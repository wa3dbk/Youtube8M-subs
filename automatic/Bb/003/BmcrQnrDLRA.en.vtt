another<00:01:20.260> way<00:01:20.740> of<00:01:20.770> also<00:01:21.759> crunching<00:01:22.509> themself

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
another way of also crunching themself

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.499 
another way of also crunching themself
as<00:01:23.470> you<00:01:24.100> know<00:01:24.250> if<00:01:24.640> you<00:01:24.910> just<00:01:24.940> have<00:01:25.270> something

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
as you know if you just have something

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.450 
as you know if you just have something
that<00:01:25.810> it's<00:01:25.960> not<00:01:26.050> really<00:01:26.380> that<00:01:26.890> great<00:01:27.160> you<00:01:27.430> know

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
that it's not really that great you know

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.040 
that it's not really that great you know
so<00:01:28.000> i<00:01:28.030> think<00:01:28.149> i<00:01:28.450> think<00:01:28.479> it's<00:01:28.750> going<00:01:28.869> to<00:01:28.960> evolve

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
so i think i think it's going to evolve

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.900 
so i think i think it's going to evolve
a<00:01:29.410> little<00:01:29.470> bit<00:01:29.830> more<00:01:30.009> I<00:01:30.250> think<00:01:30.670> they're<00:01:30.790> going

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
a little bit more I think they're going

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.990 
a little bit more I think they're going
to<00:01:30.970> look<00:01:31.119> for<00:01:31.509> a<00:01:32.050> nice<00:01:32.560> coloring<00:01:33.190> culinary

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000

experience I think this is where the
trend<00:01:37.060> is<00:01:37.210> going<00:01:38.130> keeping<00:01:39.130> that<00:01:39.160> in<00:01:39.280> mind<00:01:39.369> you

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
trend is going keeping that in mind you

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.550 
trend is going keeping that in mind you

mean we all gonna we all going through
true<00:01:58.840> challenge<00:01:59.080> obviously<00:01:59.860> there<00:02:00.040> is<00:02:00.130> a

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
true challenge obviously there is a

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.440 
true challenge obviously there is a
little<00:02:01.090> economy<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:02.770> actually<00:02:03.670> right<00:02:03.820> now<00:02:03.970> but

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
little economy is actually right now but

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.770 
little economy is actually right now but
we<00:02:04.600> need<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.350> keep<00:02:06.159> in<00:02:06.340> mind<00:02:06.580> to<00:02:07.000> not<00:02:07.180> lower

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
we need to keep in mind to not lower

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.900 
we need to keep in mind to not lower
ourselves<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.739> keep<00:02:08.920> continuing<00:02:09.489> what<00:02:09.760> we're

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
ourselves to keep continuing what we're

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.580 
ourselves to keep continuing what we're
doing<00:02:10.209> to<00:02:10.660> believe<00:02:10.929> in<00:02:11.049> why<00:02:11.170> we're<00:02:11.350> doing

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
doing to believe in why we're doing

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.979 
doing to believe in why we're doing
maybe<00:02:11.739> to<00:02:11.980> be<00:02:12.100> may<00:02:12.340> be<00:02:12.370> more<00:02:12.790> aware<00:02:13.060> what<00:02:13.360> the

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
maybe to be may be more aware what the

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.410 
maybe to be may be more aware what the
customer<00:02:14.500> want<00:02:14.769> and<00:02:14.980> maybe<00:02:15.100> get<00:02:15.700> closer<00:02:16.030> to

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
customer want and maybe get closer to

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.410 
customer want and maybe get closer to
them<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:18.100> and<00:02:18.489> evolve<00:02:19.030> from<00:02:19.180> it

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
them and and and and and evolve from it

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.199 
them and and and and and evolve from it
but<00:02:19.690> I<00:02:19.900> think<00:02:19.959> I<00:02:20.730> think<00:02:21.730> at<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:21.910> end<00:02:21.940> of<00:02:22.090> the

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
but I think I think at the end of the

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.610 
but I think I think at the end of the
day<00:02:22.330> is<00:02:22.450> going<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:22.660> be<00:02:22.750> fine<00:02:23.049> you<00:02:23.230> know<00:02:23.260> and

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
day is going to be fine you know and

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.309 
day is going to be fine you know and
especially<00:02:23.860> in<00:02:24.549> the<00:02:24.640> chameleon

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
especially in the chameleon

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.149 
especially in the chameleon
you<00:02:25.560> know<00:02:26.689> maybe<00:02:27.689> we<00:02:27.989> can<00:02:28.200> reinvent<00:02:28.859> some

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
you know maybe we can reinvent some

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.420 
you know maybe we can reinvent some
stuff<00:02:29.459> but<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:30.030> don't<00:02:30.209> think<00:02:30.359> people<00:02:30.780> need<00:02:31.079> to

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
stuff but I don't think people need to

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.699 
stuff but I don't think people need to
lose<00:02:32.430> themselves<00:02:32.870> not<00:02:33.870> do<00:02:34.079> what<00:02:34.319> they<00:02:34.469> love<00:02:34.650> to

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
lose themselves not do what they love to

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.089 
lose themselves not do what they love to
do<00:02:34.980> Ventress<00:02:36.170> it's<00:02:37.170> it's<00:02:37.379> a<00:02:37.469> hard<00:02:37.709> time<00:02:37.889> but

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
do Ventress it's it's a hard time but

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.129 
do Ventress it's it's a hard time but
you<00:02:38.249> know<00:02:38.340> what<00:02:38.519> it's<00:02:38.700> it's<00:02:39.060> usually<00:02:39.659> you<00:02:39.840> rest

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
you know what it's it's usually you rest

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.280 
you know what it's it's usually you rest
you<00:02:40.709> know<00:02:40.859> from<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.849> hard<00:02:42.150> time<00:02:42.359> and<00:02:42.659> it's<00:02:43.079> going

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
you know from a hard time and it's going

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.839 
you know from a hard time and it's going
to<00:02:43.349> become<00:02:43.469> better<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.340> better<00:02:44.579> and<00:02:44.790> better
