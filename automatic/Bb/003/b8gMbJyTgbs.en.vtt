00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.960
 Hello everyone, today I make this video 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.870
 to show you the office package that 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.660
 microsoft has launched on the app store e 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.219
 which allows us to use office 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:19.260
 excel and powerpoint on ours 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.900
 devices with ios 7 or higher 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:27.150
 applications are available at 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.640
 iphone ipad and ipod touch and allow us 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.590
 to modify ours for free 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.840
 file to be able to modify ours 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.100
 file we should obviously have a 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.190
 account 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.710
 microsoft we go to see individually 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.860
 the individual applications now use the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.379
 landscape mode to do 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.100
 better the video is seen that however on the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.199
 his iphone 6 plus is supported 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.460
 we start from world now I already have 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.309
 configured my account 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.129
 microsoft and or anyway if not yet 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.190
 you will be asked to create it or 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.110
 however if you don't want to create it you can 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.020
 use the app alone 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.630
 reading while if you will record a 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.470
 microsoft account you can also go to 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.560
 create and modify let's say file 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.170
 pre-existing or better to say gods 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.630
 pre-existing formats as you can see 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.080
 brochure for commercial news 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.860
 company we have different formats 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:33.150
 standards that allow us to create from 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.259
 a pre-defined format for a document 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.930
 word 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.470
 obviously clicking on the new button 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.890
 we can create a document from scratch 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.320
 selecting the new document 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.780
 click now i'll show you 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.720
 just a general overview though 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.240
 it is to signal you that the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.860
 three apps on the app store where you 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.840
 always mark it in the description of the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.450
 video and inside the video where 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.310
 can download them for free not 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.070
 we can go a series our text 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.550
 and make any changes 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:12.450
 in the document our files 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.090
 what we're going to do now is not 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.660
 except we can find them on ours 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.080
 microsoft one drive account so 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.040
 to be able to find them on others 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.810
 devices or even from the computer 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.990
 once we would have configured 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.250
 within an application of the 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.050
 office package 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.080
 obviously we should n't go to 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.760
 reset user name e 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.130
 password but will be saved in 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.750
 automatic and when you go to open to 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.970
 example powerpoint access to yours 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.020
 account is already configured then us 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.959
 we will have access both in reading and in 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.989
 writing buys change even on power 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.850
 point and in excel 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:04.650
 let's add it as word 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:07.200
 we will have several different standard formats 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.970
 predefined and based on our at 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.060
 our needs we could select 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.570
 one and start creating ours 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:19.350
 power point presentation 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.010
 same thing for axel we go from more to 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.150
 excel 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.850
 now in this case I have not done the 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.829
 3.7 the tutorial are a few steps and 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.870
 now as you can see you are 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.850
 activating I have already configured mine 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.890
 account and we can start creating 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.760
 edit for free as you can 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.980
 see our accounts to ours 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.989
 account our excel files come to us 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.380
 reported what we can do supports 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:51.280
 dropbox creates changes anyway 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:53.830
 things now why my world e 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.740
 power point and I had already opened these 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.920
 things will be suggested to you 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:03.130
 as soon as you install configure the 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:07.380
 your microsoft account ok 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.250
 and here too we have different formats 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.080
 predefined and based on ours 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.380
 needs we can create a sheet of 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.380
 work empty or select those 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.500
 pre-existing just to show you 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.530
 let's go for an empty file and we can 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.160
 move on the various cells and create the 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.350
 our file from scratch for all three 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.480
 applications we can save as 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.990
 gangster on word and our files on 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.610
 our account and juan drive e 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.960
 find them on all the devices in which 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:44.050
 we have installed the applications ok 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.630
 nothing was right to tell you this 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.440
 what because I imagine that for many 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:53.580
 users who work with these genres 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:57.190
 these types of documents may be 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.630
 useful information for the moment is 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.590
 all 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.590
 the next hello
