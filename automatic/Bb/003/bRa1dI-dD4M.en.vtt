00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.509
 let's solve the equation that appears in 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:08.110
 screen we notice that we have a 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.110
 quotient 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.510
 matched to a number 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.060
 to solve this equation what 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.840
 we will do is first pass the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.850
 denominator 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.100
 of the fraction that appears in the first 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.960
 member of equality to the other party 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.270
 multiplying 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.310
 with what we get 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:38.240
 on the left side would be created the 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:40.280
 numerator 2 x 1 equal to minus 5 that already 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.930
 was on the right side and now the 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.230
 denominator that happens multiplying 3x 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.230
 plus 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.260
 from here we copy the first member of the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.050
 equality 2 x 1 equal and we apply the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.090
 distributive property number 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.860
 multiplied by a sum number by the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:08.600
 first adding minus 5 x + 3 x us 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.530
 there are less 15 x 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.570
 and now minus 5 x plus two that remains 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.070
 minus 10 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.680
 and now we pass 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.280
 the Xs to a part and the numbers to the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.210
 another where we have here two x's 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.210
 we copy 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.800
 the 15 x with minus sign in front passes the 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.780
 other part with sign + + 15 x 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.140
 same 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.650
 -10 which is in this part right what 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.480
 we copied and now this 1 that was 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.800
 subtracting on the left side to sap 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:55.740
 to the other side adding 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:02:02.100
 but what we get 2 x 15 x is 17 x 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:04.680
 equal to minus 10 1 is minus 9 then 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.720
 to clear the x like this 17 is 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.170
 multiplying more to the other party 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.290
 dividing and we get that x equals 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.769
 minus 9 that was on the right side and 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:22.700
 the 17th passing dividing this would be the 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.700
 result of the equation raised
