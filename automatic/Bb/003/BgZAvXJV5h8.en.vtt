first<00:03:30.160> thing<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.520> go<00:03:30.550> so<00:03:31.480> really<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.900> burden

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
first thing to go so really the burden

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.990 
first thing to go so really the burden
falls<00:03:32.200> on<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.710> institutions<00:03:33.430> in<00:03:33.610> our<00:03:33.730> city

falls on the institutions in our city

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.750 
falls on the institutions in our city
and<00:03:34.300> we<00:03:34.870> can<00:03:35.050> do<00:03:35.200> it<00:03:35.350> very<00:03:35.590> very<00:03:35.860> well<00:03:36.160> we<00:03:36.580> have

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
and we can do it very very well we have

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.120 
and we can do it very very well we have
access<00:03:37.300> to<00:03:37.510> actual<00:03:37.960> works<00:03:38.170> of<00:03:38.320> art<00:03:38.590> we<00:03:39.010> have

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
access to actual works of art we have

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.760 
access to actual works of art we have
access<00:03:39.580> to<00:03:39.730> artists<00:03:40.360> and<00:03:40.540> we<00:03:41.050> can<00:03:41.230> do<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:41.560> in<00:03:41.680> a

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
access to artists and we can do it in a

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.560 
access to artists and we can do it in a
way<00:03:41.950> I<00:03:41.980> think<00:03:42.160> that<00:03:42.520> really<00:03:42.670> resonates<00:03:43.300> with

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
way I think that really resonates with

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.360 
way I think that really resonates with
the<00:03:43.780> children<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.620> teachers<00:03:44.650> at<00:03:45.190> least

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
the children and the teachers at least

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.230 
the children and the teachers at least
that's<00:03:45.700> what<00:03:45.880> they<00:03:46.000> tell<00:03:46.180> us<00:03:46.240> I<00:03:47.970> think<00:03:48.970> people

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
that's what they tell us I think people

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.840 
that's what they tell us I think people
are<00:03:49.330> increasingly<00:03:49.690> aware<00:03:50.110> of<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.470> fact<00:03:50.710> that

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
are increasingly aware of the fact that

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.010 
are increasingly aware of the fact that
cultivating<00:03:51.850> the<00:03:51.940> creative<00:03:52.390> mind<00:03:52.630> is<00:03:52.870> an

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
cultivating the creative mind is an

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.100 
cultivating the creative mind is an
essential<00:03:53.350> ingredient<00:03:53.560> for<00:03:54.340> creating<00:03:55.330> a<00:03:55.510> more

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
essential ingredient for creating a more

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.130 
essential ingredient for creating a more
tolerant<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:56.980> enlightened<00:03:57.580> society<00:03:58.420> and<00:03:58.690> I

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
tolerant and enlightened society and I

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.380 
tolerant and enlightened society and I
think<00:03:59.470> Jeanne<00:04:00.100> and<00:04:00.280> Tony<00:04:00.460> are<00:04:00.580> very<00:04:01.090> aware<00:04:01.240> of

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
think Jeanne and Tony are very aware of

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.690 
think Jeanne and Tony are very aware of
