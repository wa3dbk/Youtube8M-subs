00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
see this as a setback but honestly do

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.510 
see this as a setback but honestly do
this<00:00:53.850> whole<00:00:54.059> hair<00:00:54.480> journey<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.989> I've<00:00:55.520> that

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
this whole hair journey that I've that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.510 
this whole hair journey that I've that
I've<00:00:56.640> been<00:00:56.820> doing<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.360> far<00:00:57.570> for<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.020> year

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
I've been doing so far for this year

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.650 
I've been doing so far for this year
I've<00:00:59.520> noticed<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.180> really<00:01:00.390> not<00:01:00.510> about

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
I've noticed that it's really not about

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.000 
I've noticed that it's really not about
the<00:01:00.899> length<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.199> your<00:01:01.260> hair<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.590> more<00:01:01.770> about

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
the length of your hair it's more about

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.640 
the length of your hair it's more about
the<00:01:02.340> health<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.640> your<00:01:02.760> hair<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.470> this<00:01:04.470> can

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the health of your hair and this can

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.380 
the health of your hair and this can
easily<00:01:04.799> be<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.189> setback<00:01:05.430> free<00:01:05.790> because<00:01:06.090> I

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
easily be a setback free because I

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.280 
easily be a setback free because I
wanted<00:01:06.840> my<00:01:07.080> goal<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> APL<00:01:08.130> by<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:08.970> time<00:01:09.299> by

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
wanted my goal to the APL by the time by

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.190 
wanted my goal to the APL by the time by
the<00:01:10.350> end<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.619> year<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:11.840> not<00:01:12.840> really<00:01:13.049> sure

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the end of this year but not really sure

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.660 
the end of this year but not really sure
if<00:01:13.229> that's<00:01:13.439> gonna<00:01:13.590> happen<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:14.490> not

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
if that's gonna happen but it's not

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.210 
if that's gonna happen but it's not
really<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.240> don't<00:01:15.930> get<00:01:16.049> as<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> bad<00:01:16.470> thing<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.950> it

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
really I don't get as a bad thing of it

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.730
