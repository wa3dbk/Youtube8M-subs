first thing I'm going to be doing today
is<00:00:13.759> a<00:00:13.879> bit<00:00:14.059> of<00:00:14.150> welding<00:00:14.540> and<00:00:14.719> these<00:00:15.469> are<00:00:15.650> some

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
is a bit of welding and these are some

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.910 
is a bit of welding and these are some
pieces<00:00:16.100> from<00:00:16.610> the<00:00:16.790> muffler<00:00:17.660> silencer<00:00:18.470> and<00:00:18.680> I'm

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
pieces from the muffler silencer and I'm

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.010 
pieces from the muffler silencer and I'm
going<00:00:19.040> to<00:00:19.100> weld<00:00:19.280> those<00:00:19.520> up<00:00:20.210> and<00:00:20.600> clean<00:00:20.840> them<00:00:20.960> up

going to weld those up and clean them up

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.210 
going to weld those up and clean them up
a<00:00:21.110> little<00:00:21.260> bit<00:00:21.470> and<00:00:21.620> then<00:00:21.950> we're<00:00:22.070> going<00:00:22.160> to

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
a little bit and then we're going to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:54.569 
a little bit and then we're going to
move<00:00:22.430> on

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.009 

the<00:00:55.579> first<00:00:55.820> half<00:00:56.059> of<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.300> welding<00:00:56.629> is<00:00:56.750> already

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
the first half of the welding is already

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.079 
the first half of the welding is already
done<00:00:57.230> and<00:00:57.530> you<00:00:57.559> can<00:00:58.340> see<00:00:58.550> here<00:00:58.879> I've<00:00:59.030> just

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
done and you can see here I've just

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.610 
done and you can see here I've just
ground<00:00:59.510> off<00:00:59.719> and<00:00:59.960> cleaned<00:01:00.230> it<00:01:00.320> up<00:01:00.379> a<00:01:00.530> little

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
ground off and cleaned it up a little

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.560 
ground off and cleaned it up a little
bit<00:01:00.859> so<00:01:01.190> try<00:01:01.579> to<00:01:01.609> make<00:01:01.789> a<00:01:01.820> little<00:01:02.059> make<00:01:02.449> it

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
bit so try to make a little make it

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.719 
bit so try to make a little make it
looks<00:01:02.719> a<00:01:02.839> little<00:01:02.930> more<00:01:03.140> integrated<00:01:03.729> still

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
looks a little more integrated still

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.219 
looks a little more integrated still
have<00:01:04.850> to<00:01:04.970> clean<00:01:05.180> this<00:01:05.330> area<00:01:05.540> up<00:01:05.690> here<00:01:05.840> with<00:01:06.140> the

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
have to clean this area up here with the

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.680 
have to clean this area up here with the
air<00:01:06.350> tool<00:01:06.619> but<00:01:06.920> that'll<00:01:07.369> be<00:01:07.399> for<00:01:08.270> another<00:01:08.450> time

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
air tool but that'll be for another time

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.359 
air tool but that'll be for another time
and<00:01:09.880> so<00:01:10.880> that's<00:01:11.060> part<00:01:11.270> one<00:01:12.190> here's<00:01:13.190> the

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
and so that's part one here's the

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.639 
and so that's part one here's the
diffuser<00:01:13.759> I've<00:01:14.420> added<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.869> bunch<00:01:15.020> of<00:01:15.140> more

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
diffuser I've added a bunch of more

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.399 
diffuser I've added a bunch of more
holes<00:01:15.909> under<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.030> advisement<00:01:17.299> of<00:01:17.720> some<00:01:17.899> some

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
holes under the advisement of some some

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.190 
holes under the advisement of some some
people<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:19.330> I've<00:01:20.330> shortened<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:20.810> overall

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
people and I've shortened the overall

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.499 
people and I've shortened the overall
length<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:21.710> ivory<00:01:22.250> welded<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:23.000> cap<00:01:23.299> a<00:01:23.330> little

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
length and ivory welded the cap a little

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.559 
length and ivory welded the cap a little
closer<00:01:24.110> down<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:25.369> this<00:01:25.580> now<00:01:27.429> if<00:01:28.429> we<00:01:28.610> flip<00:01:29.420> that

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
closer down so this now if we flip that

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:34.719 
closer down so this now if we flip that
around<00:01:29.860> like<00:01:30.860> this<00:01:32.409> this<00:01:33.409> diffuser<00:01:33.950> has<00:01:34.429> this

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
around like this this diffuser has this

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.190 
around like this this diffuser has this
flange<00:01:35.060> which<00:01:35.630> goes<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:36.560> about<00:01:36.619> there<00:01:38.200> and

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
flange which goes to about there and

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.520 
flange which goes to about there and
then<00:01:39.679> this<00:01:39.950> flange<00:01:40.659> mounts<00:01:41.659> on<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.810> end<00:01:42.050> this

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
then this flange mounts on the end this

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.350 
then this flange mounts on the end this
is<00:01:42.710> I<00:01:42.890> wanted<00:01:43.520> to<00:01:43.610> create<00:01:43.850> now<00:01:43.970> a<00:01:44.000> flange

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
is I wanted to create now a flange

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.600 
is I wanted to create now a flange
mounting<00:01:44.899> system<00:01:45.289> for<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:46.039> expansion

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
mounting system for the expansion

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.289 
mounting system for the expansion
chamber<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.810> then<00:01:47.960> these<00:01:48.110> pieces<00:01:49.000> go<00:01:50.000> in<00:01:50.119> like

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
chamber and then these pieces go in like

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.749 
chamber and then these pieces go in like
that

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
that

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.969 
that
that's<00:01:52.759> our<00:01:52.970> it's<00:01:53.899> all<00:01:54.049> crooked<00:01:54.350> but<00:01:54.679> you<00:01:54.860> get

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
that's our it's all crooked but you get

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.929 
that's our it's all crooked but you get
the<00:01:55.069> idea<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:56.920> then<00:01:57.920> for<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.430> expansion

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
the idea and then for the expansion

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.569 
the idea and then for the expansion
chamber<00:01:59.439> I'm<00:02:00.439> going<00:02:00.649> to<00:02:00.710> add<00:02:00.829> a<00:02:00.860> flange<00:02:01.399> on

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
chamber I'm going to add a flange on

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.330 
chamber I'm going to add a flange on
here<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:02.810> then<00:02:03.140> bolt<00:02:03.439> those<00:02:03.649> up<00:02:03.860> so<00:02:03.890> that<00:02:04.250> I'll

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
here and then bolt those up so that I'll

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.850 
here and then bolt those up so that I'll
be<00:02:04.460> able<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.700> take<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:06.229> end<00:02:06.380> on<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:06.740> off

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
be able to take the the end on and off

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.779 
be able to take the the end on and off
if<00:02:07.070> I<00:02:07.189> want<00:02:07.430> or<00:02:07.909> try<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.690> different<00:02:09.429> design<00:02:10.429> if<00:02:10.670> I

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
if I want or try a different design if I

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.699 
if I want or try a different design if I
find<00:02:11.420> something<00:02:11.720> that<00:02:11.840> works<00:02:11.989> better<00:02:12.109> or<00:02:12.500> I

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
find something that works better or I

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.030 
find something that works better or I
find<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.989> if<00:02:14.989> I<00:02:15.200> want<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.440> try<00:02:15.560> putting<00:02:15.829> the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
find that if I want to try putting the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.979 
find that if I want to try putting the
Technic<00:02:16.370> gas<00:02:16.519> on<00:02:16.760> if<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.390> overall<00:02:17.600> length<00:02:17.810> is

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
Technic gas on if the overall length is

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.069 
Technic gas on if the overall length is
good<00:02:18.730> I'll<00:02:19.730> give<00:02:19.850> it<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:19.970> shot<00:02:20.000> anyway<00:02:20.750> now

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
good I'll give it a shot anyway now

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:27.880 
good I'll give it a shot anyway now
we're<00:02:21.200> going<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.380> be<00:02:21.470> welding<00:02:21.769> this<00:02:21.890> part<00:02:22.130> here

been welded in place with the new flange
this<00:02:40.160> weld<00:02:40.490> here<00:02:40.730> was<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:40.910> bit<00:02:41.120> difficult<00:02:41.600> but<00:02:42.260> I

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
this weld here was a bit difficult but I

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.100 
this weld here was a bit difficult but I
just<00:02:43.280> had<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:43.940> add<00:02:44.060> some<00:02:44.330> extra<00:02:44.540> weld<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.020> then

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
just had to add some extra weld and then

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.910 
just had to add some extra weld and then
grind<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.560> out<00:02:45.850> with<00:02:46.850> Janki<00:02:47.270> but<00:02:47.450> it's<00:02:47.570> okay

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
grind it out with Janki but it's okay

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.780 
grind it out with Janki but it's okay
and<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.220> flange<00:02:49.460> on<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.760> expansion<00:02:50.660> chamber

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
and the flange on the expansion chamber

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.670 
and the flange on the expansion chamber
that<00:02:52.790> was<00:02:52.940> also<00:02:53.300> a<00:02:53.600> bit<00:02:53.900> tricky<00:02:54.230> it's<00:02:54.350> crooked

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
that was also a bit tricky it's crooked

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.560 
that was also a bit tricky it's crooked
as<00:02:54.800> hell<00:02:54.940> so<00:02:55.940> I<00:02:55.970> might<00:02:56.180> have<00:02:56.300> to<00:02:56.390> make<00:02:56.510> some

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
as hell so I might have to make some

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.440 
as hell so I might have to make some
adjustments<00:02:57.230> later<00:02:57.380> on<00:02:57.560> down<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.770> line<00:02:58.450> once

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
adjustments later on down the line once

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.980 
adjustments later on down the line once
I<00:02:59.540> get<00:02:59.720> it

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
I get it

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.080 
I get it
the<00:03:00.320> header<00:03:00.590> on<00:03:00.800> and<00:03:01.220> everything<00:03:01.610> matched<00:03:01.790> up

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
the header on and everything matched up

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.699 
the header on and everything matched up
there<00:03:02.300> so<00:03:02.720> that's<00:03:02.840> how<00:03:02.990> it<00:03:03.080> works<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:03.410> can<00:03:03.590> take

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
there so that's how it works I can take

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.110 
there so that's how it works I can take
it<00:03:03.830> on<00:03:03.920> off<00:03:04.190> just<00:03:04.490> have<00:03:04.640> to<00:03:04.730> drill<00:03:04.910> some<00:03:05.060> holes

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
it on off just have to drill some holes

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.720 
it on off just have to drill some holes
and<00:03:05.510> pass<00:03:05.900> some<00:03:06.140> bolts<00:03:06.440> I<00:03:06.650> have<00:03:07.190> some<00:03:07.340> gasket

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
and pass some bolts I have some gasket

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.699 
and pass some bolts I have some gasket
