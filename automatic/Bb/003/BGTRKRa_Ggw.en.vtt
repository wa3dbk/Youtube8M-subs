over each nail at first it's scary

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.930

because<00:05:40.949> you<00:05:41.099> think<00:05:41.250> your<00:05:41.430> polish<00:05:41.699> is<00:05:41.789> going

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940

to<00:05:42.000> come<00:05:42.150> off<00:05:42.300> but<00:05:42.599> it<00:05:42.690> won't<00:05:42.900> this<00:05:43.740> just<00:05:44.009> gets

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
to come off but it won't this just gets

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.420 
to come off but it won't this just gets
rid<00:05:44.310> of<00:05:44.400> the<00:05:44.580> sticky<00:05:44.940> residue

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:25.970 
very easy to follow so I definitely

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.630
