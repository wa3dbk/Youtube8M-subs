00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
wanted to be around 122 but if you think

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.210 
wanted to be around 122 but if you think
about<00:03:15.320> it<00:03:15.829> if<00:03:16.220> I<00:03:16.400> was<00:03:16.549> like<00:03:16.840> 133<00:03:17.859> guess<00:03:18.859> I<00:03:19.010> lost

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
about it if I was like 133 guess I lost

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.340 
about it if I was like 133 guess I lost
how<00:03:19.640> much<00:03:19.820> was<00:03:19.970> it<00:03:20.090> like<00:03:20.209> eight<00:03:20.540> pounds<00:03:20.900> or

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
how much was it like eight pounds or

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
how much was it like eight pounds or
something<00:03:21.440> like<00:03:21.829> that

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
something like that

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.650 
something like that
still<00:03:24.760> it's<00:03:25.760> almost<00:03:25.970> tense<00:03:26.209> when<00:03:26.359> you<00:03:26.450> go<00:03:26.540> on

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
still it's almost tense when you go on

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.319 
still it's almost tense when you go on
the<00:03:26.720> die<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> little<00:03:27.049> bit<00:03:27.230> longer<00:03:28.030> I'm<00:03:29.030> tempted

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
the die a little bit longer I'm tempted

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.620 
the die a little bit longer I'm tempted
I<00:03:29.600> don't<00:03:30.380> know<00:03:30.440> but<00:03:31.340> I<00:03:31.549> guess<00:03:31.880> this<00:03:32.359> is<00:03:32.600> a

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
I don't know but I guess this is a

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.420 
I don't know but I guess this is a
moment<00:03:32.989> to<00:03:33.230> celebration<00:03:33.890> even<00:03:34.130> though<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.250> feel

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
moment to celebration even though I feel

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.479 
moment to celebration even though I feel
like<00:03:34.459> crap<00:03:34.790> but<00:03:35.630> whatever<00:03:36.290> um<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:37.040> still<00:03:37.340> lost

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
like crap but whatever um I still lost

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.420 
like crap but whatever um I still lost
weight<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:37.850> I<00:03:37.880> guess<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.060> should<00:03:38.299> be<00:03:38.390> happy<00:03:38.750> um

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.240 
weight so I guess I should be happy um
yeah<00:03:40.430> okay<00:03:40.840> I<00:03:42.069> did<00:03:43.069> it

excited because the lowest weight I

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.580 
excited because the lowest weight I
wanted<00:04:59.030> to<00:04:59.150> go<00:04:59.270> to<00:04:59.330> a<00:04:59.450> two<00:04:59.720> which<00:05:00.110> was<00:05:00.260> like<00:05:00.380> my

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
wanted to go to a two which was like my

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.190 
wanted to go to a two which was like my
really<00:05:01.190> big<00:05:01.310> goal<00:05:01.520> it's<00:05:01.700> just<00:05:01.880> 122<00:05:02.870> that<00:05:03.020> means

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
really big goal it's just 122 that means

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.400 
really big goal it's just 122 that means
I<00:05:03.380> am<00:05:03.590> really<00:05:04.070> just<00:05:04.460> one<00:05:04.970> pound<00:05:05.419> away<00:05:05.810> and<00:05:06.289> I'm

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.260 
I am really just one pound away and I'm
pretty<00:05:06.590> sure<00:05:06.710> just<00:05:07.100> exercising<00:05:07.789> after<00:05:07.910> this<00:05:08.180> I
