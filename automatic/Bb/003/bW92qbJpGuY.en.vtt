from the team against Lester Marcus Rojo

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.120 
from the team against Lester Marcus Rojo
before<00:01:12.360> he<00:01:12.479> was<00:01:12.630> okay<00:01:12.960> today<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.860> he<00:01:14.010> got

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
before he was okay today and he got

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.679 
before he was okay today and he got
stuck<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.640> he<00:01:14.760> wanted<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.180> was<00:01:15.390> up<00:01:15.509> for<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.730 
stuck in he wanted it was up for the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.410 
challenge but Phil Jones again I just
don't<00:01:19.920> think<00:01:20.130> he<00:01:20.220> allowed<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.729> defense<00:01:21.270> to

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
don't think he allowed the defense to

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.600 
don't think he allowed the defense to
settle<00:01:21.780> also<00:01:22.409> when<00:01:22.530> Luke<00:01:22.710> Shaw<00:01:22.950> came<00:01:23.220> on<00:01:23.430> I

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
the game but again you're looking for

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.880

James we also didn't have much to do and

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.140 
James we also didn't have much to do and
it's<00:02:52.799> hard<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.099> criticize<00:02:53.250> your<00:02:53.670> strikers

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
just think our passing is too slow is

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.479 
just think our passing is too slow is
too<00:03:24.079> boring<00:03:25.079> play<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:25.829> he's<00:03:25.980> too<00:03:26.160> cautious

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
too boring play and he's too cautious

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
again he needs to start for us in my

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.620 
again he needs to start for us in my
opinion<00:04:36.919> because<00:04:37.160> when<00:04:37.610> he<00:04:37.699> plays<00:04:37.910> we<00:04:38.419> play

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630
