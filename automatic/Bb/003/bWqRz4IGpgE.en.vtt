00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:23.310
 Lola, we each get four of his finance and I have a new one today 

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:24.720
 Concept presents 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.300
 you see your own Team Deathmatch on the Munich takes with the attack 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.199
 suddenly 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.609
 the greens is 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.359
 and the money is a bit older the more Rethings are awesome 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.280
 is nice to look at why I have that with you but 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.630
 who is the wind only 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.540
 for the background 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.600
 for the whole 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.510
 into the night and not commented smoke 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.700
 something else and indeed 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.840
 To Maric 7 percent today 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.480
 played at the age of 2 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.820
 and mine is 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.750
 Percent the ratio between 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.090
 Anthea and 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.050
 noticed 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.790
 completely different than in Black Ops 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.120
 and that is such a topic where I find that is not so often addressed 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.940
 has been 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.190
 That's just one of the things I wanted to do in short-time work, for example 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.060
 as an assault rifle 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.480
 the Arcor she notes the austerity measures 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.500
 no matter life 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.890
 becomes the example 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.880
 and the weapons are really strong man when say about each of them 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.000
 that they overwhelmed who over Brown is the Embach 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.090
 if it is beautiful 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.800
 two games is his league debut in Italy 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.060
 simply a standard measure of goalie can be any way which or 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.200
 do not train and play that is indeed a with Dr 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.700
 just as that was Moss can any game is it has it easy for us 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.900
 is the simplified gold with good big performance 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.680
 there is the question why are the MPS in the break in contrast to the 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.970
 Assault rifle got so bad you take my phone FIFA 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.060
 around 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.960
 I would 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.760
 she and she around 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.410
 Kaman is good with good scores, but it is 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.560
 not so easy it makes it really disadvantaged the man is in Chile 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.400
 Percent energy case and not want to show Lincoln Stephan 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.329
 light 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:12.629
 and 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.939
 yes, there are certainly people with it 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:18.749
 yes, the percent even with the Scythian score, but I felt 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.889
 Personally, it may be me now or color fonts as fancy 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.039
 learned case 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.629
 and there he is sure it also raises the question of why you do something like that 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:30.739
 and I mean with two because it is also quite different in the film 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.739
 You have mw2 as an assault rifle example 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:36.269
 Fixed ah 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.319
 to the 21st 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.889
 or 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:43.219
 Parker 7 4 TSI also has to be okay 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.159
 and there are after the impact 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.549
 you can do that too 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.539
 good Goßmann versus 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:52.899
 I'll just say that is a rare at mw2 completely hourly 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:56.229
 connects number satisfied with because you can not choose whether you prefer 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:59.299
 playing with the MP or with the assault rifle and with Black Ops one is 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.879
 actually pulled and recommended to play 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.230
 Wai m with 2 you have for example everything MP 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:08.529
 by MeeGo in four this time out 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:10.899
 for his roles and 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.139
 we have a lot as a team for example 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.000
 4 90 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.020
 for 90 St with the 90 hp really accurate when you use it 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.729
 Can play where you can travel a good scores 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:24.149
 what amy still with the MP case you can also good post office Reißner man 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:25.379
 Herrmann only with 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.249
 as in the games so I can find 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:29.669
 and he plays the bunch 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.809
 That was easy too 

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:36.449
 I think this technique is better in the 2 it may be the 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.399
 tippspiel-newsletter 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:40.069
 it has already been noticed 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.639
 and percent 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.829
 because Stefan is also why she threatens in Black Ops for the next question 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.239
 to be honest with shit you can not do it again with the brood 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.629
 games 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.119
 si perfect live com and cell forum 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:53.530
 Percent are always dogged 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.190
 Knows that it was damn hard to find a way to communicate with Scott Price and he 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.420
 also had live as it is 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.430
 So it's not good for me to be able to do that at 7 o'clock 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.359
 Approach 2 the 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.909
 So it's good that it's about Hans Amberger 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:11.809
 mw2 is not that hard because it depends on the behavior of the 67 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:15.469
 yes that's just my question to you 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:16.819
 as we 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:18.889
 the relationship finds 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.969
 WMB 2 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:23.249
 m in contrast to Black Ops so if you 

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:26.539
 the relationship was the great bearer of sweat 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:27.729
 or 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.139
 Obliers with two successful cases of such just a short short time 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.139
 concretely hear your opinion 

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:39.729
 and can I confirm my opinion or just not and maybe one 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.729
 see some other views of you 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:47.139
 As I said I'm just a bit strange no 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.090
 I came he was with two I can quite easily recommend artificer I 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.840
 swallow 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.979
 show nice 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.219
 Areva Forest 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:56.629
 around 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:57.800
 and because 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.219
 Black Ops taz not at all 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:03.219
 besides, we realized that we have such a thing 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.090
 Of course I just want to go 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.020
 we want to change that 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.910
 and 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.570
 yes, but otherwise it was again because here it is still a bit 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:19.509
 I got my Blackmagic today Birthdays Stephan horny part 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.280
 Although really fun but is also able to record live injured 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.330
 a lot of players at the summit could not meet, among others, mw2 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.349
 and especially happy for the Schüco 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:35.039
 I want to spend more or more with 2 live comments 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.819
 aa something completely different 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:40.259
 as a change to the CIO de 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.110
 I could already look forward to that 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.110
 Special guests 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.789
 and otherwise 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.030
 is it really out? 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.560
 he said research 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.960
 cut in for Martin Epple 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.850
 and 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.900
 Lagarde would then say goodbye 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.099
 a i hope you liked it i hope the topic 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:07.169
 but I adorned a bit 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.009
 yes I hope I go up with the thumb and I hope and I hope 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:11.869
 I hope 

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:14.180
 I was saying goodbye 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.139
 he skin pure people on the finance
