00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:08.690
 And here 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:14.810
 It is a new model of Tokyo monorail that carries the users of Haneda Airport 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:18.710
 It was introduced according to 50 years after opening in the year of Tokyo Olympics 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:26.740
 And the Tokyo Olympics will be held again six years later 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:26.740
 Access to Haneda is about to change significantly, with a move to consider new routes 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:39.640
 It is a new model 10000 of the Tokyo monorail 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.640
 Blue and green lines on the car body in the sky and the sea 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:51.910
 In the car, conscious of the visitor from foreign countries Mt. 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.910
 The image of the five-story pagoda etc. is designed 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.170
 I do not like it 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.170
 If you come here outside, you can use it for car reasons at first 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.840
 Tokyo monorail carrying passengers from Haneda Airport 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.670
 The opening of the store was ahead of the Tokyo Olympics 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.670
 It was September, 1982 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.820
 There are many people who first came to Haneda and saw the view of Tokyo from the monorail window for the first time 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:32.890
 The use of monorails also grew as the number of passengers at Haneda Airport increased . 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:39.390
 ec way 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.390
 The number of passengers since its opening reached 1 billion in 1997 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.299
 We receive a turning point in 1998 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.810
 Keihin Express trains from Shinagawa to Haneda 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.810
 A fierce competition has begun 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.260
 Monorail speeds up 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:07.690
 The fastest time from Hamamatsucho is 19 minutes 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:07.690
 The number of customers last year was reduced by approximately 30% compared to the peak in 1997. 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:20.060
 And the Tokyo Olympics will be held again six years later 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.060
 There is a move to consider new routes as an increase in customers of Haneda is expected 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:32.430
 One of the new routes jr East is considering 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:37.190
 From Tokyo to Haneda in a plan to utilize the cargo line suspended from around Yamanote Line Tamachi 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.190
 It is about 15 minutes shorter than now 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:46.689
 In addition, we connect Keikyu Kamata of Keihin Electric Express Co., Ltd. and grade 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.640
 Shibuya and maintain the popular line 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.640
 There is also a concept connecting with Meguro 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:01.900
 I think that there is a Tokyo monorail that is expected to increase rival 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:03.990
 New vehicles introduced introduce stoppages in 4 languages and make it easy for overseas people to use 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.990
 The 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.090
 Tokyo Olympics venue 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:17.300
 And because we will become the rail is also a well important access 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.300
 It is not only going to do enough to do that it is their 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:25.890
 Access to Haneda Airport which is likely to change significantly in the future 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.890
 Airport users meet 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.280
 I think it is good 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.280
 I think it 's pretty good to have a choice of options
