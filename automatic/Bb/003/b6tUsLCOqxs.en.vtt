00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.960
 or vanilla sugar 1 a pinch of salt 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.189
 a mixing bowl a hand mixer a 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:27.720
 balance a cube still a stirred 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:41.100
 device and a banner and a panel is 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:43.350
 she 's doing that 175 then comes that 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.710
 add sugar to either family sugar 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:59.969

 protein and give her in the mixing bowl 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.760
 because you want another conclusion from it 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.760
 hit her snow 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:26.940
 Now hit with the hand mixer the 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:26.940
 the protein too bad but the little ones 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.930
 if the snow is really nice 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.140
 has become one of them 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.369
 see the mixing bowl mm and give 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.369
 stir the lights 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.060
 if the dough is well mixed and small 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:07.830
 no lumps are more in it helps her 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:09.720
 the eischnee and under each one he means 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.070
 will not mull him right again 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.930
 should still be a bit scary but 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.490
 everything together with each other 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:25.200
 mixed now you heat a pan 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.430
 and give some fat pancakes you can 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.720
 her in a coated pan too 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.200
 advise without work 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:35.190
 but with a bit of butter it tastes good 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.190
 better called 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:47.430
 Give her the pancake batter roughly 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:52.580
 one third of the day and stood 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:55.680
 temperature some of candles 6 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.739
 There is about two to three minutes to go 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.420
 you can send the pancake after 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.680
 two to three minutes you can 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.959
 Watch carefully if the 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.019
 frankfurter solves well then he is up so 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:10.440
 to turn far 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.370
 so he should look a bit golden yellow though 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.810
 already dreamed 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.970

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.970

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.170
