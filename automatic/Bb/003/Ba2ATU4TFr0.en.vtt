00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.420
 semaphore for example red 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.280
 juliÃ¡n which was the best memory of the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.030

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.030
 when he finds me on the street 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:12.690
 today the dream of the people returns you is 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.660
 what makes the program have 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.640
 meaning because if I told you anything 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.800
 and it's like it makes you from another day in 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.360
 times with all lives to see each 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.819
 I remember that people bring you to mind 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.290
 it's like it makes you know what he did 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.170
 things well or that at least someone 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.700
 liked it was expected the betis is strong 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.709
 when on the street they tell you why it is 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.150
 like that is what they tell me the most 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.150
 thanks for being a healthy television 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.860

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.880

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.620

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.800
 opportunity we are going to occupy my position that 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.000
 It's not about taking the camera on your shoulder, 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.000
 I started several cars 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:40.780

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.780
