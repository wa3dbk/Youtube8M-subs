right away you can see we're adding some
height<00:01:31.729> I<00:01:34.030> thought<00:01:35.030> all<00:01:35.210> we<00:01:35.359> will<00:01:35.539> put<00:01:35.569> some<00:01:36.469> of

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
height I thought all we will put some of

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.200 
height I thought all we will put some of
the<00:01:36.740> front<00:01:37.100> right<00:01:37.549> here<00:01:39.969> now<00:01:40.969> I'm<00:01:41.030> just

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
the front right here now I'm just

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.980 
the front right here now I'm just
tucking<00:01:41.450> them<00:01:41.810> in

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.340 

I<00:01:45.310> know<00:01:46.310> they<00:01:46.549> can<00:01:46.729> stay<00:01:47.000> in<00:01:47.150> place<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:47.960> I<00:01:48.170> will

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
I know they can stay in place and I will

00:01:48.350 --> 00:02:05.020 
I know they can stay in place and I will
add<00:01:48.560> some<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.270> end<00:01:50.510> I<00:02:03.460> like<00:02:04.460> going<00:02:04.850> with

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
add some to the end I like going with

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.300 
add some to the end I like going with
different<00:02:05.420> sized<00:02:06.080> elements<00:02:06.890> of<00:02:06.979> different

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
different sized elements of different

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.400 
different sized elements of different
shaped<00:02:07.610> elements<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:08.360> think<00:02:08.390> that<00:02:08.780> really<00:02:09.050> adds

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
shaped elements I think that really adds

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.040 
shaped elements I think that really adds
to<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.950> treatment<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:10.880> I<00:02:11.300> have<00:02:11.510> these<00:02:11.660> long

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
to the treatment and I have these long

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.140 
to the treatment and I have these long
and<00:02:12.530> still<00:02:12.950> be<00:02:13.690> branches<00:02:15.310> which<00:02:16.310> I<00:02:16.459> once<00:02:16.819> again

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
and still be branches which I once again

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:51.390 
and still be branches which I once again
will<00:02:17.720> tuck<00:02:17.959> in<00:02:27.610> one<00:02:28.610> on<00:02:28.790> each<00:02:28.910> side

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.840 

finally<00:02:52.400> I<00:02:52.670> have<00:02:53.360> some<00:02:54.490> pointy<00:02:55.490> twin<00:02:55.940> said<00:02:56.210> yes

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
and copper I have poor of them and I

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:09.730 
and copper I have poor of them and I
will<00:03:02.300> add<00:03:02.510> sound<00:03:03.350> to<00:03:03.710> the<00:03:04.490> front<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:08.470> thumb<00:03:09.470> to

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
will add sound to the front and thumb to

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:26.360 
will add sound to the front and thumb to
the<00:03:09.770> side

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.709 

you<00:03:27.370> can<00:03:27.640> use<00:03:27.790> anything<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:28.239> you<00:03:28.420> have

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:28.719 
you can use anything that you have

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:31.440 
you can use anything that you have
around<00:03:28.799> it<00:03:29.799> doesn't<00:03:30.099> take<00:03:30.249> too<00:03:30.400> many<00:03:30.609> elements

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
around it doesn't take too many elements

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.170 
around it doesn't take too many elements
it's<00:03:31.959> just<00:03:32.230> how<00:03:32.379> to<00:03:32.439> be<00:03:32.680> creative<00:03:33.310> using<00:03:34.030> the

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
it's just how to be creative using the

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.140 
it's just how to be creative using the
elements<00:03:34.569> that<00:03:34.689> you<00:03:34.870> have<00:03:35.249> and<00:03:36.249> I<00:03:36.819> think<00:03:36.849> it's

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
elements that you have and I think it's

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.119 
elements that you have and I think it's
always<00:03:37.269> really<00:03:37.599> important<00:03:38.200> to<00:03:38.290> coordinate

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
always really important to coordinate

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.929 
always really important to coordinate
the<00:03:39.969> decor<00:03:40.329> that<00:03:40.450> you<00:03:40.510> have<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.769> finally<00:03:42.700> I
