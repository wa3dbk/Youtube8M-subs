that<00:01:17.740> coming<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:18.979> college<00:01:19.220> is<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.550> big

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
that coming to college is a big

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.450 
that coming to college is a big
difference<00:01:20.479> in<00:01:20.960> going<00:01:21.290> to<00:01:21.470> an<00:01:21.619> actual<00:01:21.830> library

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
difference in going to an actual library

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.400 
difference in going to an actual library
and<00:01:22.670> picking<00:01:23.000> up<00:01:23.119> a<00:01:23.270> book<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:23.660> actually

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
and picking up a book and actually

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.469 
and picking up a book and actually
coming<00:01:24.680> now<00:01:24.979> to<00:01:25.010> college<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:25.880> all<00:01:26.000> sudden<00:01:26.420> you

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
coming now to college and all sudden you

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.320 
coming now to college and all sudden you
have<00:01:26.690> to<00:01:26.930> pay<00:01:27.229> for<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.130> book<00:01:28.580> that<00:01:28.880> all<00:01:29.000> said

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
have to pay for a book that all said

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.410 
have to pay for a book that all said
cost<00:01:29.660> you<00:01:29.810> 100<00:01:30.320> or<00:01:30.470> 500<00:01:30.710> dollars<00:01:31.400> it's<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.240> big

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
cost you 100 or 500 dollars it's a big

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.260 
cost you 100 or 500 dollars it's a big
expense<00:01:32.600> for<00:01:33.110> students<00:01:33.619> so<00:01:33.860> I<00:01:34.130> think<00:01:34.430> it's

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
expense for students so I think it's

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.700 
expense for students so I think it's
important<00:01:35.869> that<00:01:35.990> they<00:01:36.140> know<00:01:36.170> that<00:01:36.350> they<00:01:36.680> can

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
important that they know that they can

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.370 
important that they know that they can
get<00:01:37.310> used<00:01:37.580> books<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.300> they<00:01:38.810> really<00:01:39.080> need<00:01:39.259> to

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
get used books and they really need to

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.840 
get used books and they really need to
come<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:39.679> class<00:01:39.800> prepared<00:01:39.920> with<00:01:40.550> all<00:01:40.700> their

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
come to class prepared with all their

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:52.310 
come to class prepared with all their
materials

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.180 

in<00:01:53.730> my<00:01:54.730> 18<00:01:55.180> years<00:01:55.390> of<00:01:55.630> teaching<00:01:55.870> I<00:01:56.320> think<00:01:56.890> I've

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
in my 18 years of teaching I think I've

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.160 
in my 18 years of teaching I think I've
seen<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.820> lot<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:58.090> trends<00:01:58.420> and<00:01:58.870> a<00:01:58.960> lot<00:01:59.140> of

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
seen a lot of trends and a lot of

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.470 
seen a lot of trends and a lot of
fashions<00:01:59.770> some<00:02:00.580> of<00:02:00.760> them<00:02:00.850> repeat<00:02:01.270> themselves

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
fashions some of them repeat themselves

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.950 
fashions some of them repeat themselves
over<00:02:02.080> and<00:02:02.260> over<00:02:02.380> but<00:02:03.190> I<00:02:03.250> think<00:02:03.580> some<00:02:04.570> clicks

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
over and over but I think some clicks

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.040 
over and over but I think some clicks
may<00:02:05.830> think<00:02:06.160> that<00:02:06.370> the<00:02:06.790> way<00:02:06.910> they<00:02:07.090> look<00:02:07.120> the<00:02:07.930> way

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
may think that the way they look the way

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.080 
may think that the way they look the way
they<00:02:08.080> do<00:02:08.350> their<00:02:08.530> hair<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:09.280> cars<00:02:09.580> they<00:02:09.820> drive

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
they do their hair the cars they drive

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.430 
they do their hair the cars they drive
and<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:12.190> know<00:02:12.340> is<00:02:13.060> very<00:02:13.900> important<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:15.390> I

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
and you know is very important and I

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.740 
and you know is very important and I
definitely<00:02:17.440> see<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.890> big<00:02:18.340> trend<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.600> know

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
definitely see a big trend and you know

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.080 
definitely see a big trend and you know
you<00:02:19.810> have<00:02:20.050> your<00:02:20.080> different<00:02:20.530> portunities<00:02:21.280> and

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
you have your different portunities and

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.390 
you have your different portunities and
they<00:02:22.240> may<00:02:22.420> want<00:02:22.630> you<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:23.080> look<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:24.040> certain<00:02:24.220> way

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
they may want you to look a certain way

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.860 
they may want you to look a certain way
act<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.450> certain<00:02:25.630> way<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.459> then<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:27.580> have<00:02:27.870> some

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
act a certain way and then you have some

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.560 
act a certain way and then you have some
that<00:02:29.260> don't<00:02:29.830> think<00:02:30.160> that<00:02:30.459> keeping<00:02:31.120> up<00:02:31.420> with

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
that don't think that keeping up with

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.720 
that don't think that keeping up with
their<00:02:31.750> appearance<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:32.290> that<00:02:32.440> as<00:02:32.620> in<00:02:32.650> force<00:02:33.220> and

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
their appearance is that as in force and

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.570 
their appearance is that as in force and
I<00:02:34.060> think<00:02:34.300> it<00:02:34.390> depends<00:02:34.750> on<00:02:35.140> what<00:02:35.620> your<00:02:35.770> you

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
I think it depends on what your you

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.090 
I think it depends on what your you
believe<00:02:36.940> you're<00:02:37.150> here<00:02:37.330> for<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:37.950> what<00:02:38.950> you're

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
believe you're here for and what you're

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.740 
believe you're here for and what you're
going<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.430> feel<00:02:39.820> that<00:02:40.030> you<00:02:40.150> can<00:02:40.360> get<00:02:40.480> out<00:02:40.630> of

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
got to pay off the debt but that's very

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.030

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.200 
maybe they stopped off and trying to
make<00:04:54.100> it<00:04:54.310> through<00:04:54.610> and<00:04:54.910> they're<00:04:55.060> not

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
make it through and they're not

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.629 
make it through and they're not
graduating<00:04:55.900> this<00:04:56.020> year<00:04:56.080> I<00:04:56.560> think<00:04:57.430> that's

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
graduating this year I think that's

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.719 
graduating this year I think that's
probably<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.360> hardest<00:04:58.780> thing<00:04:59.550> but<00:05:00.550> for

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
probably the hardest thing but for

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.020 
probably the hardest thing but for
myself<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.660> memories<00:05:02.110> of<00:05:02.350> college<00:05:02.590> and<00:05:03.400> the

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
myself the memories of college and the

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
myself the memories of college and the
years<00:05:04.270> and<00:05:04.539> the<00:05:04.600> friends<00:05:04.930> I<00:05:05.139> made

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
years and the friends I made

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.050 
years and the friends I made
it's<00:05:06.500> all<00:05:06.680> numbers<00:05:06.949> a<00:05:07.360> great<00:05:08.360> experience
