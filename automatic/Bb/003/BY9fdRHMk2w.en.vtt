00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.729
 an evil to find the vine at the knees 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.729
 to the islands or blurred 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.409

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.530
 I'm not sure how he goes months the baby 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:48.380
 on the other hand, or how long it will 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:48.380
 stay like that what gives 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:06:00.360
 I still can not eat them Moses 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:04.320
 carrots cooking and retains bag of bones 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.150
 dollar and sandwich 3 dollars that's 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.620
 very good but we will make a friend 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.620
 because I'm tired of cooking and 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.820
 here 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.680
 at least massive no longer poses the baby 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.020
 on the ground as soon as it has to 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.939
 something since the child stick to 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.870
 cradle 

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:31.509
 I think it's not worse and 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:36.770
 I really like having the option 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:37.999
 directly changed age for those who 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.039
 I 'm not interested in having a child 

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:45.169
 who does not do anything except 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:47.150
 claim to eat so I had my 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:51.009
 first child who stays well sticking a 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:53.569
 cradle until actually grow 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:54.590
