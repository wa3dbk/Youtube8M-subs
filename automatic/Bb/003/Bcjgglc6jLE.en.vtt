00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.170
 and what roll did you give me today? 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.369
 I bring a nice one to make way for a 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.270
 subscriber by twitter 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.070

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.930
 instruction 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.930
 if I find it from data tweets but 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.150
 I think so and if I have to remember 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.310
 since I gave him a favorite and download the map 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.870
 directly and I pass the report to fire 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.610
 which is low in the description because 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.220
 I also have to look for it and good of 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.930
 what the map is about as it says there explained 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.780
 and well, it's the spirit and it's 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.730
 I have no one to play with unfortunately 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:50.120
 It's 15 degrees 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.010
 but good if you want to know the people that 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.450

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.160
 They will know more or less what the 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.530
 this is the elevator that brings very 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.690
 very comfortable very father the truth and good 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.880

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.190
 drum of a process let's see 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.210

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.580
 no more time where I want to teach 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.990

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.299

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.380
 and there comes the name that has just 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.990
 dictate is a bit strange 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.479
 to pronounce 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.950

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.940

 sean splif games is a game you have me 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.900
 to finish so that other people will 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.700
 fall and the one that remains until the end 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.920
 Just above, the others win. 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.210
 die and well every team are 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.450
 different colors where I say they are 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.180
 four here was for the elevator 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.220
 each color you choose in this case 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.600
 I came to the red and well I am already the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.020
 red team so we continue to go to 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.020
 how many people 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.650
 of many since it is something small such 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.209
 time about 8 people as much and enters 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.530
 each of the team does not ask two 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.900
 people per team we take our 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.150
 things we give a shovel that is the main 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.700
 from this we take the armor to be 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.170
 well-equipped and once we're in 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.170
 this roll because we put everything 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.960
 show them and once they enter here the 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.610
 other people grab their things too 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.970
 and they start digging 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.520
 and finish and finish but it exists here is 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.200
 that you trolling in people and 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.850
 that you make the others 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.350
 you do not fall simply because there are 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.900
 a person and I am going to finish so that 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.580
 he falls and you have each rival 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.410
 that stays above more time is the 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.690
 computer explained so that never in 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.750

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.330

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:17.290
 see the end is disastrous the one that falls 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.340
 First, this will happen to you and then 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.780
 nothing is a very cool map in terms of 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.250
 multiplayer but always tell them that 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.290
 I record my brother is not there but he's going to 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.940

 maps that do this I liked quite 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.180

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.800
 epic and smapa as it goes straight to 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.450
