00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.300
 adults the application was created by 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.410
 outfits eb in a British company 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.670
 founded by zÃ¡molo ying in the year 2010 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.449
 same year that an application was launched 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.120
 talking tom cat with so much success in so 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.969
 Only 19 months already had 300

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.780
 the success of talking tom cat was 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.270
 would add tolkien angel to tolkien ginger and 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.630
 talking bin among more than 10 other 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.640
 Outfit applications looks nevertheless 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.370
 Soon they began to grow 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.680
 rumors about the origin of said cat and 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.510
 I relapsed into serious suspicions especially 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.270
 about talking angels 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.190
 apparently behind the application it 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.020
 moved a pedophile network that 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.660
 they watched the children through the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.850
 front camera of various phones 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.950
 Articles and videos emerged about it 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.140
 to the point that hysteria broke out 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.900
 collective and several people came to 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.450
 report the disappearance of children or the 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.510
 suspicious collection of data such as 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.730
 age or domicile of infants without 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.340
 However, after the investigation 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.230
 determined that a website was the cause of 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.990
 all the mess and he had published 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.810
 an article according to the owners of the 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.880
 web with a tinge of mischief 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.620
 the issue is that this publication was 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.050
 Replicating to the point that he managed 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.930
 paralyzed and became known in 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.490
 massive form 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.329
 they also made many script and 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.549
 pasta 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.829
 that is, fictional stories where 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.800
 they tell macabre stories but in 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.290
 reality it was all about a scam and neither 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.180
 in the eyes of tommy de angela could 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.459
 see the face of the person who would 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.160
 after the application as they maintained the 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.410
 sensationalist versions in the 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.930
 what started as talking 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.360

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.069

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:35.260
