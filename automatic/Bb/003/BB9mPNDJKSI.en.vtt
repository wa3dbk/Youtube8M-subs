00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.050 
mp3s you'd expect it's got bluetooth you
can<00:01:42.840> actually<00:01:43.020> use<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.590> as<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:44.060> Bluetooth

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
can actually use this as a Bluetooth

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.670 
can actually use this as a Bluetooth
webcam<00:01:45.810> which<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.200> actually<00:01:46.320> quite<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.619> good

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
webcam which is actually quite a good

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.200 
webcam which is actually quite a good
feature<00:01:47.100> which<00:01:47.460> haven't<00:01:47.670> really<00:01:47.850> seen<00:01:48.000> on

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
feature which haven't really seen on

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.080 
feature which haven't really seen on
things<00:01:48.829> not<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:49.979> i<00:01:50.070> really<00:01:50.369> would<00:01:50.729> ever<00:01:51.000> use

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
things not that i really would ever use

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.120 
things not that i really would ever use
it<00:01:51.210> as<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.479> bluetooth<00:01:51.840> webcam<00:01:52.290> but<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:52.920> there

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
it as a bluetooth webcam but it's there

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.850 
it as a bluetooth webcam but it's there
if<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.280> want<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.520> use<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.640> um<00:01:53.939> it's<00:01:54.899> got<00:01:55.320> no

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
if you want to use it um it's got no

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.149 
if you want to use it um it's got no
Wi-Fi<00:01:56.700> no<00:01:57.030> 3g<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.960> therefore<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.649> does

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
Wi-Fi no 3g and therefore it does

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.429 
Wi-Fi no 3g and therefore it does
separate<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.939> from<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.180> LG<00:02:00.570> renoir<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.290> came

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
separate it from the LG renoir that came

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.460 
separate it from the LG renoir that came
out<00:02:01.590> at<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.740> same<00:02:01.950> time<00:02:02.189> which<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.939> cover

top of the range type model so obviously

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.950 
top of the range type model so obviously
this<00:02:09.979> one<00:02:10.220> isn't<00:02:10.520> quite<00:02:10.550> so<00:02:10.820> up<00:02:11.480> there<00:02:11.750> and

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
this one isn't quite so up there and

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.660 
this one isn't quite so up there and
hence<00:02:12.290> probably<00:02:12.950> why<00:02:13.040> doesn't<00:02:13.280> have<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.400> proper

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.050

is<00:02:17.960> it's<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.350> fairly<00:02:18.620> affordable<00:02:19.070> 8<00:02:19.520> megapixel

something a bit tighter about it it just

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.509 
something a bit tighter about it it just
works<00:03:12.110> better<00:03:14.200> what<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:15.380> were<00:03:15.620> actually<00:03:16.070> one

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
thing I do want to show you how to get

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.910 
thing I do want to show you how to get
up<00:03:17.480> nice<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:17.660> closely<00:03:17.959> quite<00:03:18.230> good<00:03:18.410> example

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
up nice and closely quite good example

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.580 
up nice and closely quite good example
of<00:03:19.160> how<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:20.239> aim<00:03:20.480> of<00:03:20.510> how<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:20.989> affected<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.530> 8

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
of how the aim of how it affected the 8

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.130 
of how the aim of how it affected the 8
megapixel<00:03:21.850> vanishing<00:03:22.850> that<00:03:23.000> second<00:03:23.450> so<00:03:23.959> it

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
megapixel vanishing that second so it

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.479 
megapixel vanishing that second so it
makes<00:03:24.230> a<00:03:24.320> little<00:03:24.380> noise<00:03:24.500> is<00:03:24.830> when<00:03:24.980> it<00:03:25.070> turns<00:03:25.310> on

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
makes a little noise is when it turns on

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.940 
makes a little noise is when it turns on
like<00:03:25.700> that<00:03:25.850> and<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.420> does<00:03:26.690> look<00:03:26.870> a<00:03:26.959> bit<00:03:26.989> I<00:03:27.380> mean

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
like that and it does look a bit I mean

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.620 
like that and it does look a bit I mean
I'm<00:03:28.160> not<00:03:28.280> really<00:03:28.459> sure<00:03:28.580> who<00:03:28.940> this<00:03:29.060> is<00:03:29.209> for<00:03:29.450> with

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
I'm not really sure who this is for with

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.840 
I'm not really sure who this is for with
its<00:03:29.780> colored<00:03:30.140> numbers<00:03:30.530> like<00:03:30.739> that<00:03:30.769> but<00:03:31.610> um

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
its colored numbers like that but um

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.110 
its colored numbers like that but um
what<00:03:32.209> I<00:03:32.269> would<00:03:32.480> like<00:03:32.600> to<00:03:32.660> show<00:03:32.810> you<00:03:32.989> is<00:03:34.120> how

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
what I would like to show you is how

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.880 
what I would like to show you is how

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
effective the 8 megapixel camera phone

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:48.950

is<00:03:40.570> now<00:03:41.570> if<00:03:41.810> you<00:03:41.989> look<00:03:42.170> at<00:03:42.620> an<00:03:42.890> image

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.240 

I<00:03:49.020> took<00:03:50.240> Zara<00:03:51.240> then<00:03:51.630> notice<00:03:52.590> she's<00:03:52.800> caught

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
I took Zara then notice she's caught

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.850 
I took Zara then notice she's caught
slightly<00:03:53.700> between<00:03:53.910> expressions<00:03:54.780> now<00:03:55.650> if<00:03:55.830> we

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
slightly between expressions now if we

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:05.330 
slightly between expressions now if we
zoom<00:03:56.520> in<00:04:02.660> herein<00:04:03.660> lies<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.840> sluggishness<00:04:04.340> if

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
zoom in herein lies the sluggishness if

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.280 
zoom in herein lies the sluggishness if

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
from a photo taken back there what I

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.180 
from a photo taken back there what I
will<00:04:45.480> say<00:04:45.510> about<00:04:45.900> this<00:04:46.080> is<00:04:46.410> that<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:47.160> other

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
will say about this is that the other

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.640 
will say about this is that the other
things<00:04:47.580> it's<00:04:47.850> expandable<00:04:48.480> up<00:04:48.780> to<00:04:48.810> 8<00:04:49.170> gigabytes

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
things it's expandable up to 8 gigabytes

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.370 
things it's expandable up to 8 gigabytes
8<00:04:50.330> gigabytes<00:04:51.330> of<00:04:51.450> memory<00:04:51.600> will<00:04:51.990> make<00:04:52.140> likes

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
8 gigabytes of memory will make likes

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.010 
8 gigabytes of memory will make likes
gigabytes<00:04:52.860> of<00:04:52.950> memory<00:04:53.300> so<00:04:54.300> they<00:04:54.450> say<00:04:54.480> but<00:04:54.720> I've

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
gigabytes of memory so they say but I've

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.780 
gigabytes of memory so they say but I've
actually<00:04:55.050> got<00:04:55.470> a<00:04:55.500> 16<00:04:55.950> gig<00:04:56.190> card<00:04:56.400> here<00:04:56.670> it's

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
actually got a 16 gig card here it's

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.340 
actually got a 16 gig card here it's
working<00:04:57.060> very<00:04:57.210> nicely<00:04:57.270> so<00:04:57.810> don't<00:04:58.140> worry<00:04:58.260> about

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
working very nicely so don't worry about

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.720 
working very nicely so don't worry about
that<00:04:58.620> you<00:04:58.740> can't<00:04:58.980> tell<00:04:59.130> you<00:04:59.190> about<00:04:59.310> ain't<00:04:59.580> no
