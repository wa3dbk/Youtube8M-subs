00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.370
 Sir 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.810
 I am here and not to force 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.689
 but because I love you 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.980
 I want to be by your side during this time 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.980
 pre-booking 2nd 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.690
 you said that only one thing was 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.529
 necessary in life 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:35.940
 and you tried it with your example 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:41.870
 I want to be a man of prayer like you 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.870
 being with you is oxygen for my soul 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:48.150
 receive allows me to stay a while to your 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.910
 side 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:55.420
 Like Joanna lying on your chest 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.890
 like the Samaritan woman 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.800
 thirsty by the well 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.600
 as Mary 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.600
 sitting at your feet in silence 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.550
 I want to comfort you, sir 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.120
 and repair for my sins and those of 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.550
 mythology 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.810
 I want to fill up with you and then give 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.810
 testimony of everything 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.750
 I'm here to listen to you 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.270
 tell me what do you want from me 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.190
 and give me the strength to always do your 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.030
 Will 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.480
 I want to fulfill my mission and then get there 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.050
 to heaven 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.050
 and rest forever in your arms 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.050
 paternal 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.370
 Sir 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.060
 come with me on my way 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.060
