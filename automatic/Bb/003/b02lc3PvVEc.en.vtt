putting your heads together and going
you<00:04:55.320> know<00:04:55.440> what<00:04:55.650> we<00:04:56.100> need<00:04:56.280> to<00:04:56.400> do<00:04:56.550> this<00:04:56.790> this

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
you know what we need to do this this

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.060 
you know what we need to do this this
and<00:04:57.090> this<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:57.600> by<00:04:57.960> doing<00:04:58.020> that<00:04:58.470> you<00:04:58.710> find<00:04:58.950> that

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
and this and by doing that you find that

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.950 
and this and by doing that you find that
you<00:04:59.250> get<00:04:59.430> on<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.700> same<00:04:59.910> page<00:04:59.970> as<00:05:00.450> your<00:05:00.600> partner

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
you get on the same page as your partner

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.080 
you get on the same page as your partner
it's<00:05:01.440> like<00:05:01.590> if<00:05:01.830> you<00:05:01.920> get<00:05:02.130> a<00:05:02.160> new<00:05:02.250> goal<00:05:02.700> a<00:05:02.730> new

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
it's like if you get a new goal a new

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.550 
it's like if you get a new goal a new
structure<00:05:03.480> a<00:05:03.660> new<00:05:03.960> government<00:05:04.320> you<00:05:04.530> know

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
structure a new government you know

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.800 
structure a new government you know
ambition<00:05:05.310> going<00:05:05.610> here<00:05:05.820> and<00:05:06.000> this<00:05:06.360> helps<00:05:06.720> a

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
ambition going here and this helps a

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.480 
ambition going here and this helps a
relationship<00:05:07.560> to<00:05:07.710> grow<00:05:07.830> in<00:05:08.040> a<00:05:08.100> more<00:05:08.280> positive

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
relationship to grow in a more positive

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.880 
relationship to grow in a more positive
light<00:05:08.850> for<00:05:09.600> us<00:05:09.810> others<00:05:10.200> it<00:05:10.380> could<00:05:10.560> be<00:05:10.740> that

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
light for us others it could be that

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.590 
light for us others it could be that
just<00:05:11.130> about<00:05:11.340> time<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.670> make<00:05:11.940> these<00:05:12.150> decisions

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
just about time to make these decisions

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.900 
just about time to make these decisions
so<00:05:13.320> that<00:05:13.350> you<00:05:13.620> can<00:05:13.830> kind<00:05:14.070> of<00:05:14.160> move<00:05:14.370> forward

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
so that you can kind of move forward

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.700 
so that you can kind of move forward
from<00:05:15.330> circumstances<00:05:16.290> that<00:05:16.440> have<00:05:16.470> been

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
from circumstances that have been

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.350 
from circumstances that have been
holding<00:05:16.920> you<00:05:17.190> back<00:05:17.430> until<00:05:17.820> about<00:05:18.090> this<00:05:18.300> time

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
holding you back until about this time

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.710 
holding you back until about this time
now<00:05:19.260> as<00:05:19.530> this<00:05:20.040> is<00:05:20.250> a<00:05:20.280> month<00:05:20.670> of<00:05:20.820> choices<00:05:21.300> that

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
now as this is a month of choices that

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.630 
now as this is a month of choices that
may<00:05:21.960> mean<00:05:22.410> that<00:05:22.470> you<00:05:22.770> need<00:05:23.010> to<00:05:23.190> wait<00:05:23.370> for

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
may mean that you need to wait for

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.040 
may mean that you need to wait for
another<00:05:23.670> couple<00:05:24.210> of<00:05:24.390> months<00:05:24.630> before<00:05:24.900> they

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
another couple of months before they

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.320 
another couple of months before they
really<00:05:25.320> fall<00:05:25.530> into<00:05:25.830> place<00:05:25.980> so<00:05:26.670> this<00:05:26.910> gives<00:05:27.120> you

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
really fall into place so this gives you

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330 
really fall into place so this gives you
a<00:05:27.390> chance<00:05:27.720> to<00:05:27.990> really<00:05:28.230> think<00:05:28.620> about<00:05:28.770> what<00:05:29.190> is

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
a chance to really think about what is

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.370 
a chance to really think about what is
going<00:05:29.550> to<00:05:29.760> work<00:05:29.910> on<00:05:30.150> what<00:05:30.360> isn't<00:05:30.810> going<00:05:30.840> to<00:05:31.230> be

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
going to work on what isn't going to be

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.020 
going to work on what isn't going to be
work<00:05:31.590> but<00:05:32.040> I<00:05:32.070> think<00:05:32.370> that<00:05:32.400> you'll<00:05:32.610> find<00:05:32.670> that

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
work but I think that you'll find that

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.550 
work but I think that you'll find that
you'll<00:05:33.180> make<00:05:33.390> the<00:05:33.540> right<00:05:33.570> choices<00:05:34.080> anyway

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
you'll make the right choices anyway

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.040 
you'll make the right choices anyway
though<00:05:35.310> those<00:05:35.550> that<00:05:35.910> are<00:05:36.030> single<00:05:36.270> and<00:05:36.570> looking

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
though those that are single and looking

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.770 
though those that are single and looking
this<00:05:37.530> comes<00:05:37.830> down<00:05:38.040> to<00:05:38.280> what<00:05:38.490> do<00:05:38.700> you<00:05:38.790> want<00:05:39.090> the

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780
