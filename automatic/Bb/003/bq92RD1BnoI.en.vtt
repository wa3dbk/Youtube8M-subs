of the fact it makes it fragile i know
some<00:02:08.629> people<00:02:08.660> might<00:02:09.019> argue<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.679> makes<00:02:09.950> it

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160

cheap<00:04:20.479> so<00:04:21.380> they're<00:04:22.190> trying<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.789> make<00:04:22.940> it<00:04:23.060> look

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
cheap so they're trying to make it look

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.150 
cheap so they're trying to make it look
premium<00:04:23.630> but<00:04:23.840> in<00:04:24.110> my<00:04:24.229> opinion<00:04:24.320> it<00:04:24.680> looks<00:04:24.890> cheap

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
premium but in my opinion it looks cheap

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.920 
premium but in my opinion it looks cheap
I<00:04:25.430> don't<00:04:25.820> like<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:26.060> chrome<00:04:26.330> around<00:04:26.660> this

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
I don't like the chrome around this

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.110 
I don't like the chrome around this
bezel<00:04:27.289> and<00:04:27.530> the<00:04:27.710> buttons<00:04:28.039> it<00:04:28.550> gets<00:04:28.789> scratched

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
bezel and the buttons it gets scratched

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.300 
bezel and the buttons it gets scratched
easily<00:04:29.630> if<00:04:30.050> you<00:04:30.110> drop<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:30.440> it<00:04:30.770> gets<00:04:30.919> cough

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
easily if you drop it it gets cough

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.850 
easily if you drop it it gets cough
marks<00:04:31.729> and<00:04:31.970> stuff<00:04:32.210> personally<00:04:33.110> I<00:04:33.140> don't<00:04:33.289> like

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
marks and stuff personally I don't like

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.950 
marks and stuff personally I don't like
this<00:04:34.599> but<00:04:35.599> you<00:04:35.780> guys<00:04:35.930> might<00:04:36.200> say

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
this but you guys might say

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.590 
this but you guys might say
differently<00:04:37.940> so<00:04:38.940> that's<00:04:39.120> my<00:04:39.270> personal

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
differently so that's my personal

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.850 
differently so that's my personal
opinion<00:04:39.690> about<00:04:40.110> this<00:04:41.600> and<00:04:42.600> overall<00:04:43.350> I<00:04:43.650> think

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
opinion about this and overall I think

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.279 
opinion about this and overall I think
it's<00:04:44.490> a<00:04:44.699> much<00:04:45.150> more<00:04:45.180> delicate<00:04:45.539> phone<00:04:45.960> than<00:04:46.199> the

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
it's a much more delicate phone than the

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.400 
it's a much more delicate phone than the
Galaxy<00:04:46.710> Nexus<00:04:47.210> because<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.960> Galaxy<00:04:49.319> Nexus

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
Galaxy Nexus because the Galaxy Nexus

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.290 
Galaxy Nexus because the Galaxy Nexus
was<00:04:49.770> a<00:04:49.800> full<00:04:50.069> plastic<00:04:50.460> bill<00:04:50.699> definitely

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
was a full plastic bill definitely

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.809 
was a full plastic bill definitely
stronger<00:04:51.539> than<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:52.020> glass<00:04:52.349> bill<00:04:52.650> you<00:04:53.580> could

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:53.819 
stronger than the glass bill you could

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:55.730 
stronger than the glass bill you could
leave<00:04:54.000> it<00:04:54.180> to<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.449> total<00:04:54.810> and<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:55.470> can<00:04:55.620> be

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
leave it to the total and you can be

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.350 
leave it to the total and you can be
confident<00:04:56.160> that<00:04:56.280> it<00:04:56.610> wouldn't<00:04:56.880> break<00:04:57.000> on<00:04:57.270> the

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
confident that it wouldn't break on the

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.439 
confident that it wouldn't break on the
back<00:04:58.639> also<00:04:59.639> it<00:04:59.729> didn't<00:04:59.940> have<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.180> chrome

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
back also it didn't have the chrome

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.999 
back also it didn't have the chrome
around<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:00.900> edges<00:05:01.050> so<00:05:03.080> yeah<00:05:04.080> it<00:05:04.710> would

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:05.009 
around the edges so yeah it would

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.040 
around the edges so yeah it would
probably<00:05:05.550> be<00:05:05.819> more<00:05:05.940> resistive<00:05:06.630> to<00:05:06.780> scratch<00:05:07.020> it

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
probably be more resistive to scratch it

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.140 
probably be more resistive to scratch it
had<00:05:07.410> that<00:05:07.560> full<00:05:07.770> plastic<00:05:08.220> build<00:05:08.430> so<00:05:08.669> it's<00:05:08.910> a

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
had that full plastic build so it's a

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.240 
had that full plastic build so it's a
bit<00:05:09.300> more<00:05:09.449> resistant<00:05:09.990> to<00:05:10.020> scratches<00:05:10.620> and

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
bit more resistant to scratches and

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.420 
bit more resistant to scratches and
damage<00:05:11.490> than<00:05:11.880> the<00:05:11.910> glass<00:05:12.240> and<00:05:12.509> chrome<00:05:12.750> build

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
damage than the glass and chrome build

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.249 
damage than the glass and chrome build

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
you know it was my previous phone I feel

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.150 
you know it was my previous phone I feel
this<00:05:18.150> is<00:05:18.330> this<00:05:18.570> feels<00:05:18.870> a<00:05:19.110> bit<00:05:19.229> more<00:05:19.440> premium<00:05:19.740> a

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
this is this feels a bit more premium a

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.939 
this is this feels a bit more premium a
bit<00:05:20.699> more<00:05:20.910> premium<00:05:21.240> but<00:05:21.690> it's<00:05:22.470> a<00:05:22.560> bit<00:05:22.770> more

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
bit more premium but it's a bit more

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.420 
bit more premium but it's a bit more
fragile<00:05:23.160> and<00:05:23.669> Galaxy<00:05:24.479> Nexus<00:05:25.280> however<00:05:26.280> the

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
fragile and Galaxy Nexus however the

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.629 
fragile and Galaxy Nexus however the
Galaxy<00:05:26.789> Nexus<00:05:26.940> was<00:05:27.330> not<00:05:27.539> as<00:05:28.349> premium<00:05:29.009> feel<00:05:29.460> in

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
Galaxy Nexus was not as premium feel in

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.070 
Galaxy Nexus was not as premium feel in
the<00:05:29.759> hand<00:05:29.789> however<00:05:30.720> this<00:05:32.570> is<00:05:33.570> more<00:05:33.870> fragile

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
the hand however this is more fragile

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.320 
the hand however this is more fragile
than<00:05:34.320> that<00:05:34.710> so<00:05:34.889> that<00:05:35.069> was<00:05:35.220> a<00:05:35.280> bit<00:05:35.430> surgical<00:05:36.210> and

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
than that so that was a bit surgical and

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.629 
than that so that was a bit surgical and
then<00:05:36.479> this<00:05:36.690> one<00:05:36.750> so<00:05:37.620> that<00:05:38.099> is<00:05:38.250> my<00:05:38.430> personal

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
then this one so that is my personal

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.820 
then this one so that is my personal
opinion<00:05:38.849> what<00:05:39.360> I<00:05:39.389> think<00:05:39.690> about<00:05:39.930> the<00:05:40.620> two

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
opinion what I think about the two

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.550 
opinion what I think about the two
galaxy<00:05:41.250> phones<00:05:41.780> other<00:05:42.780> than<00:05:42.990> that<00:05:43.050> I<00:05:43.500> really

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
galaxy phones other than that I really

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.279 
galaxy phones other than that I really
like<00:05:43.979> it<00:05:44.300> my<00:05:45.300> experience<00:05:45.509> with<00:05:45.810> it<00:05:45.960> has<00:05:46.169> been

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
like it my experience with it has been

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:48.860 
like it my experience with it has been
great<00:05:46.440> so<00:05:46.710> far<00:05:46.740> I've<00:05:47.099> used<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:47.570> XO<00:05:48.570> skin

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
great so far I've used the XO skin

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.649 
great so far I've used the XO skin
protector<00:05:49.620> on<00:05:49.680> the<00:05:49.800> front<00:05:50.009> end<00:05:50.220> bath<00:05:50.659> full

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
protector on the front end bath full

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:54.170 
protector on the front end bath full
body<00:05:51.870> protector<00:05:52.380> edge<00:05:52.560> to<00:05:52.740> edge<00:05:52.830> so<00:05:53.460> that's

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
body protector edge to edge so that's

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.450 
body protector edge to edge so that's
why<00:05:54.389> I'm<00:05:54.930> not<00:05:55.110> using<00:05:55.320> the<00:05:55.469> case<00:05:55.710> with<00:05:55.919> it<00:05:55.949> but<00:05:56.430> a

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
why I'm not using the case with it but a

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.120 
why I'm not using the case with it but a
habit<00:05:56.729> is<00:05:57.090> to<00:05:57.120> keep<00:05:57.599> you<00:05:57.810> kids<00:05:58.050> with<00:05:58.349> it<00:05:58.500> for<00:05:59.009> it

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
habit is to keep you kids with it for it

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.180 
habit is to keep you kids with it for it
but<00:05:59.370> i<00:05:59.759> am<00:06:00.419> not<00:06:00.449> able<00:06:00.780> to<00:06:01.020> use<00:06:01.169> it<00:06:01.320> because<00:06:01.469> the

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
but i am not able to use it because the

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.300 
but i am not able to use it because the
TPU<00:06:03.180> case<00:06:03.509> cause<00:06:03.810> peeling<00:06:04.380> and<00:06:04.650> bubbling<00:06:05.009> and

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
TPU case cause peeling and bubbling and

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.310 
TPU case cause peeling and bubbling and
stuff<00:06:05.610> makes<00:06:05.909> your<00:06:06.120> screen<00:06:06.719> protector<00:06:07.139> look

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
stuff makes your screen protector look

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.070 
stuff makes your screen protector look
horrible<00:06:07.880> so<00:06:08.880> that's<00:06:09.150> why<00:06:09.300> i'm<00:06:09.419> not<00:06:09.479> able<00:06:09.840> to

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
horrible so that's why i'm not able to

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.379 
horrible so that's why i'm not able to
use<00:06:10.229> a<00:06:11.180> case<00:06:12.180> with<00:06:12.419> it<00:06:12.539> i'm<00:06:12.960> looking<00:06:13.380> to<00:06:13.469> buy<00:06:14.389> a

hopefully<00:06:19.530> I'll<00:06:19.620> get<00:06:19.800> that<00:06:19.949> soon<00:06:20.870> but<00:06:21.870> this<00:06:22.199> is

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:22.349 
hopefully I'll get that soon but this is

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:25.790 
hopefully I'll get that soon but this is
definitely<00:06:22.500> a<00:06:23.389> fragile<00:06:24.389> phone<00:06:24.840> to<00:06:25.349> be<00:06:25.469> honest

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
definitely a fragile phone to be honest

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.700 
definitely a fragile phone to be honest
and<00:06:26.599> you<00:06:27.599> have<00:06:27.750> to<00:06:27.870> be<00:06:27.900> careful<00:06:28.139> with<00:06:28.409> it<00:06:28.560> I

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
and you have to be careful with it I

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:29.779 
and you have to be careful with it I
would<00:06:28.889> recommend<00:06:29.130> using<00:06:29.430> the<00:06:29.520> screen

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:29.789 
would recommend using the screen

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:32.620 
would recommend using the screen
protector<00:06:30.210> front<00:06:30.449> and<00:06:30.719> back<00:06:30.930> as<00:06:31.889> well<00:06:32.219> as

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
protector front and back as well as

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.620 
protector front and back as well as
using<00:06:33.630> the<00:06:33.840> case<00:06:34.080> if<00:06:34.289> possible<00:06:34.820> and<00:06:35.820> yeah

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
using the case if possible and yeah

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.180 
using the case if possible and yeah
that's<00:06:36.810> pretty<00:06:36.930> much<00:06:37.229> it<00:06:37.289> that's<00:06:37.680> my<00:06:37.860> personal

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
that's pretty much it that's my personal

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.950 
that's pretty much it that's my personal
opinion<00:06:38.280> about<00:06:38.909> the<00:06:39.150> build<00:06:39.360> quality<00:06:39.509> of<00:06:39.870> the

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
opinion about the build quality of the

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.950 
opinion about the build quality of the
zone<00:06:40.199> it<00:06:40.650> feels<00:06:41.009> a<00:06:41.099> bit<00:06:41.130> premium<00:06:41.729> but<00:06:42.030> it's<00:06:42.840> a

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
zone it feels a bit premium but it's a

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.110 
zone it feels a bit premium but it's a
bit<00:06:43.110> for<00:06:43.259> jack<00:06:43.469> overall<00:06:44.430> I<00:06:44.460> would<00:06:44.669> give<00:06:45.000> it

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
bit for jack overall I would give it

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.689 
bit for jack overall I would give it
probably<00:06:45.710> eight<00:06:46.710> out<00:06:46.979> of<00:06:47.010> ten<00:06:47.310> in<00:06:47.460> build

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:47.699 
probably eight out of ten in build

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.600 
probably eight out of ten in build
quality<00:06:47.909> wise<00:06:48.330> because

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
quality wise because

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.879 
quality wise because
just<00:06:50.000> because<00:06:50.270> it<00:06:50.389> feels<00:06:50.599> a<00:06:50.780> bit<00:06:50.900> fragile<00:06:51.199> to

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:51.889 
just because it feels a bit fragile to

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:55.719 
just because it feels a bit fragile to
be<00:06:52.009> honest<00:06:52.310> wherever<00:06:52.639> my<00:06:52.879> lightning<00:06:54.610> so<00:06:55.610> yeah

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:55.729 
be honest wherever my lightning so yeah

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:57.850 
be honest wherever my lightning so yeah
hopefully<00:06:56.060> that<00:06:56.750> covers<00:06:57.080> build<00:06:57.349> quality<00:06:57.530> of

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
hopefully that covers build quality of

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.189 
hopefully that covers build quality of
the<00:06:57.979> phone
