00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.370
 after passing through the portable consoles 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.410
 arrives at the aftermath batman arkham 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.210
 origins black eyed deluxe edition one 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.950
 remastered version of the title 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.660
 original of which we tell you all the 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.050
 new features incorporated in our 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.050
 analysis 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.360
 his story takes place three months 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.490
 after what happened in batman arkham 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.040
 origins where we ally ourselves with catwoman 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.900
 to jump white and a penitentiary 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.780
 where celebrities are imprisoned 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.180
 villains this place is divided into three 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.100
 areas led by the mask penguin 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.900
 black and the southern and our mission is 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.860
 to put the place in order since 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.860
 these have mutinied 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.370
 just start part that serves us 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.050
 as a tutorial our adventure begins 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.850
 its gameplay is very similar to what 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.320
 seen in previous titles of the saga 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.970
 in desktop consoles but 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.710
 developing everything from a 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.600
 two-dimensional perspective with the 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.600
 possibility of interacting with others 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.939
 elements in different dimensions 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.009
 we have a button to attack another 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.200
 to counterattack eluding the opponent and 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.380
 one with multiple functions like running 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.360
 or jump plan to dodge or climb like 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.580
 has been usual in the saga little to 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.409
 little we will get the batman gadgets 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.930
 that allow us access to new 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.820
 zones and unlock secrets for 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.500
 change what we have selected so 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.159
 you just have to press one of the buttons 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.159
 of the directional pad 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.440
 this time the detective mode is more 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.420
 necessary that in other deliveries 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.099
 allowing to interact with certain 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.349
 objects only when we have 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.959
 analyzed something that sometimes results 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.910
 quite expendable also helps 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.769
 better identify the enemies that are 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.840
 they find themselves on the stage being 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.760
 essential to plan a strategy if not 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.360
 we want to die the instant when there 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.129
 enemies equipped with firearms 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.989
 nevertheless the combats against the rest 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.879
 they are simpler because only 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.480
 we have two directions to be 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.480
 slopes 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.769
 at the end of each level always 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.379
 we will find the most powerful enemies 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.360
 with unique movements to learn for 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:01.010
 get dodge them and launch our 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.010
 counterattack to kill them 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.750
 120 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.000
 this delivery contrary to the rest 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.950
 follows a style more similar to the saga 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.540
 metroid or castlevania with scenarios 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.670
 labyrinths that force us to use 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.100
 on more than one occasion the map for 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.380
 guide us to solve puzzles 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.240
 riddles and various half games how 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.070
 find a combination of numbers with 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.980
 the cryptographic sequencer for 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.870
 unlock a door as you 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.790
 we get the captchas we have to 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.940
 back on our steps to access 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.440
 to areas that previously we could not all this 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.300
 makes the exploration very 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.950
 important in this title just like 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.950
 know how to analyze the different situations 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.110
 because it's a game where there's 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.030
 several areas that are accessible after 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.860
 get certain caches we recommend 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.080
 complete the adventure first to 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.240
 get them all and six as we go 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.190
 going through its corridors unlock the 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.100
 hidden places without having to go back to 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.600
 traverse the pressure from top to bottom 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.310
 this will allow to get all the 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.310
 Easier selectable 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.090
 there are improvements for our costume that 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.520
 allow for greater protection or 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.650
 increase attack power as 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.449
 curiosity we find different costumes 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.240
 for batman that will be unlocked at 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.190
 get parts of these there are also 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.229
 certain optional missions such as finishing 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.949
 with the penguins in cages masks 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.949
 guiding 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.710
 there are few additions to the version 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.190
 of laptops but we can find more 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.330
 costumes and the odd new enemy 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.280
 there is also a gift map 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.380
 three-dimensional instead of the original that 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.270
 they will go two dimensions although it is quite 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.450
 confused and does not point us the following 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.450
 objective 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.520
 it is not a very extensive title 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.319
 completing in about 10 hours we include 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.319
 all the extras available 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.880
 graphically there is not much improvement except 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.770
 for his jump to the definition though 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.330
 designs two of the animations of 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.670
 the characters were already pretty good 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.730
 we will notice a big difference between 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.260
 protagonists and secondary 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.660
 -I began is where there is better 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.810
 running 1080p and 60 frames per 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.370
 second the cables the videos that counts 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.200
 in history they are made with 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.690
 pretty animated illustrations 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.690
 flashy that simulate comic scenes 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.259
 shares a lot of soundtrack with the 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.210
 original game although for our 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:07.000
 misfortune unlike this only 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.069
 includes dubbing in English at least it will be 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.479
 simple according to your argument thanks to 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:12.479
 subtitles in Spanish 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:22.259
 in conclusion batman arkham origins 

00:06:20.429 --> 00:06:24.179
 black eyed deluxe edition is a game 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:26.009
 quite entertaining with a gameplay 

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:28.489
 simple and lots of corridors 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:31.529
 two-dimensional labyrinths to explore 

00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:33.539
 does not include enough extra content 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:35.039
 as to recommend your purchase if you already 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.619
 you own some of the versions 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:40.110
 portable but still it's still a 

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:43.000
 good game its duration has seemed 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.250
 something short 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.870
 practically fulfills its mission with 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.550
 good design of the characters and 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.770
 scenarios although sometimes some 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.320
 textures fail and lack of synchronization 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.390
 lipstick on several occasions the band 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.070
 sound is just as good as the original 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:00.360
 missing the great dubbing in 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.360
 Cast of other deliveries 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:04.099
 a title that we recommend to those 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:06.110
 players who like the 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:07.610
 style games of the metro classics 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.409
 it or castlevania although it is done 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.409
 repetitive with the passage of hours
