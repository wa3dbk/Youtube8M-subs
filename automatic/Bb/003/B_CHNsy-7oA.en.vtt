happening with this is that someone will
you<00:05:39.100> have<00:05:39.250> to<00:05:39.370> root<00:05:39.580> out<00:05:39.760> the<00:05:40.120> negation<00:05:40.900> with

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
you have to root out the negation with

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.780 
you have to root out the negation with
Qwaser<00:05:41.410> and<00:05:41.590> i'm<00:05:41.650> only<00:05:41.860> going<00:05:42.190> to<00:05:42.280> negate<00:05:42.580> a

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
Qwaser and i'm only going to negate a

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.670 
Qwaser and i'm only going to negate a
play<00:05:43.060> of<00:05:43.120> yours<00:05:43.240> if<00:05:43.630> it<00:05:43.750> threatens<00:05:43.930> my<00:05:44.200> quasar

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
play of yours if it threatens my quasar

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.280 
play of yours if it threatens my quasar
and<00:05:44.890> so<00:05:45.610> if<00:05:45.730> you<00:05:45.760> play<00:05:46.060> you<00:05:46.510> know<00:05:46.540> ms<00:05:46.900> tina<00:05:47.080> back

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
and so if you play you know ms tina back

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.690 
and so if you play you know ms tina back
row<00:05:47.470> i'm<00:05:47.650> not<00:05:47.980> gonna<00:05:48.100> even<00:05:48.340> though<00:05:48.550> i<00:05:48.580> don't

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
to this then I'm going to negate it

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.730 
to this then I'm going to negate it
obviously<00:05:58.000> if<00:05:58.810> you<00:05:58.930> try<00:05:59.080> to<00:05:59.110> dark<00:05:59.350> hole<00:05:59.530> this
