00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:00.110
 ready 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.159
 therefore 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:04.330

 our offer 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:20.900
 but as the club found out 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.020
 had not returned and military in the vicinity at that moment and in that 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.020

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.439
 enough 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:35.439
 sensors are these units is a replica 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:37.529
 at night in los angeles 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:40.219
 through the gaps it makes no effort 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:42.229
 with these changes 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:46.199
 according to he listened to politicians who took to the force in panic began to think 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.199
 not impossible 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.599
 everything is alright 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:56.599
 our goal 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:58.919
 a poll 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.919

 not now 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:20.719
 when they asked for their altitude, the pilot informed that he was about a thousand 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:24.960
 five hundred meters and that he could clearly see the mysterious aircraft 

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:27.959
 hovering over it 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:36.889
 will be up to the club and that was alarmed 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.839
 It's the Atlantic with whom he had left. 

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:44.659
 87 years 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:46.999
