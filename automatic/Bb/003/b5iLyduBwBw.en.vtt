00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:11.220
 Good day to all, almost 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:18.369
 probably the evening on the street is getting dark 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:23.390
 wanted to show the video saw too 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:28.480
 the internet how people do the highlight 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:31.439
 salon door exactly car 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.439
 lifan solano 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.110
 concerning 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.540
 the highlight itself 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.579
 saw how they do 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:50.800
 at the door and 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:54.510
 on the interior trim is now hard to see but 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.180
 Turn on the downturn. The light will be fine, but 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.360
 demonstrate that I have doors 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.360
 open 2 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.620
 such a blue light comes on 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.620
 backlight 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:17.870
 looks very impressive here in the snow 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:24.470
 This moment, well, in principle, even when 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:29.620
 leaving the car can be seen that not in a puddle 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:32.890
 can become of many it costs cake 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.890
 so I pockets framed all the same under 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.890
 pen 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.909
 door closing 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.820
 to not so dirty 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.260
 Well, in principle, I liked it so much 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:54.420
 also respectively on all doors 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:56.580
 it's cold on the streets a little under 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.690
 civic 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.910
 on all doors 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.910
 the trim is simply removed 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.350
 connected parallel here to this red 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:14.830
 light bulbs 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:17.100
 that principle right now she doesn't even need them on 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.370
 ceiling 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:26.080
 here is my red 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:31.850
 diode tape and back too 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:35.410
 decent looks salon from the street close 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.410
 the door and just 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.410
 red 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:49.010
 i like like just 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.010
 will show you as to 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.740
 connection 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:03.300
 this tape she's here 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:06.350
 Salon from the interior lamp can be seen here 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.350
 all in parallel 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:14.799
 parallel light bulbs 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.799
 Well, respectively, under the skin 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.640
 who else installed all the same camera 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.519
 rear view yourself 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.040
 it's bad now or your nose is closing 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.530
 monitor 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.430
 It opens as it should stand 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.430
 parktronics but 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.590
 somehow they began to annoy me 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.740
 demonstrate camera work 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.150
 here you go 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.010
 hard to see 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.940
 nevertheless it was necessary in the afternoon 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:54.410
 take off 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:57.880
 parking sensors now froze so beeps 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:01.850
 here's a camera with tick marks just now 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.040
 here is closer here you can see the division 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:09.130
 he camera me the most common without 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.130
 backlight enough 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.130
 reversing light bulbs i.e. bottom is wise 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.130
 hp 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:24.460
 put multitronics computer display 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.830
 here of course now merges 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.979
 here 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.449
 people also saw ask the question where is it 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.900
 stick in 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.580
 many people put he means here instead 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.400
 ashtray pockets 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.460
 I did not bother found 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.100
 applying here we have it all 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.200
 anyway the lamp is not filmed here 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:52.790
 such a bird is beautiful on in my opinion 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:55.470
 flying under it did not bother 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.760
 I close the mirror a little bit 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.670
 rear view 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.940
 but as it is worthy of seeing anyway 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:06.950
 passengers 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.950
 and he is in his place 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:14.940
 everything is just enough under the skin 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:20.070
 court here has plugged the whole train and stole 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:22.410
 down to the diagnostic pads 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:26.780
 why still decided to put about 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:29.460
 ships first from our masters 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.800
 looters at all addicts amount i 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.960
 sucking drunkards 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.129
 could and was attached to the windshield 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.129
 glass and panel 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:46.240
 but still it's probably the amount of the place 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:49.419
 what else was the car adding 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:54.180
 xenon foggy threshold now you 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.180
 I will demonstrate that it flares up 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:09.210
 too worthy of such a light 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:09.570
 because the headlights have a lens shining here 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.500
 these 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:17.150
 like the same fluff avatar xenon set 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.150
 pleased glad and 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:26.000
 means 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:31.210
 from the masters of our traffic cops one movement 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:35.750
 turned the knob the light turned off 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:39.740
 Well here are my alterations that 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:42.350
 for lifan car 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.410
 Now I'll show you the rear camera 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:51.160
 kind of 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:55.210
 here it is with me here it is mortise 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.210
 mount did it yourself separately 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:09.299
 that's all I wanted to tell 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:13.110
 write 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:21.250

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.880
