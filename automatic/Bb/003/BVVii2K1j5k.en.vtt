working<00:04:52.190> we've<00:04:52.370> tried<00:04:52.550> to<00:04:52.639> Lubin<00:04:52.820> it<00:04:52.910> up<00:04:53.000> with

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
working we've tried to Lubin it up with

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.640 
working we've tried to Lubin it up with
some<00:04:53.240> of<00:04:53.330> the<00:04:53.419> best<00:04:53.810> stuff<00:04:53.930> we<00:04:54.080> can<00:04:54.199> find<00:04:54.470> we

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
some of the best stuff we can find we

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:55.840 
some of the best stuff we can find we
have<00:04:54.710> this<00:04:54.830> stuff<00:04:55.010> called<00:04:55.039> 7-eleven<00:04:55.699> it's

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
have this stuff called 7-eleven it's

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.460 
have this stuff called 7-eleven it's
usually<00:04:56.000> a<00:04:56.330> pretty<00:04:56.780> good<00:04:56.900> lubricant<00:04:57.350> that's

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
usually a pretty good lubricant that's

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.879 
usually a pretty good lubricant that's
that's<00:04:58.100> not<00:04:58.220> helping<00:04:59.410> it's<00:05:00.410> just<00:05:00.650> it<00:05:00.860> just

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
that's not helping it's just it just

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.070 
that's not helping it's just it just
hanging<00:05:01.280> up<00:05:01.370> all<00:05:01.610> the<00:05:01.760> time<00:05:01.970> it's<00:05:02.630> not<00:05:02.810> smooth

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
hanging up all the time it's not smooth

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.080 
hanging up all the time it's not smooth
and<00:05:03.229> pumping<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.710> it<00:05:04.340> does<00:05:04.490> have<00:05:04.639> failures<00:05:04.940> to

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
and pumping the it does have failures to

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.140 
and pumping the it does have failures to
feed<00:05:05.330> but<00:05:05.510> that's<00:05:06.110> most<00:05:06.470> likely<00:05:06.680> due<00:05:06.979> to

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
feed but that's most likely due to

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.219 
feed but that's most likely due to
hanging<00:05:08.150> up<00:05:08.360> ever<00:05:08.510> so<00:05:08.690> slightly<00:05:08.960> when<00:05:09.169> you

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
hanging up ever so slightly when you

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.170 
hanging up ever so slightly when you
pull<00:05:09.410> the<00:05:09.530> slide<00:05:09.979> to<00:05:10.130> the<00:05:10.190> rear<00:05:10.280> and<00:05:10.820> short

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
pull the slide to the rear and short

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.159 
pull the slide to the rear and short
stroking<00:05:11.570> it<00:05:11.660> a<00:05:11.720> bit<00:05:12.820> yeah<00:05:13.990> the<00:05:14.990> biggest

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
stroking it a bit yeah the biggest

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:16.600 
stroking it a bit yeah the biggest
problem<00:05:15.620> for<00:05:16.039> me<00:05:16.160> anyway

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
problem for me anyway

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.400 
problem for me anyway
