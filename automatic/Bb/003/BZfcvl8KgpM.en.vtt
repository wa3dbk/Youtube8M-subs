00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
what we just did was you ran a dyno test

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.149 
what we just did was you ran a dyno test
with<00:01:26.299> pnn<00:01:26.659> filters<00:01:27.049> with<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.680> new<00:01:27.860> filter

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
with pnn filters with the new filter

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.380

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
versus a filter that has race on it to

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.719 
versus a filter that has race on it to
determine<00:01:32.409> what<00:01:33.409> is<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.619> efficiency<00:01:34.399> how

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
determine what is the efficiency how

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.940 
determine what is the efficiency how
efficient<00:01:35.270> is<00:01:35.360> our<00:01:35.600> intake<00:01:36.080> and<00:01:36.350> then<00:01:36.770> of

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
efficient is our intake and then of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.010 
efficient is our intake and then of
course<00:01:36.979> Canon<00:01:37.640> is<00:01:37.970> trying<00:01:38.329> to<00:01:38.420> supply<00:01:38.689> us<00:01:38.960> with

course Canon is trying to supply us with
the<00:01:39.140> best<00:01:39.350> possible<00:01:39.590> filter<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.820> keep<00:01:41.000> the

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
the best possible filter to keep the

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.789 
the best possible filter to keep the
engine<00:01:41.539> clean<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:41.960> healthy<00:01:42.140> throughout<00:01:42.619> the

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
engine clean and healthy throughout the

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.160 
engine clean and healthy throughout the
entire<00:01:43.070> race<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:44.149> that's<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.600> number<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.049> we

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
entire race so that's the number so we

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.109 
entire race so that's the number so we
just<00:01:45.320> did<00:01:45.560> right<00:01:45.740> here<00:01:46.009> comparing<00:01:46.909> it<00:01:47.000> and

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
just did right here comparing it and

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.310 
just did right here comparing it and
it's<00:01:47.240> actually<00:01:47.539> looking<00:01:47.689> very<00:01:48.200> very<00:01:48.350> good
