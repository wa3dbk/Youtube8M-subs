the<00:00:19.710> problem<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.310> not<00:00:20.520> proving<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.210> UFOs

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
they're getting here what scientists

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.999 
they're getting here what scientists
need<00:00:29.759> to<00:00:29.910> do<00:00:30.089> is<00:00:30.300> they<00:00:30.570> need<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:31.140> look<00:00:31.470> at<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
need to do is they need to look at the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.770 
need to do is they need to look at the
hardcore<00:00:32.759> evidence<00:00:33.079> decide<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.800> oh<00:00:35.040> my<00:00:35.370> gosh

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780

ETS<00:00:36.780> are<00:00:37.020> real<00:00:37.740> and<00:00:38.130> then<00:00:38.730> get<00:00:38.970> over<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.420> then

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
ETS are real and then get over that then

thing going on in this planet today and
yet<00:01:49.079> nobody<00:01:49.259> talks<00:01:49.619> about<00:01:49.739> it

if we come together we can make this
