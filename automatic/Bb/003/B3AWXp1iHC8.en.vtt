this is just ambient light from the 60
watt<00:03:58.890> bulb<00:03:59.129> and<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.849> can<00:03:59.970> already<00:04:00.209> tell<00:04:00.330> the

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
watt bulb and you can already tell the

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.720 
watt bulb and you can already tell the
tritium<00:04:01.080> is<00:04:01.200> brighter<00:04:04.099> now<00:04:05.099> I<00:04:05.370> mean<00:04:05.580> the

what's on the paper is still blowing

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.720 
what's on the paper is still blowing
brighter<00:04:08.220> because<00:04:08.489> what's<00:04:09.390> on<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.629> paper<00:04:09.900> is

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
brighter because what's on the paper is

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.220 
brighter because what's on the paper is
it's<00:04:11.730> on<00:04:11.880> a<00:04:11.910> white<00:04:12.180> background<00:04:12.450> plus<00:04:13.049> it's

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
it's on a white background plus it's

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.819 
it's on a white background plus it's
thicker<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:13.890> it's<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.849> more<00:04:15.090> surface<00:04:15.510> area

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
thicker and it's a more surface area

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.030 
thicker and it's a more surface area
paint<00:04:17.600> but<00:04:18.600> give<00:04:18.780> it<00:04:18.810> another<00:04:19.109> hour<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.650> couple

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
paint but give it another hour a couple

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.560 
paint but give it another hour a couple
hours<00:04:20.430> and<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:21.680> it'll<00:04:22.680> definitely<00:04:22.919> be<00:04:23.570> dimmer

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
hours and you it'll definitely be dimmer

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.820 
hours and you it'll definitely be dimmer
than<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.290> tritium<00:04:27.320> okay<00:04:28.320> I<00:04:30.410> will<00:04:31.410> say<00:04:31.620> though

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
than the tritium okay I will say though

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.870 
than the tritium okay I will say though
that<00:04:32.100> this<00:04:32.910> is<00:04:32.970> my<00:04:33.180> first<00:04:33.510> night<00:04:34.229> with<00:04:34.620> the

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
that this is my first night with the

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.060 
that this is my first night with the
paint<00:04:36.110> painted<00:04:37.110> on<00:04:37.320> sites<00:04:39.289> but<00:04:40.289> I<00:04:40.350> did<00:04:40.680> have

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
paint painted on sites but I did have

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.379 
paint painted on sites but I did have
the<00:04:41.720> this<00:04:42.720> paper<00:04:43.370> next<00:04:44.370> to<00:04:44.490> my<00:04:44.610> bed<00:04:44.910> last<00:04:45.180> night

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.310 
the this paper next to my bed last night
and<00:04:46.100> I<00:04:47.100> did<00:04:47.430> notice<00:04:47.880> that<00:04:47.910> it<00:04:48.240> was<00:04:48.320> bright

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
and I did notice that it was bright

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.529 
and I did notice that it was bright
enough<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.680> see<00:04:50.039> all<00:04:50.250> night<00:04:50.610> long<00:04:50.880> with

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
enough to see all night long with

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.650 
enough to see all night long with
adjusted<00:04:52.139> with<00:04:53.070> your<00:04:53.250> eyes<00:04:53.729> adjusted<00:04:54.479> to<00:04:54.570> the

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
adjusted with your eyes adjusted to the

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.260 
adjusted with your eyes adjusted to the
darkness<00:04:57.950> alright<00:04:58.950> so<00:04:59.580> for<00:04:59.910> what<00:05:00.090> it's<00:05:00.210> worth

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
darkness alright so for what it's worth

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.800 
darkness alright so for what it's worth
that's<00:05:00.690> glow<00:05:01.050> on<00:05:01.260> glow<00:05:01.979> ink<00:05:02.220> correction<00:05:03.210> low

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
that's glow on glow ink correction low

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.710 
that's glow on glow ink correction low
ink<00:05:04.050> I<00:05:04.550> didn't<00:05:05.550> get<00:05:05.700> any<00:05:05.820> glow<00:05:06.150> on<00:05:06.330> because

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
ink I didn't get any glow on because

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.379 
ink I didn't get any glow on because
they<00:05:06.840> don't<00:05:07.050> have<00:05:07.260> it<00:05:07.410> on<00:05:07.500> Amazon<00:05:07.889> Prime<00:05:08.389> but

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
they don't have it on Amazon Prime but

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.070 
they don't have it on Amazon Prime but
ten<00:05:09.930> dollars<00:05:11.240> if<00:05:12.240> I<00:05:12.419> could<00:05:12.570> do<00:05:12.660> it<00:05:12.690> again<00:05:13.050> I

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
ten dollars if I could do it again I

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.339 
ten dollars if I could do it again I
probably<00:05:13.560> just<00:05:14.160> would<00:05:14.490> not<00:05:15.060> put<00:05:15.720> it<00:05:15.810> on<00:05:15.930> my<00:05:16.139> gun

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
probably just would not put it on my gun

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.740 
probably just would not put it on my gun
I<00:05:16.620> mean<00:05:17.430> it'll<00:05:17.729> be<00:05:17.789> good<00:05:18.060> for<00:05:18.300> another<00:05:18.389> couple

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
I mean it'll be good for another couple

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.390 
I mean it'll be good for another couple
weeks<00:05:19.050> but<00:05:19.260> I'm<00:05:19.380> just<00:05:19.530> going<00:05:19.740> to<00:05:19.860> end<00:05:20.099> up

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
weeks but I'm just going to end up

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.219 
weeks but I'm just going to end up
spending<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.880> eightieth<00:05:21.240> $90<00:05:21.900> on<00:05:22.020> night

sights<00:05:22.560> it<00:05:22.830> just<00:05:23.510> doesn't<00:05:24.510> make<00:05:24.599> sense<00:05:24.660> to<00:05:24.960> not

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
sights it just doesn't make sense to not

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.940 
sights it just doesn't make sense to not
do<00:05:25.470> it<00:05:25.650> especially<00:05:26.430> for<00:05:27.030> your<00:05:27.120> pistol<00:05:27.950> that

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
do it especially for your pistol that

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:35.000
