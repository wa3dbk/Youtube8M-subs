00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:09.660
 same lock we saw 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.480
 the machine is set to stand on 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.990
 card can show how she is 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:22.080
 a brass nose is working is a nose 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:28.529
 lock activation in a real machine 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:36.390
 it is activated by a cable means here 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:38.250
 you can lower it down and the nose closes 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.879
 the ring does not let the differential turn on 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.760
 in this case, it works as usual 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:51.120
 the differential under small he is perfect 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:55.500
 calmly spinning now if we 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.859
 raise the spout ie activate 9 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.840
 differential in difficult driving conditions 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:07.580
 on the go in this case is easier 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:11.340
 closes the possibility of mutual 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:16.430
 turning about 90 degrees 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.430
 now we can show it on the go 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.040
 turn on 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.680
 imitating 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.110
 we cover 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.720
 Of course one thing fears stops 2 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.290
 pressed through 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.240
 films 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.280
 activate the lock raise your legs 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.270
 try to blow see that wheel 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.820
 down below 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.530
 Now 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.970
 health brake 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.970
 it's trying to slow down 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.670
 click 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.670
 as rerun shows 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.670
 blocking 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.479
 also exactly 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.479
 enable lock 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.640
 wrote himself moving with you 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.540
 so it will be possible 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.670
 on the contrary and on the wheel about 200 rpm 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.770
 when matched 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:36.709
 cars about 25 meters per hour here on 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:40.489
 this speed you can activate it and 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.489
 deactivate on the go
