head has the most detail of everything

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.529

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
how he turned out his arms feel a little

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.800 
how he turned out his arms feel a little
bit<00:01:49.890> wide<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.340> me<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:50.640> they<00:01:50.790> get<00:01:51.149> any<00:01:51.390> skinnier

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
bit wide to me but they get any skinnier

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.740 
bit wide to me but they get any skinnier
they<00:01:52.020> look<00:01:52.170> disproportional<00:01:53.100> for<00:01:53.340> his<00:01:53.460> head

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
they look disproportional for his head

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.609 
they look disproportional for his head
so<00:01:55.189> I've<00:01:56.189> kind<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.579> been<00:01:56.700> debating<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.619> leave

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
so I've kind of been debating that leave

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.660 
so I've kind of been debating that leave
in<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.799> comments<00:01:59.189> let<00:01:59.250> me<00:01:59.310> know<00:01:59.399> what<00:01:59.610> you

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
think other than that though it's a

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.770 
think other than that though it's a
