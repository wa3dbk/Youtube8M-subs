00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.710
 once all the damage the future brings another service in the fight I have 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.300
 that can not make all injury anp reuters the usual five percent 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.429
 people eat only briefly because martijn is that p 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.830
 and this is vita 2014 world gap rotterdam 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.509
 yes i'm going by in particular i'm gonna just see a starter pack it looks like that 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.759
 see club for me at least at club I seem familiar to the parking spots 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.409
 to come to mexico 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:31.429
 I have 240 apex of the baron 240 not 150 we want nice round number 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:32.970
 I'm the kind of person who watches that 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.519
 what I also is safe or this video education field 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:38.399
 other plans today with pleasure is still a video so I would say if 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.280
 you want that 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.610
 then let it know 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.460
 and then i will like a nice cunt that i think i also like the german top club 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.100
 because now is ago ago and of course I also had to see how 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.120
 fine singing to play and do 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.530
 I said that I have a second one and I will certainly be hopeful but I will 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.520
 also give up to join probably do 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.430
 neighbors because playing some countries second is a very uncertain time to 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.190
 to do 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.320
 so I am not sure if that will work I keep trying but yes camp 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.710
 I will improve a bit 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.460
 but it is also certain who will be singing along with tight ones in the coming period 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.100
 pectin 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.890
 what was not too good was the ex number of teenagers 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.680
 muriel i try a second by e-mail 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.990
 and also a ruben chess but yes then you should stay a lot could play chess 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.270
 is not too good 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.740
 sorry feyenoord I mean we were not involved at all but he is just 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.930
 all too well 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.850
 he praises I had not really very good very many australia australians 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.600
 of course a few silene course says years 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.200
 it was not too good a chance came against vitesse keeper and that is pretty good 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.910
 only pretty good is not good enough 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.430
 not good enough in my opinion so i had to slide around a bit i didn't 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.030
 a really good start 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.520
 but then especially know in the responses you will find a starting place for all statistics 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.520
 players like messi ronaldo van persie robben 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.130
 on the field of practical school know what you see there the players from but that 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.340
 was in response to the huge new card 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.680
 and what i can say is i have some plans with red this time 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.140
 I hope he is bared by fans of simply by once you play 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.820
 for a fully Dutch team 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.930
 with the normal motorcycle pension which means that will try horsepower within the Netherlands 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.179
 as of course often a symbolic loss for that 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.979
 of the 2000 final 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.599
 In addition, I do not know exactly what I will do with this 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.369
 the aviko players are tackled 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:17.849
 but this is not exactly what I can do with it 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.979
 i will think about voting one of the two can think of 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:24.449
 maybe the worst possible world cup team or something in that direction towards the 100 rooms 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:25.109
 3 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.049
 after the skirmish between such it would be nice maybe they have something 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.339
 I have not yet tried 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:31.999
 I certainly had it because he can do this 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:35.010
 and further i don't know i actually know it now 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.810
 I am very curious but I am looking forward to it because it seems like a nice idea 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.599
 to do well some drawback 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.109
 first that you cannot plan for and can do 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:44.520
 and yes I don't know further 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.279
 yes maybe demolish or something in that direction would be nice 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:51.680
 but at least the best place in eerbeek is Peter, who also points out 

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:54.769
 And then I have something to say 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.250
 that is pedantic for support lately that sounds very happy 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.270
 see the taxi but that is not the intention but recently one already 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.709
 fiasco good views box more the weather flares up 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.459
 if there is one to see what stands out that just motivates me and you think 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.900
 maybe but you and I have never had as much as a month earlier 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.829
 like humans 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.489
 I go for bacteria Mitchell what but during a hobby that is not at all 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.279
 just outside in a group and it will be that if people don't understand you 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:21.419
 really mean nothing to it 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.419
 yes i think i had no better zoom and certitude 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.269
 that the villagers lost 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.599
 and then i was first to say about it 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.179
 I do not know I have nothing with stars but yes that can work with people's hair 

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:34.049
 two children 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.049
 at least not on which the investigation were murdered later 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:41.159
 and a big germany worries about a whole breadth 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:45.149
 because handy in the impossible to be the second with this is an uncertain time of 

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:48.969
 five find out no team sees the brand for 2k games 0 tourists but that 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:54.039
 I'm not sure so I will do science sorry people who don't like it and I love it 

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:55.579
 really those with you 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:56.739
 especially know that 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.789
 but it is also important to me that I could just continue as there was still 

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:03.799
 adventure and if I have to act yes that can also take a long time 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.909
 and I know you just assume that you have nothing in town that is what I am going to do 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:07.739
 to attempt 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.149
 I will try the second corner just canceled the school I had noticed 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:14.289
 will do my best for you but have had a brief overview I want to say 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.669
 dk put is fucking like thomas and i'm looking forward to it 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.950
 and I feel sorry for the people who bought clothes 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.349
 because you seriously spend 40 60 euros on a game 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:28.199
 both actually not worth this is also limit disabled also feyenoord 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.699
 because it is nest and so 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.940
 if you do with it if you bought to hell i feel sorry for you and i hope so 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.090
 I wish it could be used well but it is not possible 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.930
 is indeed the first cup place that is what you think now when fallen know that 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.309
 you have gotten a good player so far in stream supplement with 10 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.020
 after the second time viewed with the series leaves like like if you do the 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.509
 last day could still be in red like i said aegon that seems like crazy with all 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:53.759
 enjoy another video 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.889
 Brentford and I was the bye bye
