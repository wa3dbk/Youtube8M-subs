00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.220
 Once the foundations are ready 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.140
 it is time to prepare the materials. 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.820
 As you saw earlier 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.060
 the folded forms are easily portable 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.600
 Most builders have the forms 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.320
 on the inside of the building for greater convenience. 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.220
 If you use this practice, leave a free space of 1.8 m from the wall, 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.510
 to be able to mount the struts. 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.900
 When everything is ready, 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.670
 Start at a corner from the longest wall and choose to follow 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.870
 rotation arrangement clockwise or counter-clockwise. 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.840
 Forms easily dissolve - 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.840
 Fix the shape with the long side down to your stomach 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.000
 and pull the top side toward you. Ready! 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.280
 The dissolution of the angular shape is similar, 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:07.300
 the difference is that you have to pull out and insert one of the nets back into the short corner. 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.690
 Do not forget this, otherwise the form will be significantly more unstable. 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.560
 Put the shapes next to each other 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.630
 you will have problems with the order of the next row. 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.300
 To avoid this, some builders 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.070
 arrange the first and second row at the same time. 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.570
 so the locking system adjusts the shapes for you. 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:43.760
 In this case, be sure to apply the horizontal reinforcement iron between them. 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.990
 We will talk about iron reinforcement after a while. 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.450
 When you reach the next corner, 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.510
 first apply the angle and the adjacent standard shape. 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.900
 Measure the distance to the previous standard form. 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.310
 Cut out a portion of a standard shape with this length 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.570
 Move away to avoid damaging the wall and the place. 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.570
 It would be perfect if you cut along the groove, 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.430
 to match the nets in the next row. 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.100
 Since the grooves are located every 5 cm, 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:29.590
 you may need to cut the shape and not just the groove. 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.410
 We'll show you how to compensate for network mismatch after a while. 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.630
 If after the incision you have more than 10 cm panel without internal network, 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.030
 you will need to reinforce the shape with a fiber sticker in 2 places, 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:54.780
 to withstand the pressure when the concrete is poured 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.490
 When casting the concrete, the greatest pressure is found at the corners. 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.030
 Therefore, avoid cutting angles. 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.560
 It is a good practice to use wire or metal clips, 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.710
 to attach the angles to the adjacent standard shapes 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.660
 Once the first row is ready, it's time to put the iron on the arm. 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.620
 That's what we'll be talking about after a while. 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:34.460
