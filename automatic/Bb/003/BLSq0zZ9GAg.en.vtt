helps<00:01:36.649> with<00:01:36.799> detangling<00:01:37.479> so<00:01:38.479> like<00:01:38.899> I<00:01:38.929> said<00:01:39.229> I

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
helps with detangling so like I said I

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.459 
helps with detangling so like I said I
highly<00:01:40.899> recommend<00:01:41.899> it

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:48.609 

what<00:01:45.469> it<00:01:45.619> is<00:01:45.770> is<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:46.399> rose<00:01:46.609> water<00:01:46.969> is<00:01:47.619> actually

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
what it is is the rose water is actually

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.950 
what it is is the rose water is actually
made<00:01:48.859> from<00:01:49.159> soaking<00:01:49.549> rose<00:01:49.969> petals<00:01:50.600> and

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
made from soaking rose petals and

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.270 
made from soaking rose petals and
distilled<00:01:51.409> water<00:01:51.710> and<00:01:54.460> then<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:56.270> glycerin

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
distilled water and then the glycerin

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.730 
distilled water and then the glycerin
which<00:01:58.280> works<00:01:58.969> as<00:01:59.240> a<00:01:59.270> humectant<00:01:59.780> which<00:02:00.289> means

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
which works as a humectant which means

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.239 
which works as a humectant which means
it<00:02:01.039> will<00:02:01.399> attract<00:02:01.999> water<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:02.810> your<00:02:03.020> hair<00:02:03.439> so<00:02:04.130> it

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:04.249 
it will attract water to your hair so it

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:07.749 
it will attract water to your hair so it
helps<00:02:04.549> to<00:02:04.639> keep<00:02:04.850> your<00:02:05.210> hair<00:02:05.450> hydrated<00:02:06.109> and<00:02:06.759> it

helps to keep your hair hydrated and it

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.580 
helps to keep your hair hydrated and it
does<00:02:07.969> this<00:02:08.149> by<00:02:08.390> drawing<00:02:08.720> in<00:02:08.990> the<00:02:09.110> moisture

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
does this by drawing in the moisture

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.140 
does this by drawing in the moisture
from<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.979> air<00:02:10.009> so<00:02:10.900> with<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.880> awesome<00:02:13.880> smell

also using my aloe vera juice but I kind
of<00:02:29.840> eased<00:02:30.080> up<00:02:30.350> with<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.740> and<00:02:31.430> started<00:02:31.849> using

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.640 
of eased up with it and started using
this<00:02:32.330> because<00:02:32.659> I<00:02:32.780> wanted<00:02:33.049> to<00:02:33.110> see<00:02:33.319> like<00:02:33.349> the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
this because I wanted to see like the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.180 
this because I wanted to see like the
difference<00:02:33.680> in<00:02:34.159> the<00:02:34.250> two<00:02:34.400> products

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
difference in the two products

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.250 
difference in the two products
and<00:02:35.430> definitely<00:02:35.610> say<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.720> rules<00:02:36.960> water

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
and definitely say the rules water

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260 
and definitely say the rules water
glycerin<00:02:37.560> works<00:02:38.070> better<00:02:38.340> for<00:02:38.490> me<00:02:38.760> on<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> new

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
glycerin works better for me on a new

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.510 
glycerin works better for me on a new
hoof<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.660> think<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.960> aloe<00:02:40.110> vera<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.980> basically

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
hoof I think the aloe vera is basically

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.850 
hoof I think the aloe vera is basically
for<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.760> shitty<00:02:42.060> but<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.780> highly<00:02:43.200> recommend<00:02:43.350> the

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
for a shitty but I highly recommend the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.160 
for a shitty but I highly recommend the
rose<00:02:44.040> water<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:45.030> glycerin<00:02:45.300> if<00:02:45.780> you're<00:02:45.900> trying

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
rose water and glycerin if you're trying
