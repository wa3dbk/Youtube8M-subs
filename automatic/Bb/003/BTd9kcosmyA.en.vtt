00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.679 
and the ecosystems of the farm for some
reason<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.380> thought<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.890> would<00:01:50.039> take<00:01:50.280> an<00:01:50.460> hour

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
reason I thought it would take an hour

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:58.099 
reason I thought it would take an hour
to<00:01:51.689> make<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.899> batch<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.200> yogurt<00:01:56.569> instead<00:01:57.569> at<00:01:57.899> 3

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
to make a batch of yogurt instead at 3

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:01.730 
to make a batch of yogurt instead at 3
or<00:01:58.140> 4<00:01:58.490> I've<00:01:59.490> had<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.850> really<00:02:00.060> shift<00:02:00.539> the<00:02:01.530> way<00:02:01.709> I

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
or 4 I've had to really shift the way I

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.940 
or 4 I've had to really shift the way I
work<00:02:02.569> between<00:02:03.569> being<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.959> mother<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
work between being a mother and for the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.150 
work between being a mother and for the
first<00:02:05.189> time<00:02:05.429> and<00:02:06.020> being<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.319> situation<00:02:07.530> I

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
first time and being in this situation I

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.600 
first time and being in this situation I
used<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.759> always<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.090> goals<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.250> be<00:02:11.250> able<00:02:11.489> to

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
used to always have goals and be able to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.300 
used to always have goals and be able to
just<00:02:11.819> kind<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.090> charge<00:02:12.450> through<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.349> get<00:02:14.130> them

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
just kind of charge through and get them

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.120 
just kind of charge through and get them
done<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:14.819> then<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.030> would<00:02:15.299> rest<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:16.410> now<00:02:17.069> we

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
life which by the way is very complex I

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:16.289 
life which by the way is very complex I
see<00:04:09.250> I<00:04:10.650> see<00:04:11.650> promise<00:04:14.819> you<00:04:15.819> know<00:04:15.909> here's<00:04:16.180> a
