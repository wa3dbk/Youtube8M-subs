00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.880
 very good guys welcome to the channel 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.849
 of youtube of the lvbp here I am casting 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.549
 medium roast on xbox one and I'm going to 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.110
 show you this remington r5 that of 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.330
 moment seems to be one of the weapons that 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.680
 more players are using but 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.539
 at least in the games that we have 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.910
 I've been seeing where they've been 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.460
 been taking a little more seriously 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.130
 they've thrown up a lot for being remington 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.929
 r5 and I'm in one of my favorite modes 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.720
 but the one that more than is to look for and rescue 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.820
 it's a good little evolution of searching 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.520
 and destroy in which we can relive 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.970
 our partners in a very system 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.010
 similar to the confirmed low in which 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.680
 good if we confirm in the low then the 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.120
 Uncle will die and yet nevertheless to us 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.590
 the same thing happens to us if we leave our 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.940
 cap and not picked up by a partner 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.370
 we can relive if we do not have to 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.810
 wait for the next round they have placed 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.730
 the bomb there 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.940
 I will not be able to confirm this 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.340
 get out of here so they leave me this if I 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.930
 charge without any problem 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.930
 there will confirm one less 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.630
 confirmed and deactivated here 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.530
 they are deactivated from everything going first round 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.530
 that marked friends 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.439
 but when we play online in search and 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.810
 rescue the limit are four rounds in 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.820
 search and destroy competitive rules and 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.009
 you know that the limit is six rounds in 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.270
 the goal but well I like me 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.659
 quite like this mode to make a 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.580
 little the casual I like because he has a 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.619
 second chance I think this that you 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.299
 It gives a partner to relive you 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.299
 or time to gather a partner 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.830
 this bug good I get the puppy 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.100
 let's get it out 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.950
 that guy quite sure there's lohan 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.850
 all the sheet as you want to rescue me 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.850
 I'll take it ahead 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.470
 eliminating colleagues out there we go 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.670
 they confirm me the low of that round seems 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.810
 what is 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.810
 pretty good 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.170
 I'm not going to make that sheet 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.170
 happen to revive the colleague 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.540
 where are they and how many are missing and nothing 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.440
 scare 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.440
 other forgiveness 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.340
 to stay camps 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.409
 making noise 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.219
 that door moves I guess it's 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.219
 normal to move 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.360
 my dog ​​is there nest is not covering 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.360
 the backs 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.370
 good took advantage that this round is being 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:08.180
 doing a little bored uncle over 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.790
 I take this opportunity to tell you that we have already 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.250
 tested the ps 4 version of ghost and 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.840
 that my dog 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.820
 I do not know if the dog once I've 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.110
 dead and stays alive is alive 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.450
 still for the next round I did it 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.640
 but what we have said we have tested ghosts for 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.010
 ps4 and you have to say that you see a lot 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.080
 better that's why it looks in 1080 then 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.870
 who are we going to lie to my dog ​​not 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.640
 dog is there 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.190
 it looks much better what it is 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.860
 true and it seems that they have already 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.510
 experienced several is that the framerate 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.319
 it's not as stable as 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.239
 in the case of xbox one apparently here 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.739
 in the microsoft console despite 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.390
 that the resolution is quite inferior and 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.430
 let's see a little more teeth 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.640
 saw and maybe less things 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.840
 detailed the frame rate is much more 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.670
 constant in the 60 projects seconds 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.110
 at a competitive level , it will be appreciated 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.940
 quite, but if you are one of those who 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.620
 like the fineness at the graphics level 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.410
 Well, in principle the 64 version 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.900
 better enjoy it a little more 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.150
 they can not see anything 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.830
 reanimated he was always doing 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.290
 this pump plant is going to try 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:20.220
 with the shield of the shields really 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:23.299
 the fattest look in the game less bad 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.299
 what is prohibited 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.070
 pawnshop this battle 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.650
 in this game is not if in others also 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.340
 it happened because I have not played much in my 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.340
 you already know 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.920
 the allies and such do every dose of 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.170
 the areas in plan the pawnshop and 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.900
 we will use that in the end we will not finish 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.920
 inventing will surely be the second 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.780
 but I find it curious that 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.300
 that are already giving out a few 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.630
 give you some tracks of the cars the 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.580
 plan is there on the way help us 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.450
 pretty good through staying the 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.100
 typical sniper payasete as the 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.760
 before then you miss a quiz 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.760
 cover the face 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:14.850
 A pretty drop shott at the ankles 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.840
 well we appear in the next round 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.060
 what's left 7 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.710
 If the situation is solved, the colleague 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.070
 winning 20 that we have two rounds left 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.070
 to win 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.640
 ta ta ta 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.120
 good also say that soon 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.790
 done is here with me in the room 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.430
 I'm going to make a comparison between 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:40.530
 between ps4 ghosts and xbox one 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.720
 so you can see the difference a little 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.270
 I imagine that with our systems of 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.060
 capture will not be as clear as if it 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.130
 you really prove in your teles the 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.470
 truth is that the version of 3 to 4 to 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.120
 first view looks much much better yes 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.620
 it's true that I already tell you the frame rate 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.840
 it's been a little bit sometimes 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.840
 but but well we also want 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.400
 show you that and although xbox one is the 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.650
 official division console of honor by 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.590
 course and it is our favorite console 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.650
 Well, we also want to show you that 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.669
 version for for ps 4 because 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.460
 obviously many of you 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:16.440
 you will make ps4 and it will be the console that you choose 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.580
 and we respect them of course but 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.920
 it seems that this round we will win 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:25.530
 be the distinctive 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:26.790
 play just killing him bolivia is not left 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:32.210
 no one 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:35.640
 3 to 0 or 3 we will see if we do with 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.620
 this map and we leave the video closed 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.930
 Well a pity that I can not teach you 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.560
 not much quality of game you know 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.560
 that I am a little 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.970
 I do what I can try to show you 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.710
 things the best I can but already 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:53.870
 I say the remington at the moment it seems that 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.870
 I 'm not doing anything wrong with her 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.539
 that good 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.090
 I think this weapon is highly recommended 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:02.190
 especially if the pros always use it 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.900
 for something will be certainly in their rifles 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:07.009
 they are using regret too 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:09.469
 so stay tuned to that 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:12.969
 a hit marks being turkey but how does it give me 

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:12.969
 through having smoked 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.479
 I do not know what it is so that at the level of their 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.000
 rifles 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:21.340
 it seems that the m afternoon moment is the one 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.830
 also many of the pros players of 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:27.010
 let's say they are using quite 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:29.050
 so we recommend the r-5 that you try 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:33.280
 tool 95 as long and that of 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:35.139
 metal as his rifle because it seems that already 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.500
 I say the players are they are 

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:39.430
 quite liking those two weapons at 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.150
 final I do not know if I will stay in 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:48.039
 positive were positive and we will win 

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:49.810
 we will finish if we win the round 4 to 0 

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:52.419
 good is not our nothing bad at the end 

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:55.510
 this this fault that also uses that 

00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:58.000
 tool in the re 5 and notice that no 

00:07:55.510 --> 00:08:01.060
 is not going badly we recommend that the 

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.070
 try and good here victory thank you 

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.539
 by watching this video what remained said 

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:06.160
 Attentive to the channel soon we will teach you 

00:08:04.539 --> 00:08:07.720
 that comparative and of course many 

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.530
 more videos that make up the guys 

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.530
 bye bye
