you<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.140> try<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.189> course<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.790> not

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
you can try and of course this is not

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.840 
you can try and of course this is not
the<00:01:54.299> same<00:01:54.930> pattern<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.590> everyone<00:01:56.130> must<00:01:56.399> use

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
the same pattern that everyone must use

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.030 
the same pattern that everyone must use
but<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.689> basic<00:01:58.049> identity<00:01:58.619> if<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.860> don't

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
but it's a basic identity if you don't

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.020 
but it's a basic identity if you don't
already<00:01:59.189> have<00:01:59.340> one
