00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.860
 which otherwise always a little more accurate the operation tests Blackberry Storm Punch 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.829
 been 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:14.399
 The first Baku stands out is that the device affects only 50 grams pretty much 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:15.409
 bulky 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.109
 but still pretty good in the hand 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:23.710
 The display is particularly good at the resolution of 60 pixels by 84 pixels 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.610
 and can represent 65 000 colors 3 2 times 2 5 inches it's also pretty big 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.160
 That in the operation that was also something you can touch with simple 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.110
 nothing changed Sonos can choose 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.350
 You have to make my choice 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.350
 the screen is suppressed 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.770
 something unusual when typing the first 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.530
 that tests Hudson River's qwertz keyboard set up 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.080
 However, the new input works, that is 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.430
 is typing 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.430
 KÃ¼thmann does not sing letters individually 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.570
 HAZ always two letters in a field 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.520
 I have to get used to numbers first degree is therefore that you thanks game 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.210
 Wings of our creative can still turn 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.540
 and 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.700
 thus did not exist much easier and supposedly 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.920
 Could give Eckstein 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.360
 with some exercise, reinforce Thursday with the Torch out 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
 the main lines SR clearly arranged and 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.280
 Kate is also very fussy about serving something for that too is cancer 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.860
 You can feel what is behind with beautiful 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.300
 from practicing them 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.300
 Now you can see the first things just tap 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.660
 without starting directly 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.160
 Sweeney will also be the picture 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.200
 changed motion sensor he received blows
