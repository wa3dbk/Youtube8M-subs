pretty well for us
that's<00:01:38.310> what<00:01:38.550> architecture<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.330> all<00:01:39.540> about

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
that's what architecture is all about

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.080 
that's what architecture is all about
it's<00:01:40.650> about<00:01:40.710> creating<00:01:41.190> buildings<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.850> spaces

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
it's about creating buildings and spaces

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.120 
it's about creating buildings and spaces
that<00:01:42.690> inspire<00:01:42.990> us<00:01:43.670> that<00:01:44.670> help<00:01:44.850> us<00:01:45.000> do<00:01:45.450> our<00:01:45.479> jobs

that<00:01:47.130> bring<00:01:48.000> us<00:01:48.240> together

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
that bring us together

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.360 
that bring us together
and<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.860> become<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.910> best<00:01:51.440> works<00:01:52.440> of<00:01:52.680> art<00:01:52.890> we

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
and that become the best works of art we

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.630 
and that become the best works of art we
can<00:01:53.520> move<00:01:53.729> through<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.900> live<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.430> and<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.550> the

can move through and live in and in the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.850 
can move through and live in and in the
end<00:01:56.790> that's<00:01:56.940> why<00:01:57.180> architecture<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:58.680> be

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
end that's why architecture can be

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.840 
end that's why architecture can be
considered<00:01:59.400> the<00:01:59.970> most<00:02:00.630> democratic<00:02:01.640> too<00:02:02.640> hard

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
considered the most democratic too hard

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.500 
considered the most democratic too hard
for<00:02:03.060> us<00:02:04.550> perhaps<00:02:05.550> when<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.150> had<00:02:06.300> Thomas
