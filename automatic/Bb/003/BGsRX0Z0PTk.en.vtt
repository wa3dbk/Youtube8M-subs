00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.610
 that libe 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.270
 came 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.590
 still a dance game on kinect this 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.869
 this time it's black eyed peas experience 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.310
 which is actually we follow it from michael 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.689
 jackson the experience time is a little 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.369
 the same universe that is to say that we will 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.290
 find a dance game exclusively 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.360
 centered on an artist in this case 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.280
 is a group these two penalties and so 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.320
 this is giving a new dance game 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.270
 signed this time not by the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.379
 ubisoft teams in france but paris 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.000
 nice that a Japanese developer who 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.890
 had pointed out especially for and the ebita 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.390
 jones ellipses so that makes a 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.540
 association that can surprise you will see 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.540
 Why 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.000
 obviously with this kind of dance game 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.530
 devoted exclusively to a single artist 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.330
 you still have to like the artist before 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.620
 everything but when we like black eyed 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.370
 peas and when we know a little it is 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.800
 true that it is a group that has a 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.690
 playlist we will say very eclectic 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.450
 really they covered just about every 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.840
 the commercial styles that came out 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.280
 since 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.890
 since their advent we will say in 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.570
 the 2000s so despite the fact that 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.060
 this is exclusively centered on the 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.160
 group we find many of 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.930
 many tempo many rhythms of 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.600
 many songs it covers we'll say 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.490
 almost essential their career so 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.680
 from the second album actually they were 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.930
 plus r'n'b until elephunk then 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.670
 monkey business and so the last ones 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.320
 gives a little more electro so in all 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.119
 there are 27 songs of course we find 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.289
 all the big standards of the group or 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.140
 found some songs used to 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.580
 this kinect version on the a5 and that's it 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.780
 frankly if we like the group at 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.160
 level of the playlist obviously we're going 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.660
 find all the types we expected 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.660
 and that's obviously a strong point 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.170
 so yes with such a strong license 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.570
 we would have thought that the gameplay 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.390
 would be a little bit put aside it's 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.830
 not the case because nice managed to 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.880
 to take the best of what is 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.650
 actually doing in dance games 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.540
 there are some good little ideas 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.610
 like that come a little stuffed 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.110
 gameplay e.g. as in 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.640
 central we will see the black eyed peas 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.190
 dancing face to face with 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.290
 players and yet there is also the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.180
 silhouette of the avatar that makes it either 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.800
 saying the fifth member of the group who 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.630
 appears from behind what makes it open 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.820
 its offers two mirror perspectives so 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.220
 it allows to better stall this movement of 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.570
 better see the steps executed after that is 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.980
 true that at the level of the gameplay the 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.239
 recognition is relatively 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.220
 tolerant we'll say we're more 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.610
 close to a dance just a dance 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.620
 central 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.720
 despite all that remains correct can not 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.580
 do anything and then not worth 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.290
 are still relatively style and 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.730
 so for those who like games of 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.200
 dance ball gameplay meets this 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.730
 it is sure and then it is also true that we 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.950
 appreciate the little touches on the side of 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.200
 the interface is to say that ben here 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.760
 we have shortcuts that are easy to 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.989
 activate just raise your arm there is 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.790
 a bar that appear next to 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.360
 the screen that allows access a lot 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.010
 faster 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.360
 to the menu of his choice so that compared 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.870
 to other kinect games it's also a 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.370
 strong point 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.200
 and then there is also the whole aspect 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.060
 solo campaign which actually we'll say a 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.860
 big workout word that helps 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.720
 revise every little song not by 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.049
 small step it can unlock 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.910
 bonus 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.230
 so maybe it's not great there yal 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.230
 but there is still everything you need 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.610
 in terms of challenge the challenge of content 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.530
 we will say to occupy a little bit 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.940
 space beyond the purely 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.940
 dancers of the game 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.370
 after comparing other types that are 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.390
 released on the market including just 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.490
 dance and central dance 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.200
 it is true that we are a little bit limited 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.180
 by the movements there are nine movements 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.140
 by chance we do it and we will say 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.520
 that we will review them 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.200
 first time will be an intermission 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.330
 god knows why he has nothing 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.440
 pass we will redo the same moment 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.840
 for the second part of the song 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.950
 so a little robotic appearance 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.010
 in the sequence and choreographies 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.150
 a little bit too automated that swears a 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.160
 little compared to what we experienced with 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.450
 other dance games after that's true 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.860
 that he has possibility his choreographies 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.630
 but then again it will have to go 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.460
 draw on we'll say in all the 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.330
 library of steps that are proposed 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.800
 song by song 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.970
 it's not really an edition 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.440
 choreography where could hide 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.330
 do the movements you want 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.260
 here are selected obviously it is worth 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.340
 better do it the joystick besides 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.640
 because with kinect it takes 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.680
 take ages 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.020
 but here are some small aspects 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.670
 like that that make me say that this is a 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.110
 good dancing game when you love the black 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.300
 eyed peas but after it is perhaps 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.690
 not as complete as other games 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.690
 provided on the green 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.620
 2 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.439
 in conclusion we expected a game a 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.210
 little bit easy that would be his 

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:26.340
 popularity of artists and despite everything 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.439
 well not only here is the playlist is 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.969
 complete and covers the whole story well 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:30.659
 the discography of black eyed peas but 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:32.580
 at the same time there is still a 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:33.900
 gameplay that is pretty square anyway 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.569
 square enough to hold long 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.620
 fans of games awake so that's it 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:38.849
 we love dance games and if we like 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.479
 the artists I think it's worth 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.650
 really blow 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.870
 a little bit like michael 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.639
 jackson well here we go we'll dance on 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.969
 the black eyed peas and for Christmas we know 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.969
 no refusal 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.070
 no
