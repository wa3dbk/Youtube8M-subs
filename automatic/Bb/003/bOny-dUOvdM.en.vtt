pretty common next you're going to need
a<00:00:31.679> flashlight<00:00:32.099> where<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.000> can<00:00:33.180> actually

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
a flashlight where you can actually

remove the LEDs inside this one you

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.850 
remove the LEDs inside this one you
can't<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.170> going<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.350> be<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> little<00:00:37.739> more

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
can't so it's going to be a little more

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.920 
can't so it's going to be a little more
tricky<00:00:38.040> we're<00:00:38.790> also<00:00:38.910> going<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.210> need<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.420> simple

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
tricky we're also going to need a simple

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.080 
tricky we're also going to need a simple
on/off<00:00:40.140> switch<00:00:40.620> if<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.460> really<00:00:41.730> want<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.059> can

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
on/off switch if you really want you can

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.340 
on/off switch if you really want you can
use<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.540> one<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.690> comes<00:00:42.989> with<00:00:43.079> this

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
use the one that comes with this

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.470 
use the one that comes with this
flashlight<00:00:43.620> also<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.700> three<00:00:45.000> triple-a

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
flashlight also the three triple-a

flashlight some solder a soldering iron

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.680 
flashlight some solder a soldering iron
and<00:00:49.320> some<00:00:50.010> wire<00:00:50.219> oh<00:00:50.489> yeah<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.239> some<00:00:51.300> hot<00:00:51.570> glue

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
and some wire oh yeah and some hot glue

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.680 
and some wire oh yeah and some hot glue
let's<00:00:52.410> get<00:00:52.620> started<00:00:53.059> first<00:00:54.059> step<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.510> to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
let's get started first step is to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.510 
let's get started first step is to
remove<00:00:54.809> all<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.140> LEDs<00:00:55.620> from<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.039> flashlight

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
remove all the LEDs from the flashlight

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.279 
remove all the LEDs from the flashlight
housing<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.030> had<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.360> cut<00:00:57.570> into<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> housing<00:00:58.199> a

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
housing I had to cut into the housing a

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.930 
housing I had to cut into the housing a
little<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.620> get<00:00:58.770> them<00:00:58.920> all<00:00:59.070> out<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.489> that's<00:00:59.760> why

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
little to get them all out so that's why

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.369 
little to get them all out so that's why
it's<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.149> better<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.570> have<00:01:00.780> one<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.109> fit<00:01:01.289> on

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
it's just better to have one that fit on

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.889 
it's just better to have one that fit on
screw<00:01:01.680> next<00:01:02.609> take<00:01:02.910> two<00:01:03.120> wires<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.750> your

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
screw next take two wires and your

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.840 
screw next take two wires and your
battery<00:01:04.080> pack<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.769> connect<00:01:05.189> one<00:01:05.430> wire<00:01:05.460> to

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850

each<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> ends<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.229> use<00:01:07.380> tape<00:01:07.650> but

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
each of the ends you can use tape but

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.460 
each of the ends you can use tape but
solder<00:01:08.310> will<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> much<00:01:08.880> stronger<00:01:09.090> hold<00:01:09.510> once

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
solder will be a much stronger hold once

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.710 
solder will be a much stronger hold once
you've<00:01:10.619> made<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> soldered<00:01:11.220> connections<00:01:11.720> you

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
you've made the soldered connections you

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.060 
you've made the soldered connections you
can<00:01:12.810> go<00:01:12.960> ahead<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.409> take<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.860> wires

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
can go ahead and take one of the wires

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.890 
can go ahead and take one of the wires
and<00:01:14.340> connect<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.939> one<00:01:15.180> end<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.479> your<00:01:15.540> switch

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
and connect it to one end of your switch

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.679 
and connect it to one end of your switch

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.990 
coming off the other end of the battery
gets<00:01:34.950> attached<00:01:35.340> right<00:01:35.579> here

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
gets attached right here

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.940 
gets attached right here
if<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.540> flashlight<00:01:36.990> lights<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.590> means<00:01:37.829> a

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
if the flashlight lights up that means a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.649 
if the flashlight lights up that means a
polarity<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.400> correct<00:01:38.430> if<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.090> doesn't<00:01:39.450> just

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
polarity is correct if it doesn't just

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.630 
polarity is correct if it doesn't just
reverse<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> wires<00:01:40.290> okay<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.220> last<00:01:41.250> step

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
reverse the wires okay so the last step

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.370 
reverse the wires okay so the last step
is<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.880> connect<00:01:42.240> one<00:01:42.509> wire<00:01:42.540> coming<00:01:43.020> off<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
is to connect one wire coming off the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.319 
is to connect one wire coming off the
LED<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> switch<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.790> will<00:01:45.030> complete<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
LED to the switch this will complete the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.789 
LED to the switch this will complete the
circuit<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.049> should<00:01:46.229> light<00:01:46.439> up<00:01:46.470> when<00:01:46.770> you

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
circuit and it should light up when you

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:58.240 
circuit and it should light up when you
flip<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.159> switch

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.580 

now<00:01:58.820> all<00:01:59.060> that's<00:01:59.240> left<00:01:59.510> is<00:01:59.690> to<00:01:59.900> glue<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.230> led

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
now all that's left is to glue the led

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.430 
now all that's left is to glue the led
to<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:00.950> center<00:02:01.220> of<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.400> palm<00:02:01.580> and<00:02:02.230> also<00:02:03.230> glue

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
to the center of the palm and also glue

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.230 
to the center of the palm and also glue
on<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.680> switch<00:02:03.890> in<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.190> battery<00:02:04.520> like<00:02:05.000> this

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
on the switch in the battery like this

on the switch in the battery like this
it's<00:02:06.170> a<00:02:06.320> good<00:02:06.440> idea<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.800> position<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.460> switch<00:02:07.670> in

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
it's a good idea to position a switch in

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.030 
it's a good idea to position a switch in
a<00:02:08.000> place<00:02:08.210> your<00:02:08.479> thumb<00:02:08.690> can<00:02:08.869> reach<00:02:09.080> this<00:02:09.800> way

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
a place your thumb can reach this way
