worries about hi he's just a really nice

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.970 
worries about hi he's just a really nice
player<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:05.840> it's<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:05.989> play<00:03:06.140> that's<00:03:06.350> managed<00:03:06.739> to

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
player and it's a play that's managed to

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.970 
player and it's a play that's managed to
come<00:03:07.550> across<00:03:07.580> from<00:03:08.390> wing<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:09.200> strike<00:03:09.560> really

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
come across from wing to strike really

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.440 
come across from wing to strike really
well<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.430> I<00:03:10.520> think<00:03:10.550> he'd<00:03:10.880> make<00:03:11.000> an<00:03:11.180> even

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
well and I think he'd make an even

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.229 
well and I think he'd make an even
better<00:03:11.720> centre<00:03:12.230> forward<00:03:12.730> or<00:03:13.730> maybe<00:03:13.940> even<00:03:14.030> a

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
better centre forward or maybe even a

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.150 
better centre forward or maybe even a
wide<00:03:14.450> coming<00:03:14.810> like<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:14.959> four<00:03:15.290> triple<00:03:15.680> two<00:03:15.830> lads

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
wide coming like a four triple two lads
