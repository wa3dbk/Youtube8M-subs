three<00:00:07.839> so<00:00:08.080> obviously<00:00:08.280> wrc2<00:00:09.280> last<00:00:09.879> year<00:00:10.090> moved

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360 
three so obviously wrc2 last year moved

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.510 
three so obviously wrc2 last year moved
on<00:00:10.600> a<00:00:10.840> fair<00:00:11.350> bit<00:00:11.469> from<00:00:11.650> the<00:00:11.740> first<00:00:11.949> one<00:00:12.160> but<00:00:12.340> I'm

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:12.520 
on a fair bit from the first one but I'm

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.939 
on a fair bit from the first one but I'm
fortunate<00:00:12.879> on<00:00:13.090> its<00:00:13.209> release<00:00:13.480> states<00:00:13.779> and<00:00:14.619> the

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:14.949 
fortunate on its release states and the

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:16.710 
fortunate on its release states and the
coastal<00:00:15.219> sections<00:00:15.400> were<00:00:15.820> improving<00:00:16.270> but

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
coastal sections were improving but

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.810 
coastal sections were improving but
graphically<00:00:17.170> it<00:00:17.650> still<00:00:17.949> had<00:00:18.130> some<00:00:18.310> way<00:00:18.490> to<00:00:18.550> go

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
graphically it still had some way to go

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.310 
graphically it still had some way to go
there's<00:00:19.090> no<00:00:19.180> doubt<00:00:19.390> about<00:00:19.420> it<00:00:19.870> this<00:00:19.990> year<00:00:20.200> it

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
there's no doubt about it this year it

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.720 
there's no doubt about it this year it
seems<00:00:20.530> they<00:00:20.680> are<00:00:20.710> working<00:00:21.190> more<00:00:21.340> on<00:00:21.400> sort<00:00:21.700> of

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
seems they are working more on sort of

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.460 
seems they are working more on sort of
the<00:00:21.820> foliage<00:00:22.210> and<00:00:22.450> detail<00:00:22.870> from<00:00:23.080> these<00:00:23.260> very

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
the foliage and detail from these very

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.140 
the foliage and detail from these very
early<00:00:23.830> shots<00:00:24.070> working<00:00:24.550> progress<00:00:24.760> at<00:00:25.090> the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
early shots working progress at the

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.960 
early shots working progress at the
moment<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:26.500> of<00:00:26.680> course<00:00:26.740> once<00:00:27.220> we<00:00:27.430> do<00:00:27.700> get<00:00:27.850> the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
moment and of course once we do get the

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.279 
moment and of course once we do get the
opportunity<00:00:28.000> for<00:00:28.570> a<00:00:28.600> hands-on<00:00:28.960> I'll<00:00:29.170> be

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
opportunity for a hands-on I'll be

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.710 
opportunity for a hands-on I'll be
testing<00:00:29.500> it<00:00:29.710> later<00:00:29.920> in<00:00:30.100> the<00:00:30.190> year<00:00:30.310> I<00:00:30.720> look

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
testing it later in the year I look

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.119 
testing it later in the year I look
forward<00:00:31.930> to<00:00:32.050> probably<00:00:32.379> trying<00:00:32.649> it<00:00:32.770> sometime

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
forward to probably trying it sometime

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.489 
forward to probably trying it sometime
around<00:00:33.250> july<00:00:33.670> august<00:00:33.879> time<00:00:34.300> i<00:00:34.329> expect<00:00:34.870> but<00:00:35.379> as

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:35.499 
around july august time i expect but as

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:37.709 
around july august time i expect but as
we<00:00:35.620> can<00:00:35.739> see<00:00:35.800> they're<00:00:36.219> well<00:00:36.460> on<00:00:36.609> the<00:00:37.329> way<00:00:37.690> to

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
we can see they're well on the way to

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.899 
we can see they're well on the way to
developing<00:00:38.499> it<00:00:38.649> and<00:00:38.829> moving<00:00:39.489> on<00:00:39.609> again<00:00:39.699> this

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:39.909 
developing it and moving on again this

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:40.889 
developing it and moving on again this
year<00:00:39.969> so<00:00:40.239> we<00:00:40.329> look<00:00:40.449> forward<00:00:40.629> to<00:00:40.809> more

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
year so we look forward to more

actually<00:01:07.180> one<00:01:07.299> the<00:01:07.360> circuits<00:01:07.719> that<00:01:07.780> look

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
actually one the circuits that look

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.359 
actually one the circuits that look
pretty<00:01:08.170> good<00:01:08.350> last<00:01:08.469> time<00:01:08.680> it<00:01:08.920> has<00:01:09.039> to<00:01:09.100> be<00:01:09.189> said

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
pretty good last time it has to be said

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.700 
pretty good last time it has to be said
the<00:01:09.490> graphics<00:01:09.850> improved<00:01:10.000> I<00:01:10.750> thought<00:01:11.409> a<00:01:11.469> fair

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
the graphics improved I thought a fair

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.289 
the graphics improved I thought a fair
bit<00:01:11.890> in<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.159> last<00:01:12.189> version<00:01:12.579> compared<00:01:13.180> two

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
bit in the last version compared two

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.590 
bit in the last version compared two
versions<00:01:13.659> before<00:01:13.780> but<00:01:15.149> envelope<00:01:16.149> was<00:01:16.479> an

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
versions before but envelope was an

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.440 
versions before but envelope was an
excellent<00:01:16.869> sort<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.369> circuit<00:01:18.369> but<00:01:18.670> some<00:01:19.390> of

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
excellent sort of circuit but some of

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.550 
excellent sort of circuit but some of
the<00:01:19.539> other<00:01:19.630> circuits<00:01:20.079> were<00:01:20.229> a<00:01:20.289> little<00:01:20.409> bit

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
the other circuits were a little bit

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.560 
the other circuits were a little bit
rough<00:01:20.740> around<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:21.039> edges<00:01:21.130> I<00:01:21.579> do<00:01:21.820> remember<00:01:22.149> the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
rough around the edges I do remember the

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.840 
rough around the edges I do remember the
Himalayas<00:01:23.439> mountain<00:01:23.890> range<00:01:24.130> that<00:01:24.250> surrounded

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
Himalayas mountain range that surrounded

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.340 
Himalayas mountain range that surrounded
silverstone<00:01:25.329> race<00:01:25.359> track<00:01:25.780> which<00:01:26.020> looked<00:01:26.259> a

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
silverstone race track which looked a

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.050 
silverstone race track which looked a
little<00:01:26.500> bit<00:01:26.619> dodgy<00:01:26.799> some<00:01:27.490> tracks<00:01:27.759> such<00:01:28.030> as

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
little bit dodgy some tracks such as

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.690 
little bit dodgy some tracks such as
Emaline<00:01:29.020> Monza<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:29.920> valencia<00:01:30.369> actually

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
Emaline Monza and valencia actually

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.459 
Emaline Monza and valencia actually
looked<00:01:30.880> pretty<00:01:30.939> good<00:01:31.329> so<00:01:31.689> there<00:01:32.200> are<00:01:32.289> a<00:01:32.320> lot<00:01:32.439> of

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
looked pretty good so there are a lot of

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.740 
looked pretty good so there are a lot of
fun<00:01:32.710> to<00:01:32.920> ride<00:01:33.100> but<00:01:33.130> again<00:01:34.090> it<00:01:34.210> just<00:01:34.240> depends<00:01:34.659> on

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
fun to ride but again it just depends on

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.719 
fun to ride but again it just depends on
the<00:01:34.840> handling<00:01:35.200> this<00:01:35.320> year<00:01:35.560> and<00:01:35.890> you<00:01:36.460> know<00:01:36.579> what

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
the handling this year and you know what

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.609 
the handling this year and you know what
the<00:01:36.789> differences<00:01:37.179> are<00:01:37.240> going<00:01:37.450> to<00:01:37.509> be<00:01:37.630> I<00:01:37.659> don't

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
the differences are going to be I don't

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:39.749 
the differences are going to be I don't
have<00:01:38.770> a<00:01:38.799> fact<00:01:39.070> sheet<00:01:39.280> so<00:01:39.429> I<00:01:39.460> couldn't<00:01:39.670> really

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
have a fact sheet so I couldn't really

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.069 
have a fact sheet so I couldn't really
go<00:01:40.000> through<00:01:40.240> what<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.479> difference<00:01:40.719> is<00:01:40.810> going

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
go through what the difference is going

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.020 
go through what the difference is going
to<00:01:41.170> be<00:01:41.259> on<00:01:41.469> the<00:01:41.590> surface<00:01:42.009> looking<00:01:42.310> at<00:01:42.429> it<00:01:42.579> not<00:01:43.000> a

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
to be on the surface looking at it not a

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.279 
to be on the surface looking at it not a
lot<00:01:43.240> really<00:01:43.570> is<00:01:43.659> you<00:01:43.780> can<00:01:43.899> see<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.020> slight

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
lot really is you can see a slight

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:45.660 
lot really is you can see a slight
improvement<00:01:44.740> in<00:01:44.799> graphics<00:01:45.189> obviously<00:01:45.549> the

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
improvement in graphics obviously the

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.429 
improvement in graphics obviously the
updated<00:01:46.149> teams<00:01:46.420> and<00:01:46.630> bikers<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.109> stuff<00:01:47.289> like

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
updated teams and bikers and stuff like

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.260 
updated teams and bikers and stuff like
that<00:01:47.499> but<00:01:48.130> I<00:01:48.219> don't<00:01:48.520> think<00:01:48.670> it's<00:01:48.789> necessarily

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
that but I don't think it's necessarily

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.910 
that but I don't think it's necessarily
going<00:01:49.479> to<00:01:49.570> be<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.689> huge<00:01:49.929> leap<00:01:50.200> forward<00:01:50.229> compared

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
going to be a huge leap forward compared

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.700 
going to be a huge leap forward compared
to<00:01:51.060> previous<00:01:52.060> versions<00:01:52.090> as<00:01:52.659> far<00:01:52.840> as<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.530> look

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
to previous versions as far as the look

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.160 
to previous versions as far as the look
and<00:01:53.890> feel<00:01:54.039> is<00:01:54.249> concerned<00:01:54.749> either<00:01:55.749> way<00:01:55.990> that

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
and feel is concerned either way that

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.529 
and feel is concerned either way that

on a fair bit and weather conditions and
everything<00:02:44.299> else<00:02:44.450> but<00:02:44.689> that's<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.349> for

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
everything else but that's it for
