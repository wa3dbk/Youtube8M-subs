00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
but what I do is I come over here I jump

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.130 
but what I do is I come over here I jump
on<00:01:31.920> top<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.549> light<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.450> when<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.840> get<00:01:34.020> on

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
on top of this light and when I get on

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.480 
on top of this light and when I get on
top<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.530> slide<00:01:34.740> all<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.009> do<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.250> look

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
top of the slide all I do is look

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.310 
top of the slide all I do is look
directly<00:01:35.759> down<00:01:35.970> here<00:01:36.479> they're<00:01:37.079> already

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
directly down here they're already

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.550 
directly down here they're already
coming<00:01:37.619> out<00:01:37.860> give<00:01:38.189> them<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.369> second<00:01:38.700> Bam<00:01:38.970> Bam

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.340 
coming out give them a second Bam Bam
and<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.650> think<00:01:41.490> that's<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.850> what<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.630> do<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.930> I'll

and I think that's it what I do is I'll

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.780 
and I think that's it what I do is I'll
just<00:01:43.560> throw<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> grenade<00:01:43.860> kind<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.549> gives<00:01:44.700> you

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
just throw a grenade kind of gives you

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.280 
just throw a grenade kind of gives you
like<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> time<00:01:45.210> or<00:01:45.540> when<00:01:45.899> they're<00:01:46.079> going<00:01:46.229> to

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290

better luck there but again it's just

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.280 
better luck there but again it's just
random<00:03:39.040> generated<00:03:39.700> drops<00:03:40.300> so<00:03:40.720> it's<00:03:40.900> not<00:03:41.050> like

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
random generated drops so it's not like

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.979 
random generated drops so it's not like
I<00:03:41.320> said<00:03:41.739> like<00:03:41.770> kills<00:03:42.340> not<00:03:42.880> set<00:03:43.150> enemies<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:43.900> I
