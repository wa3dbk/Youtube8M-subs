00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.130
 how a computer works 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.410
 I don't know if you're aware of them but all of them 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.360
 these are also yours 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.070
 refrigerator could be a computer 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.660
 this does not mean that yours 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.290
 refrigerator starts at 3 am a 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.330
 play baby by justin bieber ad 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.190
 example refrigerators with advanced systems 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.540
 can have processors inside 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.110
 let's see what it is made of 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.110
 a computer 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.520
 the motherboard is the mother of the 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.660
 computer and connects all the peripherals 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.290
 to the motherboard must be 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.110
 connected other ram processor 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.520
 peripherals such as expansion cards 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.170
 the sound card that can also be 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.280
 integrated and the video card that can 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.280
 also be integrated 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.580
 the motherboard tracks that 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:25.840
 connect cpu ram video card are 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:27.610
 called low the ram store the 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.560
 subsequent instructions that the processor 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.910
 will have to run in their memory 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.910
 being really fast 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.390
 the processor will execute the instructions it 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.009
 are contained in the cache which is one 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.719
 faster and smaller memory again 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.820
 of the ram that contains the instructions 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:52.189
 pass a sound card from the ram yes 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.310
 deals with converting big or signals 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:02:02.479
 digital in analog audio signals for 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:04.369
 be sent to an amplifier la 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.890
 video card takes care of converting bits 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.660
 or digital signals teach the 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.080
 logics ready to be sent to 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.080
 monitor 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.630
 from today soy big lines as it is made 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.640
 your computer 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.710
 if you liked the video I remember you 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.750
 put a nice like and support me 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.750
 hello everyone from alessandra channel
