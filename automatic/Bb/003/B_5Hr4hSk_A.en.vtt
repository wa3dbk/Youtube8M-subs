00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.670
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:20.390
 They are 1 liter and a half of water 2 lemons 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:22.130
 whole and 80 grams of sugar so that 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.730
 the sugar dissolves better let's 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.800
 make a symmetrical syrup 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.320
 The first thing we will do is mix the 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.210
 80 grams of sugar with 40 water 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.740
 we heat it on a plate about two 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.909
 minutes until the sugar is 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.909
 completely dissolved 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.000
 once it is ready we remove and leave 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.000

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.900

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.070

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:03.009

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:05.140
 We cut a few pieces of skin and 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.050
 finish we mix everything in a jar 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.160
