to<00:02:25.490> one<00:02:26.490> hand<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.970> it's<00:02:27.210> a<00:02:27.330> trick<00:02:27.750> one-handed

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.550 

cable<00:02:46.340> is<00:02:46.490> very<00:02:46.790> slack<00:02:47.390> we<00:02:48.050> should<00:02:48.200> be<00:02:48.290> able<00:02:48.380> to

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
cable is very slack we should be able to

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.970 
cable is very slack we should be able to
lift<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:48.830> up<00:02:48.950> which<00:02:49.160> I<00:02:49.280> can<00:02:49.520> do<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:51.410> slide<00:02:51.830> it

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
lift it up which I can do and slide it

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:00.100 
lift it up which I can do and slide it
out

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.449 

see<00:03:00.650> if<00:03:00.710> I<00:03:00.800> can<00:03:00.890> get<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.100> camera

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
see if I can get the camera

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.520 
see if I can get the camera
over<00:03:03.090> here

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
over here

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.560 
over here
before<00:03:05.100> you<00:03:05.310> do<00:03:05.430> mean<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.760> be<00:03:05.850> careful<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.360> we

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
before you do mean to be careful that we

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.240 
before you do mean to be careful that we
don't<00:03:06.750> lose<00:03:07.050> these<00:03:07.400> brass<00:03:09.620> fresh<00:03:10.620> grass

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
don't lose these brass fresh grass

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.710 
don't lose these brass fresh grass
bushes<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:12.390> table<00:03:12.810> itself<00:03:13.850> folks<00:03:14.850> this<00:03:15.390> cable

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
bushes the table itself folks this cable

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.350 
bushes the table itself folks this cable
itself<00:03:16.020> is<00:03:16.290> not<00:03:16.860> directly<00:03:17.430> connected<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:18.060> this

itself is not directly connected to this
little<00:03:18.690> brass<00:03:18.930> bushing<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:19.740> in<00:03:20.610> lifting<00:03:21.150> it

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
little brass bushing so in lifting it

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.680 
little brass bushing so in lifting it
right<00:03:22.770> I<00:03:23.010> lift<00:03:23.490> it<00:03:24.680> one-handed<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.880> then<00:03:27.360> this

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
right I lift it one-handed and then this

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.570 
right I lift it one-handed and then this
comes<00:03:27.959> out<00:03:28.140> put<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.470> finger<00:03:28.709> over<00:03:29.130> this<00:03:29.280> and

comes out put a finger over this and

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.980 
comes out put a finger over this and
just<00:03:29.700> walk<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.420> walk<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.590> cable<00:03:31.950> out<00:03:32.990> careful

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
just walk the walk the cable out careful

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.680 
just walk the walk the cable out careful
of<00:03:34.080> that<00:03:34.110> brass<00:03:34.580> that<00:03:35.580> brass<00:03:35.940> bushing<00:03:36.240> it<00:03:36.540> will

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
of that brass that brass bushing it will

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.740 
of that brass that brass bushing it will
want<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.110> run<00:03:37.350> away<00:03:37.500> on<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.160> if<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.370> does

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
want to run away on you and if it does

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.300 
want to run away on you and if it does
you're<00:03:39.750> kind<00:03:40.110> of<00:03:40.260> bumming<00:03:40.650> out<00:03:40.830> a<00:03:40.860> little<00:03:41.100> bit

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
you're kind of bumming out a little bit

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.699 
you're kind of bumming out a little bit
okay<00:03:41.840> but<00:03:42.840> as<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:43.020> can<00:03:43.140> see<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.530> brass

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
okay but as you can see the brass

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.600 
okay but as you can see the brass
bushing<00:03:44.070> is<00:03:44.459> not<00:03:45.860> connected<00:03:46.860> to<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:47.160> see<00:03:47.520> it

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
bushing is not connected to it see it

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.390 
bushing is not connected to it see it
comes<00:03:47.850> right<00:03:47.940> away<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:48.600> so<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:49.770> also<00:03:50.040> comes

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
comes right away and so it also comes

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.800 
comes right away and so it also comes
right<00:03:50.640> off<00:03:50.670> okay

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
right off okay

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.790 
right off okay
we<00:03:52.350> don't<00:03:52.500> want<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.709> lose<00:03:52.830> that<00:03:54.530> but<00:03:55.530> we<00:03:55.650> do

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
we don't want to lose that but we do

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.740 
we don't want to lose that but we do
need<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.070> remove<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.670> we<00:03:57.060> do<00:03:57.180> need<00:03:57.360> to<00:03:57.390> remove

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
it okay here it comes it's out I slide

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.330 
it okay here it comes it's out I slide
that<00:04:01.830> brass<00:04:03.080> that<00:04:04.080> brass<00:04:04.410> piece<00:04:04.800> down<00:04:05.280> a

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
that brass that brass piece down a

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.860 
that brass that brass piece down a
little<00:04:05.700> bit<00:04:05.820> but<00:04:06.000> you<00:04:06.090> can<00:04:06.120> see<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.480> throttle

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
little bit but you can see the throttle

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.750 
little bit but you can see the throttle
has<00:04:07.020> come<00:04:07.200> loose<00:04:08.570> slide<00:04:09.570> this<00:04:09.840> brass<00:04:10.140> down<00:04:10.760> and

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
has come loose slide this brass down and

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.050 
has come loose slide this brass down and
get<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.120> off

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
get it off

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.810 
get it off
and<00:04:14.540> we're<00:04:14.690> good<00:04:14.810> to<00:04:14.930> go<00:04:15.260> okay<00:04:15.680> throttle<00:04:16.489> and

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
and we're good to go okay throttle and

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.340 
and we're good to go okay throttle and
idle<00:04:17.540> cables<00:04:17.959> are<00:04:18.139> now<00:04:18.350> removed<00:04:18.799> and<00:04:19.160> the<00:04:20.350> the

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
idle cables are now removed and the the

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.180 
idle cables are now removed and the the
throttles<00:04:21.739> off

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
throttles off

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.170 
throttles off
I<00:04:22.330> found<00:04:23.330> that<00:04:23.660> pulling<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:24.790> wiring<00:04:25.790> harness

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
I found that pulling the wiring harness

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.360 
I found that pulling the wiring harness
to<00:04:26.630> notice<00:04:26.990> it<00:04:27.139> does<00:04:27.530> it<00:04:27.740> comes<00:04:28.010> out<00:04:28.190> of<00:04:28.220> the

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
to notice it does it comes out of the

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.070 
to notice it does it comes out of the
bars<00:04:28.550> this<00:04:28.940> sends<00:04:29.270> down<00:04:29.389> through<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:29.750> front

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
bars this sends down through the front

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.040 
bars this sends down through the front
of<00:04:30.230> the<00:04:30.320> triple<00:04:30.680> tree<00:04:30.950> and<00:04:31.160> then<00:04:31.580> back<00:04:31.820> around

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
of the triple tree and then back around

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.320 
of the triple tree and then back around
what<00:04:33.050> to<00:04:33.169> do<00:04:33.290> is<00:04:33.580> take<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.700> wiring<00:04:34.880> harness

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
what to do is take the wiring harness

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.629 
what to do is take the wiring harness
pull<00:04:35.600> it<00:04:35.720> all<00:04:36.230> through<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:36.650> front<00:04:36.919> okay<00:04:37.430> this

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
pull it all through the front okay this

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:38.860 
pull it all through the front okay this
is<00:04:37.760> the<00:04:37.850> right<00:04:38.000> side<00:04:38.240> I've<00:04:38.419> already<00:04:38.690> pulled

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
is the right side I've already pulled

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.590 
is the right side I've already pulled
the<00:04:38.990> left<00:04:39.169> side<00:04:39.380> then<00:04:40.010> take<00:04:40.340> it<00:04:40.550> and<00:04:40.730> push<00:04:41.570> it

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
the left side then take it and push it

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.890 
the left side then take it and push it
through<00:04:42.169> to<00:04:42.950> the<00:04:42.980> back<00:04:43.310> so<00:04:43.970> that<00:04:44.000> it<00:04:44.270> pulls<00:04:44.540> out

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
through to the back so that it pulls out

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.280 
through to the back so that it pulls out
the<00:04:45.490> backside<00:04:46.490> of<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:46.970> bar<00:04:47.210> and<00:04:47.480> what<00:04:48.140> we'll

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
the backside of the bar and what we'll

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.360 
the backside of the bar and what we'll
find<00:04:48.320> is<00:04:48.710> that<00:04:48.740> this<00:04:49.490> this<00:04:50.390> up<00:04:50.660> motion<00:04:51.370> into

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
find is that this this up motion into

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.240 
find is that this this up motion into
the<00:04:52.520> bar<00:04:52.730> is<00:04:53.060> easier<00:04:53.870> than<00:04:54.530> actually<00:04:54.740> trying

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
the bar is easier than actually trying

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.340 
the bar is easier than actually trying
to<00:04:55.669> bend<00:04:55.970> the<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:58.340> harness<00:04:58.730> in<00:04:59.690> this<00:05:00.080> way

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
to bend the the the harness in this way

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.380 
to bend the the the harness in this way
and<00:05:00.620> out<00:05:00.890> that's<00:05:01.520> pulled<00:05:01.850> back<00:05:02.030> through<00:05:02.210> it's

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
and out that's pulled back through it's

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.150 
and out that's pulled back through it's
more<00:05:02.600> of<00:05:02.660> a<00:05:02.750> straight<00:05:03.080> up<00:05:03.290> and<00:05:03.590> it<00:05:03.680> actually

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
more of a straight up and it actually

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.940 
more of a straight up and it actually
will<00:05:04.910> come<00:05:05.150> out<00:05:05.360> a<00:05:05.600> little<00:05:06.050> easier<00:05:06.410> than

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
will come out a little easier than

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.830 
will come out a little easier than
trying<00:05:07.520> to<00:05:07.669> go<00:05:07.850> in<00:05:08.030> through<00:05:08.300> the<00:05:08.390> front<00:05:08.600> and

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
trying to go in through the front and

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.810 
trying to go in through the front and
out<00:05:08.960> so<00:05:09.290> pull<00:05:09.470> it<00:05:09.560> back<00:05:09.770> through<00:05:10.160> alright<00:05:10.640> what

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
out so pull it back through alright what

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.360 
out so pull it back through alright what
I'm<00:05:10.910> doing<00:05:11.210> here<00:05:11.450> is<00:05:11.510> pulling<00:05:12.139> the<00:05:13.010> black

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
I'm doing here is pulling the black

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.030 
I'm doing here is pulling the black
harness<00:05:13.940> now<00:05:14.210> through<00:05:15.020> the<00:05:15.139> bars<00:05:15.380> to<00:05:15.740> remove

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
harness now through the bars to remove

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.219 
harness now through the bars to remove
them<00:05:16.280> from<00:05:16.490> the<00:05:16.669> bars<00:05:16.910> and<00:05:17.330> at<00:05:17.720> the<00:05:17.810> same<00:05:17.960> time

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
them from the bars and at the same time

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.530 
them from the bars and at the same time
I've<00:05:18.500> attached<00:05:18.890> a<00:05:19.130> pull<00:05:19.340> cable<00:05:19.820> a<00:05:19.940> pull<00:05:20.270> line

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
I've attached a pull cable a pull line

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.920 
I've attached a pull cable a pull line
to<00:05:21.350> that<00:05:21.500> harness<00:05:22.030> such<00:05:23.030> that<00:05:23.330> and<00:05:23.540> that's<00:05:23.720> the

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
to that harness such that and that's the

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.770 
to that harness such that and that's the
end<00:05:24.110> of<00:05:24.229> the<00:05:24.410> the<00:05:24.950> bulk<00:05:25.160> of<00:05:25.370> the<00:05:25.610> the<00:05:26.419> tie<00:05:26.600> up

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
end of the the bulk of the the tie up

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.080 
end of the the bulk of the the tie up
there<00:05:26.960> of<00:05:27.080> the<00:05:27.169> wires<00:05:27.380> I<00:05:27.710> figured<00:05:28.520> having<00:05:28.790> the

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
there of the wires I figured having the

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.969 
there of the wires I figured having the
the<00:05:29.479> pull<00:05:29.690> line<00:05:29.900> there<00:05:30.140> would<00:05:30.470> be<00:05:30.590> easy<00:05:30.800> to

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
the pull line there would be easy to

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:33.850 
the pull line there would be easy to
draw<00:05:31.910> it<00:05:32.060> through<00:05:32.630> the<00:05:32.810> new<00:05:32.930> bars<00:05:33.200> and<00:05:33.560> then

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
draw it through the new bars and then

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.640 
draw it through the new bars and then
pull<00:05:34.640> the<00:05:35.120> that<00:05:35.479> harness<00:05:35.990> back<00:05:36.229> through<00:05:36.530> the

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
pull the that harness back through the

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.130 
pull the that harness back through the
new<00:05:36.770> bars<00:05:37.010> but<00:05:37.280> that<00:05:37.400> proved<00:05:37.700> unnecessary<00:05:38.140> the

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
new bars but that proved unnecessary the

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.219 
new bars but that proved unnecessary the
reason<00:05:39.500> is<00:05:39.710> because<00:05:40.340> of<00:05:40.970> we're<00:05:41.810> going<00:05:41.930> to

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
reason is because of we're going to

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.190 
reason is because of we're going to
relocate<00:05:42.890> the<00:05:43.490> directional<00:05:44.090> lights<00:05:44.330> and<00:05:44.630> the

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
relocate the directional lights and the

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.800 
relocate the directional lights and the
directional<00:05:45.740> light<00:05:45.800> wires<00:05:46.490> are<00:05:46.970> inside<00:05:47.780> of

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
directional light wires are inside of

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.040 
directional light wires are inside of
that<00:05:48.470> black<00:05:49.010> harness<00:05:49.700> and<00:05:49.940> needed<00:05:50.780> to<00:05:50.900> be

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
that black harness and needed to be

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.070 
that black harness and needed to be
separated<00:05:51.710> any<00:05:51.979> way<00:05:52.280> to<00:05:53.120> to<00:05:53.840> do<00:05:53.960> the

separated any way to to do the

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.610 
separated any way to to do the
relocation<00:05:54.440> so<00:05:55.190> at<00:05:55.370> this<00:05:55.490> point<00:05:56.289> pull<00:05:57.289> if

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
relocation so at this point pull if

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.020 
relocation so at this point pull if
you're<00:05:57.800> doing<00:05:57.950> this<00:05:58.130> job<00:05:58.340> just<00:05:58.610> pull<00:05:58.880> the

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
you're doing this job just pull the

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.820 
you're doing this job just pull the
harness<00:05:59.390> back<00:05:59.570> through<00:05:59.900> and<00:06:00.080> do<00:06:00.229> the<00:06:00.410> tie<00:06:00.620> up

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
harness back through and do the tie up

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.820 
harness back through and do the tie up
later<00:06:01.460> on<00:06:01.760> after<00:06:02.450> you've<00:06:02.630> removed<00:06:02.840> the

later on after you've removed the

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.000 
later on after you've removed the
directional<00:06:04.580> wires<00:06:04.910> from<00:06:05.479> the<00:06:05.900> black<00:06:06.410> harness

directional wires from the black harness
all<00:06:09.010> right<00:06:09.160> I'm<00:06:09.250> pulling<00:06:09.580> this<00:06:09.730> second

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
all right I'm pulling this second

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.560 
all right I'm pulling this second
harness<00:06:10.720> this<00:06:10.930> all<00:06:11.380> came<00:06:11.680> off<00:06:11.710> nicely<00:06:12.340> and<00:06:12.580> I'm

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
harness this all came off nicely and I'm

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.540 
harness this all came off nicely and I'm
pulling<00:06:13.780> this<00:06:14.020> second<00:06:14.680> harness<00:06:15.010> through<00:06:15.310> the

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
pulling this second harness through the

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.600 
pulling this second harness through the
back<00:06:16.140> so<00:06:17.140> that<00:06:17.470> the<00:06:17.650> feed<00:06:17.890> is<00:06:18.100> gonna<00:06:18.280> go<00:06:18.430> now

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
back so that the feed is gonna go now

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.980 
back so that the feed is gonna go now
straight<00:06:19.090> up<00:06:19.270> through<00:06:19.420> and<00:06:19.600> as<00:06:19.660> you<00:06:19.720> can<00:06:19.840> see

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
straight up through and as you can see

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.340 
straight up through and as you can see
it<00:06:20.110> actually<00:06:20.230> lets<00:06:20.650> slack<00:06:20.980> off<00:06:21.220> right<00:06:21.670> away

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350 
it actually lets slack off right away

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.020 
it actually lets slack off right away
and<00:06:23.350> everything<00:06:24.190> should<00:06:24.400> pull<00:06:24.670> through

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
and everything should pull through

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.120 
and everything should pull through
within<00:06:25.510> reason

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
within reason

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:32.420 
within reason
there<00:06:27.130> it<00:06:27.280> goes<00:06:27.880> not<00:06:28.690> catching<00:06:29.730> all<00:06:30.730> right

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
there it goes not catching all right

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.100 
there it goes not catching all right
just<00:06:33.430> pulling<00:06:33.760> it<00:06:33.880> through<00:06:33.910> gently<00:06:34.570> pulling

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
just pulling it through gently pulling

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.140 
just pulling it through gently pulling
it<00:06:35.290> through<00:06:35.320> the<00:06:35.590> bar<00:06:35.770> at<00:06:36.490> which<00:06:36.640> point<00:06:36.940> now

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
it through the bar at which point now

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.690 
it through the bar at which point now
once<00:06:37.750> this<00:06:37.930> is<00:06:38.110> through<00:06:38.440> the<00:06:38.710> bar<00:06:38.950> is<00:06:39.160> ready<00:06:39.400> to

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
once this is through the bar is ready to

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.060 
once this is through the bar is ready to
disconnect<00:06:40.360> I<00:06:40.810> can<00:06:41.170> remove<00:06:41.440> the<00:06:41.680> actual

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
disconnect I can remove the actual

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.310 
disconnect I can remove the actual
handle<00:06:42.400> bars<00:06:42.610> from<00:06:42.910> the<00:06:43.030> bike<00:06:43.180> these<00:06:43.600> what

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:44.320 
handle bars from the bike these what

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.950 
handle bars from the bike these what
you'll<00:06:44.440> want<00:06:44.620> to<00:06:44.740> use<00:06:44.830> is<00:06:45.370> a<00:06:45.780> what's<00:06:46.780> that<00:06:46.930> a

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
you'll want to use is a what's that a

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.300 
you'll want to use is a what's that a
three-quarter<00:06:47.650> inch<00:06:48.930> 3/4<00:06:49.930> inch<00:06:50.080> socket<00:06:50.140> I<00:06:50.710> use

three-quarter inch 3/4 inch socket I use

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.240 
three-quarter inch 3/4 inch socket I use
it<00:06:51.430> on<00:06:51.520> the<00:06:51.610> end<00:06:51.760> of<00:06:51.880> a<00:06:51.940> swivel<00:06:52.710> and<00:06:53.710> it<00:06:54.070> should

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250 
it on the end of a swivel and it should

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.360 
it on the end of a swivel and it should
just<00:06:54.460> go<00:06:54.640> on<00:06:55.410> I've<00:06:56.410> already<00:06:56.650> done<00:06:56.800> a<00:06:56.830> loosening

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:57.370 
just go on I've already done a loosening

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.220 
just go on I've already done a loosening
I'll<00:06:57.940> try<00:06:58.180> it<00:06:58.240> from<00:06:58.420> the<00:06:58.540> backside<00:06:58.750> of<00:06:59.050> the

00:06:59.220 --> 00:06:59.230 
I'll try it from the backside of the

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.990 
I'll try it from the backside of the
triple<00:06:59.560> tree<00:06:59.740> it<00:06:59.860> seems<00:07:00.100> easier<00:07:00.520> from<00:07:00.760> back

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
triple tree it seems easier from back

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.960 
triple tree it seems easier from back
here<00:07:01.360> I<00:07:02.100> loosened<00:07:03.100> this<00:07:03.250> I<00:07:03.400> believe

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
here I loosened this I believe
