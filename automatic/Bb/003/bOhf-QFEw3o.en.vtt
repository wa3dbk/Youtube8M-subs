00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.199
 dixon arrived at the end of the first day of 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.060
 motorola x play use 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.710
 I'll talk a little bit about the battery now. 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.369
 I'm almost dead with my cell phone. 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.640
 so I have 1% battery to the battery 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.470
 very good even then we'll give a 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.420
 battery settings. 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.460
 first thing is the following I have with the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.260
 cell phone a day and an hour and nine minutes 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.750
 waiting then it means that it makes more 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.270
 from the day I arrived from the 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.940
 I arrived on the screen at 6 o'clock and 14 minutes 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.890
 active screen then okay this is an average 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.160
 very good, I do not know what to do there today in 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.930
 day and you will easily find people 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.280
 doing more than six hours of screen 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.770
 because I spent two and a half hours 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.320
 inside this little game heart stone 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.800
 then the game will pull the battery much more 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.989
 if you use more facebook to navigate 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.250
 whatsapp sure to do more than 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.019
 I did the drums 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.850
 so I would say it is a battery 50% 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.729
 better than you found out there 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.250
 so do not expect a battery to the frame 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.530
 double what your current but with 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.689
 sure a standard battery 50% more 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.320
 so it really is a deciding factor of 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.390
 purchase 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.799
 I really liked the battery my first 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.549
 impressions I've spoken in the video of a 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.250
 box 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.380
 You are much better in the hand than you are. 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.049
 they talk, then it's heavy but like him 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.869
 is large is well distributed does not stay 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.130
 looking so heavy on his hand 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.450
 he has such a to his boots is well 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.460
 which are very thin 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.930
 then it is quite comfortable to hold me 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.310
 I do not know how the copying goes. 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.850
 stay right 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.649
 but very good grip the camera is very 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.409
 above average is very good I liked it 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.659
 enough of the self from the front of 5 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.280
 megapixels against the rear of 21 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.020
 I'll talk some more about the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.130
 the camera but that is the end of the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.100
 first day of use 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.909
 motorola moto x play really recommend 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.909
 a good surprise 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.600
 what's up
