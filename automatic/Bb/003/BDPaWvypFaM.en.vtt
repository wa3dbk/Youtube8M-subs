00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.620
 good soy milk people and I'll find 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.450
 a review of approx the sword of the 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.900
 dark the new league champion 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.900
 legends 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.140
 that is to say the champion is pretty 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.630
 fun its dialogues a bit poor and 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.439
 his voice, the Latin, personally, I do not 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.960
 like for nothing 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.699
 he has an enmity with trina shit like that 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.160
 that while the king of the vikings or 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.930
 rather the king of the clickers this 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.750
 champion will come as a ring to the 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.760
 finger your animations are also good 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.129
 their skills have beautiful effects 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.769
 visuals but his skin the truth is not worth 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.140
 the penalty is like atrox the butterfly 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.149
 buy being champion are not hyper 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.920
 lost but avoid the skin unless 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.869
 want to look like guido süller playing 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.089
 al ol although that is already your subject 

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:57.040
 atrox is a good champion for jungle and 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.900
 top after trying it on both me 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.759
 It seems quite funny, good as 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.619
 Weezer on the line above while 

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:04.600
 that in the jungle decade a little its 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:06.670
 hanks in arles are very good and 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.460
 effective something like leaving them vain 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.680
 bloated but in mid and lake game of 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.350
 street because of the lack of that extreme 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.020
 how could it be nautilius ose juan 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.939
 although depending on the team as 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.890
 it could sting anyway we're going to 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.540
 separate their characteristics into pros and 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.550
 cons 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.870
 but if you have a good course taking 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.610
 ready the passive of the w more than more 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:33.030
 very many you in early and tell me 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.220
 God ow zhouqu crosses great ranges 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.590
 very good escape method approach 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.750
 those powers consume life therefore 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.460
 we do not have problems with the mana 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.380
 full tank with an offensive item and 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.170
 keep making good quantities of 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.870
 very good passive damage in universes 1 the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.610
 rba yo but obviously a lot of attack 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.490
 speed in addition to the extra range of the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.740
 last and the passive cons with much 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.720
 it gives in and by which they can make you spotlights 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.970
 just at the end of the ink and if we go 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.280
 are missing that obviously do not have a 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.890
 last and relevant appointments are that 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.020
 depends on more defensive items that 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.320
 other heroes are very likely to have 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.360
 chilled in terms of mechanics in if the 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.070
 champion is quite simple your combo is 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.610
 based on hitting the minions twice 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.230
 self attack and this is how to get down to the 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.780
 largely enemy's life 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.300
 since the basic damage of your baby is high 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.200
 200 goes out on the 5th every three attacks to be 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.930
 exact 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.849
 if it is simply spam 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.230
 is another one that is against the children of this 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.849
 way it's going to be a matter of some 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.280
 minutes of defensive play for 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.590
 regenerate all life the jungle 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.209
 he cleans very fast and his guns are very 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.250
 good in the only thing that does not reach me 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.050
 like is the last in five before 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.239
 you take off 2 and be defensive so 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.940
 unless this hero is really fragile 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.620
 question of a ignite and do not count it is 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.690
 that's why he tried to take me out of 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.190
 effective as quickly as possible 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.319
 if we talk about team fights after 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.540
 have 3 core items I think is excellent 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.880
 Holds a lot and when it climbed low of 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.709
 50% will start to cure twice as much 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.930
 double time I think the goal of atrocious 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.720
 is to leave out of Latin fight or dead to 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.090
 the carry or apply enemy king 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.530
 let's also remember that he revives so if 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.600
 the enemy team is responsible for protecting 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.790
 to your lane and kill you will revive and 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.650
 they will have spent many skills and 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.900
 even invoker spells over voice 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.690
 it is for this reason that he perceives with a 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.370
 atrox with only one damage item and all 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.530
 the other tanks to make it more 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.480
 annoyed that I can heal as much as 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.550
 can and if it is possible to eliminate 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.170
 enemy lanes the order of the 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.880
 skills I do not have it defined yet 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.710
 but for the maximum time twice as much 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.420
 for the course followed by the one that 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.610
 added the slow and left a point in the q 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.340
 maximizing the end always giving it 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.260
 the r every time you can in terms of 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.720
 masters there is not much return to give them 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.200
 21 in attack and 9 in defense or 9 in 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.120
 attack 21 in defense own choice if 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.340
 we talk about big and red damage top 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.459
 armor the yellow ones and in the blue ones 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.080
 m &amp; r by level in terms of items there is a 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.880
 great dilemma to mila will that more me 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.830
 it served was we started with a vest and 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.510
 five positions controls a 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.490
 pending king in five positions and 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.560
 a guard against a p we bought the 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.900
 mercury always since if we stop 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.160
 paste we stop curing another item 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.519
 indispensable will be light of day ' 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.650
 this I tried to give more sustenance the asset 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:22.100
 that is very good attack speed and the 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.520
 passive which is very good also against 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.500
 of we bought run wind and fire 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.700
 counterweight we can buy spirit be 6 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.980
 which is another item that we are going to take 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.780
 then almost reaching the end because 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.460
 because we cure ourselves more with our 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.560
 passive because we cure ourselves more with 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.890
 our w because we play more more with 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.550
 the lifestyle after other viable items 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:46.250
 they are frozen mallet the same way the speech 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.500
 clíver I see it necessary from my wheel 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.400
 from the strategy that I have and a 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.590
 whisper side would not hurt 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.220
 good people that was my review of atrox 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.690

 I said the guide more dynamic than the 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.470
 previous thanks to all those who 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.000
 criticized because the criticisms were 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.500
 very constructive and they helped me 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.050
 to get better 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.840
