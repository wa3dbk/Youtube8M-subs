00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
he just shakes it off and breaks all of

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.990 
he just shakes it off and breaks all of
the<00:01:03.960> ice<00:01:04.140> off<00:01:04.379> but<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.280> at<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.640> point<00:01:05.760> that

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the ice off but it is at this point that

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.490 
the ice off but it is at this point that
he<00:01:06.180> decides<00:01:06.510> he<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:06.960> going<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.320> fight

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.929 
he decides he is not going to fight
against<00:01:07.770> al-qaeda<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.369> I'm<00:01:08.460> guessing<00:01:08.850> that's

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
against al-qaeda and I'm guessing that's

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.460 
against al-qaeda and I'm guessing that's
because<00:01:09.330> he<00:01:09.600> doesn't<00:01:09.900> want<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.049> get<00:01:10.140> his<00:01:10.260> ass

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
because he doesn't want to get his ass

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.109 
because he doesn't want to get his ass
handed<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.950> him<00:01:11.040> because<00:01:11.369> let's<00:01:11.640> face<00:01:11.729> it

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.650 
continued screen and ending this week's
episode<00:02:18.680> which<00:02:19.220> like<00:02:19.520> I<00:02:19.640> said<00:02:19.880> it<00:02:20.060> was<00:02:20.240> pretty

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
episode which like I said it was pretty

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.990 
episode which like I said it was pretty
decent<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.410> even<00:02:21.980> though<00:02:22.130> not<00:02:22.520> that<00:02:22.730> much

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
decent and even though not that much

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.390 
decent and even though not that much
happened<00:02:23.480> if<00:02:24.080> some<00:02:24.290> went<00:02:24.500> by<00:02:24.620> pretty<00:02:25.010> quickly

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
happened if some went by pretty quickly

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.800 
happened if some went by pretty quickly
and<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.730> lot<00:02:25.880> of<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:26.090> probably<00:02:26.450> has<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.690> do

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
and a lot of that probably has to do

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.360 
and a lot of that probably has to do
with<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.960> fact<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.260> there<00:02:27.440> is<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.620> 5<00:02:28.010> minute

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
with the fact that there is a 5 minute

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.890 
with the fact that there is a 5 minute
opening<00:02:28.760> reminding<00:02:29.300> you<00:02:29.360> of<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.570> stuff<00:02:29.780> that

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
opening reminding you of the stuff that

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.320 
opening reminding you of the stuff that
you<00:02:29.990> saw<00:02:30.200> in<00:02:30.320> last<00:02:30.500> week's<00:02:30.770> episode<00:02:31.030> but<00:02:32.030> still

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
you saw in last week's episode but still

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.420 
you saw in last week's episode but still
this<00:02:32.630> was<00:02:32.840> an<00:02:32.930> episode<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:33.800> know<00:02:33.920> wasn't

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
this was an episode that you know wasn't

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.220 
this was an episode that you know wasn't
meant<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:34.670> blow<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:35.000> away<00:02:35.210> just<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.690> sort<00:02:36.200> of

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
meant to blow you away just to sort of

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.870 
meant to blow you away just to sort of
take<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:36.440> little<00:02:36.650> break<00:02:36.950> in<00:02:37.190> a<00:02:37.460> little<00:02:37.670> breather

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
take a little break in a little breather

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.610 
take a little break in a little breather
before<00:02:38.120> we<00:02:38.360> start<00:02:38.570> this<00:02:38.720> brand<00:02:38.990> new<00:02:39.110> arc<00:02:39.320> which

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
before we start this brand new arc which

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.830 
before we start this brand new arc which
i<00:02:39.800> think<00:02:39.920> is<00:02:40.310> probably<00:02:40.610> going<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.150> be<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.390> filler

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
i think is probably going to be a filler

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.390 
i think is probably going to be a filler
arc<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:42.320> think<00:02:42.530> that's<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.830> word<00:02:43.040> on<00:02:43.220> the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.840 
arc I think that's the word on the
street<00:02:43.670> right<00:02:43.850> now<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.470> you<00:02:45.470> know<00:02:45.560> I'm<00:02:46.280> one<00:02:46.760> of

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.440 
looking forward to that because anything
can<00:02:57.530> happen<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:58.010> don't<00:02:58.070> read<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.490> manga<00:02:58.700> so

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
can happen and I don't read the manga so

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.090 
can happen and I don't read the manga so
I<00:02:59.480> don't<00:02:59.690> know<00:02:59.810> if<00:02:59.930> any<00:03:00.110> of<00:03:00.290> like<00:03:00.560> any<00:03:00.800> of<00:03:01.010> this

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
I don't know if any of like any of this

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.100 
I don't know if any of like any of this
stuff<00:03:01.160> is<00:03:01.490> filler<00:03:01.760> but<00:03:02.060> I<00:03:02.090> do<00:03:02.450> know<00:03:02.810> that<00:03:02.840> they

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
stuff is filler but I do know that they

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.870 
stuff is filler but I do know that they
add<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.290> lot<00:03:03.590> of<00:03:03.650> extra<00:03:04.100> things<00:03:04.130> to<00:03:04.550> almost

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
add a lot of extra things to almost

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.610 
add a lot of extra things to almost
every<00:03:05.240> single<00:03:05.390> episode<00:03:05.930> of<00:03:06.050> the<00:03:06.140> series<00:03:06.440> and

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
every single episode of the series and

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.949 
every single episode of the series and
make<00:03:06.770> some<00:03:06.950> few<00:03:07.160> minor<00:03:07.370> alterations<00:03:08.090> but<00:03:08.810> that

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
make some few minor alterations but that

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.479 
make some few minor alterations but that
doesn't<00:03:09.200> really<00:03:09.350> bug<00:03:09.530> me<00:03:09.560> too<00:03:09.860> much<00:03:10.010> but<00:03:10.370> still

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
doesn't really bug me too much but still

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.160 
doesn't really bug me too much but still
I<00:03:10.820> can't<00:03:11.030> hate<00:03:11.180> on<00:03:11.239> this<00:03:11.450> episode<00:03:11.840> too<00:03:12.020> much

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
I can't hate on this episode too much

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.360 
I can't hate on this episode too much

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
because I gotta admit there were a few

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.370 
because I gotta admit there were a few
times<00:03:13.550> that<00:03:13.730> I<00:03:13.760> was<00:03:13.940> laughing<00:03:14.209> in<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:15.050> second

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
times that I was laughing in the second

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.750
