00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.140
 I will not lie to sports 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.090
 fond of and that doesn't mean i'm gay so 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.590
 that shut up in general yes from sports i 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.880
 far did not like the movie with 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.099
 half a million views 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.990
 there where during the hockey match puck 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.600
 accidentally falls pants 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.279
 goalkeeper and commenting makes sense 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.699
 understanding of the rules which 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.949
 throw and here's the air duck see what 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.230
 produce and now one more time platoon 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:38.010
 look see puck will now fall with 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.129
 right here look she fell him right in 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.899
 pants oh my god yes there can be no 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.300
 forget that the teams at that time 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.149
 draw and goes about twirl so it is very 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.559
 important goal since the puck is still 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.410
 appeared at the gate 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.469
 a goal is counted and here it begins 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.510
 I read the most interesting thing sometimes 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.670
 when what is the rule that as soon as 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.920
 the vicar loses the puck use the rang 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.140
 gotta stop the game he's not 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.020
 did and from what fans started 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.700
 frantically freaking out and falling 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.740
 This situation reminds me 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.600
 some movie with farrel input but 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.330
 know when we are still laughing type 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.500
 cool and fun to but this can 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.229
 be only in the cinema 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.780
 and not only did I find the next one 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.340
 video on the site whin point com site 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.259
 named after you 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.240
 I liked him so much 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.970
 videos are always very impressive 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.420
 positive called movie guy can 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.549
 really long pull and mons simple 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.590
 the plot in which the apartments perform the song 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.880
 in public however pay attention here 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.880
 on this guy 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.030
 this 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.360
 quite impressively the pizza name is symbolism 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.910
 he pulls that note almost thirty one 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.310
 a second for how much I am cherished 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.920
 don't try to beat his record so 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.000
 let's see with us and washes away that 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.000
