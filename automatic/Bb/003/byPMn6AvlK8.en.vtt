00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:13.629
 pirelli with the pizzeroa tire set new and higher standards than 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:17.349
 performance in clay and driving safety the excellent use of these 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.250
 Alpine covers within well defined operating parameters first among 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.300
 all the operating temperature hilti 0 in its 4 declination of 2sm 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.720
 Ascoli ensures top performance only within a range 

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:31.489
 thermal 20 finished 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.609
 the star's peace of the tread is the coldest the central one the inner one 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:39.750
 are the hottest tests for the workload. in the throat subjected 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.020
 once the tire temperature is reached it is able to develop the maximum 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.460
 road grip but lack of vertical load trim problems 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.470
 hole driving styles too aggressive can generate wear problems 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.610
 irregular from the teacher in the form of blistering a 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.360
 they are coditions that occur rarely grace chemical treatments 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.820
 of the rubber specific to remove this type of phenomenon 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.000
 develops in the innermost part of the tire in the tread section 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.120
 the blister is a process that occurs when the region is overheated 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.040
 near the carcass generating air bubbles that activate a prince of 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.860
 detachment of the rubber with the extension circumscribed in different points of the 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.170
 tire manifests itself on the tread with real detachments of portions 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.000
 rubber counts varying in function of the level of thermal stress 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.100
 mechanic born that leave ancient visible crazy right going 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.960
 in depth sometimes up to the carcass 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.350
 one of the factors involved in improving the creep duration performance 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.960
 of shells and certainly free of hard track rubber 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.430
 depending on the particle size the rubber deposit is more or less 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.710
 quickly of nothing in the interstices of the asphalt until to obtain 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.940
 a carpet of rubber material 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.590
 it is the clean or gummed path that you come into contact with the tread 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.780
 in temperature, exceptional adhesion development reduces deterioration 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.960
 allows the rider to drive safely and perform with full exploitation 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.230
 the characteristics of prenatal and terence motility in the curve of the
