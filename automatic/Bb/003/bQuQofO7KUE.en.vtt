yeah look we were really relieved to get
through<00:00:04.380> that<00:00:04.500> one<00:00:04.650> that's<00:00:04.859> probably<00:00:05.190> the

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
through that one that's probably the

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.950 
through that one that's probably the
most<00:00:05.670> nervous<00:00:05.790> you<00:00:06.089> get<00:00:06.240> for<00:00:06.480> that<00:00:06.629> one<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.870> get

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
most nervous you get for that one to get

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.900 
most nervous you get for that one to get
into<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.319> big<00:00:07.470> game<00:00:07.680> so<00:00:08.099> we're<00:00:08.490> thrilled<00:00:08.760> with

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
into the big game so we're thrilled with

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.220 
into the big game so we're thrilled with
the<00:00:09.000> performance<00:00:09.389> we<00:00:09.450> put<00:00:09.630> out<00:00:09.750> there<00:00:09.990> and

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
the performance we put out there and

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.320 
the performance we put out there and
look<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:10.950> think<00:00:11.130> New<00:00:11.340> Zealand<00:00:11.670> for<00:00:11.880> more<00:00:12.090> today

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
look I think New Zealand for more today

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.700 
look I think New Zealand for more today
inside<00:00:12.630> away<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.170> think<00:00:13.290> it's<00:00:13.469> going<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.650> be

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
inside away so I think it's going to be

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.269 
inside away so I think it's going to be
game<00:00:13.950> on<00:00:13.980> tomorrow<00:00:15.470> long<00:00:16.470> time<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.070> someone

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
game on tomorrow long time and someone

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.890 
game on tomorrow long time and someone
yeah<00:00:17.760> that's<00:00:18.060> right<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.480> that's<00:00:18.600> probably

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
yeah that's right and that's probably

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.109 
yeah that's right and that's probably
the<00:00:19.050> best<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.320> performed<00:00:19.740> all<00:00:19.939> tournament<00:00:20.939> so

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
the best we performed all tournament so

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.580 
the best we performed all tournament so
far<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.600> we've<00:00:21.720> got<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> little<00:00:21.990> bit<00:00:22.109> up<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.320> bat

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
far so we've got a little bit up the bat

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.200 
far so we've got a little bit up the bat
in<00:00:22.830> left<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.310> our<00:00:23.400> sleep<00:00:23.640> for<00:00:23.850> tomorrow's<00:00:24.180> game

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
in left in our sleep for tomorrow's game

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.450 
in left in our sleep for tomorrow's game
but<00:00:24.750> look<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.619> think<00:00:25.680> both<00:00:25.949> teams<00:00:25.980> are

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
but look I think both teams are

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.980 
but look I think both teams are
absolutely<00:00:27.210> hitting<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.539> straps<00:00:27.810> at<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
absolutely hitting the straps at the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.650 
absolutely hitting the straps at the
right<00:00:28.199> time<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.830> let's<00:00:29.820> expect<00:00:30.179> another<00:00:30.390> tough

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
right time so let's expect another tough

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.310 
right time so let's expect another tough
game<00:00:30.869> against<00:00:31.170> New<00:00:31.320> Zealand<00:00:31.650> tomorrow<00:00:31.890> oh<00:00:36.320> we

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
game against New Zealand tomorrow oh we

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.630 
game against New Zealand tomorrow oh we
weren't<00:00:37.469> happy<00:00:37.710> with<00:00:37.800> our<00:00:37.950> performance<00:00:38.070> but

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
weren't happy with our performance but

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.190 
weren't happy with our performance but
we<00:00:38.790> knew<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.000> they<00:00:39.239> perform<00:00:39.600> really<00:00:39.780> well<00:00:39.870> as

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
we knew that they perform really well as

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.080 
we knew that they perform really well as
well<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> think<00:00:41.100> sometimes<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.760> do<00:00:41.940> need

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
well so I think sometimes you do need

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.240 
well so I think sometimes you do need
that<00:00:42.270> little<00:00:42.450> bit<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.899> kick<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.680> kick-start

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
that little bit of a kick to kick-start

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.119 
that little bit of a kick to kick-start
you<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.910> today<00:00:45.180> we<00:00:45.450> did<00:00:45.660> mr.<00:00:45.930> Beavan<00:00:46.350> look<00:00:46.950> we

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
you and today we did mr. Beavan look we

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.100 
you and today we did mr. Beavan look we
made<00:00:47.520> sure<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.910> we<00:00:47.969> cut<00:00:48.329> down<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.629> errors<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
made sure that we cut down on errors and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.000 
made sure that we cut down on errors and
that's<00:00:49.379> something<00:00:49.500> that's<00:00:49.649> been<00:00:49.860> working

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
that's something that's been working

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.200 
that's something that's been working
really<00:00:50.219> hard<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.520> picks<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:51.559> oh<00:00:53.030> we<00:00:54.030> haven't

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
really hard to picks up oh we haven't

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.479 
really hard to picks up oh we haven't
mentioned<00:00:54.600> Delhi<00:00:54.780> yet<00:00:55.020> but<00:00:55.739> I'm<00:00:55.980> sure<00:00:56.039> it's<00:00:56.430> in

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
mentioned Delhi yet but I'm sure it's in

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.729 
mentioned Delhi yet but I'm sure it's in
the<00:00:56.579> back<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.730> our<00:00:56.969> minds<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:58.170> gives<00:00:58.559> us

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the back of our minds and that gives us

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.310 
the back of our minds and that gives us
more<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.520> guess<00:00:59.760> I<00:01:00.090> guess<00:01:00.390> makes<00:01:00.809> us<00:01:00.960> hungrier

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
more I guess I guess makes us hungrier

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.049 
more I guess I guess makes us hungrier
than<00:01:01.469> anything<00:01:01.829> else<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.340> remember<00:01:02.520> what

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.039 
that felt like so we know tomorrow we do
not<00:01:05.460> want<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.000> feeling<00:01:06.240> again<00:01:06.450> so

anyone<00:01:24.270> tomorrow<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.990> i<00:01:25.020> think<00:01:25.170> that's<00:01:25.470> a

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
anyone tomorrow so i think that's a

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.530 
anyone tomorrow so i think that's a
really<00:01:25.860> good<00:01:26.040> thing<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.939> we<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.509> our

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
really good thing that we have on our

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.359 
really good thing that we have on our
side<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.259> everyone's<00:01:28.979> hitting<00:01:29.159> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
side is that everyone's hitting the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.890 
side is that everyone's hitting the
straps<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.880> everyone<00:01:30.119> performing<00:01:30.540> well<00:01:30.689> for

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900

straps and everyone performing well for
us

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.899 

look<00:01:35.320> I<00:01:35.409> think<00:01:35.470> we<00:01:35.650> always<00:01:35.950> love<00:01:36.100> playing<00:01:36.400> the

look I think we always love playing the
Kiwis<00:01:37.360> and<00:01:37.390> I<00:01:37.720> think<00:01:37.930> everyone<00:01:38.260> enjoys

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
Kiwis and I think everyone enjoys

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.800 
Kiwis and I think everyone enjoys
watching<00:01:38.770> those<00:01:39.159> tough<00:01:39.430> of<00:01:39.640> as<00:01:39.790> well<00:01:40.030> but<00:01:40.300> we

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
watching those tough of as well but we

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
knew Jamaica were going to be really

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.680 
knew Jamaica were going to be really
tough<00:01:42.369> we<00:01:42.550> did<00:01:42.700> not<00:01:42.850> accept<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.270> scoreline

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
tough we did not accept the scoreline

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.830 
tough we did not accept the scoreline
that<00:01:43.869> we<00:01:43.990> ended<00:01:44.140> up<00:01:44.260> with<00:01:44.460> tonight<00:01:45.460> so<00:01:45.909> look<00:01:46.600> I

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
that we ended up with tonight so look I

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.899 
that we ended up with tonight so look I
think<00:01:47.050> yeah<00:01:47.800> I<00:01:48.070> just<00:01:48.159> going<00:01:48.610> to<00:01:48.670> be<00:01:48.760> one<00:01:48.880> of

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
think yeah I just going to be one of

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.820 
think yeah I just going to be one of
those<00:01:49.030> horrid<00:01:49.840> but<00:01:49.990> it<00:01:50.140> was<00:01:50.229> again<00:01:50.440> tomorrow

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
those horrid but it was again tomorrow

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.880 
those horrid but it was again tomorrow
and<00:01:51.040> I<00:01:51.130> think<00:01:51.340> everyone<00:01:51.640> will<00:01:51.790> enjoy<00:01:51.970> that

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.280 

yeah<00:01:56.890> but<00:01:57.729> i<00:01:57.759> think<00:01:58.420> that<00:01:58.479> was<00:01:58.810> due<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.170> the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
yeah but i think that was due to the

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.760 
yeah but i think that was due to the
opposition<00:01:59.560> i'm<00:02:00.130> just<00:02:00.400> not<00:02:00.640> sure<00:02:01.650> with<00:02:02.650> the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
opposition i'm just not sure with the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.980 
opposition i'm just not sure with the
two<00:02:02.979> tools<00:02:03.310> in<00:02:03.610> there<00:02:03.820> they<00:02:04.570> thought<00:02:04.750> they

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
two tools in there they thought they

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.870 
two tools in there they thought they
might<00:02:05.170> have<00:02:05.320> got<00:02:05.409> more<00:02:05.590> volume<00:02:06.100> and<00:02:06.310> i<00:02:06.640> think

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
might have got more volume and i think

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.279 
might have got more volume and i think
once<00:02:07.030> we<00:02:07.119> cut<00:02:07.390> that<00:02:07.539> out<00:02:07.600> i<00:02:07.750> think<00:02:07.930> they

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
once we cut that out i think they

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.250 
once we cut that out i think they
doubted<00:02:08.890> themselves<00:02:09.220> so<00:02:09.729> i<00:02:09.759> think<00:02:09.880> they<00:02:10.260> sort

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
doubted themselves so i think they sort

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.470 
doubted themselves so i think they sort
of<00:02:11.350> you<00:02:12.130> know<00:02:12.160> that<00:02:12.459> nap<00:02:12.730> came<00:02:13.060> in<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:13.360> they

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
of you know that nap came in and they

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.479 
of you know that nap came in and they
couldn't<00:02:13.900> pull<00:02:14.140> it<00:02:14.170> back<00:02:14.500> cuz<00:02:15.070> Jamaica

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
couldn't pull it back cuz Jamaica

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.780 
couldn't pull it back cuz Jamaica
actually<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.060> class<00:02:16.390> inside<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:17.320> I<00:02:18.130> wouldn't

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
actually a class inside and I wouldn't

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.090 
actually a class inside and I wouldn't
have<00:02:18.880> expected<00:02:19.239> that<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:20.100> scoreline

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
have expected that that scoreline

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.400 
have expected that that scoreline
actually<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:21.940> just<00:02:22.239> think<00:02:22.660> it<00:02:22.780> was<00:02:22.870> our<00:02:23.110> day

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.470 

yeah<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.440> thought<00:02:26.890> England<00:02:27.340> had<00:02:28.269> their

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
yeah I thought England had their

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.630 
yeah I thought England had their
opportunities<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.500> they're<00:02:29.980> passing<00:02:30.489> and

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
opportunities and they're passing and

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.699 
opportunities and they're passing and
everything<00:02:30.970> let<00:02:31.480> them<00:02:31.600> down<00:02:31.810> burns

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
everything let them down burns

was and then come out prepared for this

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.780 
was and then come out prepared for this
one<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.410> thought<00:03:14.860> they<00:03:15.040> might<00:03:15.220> put<00:03:15.460> the<00:03:15.580> two

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
one I thought they might put the two

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.940 
one I thought they might put the two
tools<00:03:16.090> on<00:03:16.360> RB<00:03:16.630> been<00:03:16.840> expecting<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.560> for<00:03:17.770> quite

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
tools on RB been expecting it for quite

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.830 
tools on RB been expecting it for quite
a<00:03:18.010> while<00:03:18.250> but<00:03:18.880> I<00:03:19.000> don't<00:03:19.240> think<00:03:19.390> it<00:03:19.510> worked<00:03:19.690> in

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
a while but I don't think it worked in

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.210 
a while but I don't think it worked in
their<00:03:19.960> favor<00:03:20.020> actually<00:03:20.560> I<00:03:20.770> think<00:03:20.860> they<00:03:21.160> were

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
their favor actually I think they were

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.100 
their favor actually I think they were
too<00:03:21.430> top-heavy<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:22.120> we're<00:03:22.600> all<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:22.780> want<00:03:23.050> to

the<00:03:29.890> girls<00:03:30.130> have<00:03:30.310> already<00:03:30.760> talked<00:03:31.030> about<00:03:31.180> that

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
the girls have already talked about that

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.210 
the girls have already talked about that
and<00:03:31.810> they've<00:03:32.020> got<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:32.440> well<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:32.830> truly<00:03:33.100> in

and they've got that well and truly in
their<00:03:33.370> mind<00:03:34.140> but<00:03:35.140> in<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.440> end<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:36.190> know<00:03:36.220> each

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
their mind but in the end you know each

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.940 
their mind but in the end you know each
game<00:03:36.910> is<00:03:37.060> different<00:03:37.209> so<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:38.320> just<00:03:38.350> never<00:03:38.740> know

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.610 
game is different so you just never know
yes<00:03:39.760> we're<00:03:40.030> prepared<00:03:40.450> for<00:03:40.570> triple<00:03:41.290> overtime

to<00:03:44.500> god<00:03:44.680> damn<00:03:44.950> it's<00:03:45.160> not<00:03:45.370> but<00:03:45.550> anyway<00:03:45.880> I<00:03:46.840> think

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
to god damn it's not but anyway I think

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.660 
to god damn it's not but anyway I think
everybody<00:03:47.680> was<00:03:47.800> running<00:03:47.980> out<00:03:48.220> of<00:03:48.250> parking

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
everybody was running out of parking

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.750 
everybody was running out of parking
that<00:03:48.850> but<00:03:49.240> I<00:03:49.270> you<00:03:49.630> know<00:03:50.160> technically<00:03:51.160> you<00:03:51.610> can

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
that but I you know technically you can

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.280 
that but I you know technically you can
I<00:03:51.820> go<00:03:52.000> out<00:03:52.120> and<00:03:52.150> do<00:03:52.360> our<00:03:52.390> best<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:52.930> i'm<00:03:53.080> pretty

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
I go out and do our best and i'm pretty

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.320 
I go out and do our best and i'm pretty
sure<00:03:53.560> that<00:03:53.860> the<00:03:54.310> girls<00:03:54.519> are<00:03:54.700> all<00:03:54.820> fired<00:03:55.060> up<00:03:55.269> for

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
sure that the girls are all fired up for

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.100 
sure that the girls are all fired up for
that

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
that

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.420 
that
did<00:03:57.440> you<00:03:57.560> think<00:03:57.740> that<00:03:57.860> England<00:03:58.280> just

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
did you think that England just

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.190 
did you think that England just
squandered<00:03:58.880> a<00:03:59.060> lot<00:03:59.240> of<00:03:59.360> charge<00:03:59.570> yeah<00:03:59.750> they<00:03:59.990> did

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
squandered a lot of charge yeah they did

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.600 
squandered a lot of charge yeah they did
so<00:04:00.350> under<00:04:00.470> a<00:04:00.650> lot<00:04:00.830> of<00:04:00.860> chances<00:04:01.340> and<00:04:01.400> they

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
so under a lot of chances and they

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.430 
so under a lot of chances and they
certainly<00:04:01.850> got<00:04:02.180> shut<00:04:02.450> down<00:04:02.480> into<00:04:02.930> forward<00:04:03.320> in

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
certainly got shut down into forward in

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.530 
certainly got shut down into forward in
and<00:04:04.370> that<00:04:04.490> was<00:04:04.670> pretty<00:04:04.820> early<00:04:05.240> and<00:04:05.270> then

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
and that was pretty early and then

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.420 
and that was pretty early and then
nothing<00:04:05.780> changed<00:04:06.380> much<00:04:06.530> for<00:04:06.860> them<00:04:07.010> after<00:04:07.130> the
