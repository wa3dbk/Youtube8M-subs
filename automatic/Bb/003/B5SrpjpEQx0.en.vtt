00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.220 
discontent with that because 60 minutes
just<00:00:51.970> isn't<00:00:52.239> enough<00:00:52.300> time<00:00:52.600> to<00:00:52.750> complete<00:00:52.900> three

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
just isn't enough time to complete three

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.500 
just isn't enough time to complete three
games<00:00:53.530> let's<00:00:53.770> be<00:00:53.890> honest<00:00:54.190> a<00:00:54.340> regular<00:00:54.940> Swiss

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
games let's be honest a regular Swiss

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.630 
games let's be honest a regular Swiss
round<00:00:55.810> is<00:00:55.989> 30<00:00:56.290> minutes<00:00:56.650> plus<00:00:56.920> 3<00:00:57.130> turns<00:00:57.370> and

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
round is 30 minutes plus 3 turns and

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.120 
round is 30 minutes plus 3 turns and
then<00:00:58.360> a<00:00:58.690> best<00:00:59.260> two<00:00:59.410> out<00:00:59.500> of<00:00:59.530> three<00:00:59.620> matches

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
then a best two out of three matches

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.000 
then a best two out of three matches
only<00:01:00.370> 60<00:01:00.820> minutes<00:01:01.090> which<00:01:01.750> would<00:01:01.930> tell<00:01:02.110> you<00:01:02.230> by

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
only 60 minutes which would tell you by

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.920 
only 60 minutes which would tell you by
simple<00:01:03.489> math<00:01:03.640> that'd<00:01:04.000> probably<00:01:04.390> only<00:01:04.750> has

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
simple math that'd probably only has

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.870 
simple math that'd probably only has
time<00:01:05.110> for<00:01:05.350> two<00:01:05.470> games<00:01:05.740> at<00:01:05.950> best<00:01:06.159> and<00:01:06.430> it<00:01:06.790> would

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
time for two games at best and it would

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.830 
time for two games at best and it would
cause<00:01:07.090> a<00:01:07.120> lot<00:01:07.420> of<00:01:07.650> really<00:01:08.650> bad<00:01:09.460> scenarios<00:01:10.240> for

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
cause a lot of really bad scenarios for

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.840 
cause a lot of really bad scenarios for
example<00:01:11.350> our<00:01:11.440> last<00:01:11.710> two<00:01:11.979> national<00:01:12.550> and<00:01:12.670> world

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
example our last two national and world

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.080 
example our last two national and world
champions<00:01:13.390> were<00:01:14.050> decided<00:01:14.680> by<00:01:14.890> time<00:01:15.280> believe

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
champions were decided by time believe

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.200 
champions were decided by time believe
it<00:01:16.210> or<00:01:16.270> not<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:17.350> time<00:01:17.620> limits<00:01:17.979> were<00:01:18.909> the<00:01:19.060> cause

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
it or not the time limits were the cause

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.440 
it or not the time limits were the cause
of<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.450> winner<00:01:19.600> so<00:01:20.590> I<00:01:20.979> mean<00:01:21.549> take<00:01:22.120> that<00:01:22.299> for

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
of the winner so I mean take that for

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.539 
of the winner so I mean take that for
what<00:01:22.479> it's<00:01:22.659> worth<00:01:22.720> they<00:01:23.650> have<00:01:23.799> adapted<00:01:24.070> to<00:01:24.310> it

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
what it's worth they have adapted to it

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.370 
what it's worth they have adapted to it
and<00:01:24.700> you<00:01:25.150> can<00:01:25.270> take<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.450> look<00:01:25.659> here<00:01:25.720> if<00:01:26.049> you<00:01:26.140> just

minutes<00:01:58.960> for<00:01:59.290> the<00:01:59.350> match<00:01:59.500> I<00:01:59.830> don't<00:02:00.460> think<00:02:00.700> they

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
minutes for the match I don't think they

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.460
