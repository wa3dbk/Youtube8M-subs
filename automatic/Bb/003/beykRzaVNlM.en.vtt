00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.649 
variety of events and races that anyone
can<00:01:14.040> take<00:01:14.159> part<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.000> if<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.360> start<00:01:15.630> with

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
can take part in so if we start with

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.960 
can take part in so if we start with
flat<00:01:15.990> water<00:01:16.140> distance<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.280> we<00:01:17.400> can<00:01:17.549> power<00:01:17.820> for

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
flat water distance so we can power for

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.120 
flat water distance so we can power for
one<00:01:18.119> point<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.540> another<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.869> flat<00:01:19.170> water<00:01:19.380> or<00:01:19.979> we

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
one point to another on flat water or we

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.039 
one point to another on flat water or we
can<00:01:20.250> have<00:01:20.460> out<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.700> backs<00:01:21.030> races<00:01:21.540> range<00:01:21.780> and

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
can have out on backs races range and

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.899 
can have out on backs races range and
distance<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.650> often<00:01:23.430> with<00:01:23.580> inside

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
distance and often with inside

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.789 
distance and often with inside
individual<00:01:24.600> events<00:01:25.020> they'll<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.439> different

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
individual events they'll have different

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.560 
individual events they'll have different
distance<00:01:26.159> or<00:01:26.369> different<00:01:26.640> categories<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.390> it

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
distance or different categories so it

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.149 
distance or different categories so it
makes<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.930> really<00:01:28.110> inclusive<00:01:28.500> when<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.040> get

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
makes it really inclusive when you get

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.740 
makes it really inclusive when you get
down<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> coast<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:30.119> can<00:01:30.299> start<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.600> bring

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
down to the coast we can start to bring

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.210 
down to the coast we can start to bring

of soup replacement and some
carbohydrates<00:02:16.000> when<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.540> sweat<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.140> don't

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
carbohydrates when you sweat you don't

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.770 
carbohydrates when you sweat you don't
just<00:02:17.710> lose<00:02:17.830> fluid<00:02:18.250> but<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:18.490> lose<00:02:18.640> sodium<00:02:19.630> but

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
just lose fluid but you lose sodium but

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.360 
just lose fluid but you lose sodium but
it<00:02:19.870> we<00:02:19.990> all<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.470> lose<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.950> at<00:02:21.010> different

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
it we all you lose it at different

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.370 
it we all you lose it at different
levels<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:22.270> when<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.540> biggest<00:02:22.750> performance

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
levels so when the biggest performance

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.710 
levels so when the biggest performance
indicators<00:02:24.370> if<00:02:24.640> it's<00:02:24.790> decreasing<00:02:24.970> is

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
indicators if it's decreasing is

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.870 
indicators if it's decreasing is
actually<00:02:26.110> your<00:02:26.230> sodium<00:02:26.440> level<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:27.340> one<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:27.820> the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
actually your sodium level so one of the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.010 
actually your sodium level so one of the
best<00:02:28.030> thing<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.180> do<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.480> make<00:02:28.510> sure<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:28.840> take<00:02:28.990> a

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
best thing to do is make sure you take a

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.260 
best thing to do is make sure you take a
sodium<00:02:29.350> supplement<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.130> water<00:02:30.550> some<00:02:31.090> people

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
sodium supplement and water some people

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.970 
sodium supplement and water some people
are<00:02:31.330> okay<00:02:31.390> with<00:02:31.660> water<00:02:31.870> but<00:02:32.380> some<00:02:32.590> people<00:02:32.830> need

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
are okay with water but some people need

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.830 
are okay with water but some people need
focus<00:02:33.250> supplement<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.000> water<00:02:34.240> as<00:02:34.480> well<00:02:34.660> a

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
focus supplement and water as well a

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.840 
focus supplement and water as well a
warm<00:02:35.140> up<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.380> very<00:02:35.440> important<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.340> intensity

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
warm up is very important the intensity

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.790 
warm up is very important the intensity

rehearsing some of the paddle strokes
it's<00:02:57.310> about<00:02:57.459> doing<00:02:57.670> dynamic<00:02:57.959> flexibility<00:02:58.959> do

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
it's about doing dynamic flexibility do

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.990 
it's about doing dynamic flexibility do
all<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.920> movement<00:03:00.310> so<00:03:00.400> you're<00:03:00.520> gonna<00:03:00.610> create

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
all the movement so you're gonna create

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.540 
all the movement so you're gonna create
on<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:01.840> pedal<00:03:02.140> board<00:03:02.320> on<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.709> bike<00:03:02.980> on<00:03:03.280> that

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.880 
on that pedal board on the bike on that
run<00:03:03.790> so<00:03:04.270> make<00:03:04.780> sure<00:03:04.810> that<00:03:05.020> you<00:03:05.290> have<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.590> look<00:03:05.769> at

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
run so make sure that you have a look at

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.410 
run so make sure that you have a look at
how<00:03:06.070> you're<00:03:06.220> doing<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.580> might<00:03:06.700> be<00:03:06.820> squat<00:03:07.180> it

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
how you're doing so it might be squat it

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.660 
how you're doing so it might be squat it
might<00:03:07.630> be<00:03:07.810> then<00:03:08.350> to<00:03:08.500> extend<00:03:08.680> patterns<00:03:09.340> it

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
might be then to extend patterns it

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.000
