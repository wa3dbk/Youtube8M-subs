2002 the tune of 5.5 billion dollars and
what<00:00:49.590> they<00:00:49.710> do<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:50.039> they<00:00:50.160> buy<00:00:50.370> these

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
what they do is they buy these

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.700 
what they do is they buy these
foreclosed<00:00:51.120> homes<00:00:51.420> they<00:00:51.809> renovate<00:00:52.379> them<00:00:52.559> if

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
foreclosed homes they renovate them if

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.470 
foreclosed homes they renovate them if
they<00:00:52.800> need<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:52.980> be<00:00:53.129> renovated<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.270> then

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
they need to be renovated and then

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.330 
they need to be renovated and then
instead<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.020> selling<00:00:55.590> them<00:00:55.620> instead<00:00:56.280> of

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
instead of selling them instead of

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.369 
instead of selling them instead of
flipping<00:00:56.730> them<00:00:57.120> what<00:00:57.600> they<00:00:57.719> do<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.989> they<00:00:58.140> rent

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
flipping them what they do is they rent

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.380 
flipping them what they do is they rent
them<00:00:58.530> out<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.730> seems<00:01:00.030> reasonable

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
them out so it seems reasonable

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.029 
them out so it seems reasonable
especially<00:01:00.930> considering<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.739> fact<00:01:01.770> that

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
especially considering the fact that

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.490 
especially considering the fact that
it's<00:01:02.219> really<00:01:02.640> difficult<00:01:03.120> for<00:01:03.180> people<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.930> get

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
it's really difficult for people to get

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.950 
it's really difficult for people to get
mortgages<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.489> day<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.820> age<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.600> really

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
mortgages this day and age it's really

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.510 
mortgages this day and age it's really
difficult<00:01:07.110> for<00:01:07.350> them<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.710> get<00:01:07.830> approved<00:01:08.220> for

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
difficult for them to get approved for

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.690 
difficult for them to get approved for
the<00:01:08.610> loan<00:01:08.840> so<00:01:09.840> there<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.799> more<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.310> market

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the loan so there is more of a market

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.700 
the loan so there is more of a market
for<00:01:11.729> renters<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.080> seems<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> really

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
for renters so it seems like a really

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.530 
for renters so it seems like a really
reasonable<00:01:13.950> thing<00:01:14.460> except<00:01:15.030> they're<00:01:15.270> buying

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
reasonable thing except they're buying

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.499 
reasonable thing except they're buying
these<00:01:15.810> homes<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.500> areas<00:01:16.759> including<00:01:17.759> Phoenix

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
these homes in areas including Phoenix

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.289 
these homes in areas including Phoenix
Las<00:01:18.810> Vegas<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.470> Orlando<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.460> they're<00:01:20.939> kind<00:01:21.180> of

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
Las Vegas in Orlando and they're kind of

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.420 
Las Vegas in Orlando and they're kind of
buying<00:01:21.540> them<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.930> these<00:01:22.049> fringe<00:01:22.770> suburban

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
buying them in these fringe suburban

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.800 
buying them in these fringe suburban
neighborhoods<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.180> aren't<00:01:24.420> really<00:01:24.600> that

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
neighborhoods that aren't really that

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.410 
neighborhoods that aren't really that
desirable<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.040> there's<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.310> huge<00:01:26.640> chance<00:01:27.030> that

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
desirable so there's a huge chance that

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.510 
desirable so there's a huge chance that
they're<00:01:27.960> creating<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.680> or<00:01:29.009> they're<00:01:29.369> not

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
they're creating this or they're not

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.399 
they're creating this or they're not
creating<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.119> single-handedly<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:31.170> course

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
creating it single-handedly of course

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.450 
creating it single-handedly of course
there<00:01:31.560> are<00:01:31.650> many<00:01:31.740> factors<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.310> come<00:01:32.400> into

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
there are many factors that come into

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.789 
there are many factors that come into
place<00:01:32.850> but<00:01:33.299> they're<00:01:33.450> contributing<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
place but they're contributing to the

place but they're contributing to the
next<00:01:35.130> housing<00:01:35.640> bubble<00:01:36.030> because<00:01:36.509> people<00:01:36.840> are

next housing bubble because people are

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.020 
next housing bubble because people are

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
unlikely to rent in these areas they're

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.200

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.070 
in the US
it<00:02:12.920> all<00:02:13.130> seems<00:02:13.550> reasonable<00:02:14.270> but<00:02:14.450> as<00:02:14.630> an

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
it all seems reasonable but as an

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.780 
it all seems reasonable but as an
American<00:02:15.590> who's<00:02:15.739> lived<00:02:16.160> in<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.430> past<00:02:16.610> few

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
American who's lived in the past few

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.670 
American who's lived in the past few
years<00:02:17.030> in<00:02:17.180> this<00:02:17.239> country<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.780> don't<00:02:18.410> trust

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
years in this country I don't trust

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.960 
years in this country I don't trust
anything<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.190> they're<00:02:19.400> doing<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.790> either

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
anything that they're doing I either

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.100 
anything that they're doing I either
think<00:02:20.270> that<00:02:20.480> one<00:02:20.750> they're<00:02:20.959> gonna

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
think that one they're gonna

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.380 
think that one they're gonna
purposefully<00:02:21.770> screw<00:02:22.010> me<00:02:22.160> or<00:02:22.310> two<00:02:22.910> they're

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
purposefully screw me or two they're

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.970 
purposefully screw me or two they're
going<00:02:23.630> to<00:02:23.840> be<00:02:23.959> completely<00:02:24.230> incompetent<00:02:24.590> and

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
going to be completely incompetent and

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.020 
going to be completely incompetent and
they<00:02:25.069> are<00:02:25.190> going<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.400> cause<00:02:25.550> another<00:02:25.819> housing

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
they are going to cause another housing

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.059 
they are going to cause another housing
bubble<00:02:26.239> it<00:02:26.569> seems<00:02:26.810> like<00:02:26.989> at<00:02:27.080> this<00:02:27.170> point<00:02:27.440> we're

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
bubble it seems like at this point we're

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.309 
bubble it seems like at this point we're
just<00:02:28.099> hopefully<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.090> buy<00:02:29.330> at<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.599> right<00:02:29.989> time

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
just hopefully you buy at the right time

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.949 
just hopefully you buy at the right time
I<00:02:30.650> guess<00:02:30.680> under<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.370> right<00:02:31.640> agreement<00:02:32.569> to<00:02:32.870> be

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
I guess under the right agreement to be

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.540 
I guess under the right agreement to be
able<00:02:33.019> to<00:02:33.110> weather<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:33.620> inevitable<00:02:34.340> collapse

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
able to weather the inevitable collapse

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.740 
able to weather the inevitable collapse
of<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:34.970> future<00:02:35.239> I<00:02:35.300> don't<00:02:35.390> know<00:02:35.510> if<00:02:35.599> that's

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
of the future I don't know if that's

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.720 
of the future I don't know if that's
unrealistic<00:02:36.650> or<00:02:36.890> from<00:02:37.069> being<00:02:37.250> conspiratorial

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
unrealistic or from being conspiratorial

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.160 
unrealistic or from being conspiratorial
but<00:02:38.030> that's<00:02:38.150> just<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:38.450> experience<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:38.989> I

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
but that's just the experience that I

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.330 
but that's just the experience that I
have<00:02:39.349> looking<00:02:39.560> towards<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.860> future<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:40.280> think

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
have looking towards the future I think

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.100 
have looking towards the future I think
it's<00:02:40.610> a<00:02:40.700> common<00:02:41.090> fear<00:02:41.330> among<00:02:41.360> people<00:02:41.900> that<00:02:41.930> are

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
it's a common fear among people that are

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.660 
it's a common fear among people that are
looking<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.440> buy<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:43.099> it<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:43.400> really

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
looking to buy and it is really

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.000 
looking to buy and it is really
difficult<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:44.390> buy<00:02:44.600> something<00:02:45.290> confidently

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
difficult to buy something confidently

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.530 
difficult to buy something confidently
especially<00:02:46.640> in<00:02:46.730> today's<00:02:46.970> market<00:02:47.390> especially

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
when you see all of these reports

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.610 
when you see all of these reports
indicating<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.880> markets<00:02:50.209> doing<00:02:50.360> better<00:02:50.660> yeah

if you were lucky enough to buy at the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.059 
if you were lucky enough to buy at the
bottom<00:02:53.360> of<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.540> market<00:02:53.870> great<00:02:54.200> but<00:02:54.650> price<00:02:54.830> and

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
bottom of the market great but price and

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.309 
bottom of the market great but price and
prices<00:02:55.519> have<00:02:55.640> increased<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:56.690> know<00:02:56.780> upwards

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
prices have increased you know upwards

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.039

of<00:02:57.650> 20<00:02:57.980> percent<00:02:58.160> in<00:02:58.549> the<00:02:58.610> last<00:02:58.819> year<00:02:59.480> so<00:02:59.900> it's

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
of 20 percent in the last year so it's

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.660 
of 20 percent in the last year so it's
really<00:03:00.290> really<00:03:00.530> difficult<00:03:01.160> for<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.430> lot<00:03:01.640> of

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
really really difficult for a lot of

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.190 
really really difficult for a lot of
people<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.000> buy<00:03:02.150> homes<00:03:02.330> at<00:03:02.569> this<00:03:02.720> point<00:03:02.989> and

people to buy homes at this point and

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.170 
people to buy homes at this point and
you<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.769> seems<00:03:04.310> like<00:03:04.489> what<00:03:04.640> they're<00:03:04.790> doing<00:03:04.819> is

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
you it seems like what they're doing is

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.910 
you it seems like what they're doing is
great<00:03:05.510> because<00:03:05.900> if<00:03:06.170> there<00:03:06.319> is<00:03:06.470> a<00:03:06.500> market<00:03:06.890> for

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
great because if there is a market for

great because if there is a market for
renters<00:03:07.370> well<00:03:07.819> they're<00:03:08.180> buying<00:03:08.569> these<00:03:08.780> homes

they're renovating them and what they
want<00:03:10.819> to<00:03:10.910> do<00:03:11.030> is<00:03:11.180> they<00:03:11.299> actually<00:03:11.450> want<00:03:11.810> to

of<00:04:43.730> miles<00:04:44.030> outside<00:04:44.390> of<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.750> city<00:04:44.930> center<00:04:44.990> now

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
of miles outside of the city center now

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.710 
of miles outside of the city center now
it<00:04:45.680> looks<00:04:45.830> like<00:04:45.980> these<00:04:46.250> houses<00:04:46.430> are<00:04:46.910> in<00:04:47.450> less

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
it looks like these houses are in less

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.030 
it looks like these houses are in less
desirable<00:04:48.050> area<00:04:48.380> so<00:04:48.500> it<00:04:48.590> seems<00:04:48.800> like<00:04:48.860> there

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
desirable area so it seems like there

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.800 
desirable area so it seems like there
might<00:04:49.220> be<00:04:49.280> more<00:04:49.730> latitude<00:04:50.240> for<00:04:50.450> people<00:04:50.690> to

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
might be more latitude for people to

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.920 
might be more latitude for people to
negotiate<00:04:51.350> but<00:04:52.220> I'm<00:04:52.820> incredibly<00:04:53.450> worried<00:04:53.780> and

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
negotiate but I'm incredibly worried and

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.810 
negotiate but I'm incredibly worried and
I<00:04:53.990> this<00:04:54.410> might<00:04:54.650> not<00:04:54.680> be<00:04:54.980> a<00:04:55.010> great<00:04:55.160> example<00:04:55.490> of

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
I this might not be a great example of

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.520 
I this might not be a great example of
how<00:04:56.060> paranoid<00:04:56.540> I<00:04:56.750> am<00:04:56.900> about<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.200> future<00:04:57.500> of

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
how paranoid I am about the future of

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.560 
how paranoid I am about the future of
American<00:04:57.950> housing<00:04:58.280> but<00:04:58.460> it<00:04:58.790> doesn't<00:04:59.420> look

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
American housing but it doesn't look

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.780 
American housing but it doesn't look
good<00:04:59.750> it<00:05:00.110> does<00:05:00.320> and<00:05:01.070> just<00:05:01.340> to<00:05:01.430> put<00:05:01.520> everything

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
good it does and just to put everything

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.310 
good it does and just to put everything
in<00:05:01.970> perspective<00:05:02.240> guys<00:05:02.660> cuz<00:05:02.870> I<00:05:02.930> definitely

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
in perspective guys cuz I definitely

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.660 
in perspective guys cuz I definitely
don't<00:05:03.470> want<00:05:03.770> a<00:05:03.830> fear<00:05:04.100> monger<00:05:04.400> or<00:05:04.460> anything

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
don't want a fear monger or anything

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.300 
don't want a fear monger or anything
like<00:05:04.880> I<00:05:05.060> do<00:05:05.120> this<00:05:05.930> particular<00:05:06.650> company<00:05:07.100> only

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
like I do this particular company only

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.630 
like I do this particular company only
represents<00:05:08.090> one<00:05:08.420> three<00:05:08.960> hundredths<00:05:09.590> of<00:05:09.740> one

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
represents one three hundredths of one

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.240 
represents one three hundredths of one
percent<00:05:11.300> of<00:05:11.900> the<00:05:12.080> housing<00:05:12.500> market<00:05:12.530> so<00:05:12.860> it's

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
percent of the housing market so it's

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.350 
percent of the housing market so it's

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
not like this company can
