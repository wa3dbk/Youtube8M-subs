are<00:02:45.810> both<00:02:45.989> two<00:02:46.319> types<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.980> long<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.910> tooth<00:02:48.180> norm

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
are both two types of long to tooth norm

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.069 
are both two types of long to tooth norm
instability<00:02:50.030> but<00:02:51.030> what<00:02:51.180> interfering<00:02:51.780> from

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
instability but what interfering from

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.650 
instability but what interfering from
analyzing<00:02:52.640> whole<00:02:53.640> range<00:02:53.970> about<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.420> car

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
analyzing whole range about the car

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.069 
analyzing whole range about the car

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
accident is that in real life accidents

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.530 
accident is that in real life accidents
occur<00:02:58.350> well<00:02:58.680> below<00:02:59.069> who<00:02:59.310> those<00:02:59.519> angles<00:03:00.329> that

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
occur well below who those angles that

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.640

plastic example being one in this case

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.580 
plastic example being one in this case
what<00:03:08.010> we<00:03:08.130> have<00:03:08.160> is<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.609> two<00:03:09.450> wheel<00:03:09.690> drive<00:03:09.780> an

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
what we have is a two wheel drive an

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.840 
what we have is a two wheel drive an
agricultural<00:03:11.280> tractor<00:03:12.380> in<00:03:13.380> this<00:03:13.650> case<00:03:13.920> what

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
agricultural tractor in this case what

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.240 
agricultural tractor in this case what
we<00:03:15.000> find<00:03:15.239> is<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.569> it<00:03:15.930> will<00:03:16.109> slide<00:03:16.410> out<00:03:17.040> up

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
we find is that it will slide out up

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.240 
we find is that it will slide out up
from<00:03:17.459> trouble<00:03:17.940> at<00:03:18.900> angles<00:03:19.500> much<00:03:19.739> much<00:03:20.010> less

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
from trouble at angles much much less

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.729 
from trouble at angles much much less
than<00:03:20.280> we<00:03:20.609> found<00:03:20.850> on<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.150> tilt<00:03:21.359> table<00:03:21.590> in<00:03:22.590> this

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
than we found on the tilt table in this

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.979 
than we found on the tilt table in this
case<00:03:23.010> if<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.280> just<00:03:23.489> give<00:03:23.639> an<00:03:23.760> example<00:03:23.930> on<00:03:24.930> a

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
case if I just give an example on a

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.970 
case if I just give an example on a
20-degree<00:03:25.590> slope<00:03:26.989> if<00:03:27.989> we<00:03:28.170> just<00:03:28.440> raise<00:03:28.680> it

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
20-degree slope if we just raise it

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.240 
20-degree slope if we just raise it
slightly<00:03:29.130> or<00:03:30.030> slide<00:03:30.389> out<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.690> control<00:03:31.350> or

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
slightly or slide out of control or

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.090 
slightly or slide out of control or
potentially<00:03:32.940> overturn<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:34.530> although<00:03:34.709> right

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
potentially overturn and although right

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.610 
potentially overturn and although right
at<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.489> bottom<00:03:35.819> of<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.060> hill<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:37.079> actual

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
at the bottom of the hill the actual

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.349 
at the bottom of the hill the actual
final<00:03:38.540> overturn<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:39.840> lateral<00:03:40.230> or<00:03:40.620> sideways

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
final overturn is lateral or sideways

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.600 
final overturn is lateral or sideways
the<00:03:42.359> real<00:03:42.540> cause<00:03:42.900> is<00:03:42.930> this<00:03:43.380> control<00:03:43.889> switch

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
the real cause is this control switch

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.510 
the real cause is this control switch
slides<00:03:44.940> out<00:03:45.210> of<00:03:45.240> control<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.080> in<00:03:46.890> this<00:03:47.040> case<00:03:47.340> if

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
slides out of control so in this case if

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.910 
slides out of control so in this case if
I<00:03:47.670> just<00:03:47.850> give<00:03:48.450> another<00:03:48.690> demonstration<00:03:49.080> there

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
I just give another demonstration there

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.050 
I just give another demonstration there
it<00:03:50.010> is<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:52.650> in<00:03:52.770> this<00:03:52.920> case<00:03:53.220> you'll<00:03:53.490> see<00:03:53.760> that

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
it is and in this case you'll see that

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.780 
it is and in this case you'll see that
the<00:03:54.690> first<00:03:55.020> sign<00:03:55.380> is<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:55.860> one<00:03:56.220> of<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.490> wheels

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
the first sign is that one of the wheels

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.020 
the first sign is that one of the wheels
lifted<00:03:57.030> off<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.570> ground<00:03:58.370> in<00:03:59.370> this<00:03:59.550> case<00:03:59.820> we

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
lifted off the ground in this case we

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.970 
lifted off the ground in this case we
have<00:04:00.120> three<00:04:00.330> points<00:04:00.660> of<00:04:00.750> contact<00:04:00.980> there's

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
have three points of contact there's

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.640 
have three points of contact there's
some<00:04:02.100> front<00:04:02.370> two<00:04:02.580> axles<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:03.720> on<00:04:04.010> this<00:04:05.030> rear

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
some front two axles and on this rear

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.280 
some front two axles and on this rear
upside<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:09.030> reason<00:04:09.450> for<00:04:09.540> that<00:04:09.600> is<00:04:09.900> that<00:04:09.930> this

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
upside the reason for that is that this

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.110 
upside the reason for that is that this
has<00:04:10.770> proper<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.840> tilting<00:04:12.840> front<00:04:13.470> axle<00:04:14.120> the

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
has proper a tilting front axle the

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.780 
has proper a tilting front axle the
advantage<00:04:15.720> of<00:04:15.900> that<00:04:16.079> in<00:04:16.290> practice<00:04:16.769> is<00:04:17.040> if<00:04:17.640> you

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
advantage of that in practice is if you

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.050 
advantage of that in practice is if you
find<00:04:18.060> potholes<00:04:18.630> slight<00:04:19.140> bumps<00:04:19.709> it<00:04:20.519> gives<00:04:20.820> you

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
find potholes slight bumps it gives you

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.120 
find potholes slight bumps it gives you
much<00:04:21.390> better<00:04:21.419> contact<00:04:21.989> with<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.530> ground<00:04:22.710> so<00:04:23.100> a

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
much better contact with the ground so a

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.670 
much better contact with the ground so a
slight<00:04:23.490> bump<00:04:24.120> or<00:04:24.360> inclination<00:04:24.690> can<00:04:25.320> actually

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
slight bump or inclination can actually

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.970 
slight bump or inclination can actually
give<00:04:25.890> you<00:04:27.290> continued<00:04:28.290> to<00:04:28.320> give<00:04:28.560> you<00:04:28.680> three

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
give you continued to give you three

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.570 
give you continued to give you three
points<00:04:29.010> of<00:04:29.460> contact<00:04:29.540> or<00:04:30.540> even<00:04:30.810> four<00:04:31.250> whereas<00:04:32.250> I

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
points of contact or even four whereas I

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.580 
points of contact or even four whereas I
use<00:04:32.880> this<00:04:33.060> example<00:04:33.270> which<00:04:33.870> is<00:04:34.080> a<00:04:34.110> tractor

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
use this example which is a tractor

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.760 
use this example which is a tractor
that's<00:04:34.710> got<00:04:34.950> a<00:04:34.980> fixed<00:04:35.460> contact<00:04:36.000> so<00:04:36.560> once<00:04:37.560> it

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
that's got a fixed contact so once it

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.800 
that's got a fixed contact so once it
starts<00:04:38.220> to<00:04:38.310> if<00:04:38.730> one<00:04:38.970> wheel<00:04:39.180> comes<00:04:39.510> off<00:04:39.690> the

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
starts to if one wheel comes off the

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.020 
starts to if one wheel comes off the
ground<00:04:40.080> it<00:04:40.800> brings<00:04:41.160> the<00:04:41.370> other<00:04:41.610> so<00:04:41.820> in<00:04:41.940> this

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
ground it brings the other so in this

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.840 
ground it brings the other so in this
case<00:04:42.330> it's<00:04:42.690> less<00:04:42.870> stable<00:04:43.169> because<00:04:43.640> only<00:04:44.640> two

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
case it's less stable because only two

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.290 
case it's less stable because only two
points<00:04:45.270> of<00:04:45.360> contact<00:04:45.390> remain<00:04:46.700> we<00:04:47.700> go<00:04:47.910> for<00:04:48.180> the

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
points of contact remain we go for the

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.250 
points of contact remain we go for the
pivoting<00:04:49.169> front<00:04:49.440> axle<00:04:50.419> get<00:04:51.419> a<00:04:51.450> slight

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
pivoting front axle get a slight

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.190 
pivoting front axle get a slight
inclination<00:04:52.650> and<00:04:53.370> in<00:04:53.520> this<00:04:53.669> case<00:04:54.000> one<00:04:54.870> wheels

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
inclination and in this case one wheels

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.350 
inclination and in this case one wheels
off<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:55.410> ground<00:04:55.640> but<00:04:56.640> the<00:04:56.790> three<00:04:57.060> others

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
off the ground but the three others

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.890 
off the ground but the three others
remain<00:04:57.930> so<00:04:58.830> this<00:04:59.010> is<00:04:59.220> an<00:04:59.340> example<00:04:59.729> of<00:05:00.000> to<00:05:00.690> say

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
remain so this is an example of to say

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.140 
remain so this is an example of to say
this<00:05:01.710> type<00:05:02.010> of<00:05:02.160> instability<00:05:02.520> called

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
this type of instability called

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.170

surface in this case this is one that's
slippier<00:05:32.130> still<00:05:32.810> you<00:05:33.810> might<00:05:34.020> need<00:05:34.169> to<00:05:34.410> go<00:05:34.560> down

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
slippier still you might need to go down

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.610 
slippier still you might need to go down

ten and fifteen degrees

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.240 
ten and fifteen degrees
and<00:05:40.990> you<00:05:41.080> can<00:05:41.260> show<00:05:41.500> that<00:05:41.530> it<00:05:41.830> will<00:05:41.950> slide

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
and you can show that it will slide

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.270 
and you can show that it will slide
there<00:05:42.460> to<00:05:42.610> control<00:05:43.030> so<00:05:43.300> his<00:05:43.860> slip<00:05:44.860> this<00:05:45.070> one

shallow ankles so the moral of the story

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.470 
shallow ankles so the moral of the story
is<00:06:12.820> that<00:06:12.970> these<00:06:13.950> accidents<00:06:14.950> occur<00:06:15.280> very<00:06:16.120> much

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:16.480 
is that these accidents occur very much
