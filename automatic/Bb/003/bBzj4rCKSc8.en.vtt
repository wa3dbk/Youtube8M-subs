now acetoacetate is known as a ketone

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.720 
now acetoacetate is known as a ketone
ketone<00:03:27.650> but<00:03:28.650> it's<00:03:28.830> also<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.160> ketone<00:03:29.490> body

acetoacetate<00:03:30.600> can<00:03:31.320> also<00:03:31.640> decarboxylase<00:03:32.640> to

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
acetoacetate can also decarboxylase to

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.660 
acetoacetate can also decarboxylase to
acetone<00:03:33.870> which<00:03:34.350> is<00:03:34.530> which<00:03:34.800> is<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.070> ketone<00:03:35.490> body
