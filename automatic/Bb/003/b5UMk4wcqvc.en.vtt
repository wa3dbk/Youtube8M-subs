00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
see in here is too small

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.359 
see in here is too small
me<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.360> electronics<00:01:34.049> do<00:01:34.290> not<00:01:34.530> get<00:01:34.740> along<00:01:34.860> I

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
me and electronics do not get along I

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.289 
me and electronics do not get along I
have<00:01:35.880> had<00:01:36.180> problems<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.750> es<00:01:37.409> C's<00:01:38.119> becs<00:01:39.119> in

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
have had problems with es C's becs in

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.870 
have had problems with es C's becs in
the<00:01:39.450> past<00:01:39.920> so<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.250> wanted<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.700> eliminate

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
the past so I just wanted to eliminate

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.530 
the past so I just wanted to eliminate
the<00:01:42.329> B<00:01:42.509> EC<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.770> went<00:01:44.009> with<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.460> flight<00:01:44.880> back

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
the B EC and I went with a flight back

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.580 
the B EC and I went with a flight back
so<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.170> flight<00:01:46.439> pack<00:01:46.740> powers<00:01:47.840> my<00:01:48.840> fly

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
so this flight pack powers my fly

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.740 
so this flight pack powers my fly
brothers<00:01:50.009> unit<00:01:50.420> it<00:01:51.420> powers<00:01:51.869> my<00:01:52.250> servos<00:01:53.250> and

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
brothers unit it powers my servos and

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.450 
brothers unit it powers my servos and
then<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.619> flight<00:01:56.280> pack<00:01:56.899> that<00:01:58.219> flies<00:01:59.219> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
then I have a flight pack that flies the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.480 
then I have a flight pack that flies the
helicopter<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.299> spins<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.200> motor

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
helicopter that spins the motor

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.230 
helicopter that spins the motor
obviously<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:04.140> build<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.710> heli<00:02:05.090> for<00:02:06.090> me

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
obviously the build on this heli for me

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.109 
obviously the build on this heli for me
it<00:02:07.110> was<00:02:07.259> pretty<00:02:07.500> self-explanatory<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:09.000> was

of the Yowie x5 highway the build one
for<00:03:16.100> me<00:03:16.310> how<00:03:16.910> I<00:03:16.940> like<00:03:17.300> it<00:03:17.510> so<00:03:18.350> far

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
for me how I like it so far

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.340 
for me how I like it so far
won't<00:03:19.430> have<00:03:19.610> two<00:03:19.940> days<00:03:20.120> but<00:03:20.540> so<00:03:20.750> far<00:03:20.989> I<00:03:21.050> really

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
won't have two days but so far I really

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.840 
won't have two days but so far I really
like<00:03:21.470> it<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:23.570> tail<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.739> everything<00:03:25.220> really

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
like it the tail and everything really

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.170 
like it the tail and everything really
like<00:03:26.180> how<00:03:26.330> solid<00:03:26.900> that<00:03:26.930> is<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.910> narrow

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
like how solid that is the narrow

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:36.100 
like how solid that is the narrow
framing<00:03:30.280> I<00:03:32.530> get<00:03:33.530> it<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:35.090> narrower<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.810> frame

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
framing I get it the narrower the frame

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.610 
framing I get it the narrower the frame
the<00:03:36.350> more<00:03:36.500> rigid<00:03:36.739> it<00:03:37.070> is<00:03:37.100> more<00:03:37.580> solid<00:03:37.880> to<00:03:38.090> this

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.479 

so<00:03:42.620> I<00:03:43.330> don't<00:03:44.330> know<00:03:44.739> we'll<00:03:45.739> see<00:03:45.769> what<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.190> ends

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
so I don't know we'll see what it ends

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.720 
so I don't know we'll see what it ends
up<00:03:46.610> like<00:03:46.850> one<00:03:47.030> of<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.209> crashes<00:03:47.720> I<00:03:47.870> guess

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
up like one of the crashes I guess

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.699 
up like one of the crashes I guess
hopefully<00:03:49.730> that<00:03:49.940> doesn't<00:03:50.150> happen<00:03:50.450> but<00:03:51.410> anyway

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
hopefully that doesn't happen but anyway

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:59.050 
hopefully that doesn't happen but anyway
that's<00:03:52.519> it<00:03:52.850> there<00:03:53.570> it<00:03:53.750> is<00:03:53.840> and<00:03:55.060> enjoy<00:03:56.060> Thanks
