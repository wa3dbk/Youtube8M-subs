00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
in the pipeline also i just want to

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.810 
in the pipeline also i just want to
point<00:00:32.590> out<00:00:32.770> none<00:00:33.070> of<00:00:33.100> these<00:00:33.280> tweaks<00:00:33.610> are

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
point out none of these tweaks are

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.810 
point out none of these tweaks are
actually<00:00:34.180> in<00:00:34.450> CT<00:00:35.140> just<00:00:35.530> yet<00:00:35.770> but<00:00:36.220> anyway<00:00:36.550> if

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
actually in CT just yet but anyway if

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.639 
actually in CT just yet but anyway if
you<00:00:36.940> guys<00:00:37.120> remember<00:00:37.329> a<00:00:37.660> while<00:00:37.870> ago<00:00:37.930> we<00:00:38.380> had<00:00:38.530> the

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
you guys remember a while ago we had the

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.500 
you guys remember a while ago we had the
very<00:00:38.920> first<00:00:39.220> weapon<00:00:39.520> and<00:00:39.850> attachment

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
very first weapon and attachment

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.540 
very first weapon and attachment
balancing<00:00:41.020> pass<00:00:41.260> so<00:00:41.890> that<00:00:42.040> means<00:00:42.250> it's<00:00:42.460> a

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
balancing pass so that means it's a

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.250 
balancing pass so that means it's a
second<00:00:43.000> time<00:00:43.210> this<00:00:43.390> will<00:00:43.570> happen<00:00:43.720> this<00:00:44.199> time

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
second time this will happen this time

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.990 
second time this will happen this time
around<00:00:44.590> the<00:00:44.890> main<00:00:45.129> goals<00:00:45.399> have<00:00:45.670> better

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
around the main goals have better

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.569 
around the main goals have better
defined<00:00:46.539> roles<00:00:46.809> of<00:00:47.079> primary<00:00:47.680> weapons<00:00:48.100> to

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
defined roles of primary weapons to

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.819 
defined roles of primary weapons to
clarify<00:00:49.180> their<00:00:49.570> differences<00:00:50.199> in<00:00:50.350> a<00:00:50.440> number<00:00:50.800> of

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
clarify their differences in a number of

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.250 
clarify their differences in a number of
areas<00:00:51.250> which<00:00:51.760> sounds<00:00:52.239> like<00:00:52.329> maybe<00:00:52.570> dice<00:00:52.929> want

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
areas which sounds like maybe dice want

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.169 
areas which sounds like maybe dice want
to<00:00:53.350> increase<00:00:53.679> your<00:00:53.739> overall<00:00:54.370> skill<00:00:54.760> cap<00:00:55.000> in

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
to increase your overall skill cap in

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.299 
to increase your overall skill cap in
the<00:00:55.210> game<00:00:55.480> when<00:00:56.019> it<00:00:56.140> comes<00:00:56.350> to<00:00:56.500> gun<00:00:56.739> play<00:00:56.980> like

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
the game when it comes to gun play like

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.189 
the game when it comes to gun play like
for<00:00:57.519> example<00:00:57.609> that<00:00:58.089> wants<00:00:58.390> to<00:00:58.449> bring<00:00:58.660> back<00:00:58.929> the

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
for example that wants to bring back the

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.380 
for example that wants to bring back the
whole<00:00:59.410> two-shot<00:01:00.129> head<00:01:00.370> shot<00:01:00.609> kills<00:01:00.879> i'm

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
whole two-shot head shot kills i'm

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.060 
whole two-shot head shot kills i'm
guessing<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.839> headshot<00:01:02.289> multiplier<00:01:02.469> is

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
guessing the headshot multiplier is

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.220 
guessing the headshot multiplier is
going<00:01:03.339> to<00:01:03.489> be<00:01:03.670> increase<00:01:04.360> which<00:01:04.629> i<00:01:04.780> totally

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
going to be increase which i totally

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.350 
going to be increase which i totally
agree<00:01:05.620> with<00:01:06.070> i<00:01:06.280> think<00:01:06.550> that's<00:01:06.820> a<00:01:06.910> good<00:01:07.090> start

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
agree with i think that's a good start

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.120 
agree with i think that's a good start
to<00:01:07.510> raise<00:01:07.720> a<00:01:07.750> skill<00:01:08.200> cap<00:01:08.440> of<00:01:08.620> the<00:01:08.650> game<00:01:08.950> and

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
to raise a skill cap of the game and

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.980 
to raise a skill cap of the game and
overall<00:01:09.490> just<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.820> make<00:01:10.000> headshots<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.630> little

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
overall just to make headshots a little

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.050 
overall just to make headshots a little
more<00:01:11.170> meaningful<00:01:11.800> we<00:01:12.280> can<00:01:12.430> argue<00:01:12.580> at<00:01:12.909> the

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
more meaningful we can argue at the

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.030 
more meaningful we can argue at the
moment<00:01:13.450> beer<00:01:13.600> for<00:01:13.870> doesn't<00:01:14.350> require<00:01:14.650> the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
moment beer for doesn't require the

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.550 
moment beer for doesn't require the
highest<00:01:15.610> level<00:01:16.000> of<00:01:16.030> skill<00:01:16.420> but<00:01:17.050> it<00:01:17.170> seems<00:01:17.440> like

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
highest level of skill but it seems like

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.290 
highest level of skill but it seems like
the<00:01:17.800> whole<00:01:17.920> two<00:01:18.190> shot<00:01:18.460> head<00:01:18.700> shots<00:01:18.940> will<00:01:19.090> only

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
the whole two shot head shots will only

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.750 
the whole two shot head shots will only
be<00:01:19.540> capable<00:01:20.140> at<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.440> optimal<00:01:20.950> ranges<00:01:21.520> which

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
be capable at the optimal ranges which

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.610 
be capable at the optimal ranges which
sounds<00:01:22.510> like<00:01:22.630> that's<00:01:22.780> only<00:01:23.020> for<00:01:23.260> close<00:01:23.470> range

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
sounds like that's only for close range

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.400 
sounds like that's only for close range
but<00:01:24.130> not<00:01:24.340> entirely<00:01:24.790> sure<00:01:25.200> according<00:01:26.200> to<00:01:26.230> the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
but not entirely sure according to the

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.040 
but not entirely sure according to the
CT<00:01:26.800> ready<00:01:27.070> page<00:01:27.370> the<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:28.090> hit<00:01:28.330> kill<00:01:28.600> will<00:01:28.810> vary

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
CT ready page the to hit kill will vary

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.570 
CT ready page the to hit kill will vary
from<00:01:29.200> weapons<00:01:29.650> to<00:01:29.710> weapon<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:30.280> won't<00:01:30.490> be

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
from weapons to weapon and won't be

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.120 
from weapons to weapon and won't be
available<00:01:31.000> to<00:01:31.360> all<00:01:31.540> guns<00:01:31.900> that<00:01:32.530> kind<00:01:32.800> of<00:01:32.860> leads

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
available to all guns that kind of leads

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.190 
available to all guns that kind of leads
me<00:01:33.370> towards<00:01:33.880> maybe<00:01:34.120> weapons<00:01:34.630> I<00:01:34.750> have<00:01:34.870> a<00:01:34.900> low

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
me towards maybe weapons I have a low

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.940 
me towards maybe weapons I have a low
close<00:01:35.620> range<00:01:35.920> damage<00:01:36.220> like<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.910> jst<00:01:37.600> PDW<00:01:38.320> even

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
close range damage like the jst PDW even

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.770 
close range damage like the jst PDW even
with<00:01:39.100> a<00:01:39.130> higher<00:01:39.520> headshot<00:01:40.090> multiplier<00:01:40.240> it

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
with a higher headshot multiplier it

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.050 
with a higher headshot multiplier it
still<00:01:41.080> won't<00:01:41.530> be<00:01:41.710> a<00:01:41.740> two-shot<00:01:42.400> kill<00:01:42.670> in<00:01:42.790> close

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
still won't be a two-shot kill in close

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.510 
still won't be a two-shot kill in close
range<00:01:43.210> which<00:01:43.990> i<00:01:44.140> think<00:01:44.200> is<00:01:44.470> okay<00:01:44.860> for<00:01:44.890> balance

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
range which i think is okay for balance

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.100 
range which i think is okay for balance
and<00:01:45.610> reasons<00:01:46.090> if<00:01:46.240> all<00:01:46.420> weapons<00:01:46.810> had<00:01:46.990> the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
and reasons if all weapons had the

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.590 
and reasons if all weapons had the
ability<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:47.710> do<00:01:47.830> a<00:01:47.860> two<00:01:48.010> hit<00:01:48.430> kill<00:01:48.670> within<00:01:49.000> 11

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
ability to do a two hit kill within 11

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.900 
ability to do a two hit kill within 11
meters<00:01:49.900> or<00:01:50.050> so<00:01:50.230> my<00:01:50.740> kind<00:01:51.040> of<00:01:51.160> screw-up<00:01:51.550> with

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
meters or so my kind of screw-up with

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.240 
meters or so my kind of screw-up with
the<00:01:52.120> weapon<00:01:52.510> balanced<00:01:52.870> quite<00:01:53.230> a<00:01:53.260> lot<00:01:53.560> which

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
the weapon balanced quite a lot which

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.340 
the weapon balanced quite a lot which
brings<00:01:54.490> me<00:01:54.700> to<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.060> next<00:01:55.090> topic<00:01:55.510> was<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:56.050> little

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
brings me to the next topic was a little

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.260 
brings me to the next topic was a little
bit<00:01:56.500> confused<00:01:56.980> about<00:01:57.070> this<00:01:57.460> image<00:01:57.880> though

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
bit confused about this image though

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.960 
bit confused about this image though
it's<00:01:58.600> being<00:01:58.960> named<00:01:59.320> as<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.620> new<00:02:00.010> damage<00:02:00.610> model

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
it's being named as the new damage model

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.360 
it's being named as the new damage model
as<00:02:01.060> we<00:02:01.570> can<00:02:01.720> see<00:02:01.930> it<00:02:02.080> looks<00:02:02.260> like<00:02:02.470> it's<00:02:02.830> a<00:02:02.950> kind

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
as we can see it looks like it's a kind

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.490 
as we can see it looks like it's a kind
of<00:02:03.610> three<00:02:04.240> stage<00:02:04.600> model<00:02:05.020> it<00:02:05.230> looks<00:02:05.440> like

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
of three stage model it looks like

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.440 
of three stage model it looks like
weapons<00:02:05.830> will<00:02:06.190> be<00:02:06.220> most<00:02:06.550> effective<00:02:07.150> at<00:02:07.300> close

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
weapons will be most effective at close

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.690 
weapons will be most effective at close
range<00:02:07.870> or<00:02:08.110> within<00:02:08.560> that<00:02:08.800> red<00:02:09.069> zone<00:02:09.340> so<00:02:09.610> I'm

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
range or within that red zone so I'm

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.009 
range or within that red zone so I'm
assuming<00:02:09.849> that's<00:02:10.209> where<00:02:10.420> all<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.539> damage

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
assuming that's where all the damage

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.259 
assuming that's where all the damage
will<00:02:11.170> be<00:02:11.200> then<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.160> middle<00:02:12.489> orangey<00:02:13.239> yellow

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
will be then the middle orangey yellow

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.839 
will be then the middle orangey yellow
fall<00:02:14.140> off<00:02:14.260> zone<00:02:14.500> will<00:02:14.709> be<00:02:14.739> when<00:02:15.099> damage<00:02:15.550> starts

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
fall off zone will be when damage starts

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.520 
fall off zone will be when damage starts
to<00:02:15.940> fall<00:02:16.120> off<00:02:16.300> then<00:02:16.569> proceeds<00:02:17.050> into<00:02:17.290> the

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
to fall off then proceeds into the

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.040 
to fall off then proceeds into the
bluish<00:02:18.040> type<00:02:18.370> zone<00:02:18.670> where<00:02:18.940> damage<00:02:19.540> will<00:02:19.810> be<00:02:19.930> at

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
bluish type zone where damage will be at

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.380 
bluish type zone where damage will be at
a<00:02:20.080> minimum<00:02:20.530> but<00:02:20.830> knows<00:02:21.280> how<00:02:21.580> suppression<00:02:22.270> will

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
a minimum but knows how suppression will

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.920 
a minimum but knows how suppression will
start<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.780> kick<00:02:23.020> in<00:02:23.050> and

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
start to kick in and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.929 
start to kick in and
this<00:02:24.049> is<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.290> pretty<00:02:24.739> big<00:02:25.010> change<00:02:25.370> here<00:02:25.640> looks

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
this is a pretty big change here looks

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.030 
this is a pretty big change here looks
like<00:02:26.090> suppression<00:02:26.719> will<00:02:26.870> only<00:02:27.049> take<00:02:27.379> place<00:02:27.650> in

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
like suppression will only take place in

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.309 
like suppression will only take place in
this<00:02:28.129> blue<00:02:28.430> zone<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:29.030> onwards<00:02:29.510> I'm<00:02:29.719> not

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
this blue zone and onwards I'm not

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.530 
this blue zone and onwards I'm not
entirely<00:02:30.680> sure<00:02:30.859> of<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.340> exact<00:02:31.819> distance<00:02:32.060> but

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
entirely sure of the exact distance but

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.360 
entirely sure of the exact distance but
I'm<00:02:32.629> guessing<00:02:33.109> maybe<00:02:33.319> this<00:02:33.560> blue<00:02:33.739> zone<00:02:34.129> is<00:02:34.340> a

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
I'm guessing maybe this blue zone is a

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.509 
I'm guessing maybe this blue zone is a
bad<00:02:34.700> 40<00:02:35.659> meters<00:02:35.989> away<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.500> this<00:02:37.010> looks<00:02:37.250> about

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
bad 40 meters away and this looks about

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.130 
bad 40 meters away and this looks about
right<00:02:37.790> because<00:02:38.269> those<00:02:38.569> mention<00:02:39.049> that

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
right because those mention that

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.559 
right because those mention that
suppression<00:02:39.560> will<00:02:39.920> not<00:02:40.129> affect<00:02:40.609> the<00:02:40.730> optimal

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
suppression will not affect the optimal

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.569 
suppression will not affect the optimal
range<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.139> that<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:42.709> will<00:02:42.799> only<00:02:42.980> affect<00:02:43.219> the

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
range and that it will only affect the

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.670 
range and that it will only affect the
fall-off<00:02:43.879> ranges<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:44.689> beyond<00:02:45.019> which<00:02:45.290> like<00:02:45.500> I

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
fall-off ranges and beyond which like I

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.580 
fall-off ranges and beyond which like I
said<00:02:45.709> I'm<00:02:46.040> guessing<00:02:46.489> is<00:02:46.670> this<00:02:47.000> blue<00:02:47.420> zone<00:02:47.659> so

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
said I'm guessing is this blue zone so

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.679 
said I'm guessing is this blue zone so
far<00:02:48.859> honestly<00:02:49.370> I'm<00:02:49.639> okay<00:02:50.000> with<00:02:50.209> this<00:02:50.420> I<00:02:50.629> do

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
far honestly I'm okay with this I do

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.780 
far honestly I'm okay with this I do
think<00:02:51.170> suppression<00:02:51.799> needs<00:02:52.040> some<00:02:52.250> tweaks<00:02:52.549> and

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
think suppression needs some tweaks and

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.160 
think suppression needs some tweaks and
you<00:02:52.849> might<00:02:53.030> be<00:02:53.060> wondering<00:02:53.209> with<00:02:53.810> this<00:02:53.989> new

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
you might be wondering with this new

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.440 
you might be wondering with this new
damage<00:02:54.650> more<00:02:54.859> what<00:02:55.459> will<00:02:55.670> it<00:02:55.700> achieve<00:02:56.209> it

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
damage more what will it achieve it

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.240 
damage more what will it achieve it
sounds<00:02:56.870> like<00:02:57.019> it's<00:02:57.230> going<00:02:57.439> to<00:02:57.620> be<00:02:57.769> more<00:02:58.069> or

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
sounds like it's going to be more or

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.670 
sounds like it's going to be more or
less<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.669> tool<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.510> reposition<00:02:59.750> yourself<00:03:00.349> in

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
less a tool to reposition yourself in

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.379 
less a tool to reposition yourself in
combat<00:03:01.099> I<00:03:01.280> don't<00:03:01.879> know<00:03:02.030> if<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.239> average

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.389 
combat I don't know if the average

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.539 
combat I don't know if the average
player<00:03:02.930> is<00:03:03.079> going<00:03:03.409> to<00:03:03.560> think<00:03:03.859> like<00:03:04.040> that<00:03:04.250> but

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
player is going to think like that but

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.879 
player is going to think like that but
we'll<00:03:04.970> see<00:03:05.150> what<00:03:05.269> happens<00:03:05.389> in<00:03:05.750> CT<00:03:06.230> there's

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
we'll see what happens in CT there's

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.009 
we'll see what happens in CT there's
also<00:03:07.099> some<00:03:07.430> other<00:03:07.459> proposed<00:03:08.150> weeks<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.750> quote

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
not too sure what that means by reducing

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.909 
not too sure what that means by reducing

by<00:03:48.470> now<00:03:48.650> shotguns<00:03:49.189> can<00:03:49.639> be<00:03:49.849> somewhat

by now shotguns can be somewhat

by now shotguns can be somewhat
inconsistent<00:03:50.810> at<00:03:51.319> times<00:03:51.459> so<00:03:52.459> let's<00:03:52.879> move<00:03:53.060> on

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209

out he does pose a lot of good info but

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.550 
out he does pose a lot of good info but
it<00:04:05.090> looks<00:04:05.269> like<00:04:05.419> all<00:04:05.569> grips<00:04:05.900> in<00:04:06.079> the<00:04:06.169> game<00:04:06.349> will

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
it looks like all grips in the game will

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.589 
it looks like all grips in the game will
receive<00:04:06.889> a<00:04:07.069> slight<00:04:07.579> knife<00:04:07.849> and<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.150> form<00:04:08.449> of

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
receive a slight knife and a form of

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.199 
receive a slight knife and a form of
slower<00:04:09.019> spread<00:04:09.620> decrease<00:04:09.919> which<00:04:10.519> means<00:04:10.790> it'll

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
slower spread decrease which means it'll

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.879 
slower spread decrease which means it'll
take<00:04:11.419> longer<00:04:11.689> for<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:12.019> spread<00:04:12.349> of<00:04:12.409> your<00:04:12.620> balls

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
take longer for the spread of your balls

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.949 
take longer for the spread of your balls
to<00:04:13.099> reset<00:04:13.609> if<00:04:13.759> you<00:04:13.909> have<00:04:14.090> a<00:04:14.120> grip<00:04:14.540> attached

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
to reset if you have a grip attached

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.990 
to reset if you have a grip attached
which<00:04:15.590> I<00:04:15.680> know<00:04:15.829> sounds<00:04:15.859> like<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:16.400> nerve<00:04:16.699> but

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
which I know sounds like a nerve but

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.670 
which I know sounds like a nerve but
when<00:04:17.299> we<00:04:17.419> do<00:04:17.539> the<00:04:17.659> math<00:04:17.870> will<00:04:18.109> only<00:04:18.289> take<00:04:18.530> an

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
when we do the math will only take an

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.729 
when we do the math will only take an
additional<00:04:18.919> 15<00:04:19.880> milliseconds<00:04:20.329> or<00:04:20.840> so<00:04:21.079> for<00:04:21.650> the

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
additional 15 milliseconds or so for the

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.680 
additional 15 milliseconds or so for the
spread<00:04:22.009> to<00:04:22.190> reset<00:04:22.580> compared<00:04:23.000> to<00:04:23.150> normal<00:04:23.300> which

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
spread to reset compared to normal which

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.330 
spread to reset compared to normal which
makes<00:04:23.990> me<00:04:24.169> wonder<00:04:24.349> what's<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:24.860> point<00:04:25.280> of

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
makes me wonder what's the point of

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.189 
makes me wonder what's the point of
changing<00:04:25.610> it<00:04:25.909> anyway<00:04:26.240> doesn't<00:04:26.840> seem<00:04:26.960> like<00:04:27.020> it

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
changing it anyway doesn't seem like it

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.439 
changing it anyway doesn't seem like it
will<00:04:27.470> dramatically<00:04:28.159> change<00:04:28.280> gameplay<00:04:29.120> in

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
will dramatically change gameplay in

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.330 
will dramatically change gameplay in
terms<00:04:29.930> of<00:04:30.110> stats<00:04:30.409> it<00:04:30.560> looks<00:04:30.710> like<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:31.070> grips

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
terms of stats it looks like the grips

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.000 
terms of stats it looks like the grips
are<00:04:31.550> going<00:04:31.789> from<00:04:31.969> a<00:04:32.169> 1.0<00:04:33.169> spread<00:04:33.740> decrease

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
are going from a 1.0 spread decrease

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.090 
are going from a 1.0 spread decrease
multiplied<00:04:35.349> 2.66

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
multiplied 2.66

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.070

even<00:04:37.580> though<00:04:37.640> like<00:04:37.880> I<00:04:38.000> said<00:04:38.240> at<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.480> end<00:04:38.570> we'll

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
even though like I said at the end we'll

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.170 
even though like I said at the end we'll
make<00:04:39.380> hardly<00:04:40.070> any<00:04:40.250> difference<00:04:40.430> but<00:04:40.850> I<00:04:40.970> think

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
make hardly any difference but I think

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.940 
make hardly any difference but I think
dice<00:04:41.420> wants<00:04:41.870> a<00:04:41.930> move<00:04:42.110> away<00:04:42.260> from<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:42.680> hole

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
using any kind of group is a no-brainer

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.830

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
don't understand why but like I said

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.280 
don't understand why but like I said
we'll<00:04:50.390> see<00:04:50.420> what<00:04:50.660> happens<00:04:50.810> in<00:04:51.170> the<00:04:51.230> next

justification<00:05:14.750> and<00:05:15.680> it<00:05:16.010> seems<00:05:16.400> like<00:05:16.580> they

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
justification and it seems like they

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.610 
justification and it seems like they
just<00:05:16.940> want<00:05:17.210> to<00:05:17.300> reduce<00:05:17.660> its<00:05:18.050> effectiveness

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
just want to reduce its effectiveness

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.130 
just want to reduce its effectiveness
because<00:05:18.980> when<00:05:19.460> an<00:05:19.640> attachment<00:05:20.030> is<00:05:20.420> equally

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
because when an attachment is equally

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.470 
because when an attachment is equally
viable<00:05:21.500> on<00:05:21.890> a<00:05:21.920> slow<00:05:22.580> rate<00:05:22.760> of<00:05:22.820> fire<00:05:22.940> weapon

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
viable on a slow rate of fire weapon

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.600 
viable on a slow rate of fire weapon
versus<00:05:23.930> a<00:05:24.050> high<00:05:24.350> rate<00:05:24.710> of<00:05:24.740> fire<00:05:24.860> weapon<00:05:25.400> like

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
versus a high rate of fire weapon like

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.880 
versus a high rate of fire weapon like
the<00:05:25.850> AEK<00:05:26.390> even<00:05:27.080> though<00:05:27.170> those<00:05:27.410> are<00:05:27.470> two

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
the AEK even though those are two

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.190 
the AEK even though those are two
completely<00:05:28.370> different<00:05:28.640> weapons<00:05:29.480> it<00:05:29.660> doesn't

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
completely different weapons it doesn't

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.590 
completely different weapons it doesn't
exactly<00:05:30.560> make<00:05:30.980> sense<00:05:31.370> which<00:05:31.670> to<00:05:32.120> be<00:05:32.240> honest<00:05:32.480> I

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
exactly make sense which to be honest I

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.450 
exactly make sense which to be honest I
disagree<00:05:33.170> with<00:05:33.410> but<00:05:33.620> it<00:05:33.770> sounds<00:05:34.190> like<00:05:34.280> this

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
disagree with but it sounds like this

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.490 
disagree with but it sounds like this
week<00:05:34.790> will<00:05:35.030> just<00:05:35.210> be<00:05:35.330> a<00:05:35.360> trial<00:05:35.810> to<00:05:35.990> see<00:05:36.140> how<00:05:36.320> it

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
week will just be a trial to see how it

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.470 
week will just be a trial to see how it
affects<00:05:36.740> gameplay<00:05:37.220> I<00:05:37.490> don't<00:05:38.000> see<00:05:38.210> why<00:05:38.420> the

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
affects gameplay I don't see why the

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.390 
affects gameplay I don't see why the
angled<00:05:39.050> grip<00:05:39.050> needs<00:05:39.410> to<00:05:39.590> be<00:05:39.710> changed<00:05:39.980> maybe

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
angled grip needs to be changed maybe

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.280 
angled grip needs to be changed maybe
we're<00:05:40.700> going<00:05:40.880> to<00:05:41.060> see<00:05:41.240> some<00:05:41.510> pretty<00:05:41.900> drastic

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
we're going to see some pretty drastic

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.010 
we're going to see some pretty drastic
weapons<00:05:42.980> week<00:05:43.220> soon<00:05:43.520> and<00:05:43.910> maybe<00:05:44.450> these<00:05:44.720> weeks

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
weapons week soon and maybe these weeks

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.810 
weapons week soon and maybe these weeks
of<00:05:45.230> the<00:05:45.290> grips<00:05:45.530> will<00:05:45.710> make<00:05:45.860> sense<00:05:46.100> in<00:05:46.370> time<00:05:46.610> but

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
of the grips will make sense in time but

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.400 
of the grips will make sense in time but
at<00:05:46.940> the<00:05:47.090> moment<00:05:47.210> it<00:05:47.600> doesn't<00:05:47.960> really<00:05:48.230> make

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
at the moment it doesn't really make

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.710 
at the moment it doesn't really make
sense<00:05:48.470> to<00:05:48.890> me<00:05:49.040> and<00:05:49.250> the<00:05:50.000> stubby<00:05:50.270> grip<00:05:50.390> has

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
sense to me and the stubby grip has

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.420 
sense to me and the stubby grip has
actually<00:05:51.110> been<00:05:51.320> buffed<00:05:51.680> believe<00:05:52.100> it<00:05:52.220> or<00:05:52.310> not

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
actually been buffed believe it or not

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.310 
actually been buffed believe it or not
it's<00:05:52.610> spread<00:05:52.970> increase<00:05:53.120> per<00:05:53.570> shot<00:05:53.780> multiplier

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
it's spread increase per shot multiplier

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.970 
it's spread increase per shot multiplier
is<00:05:54.560> going<00:05:54.800> from<00:05:55.070> point<00:05:55.340> eight<00:05:55.610> five<00:05:56.050> 2.80<00:05:57.050> so

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 
is going from point eight five 2.80 so

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.890 
is going from point eight five 2.80 so
it<00:05:58.250> will<00:05:58.400> reduce<00:05:58.610> spread<00:05:59.090> increase<00:05:59.210> per<00:05:59.660> shot

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
it will reduce spread increase per shot

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.900 
it will reduce spread increase per shot
by<00:06:00.110> twenty<00:06:00.620> percent<00:06:00.920> up<00:06:01.130> from<00:06:01.340> fifteen

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
by twenty percent up from fifteen

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.850 
by twenty percent up from fifteen
percent<00:06:02.240> which<00:06:02.480> even<00:06:03.140> though<00:06:03.230> it's<00:06:03.380> only<00:06:03.500> 5%

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
percent which even though it's only 5%

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.520 
percent which even though it's only 5%
extra<00:06:04.490> it's<00:06:04.640> still<00:06:04.820> a<00:06:04.910> nice<00:06:05.120> increase<00:06:05.780> I<00:06:06.020> hope

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
extra it's still a nice increase I hope

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.590 
extra it's still a nice increase I hope
the<00:06:06.680> ogre<00:06:07.070> and<00:06:07.100> vertical<00:06:07.910> grip<00:06:08.090> kind<00:06:08.360> of<00:06:08.480> see

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
the ogre and vertical grip kind of see

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.450 
the ogre and vertical grip kind of see
similar<00:06:09.080> tweak<00:06:09.410> so<00:06:09.560> it's<00:06:09.710> multipliers<00:06:10.280> as

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
similar tweak so it's multipliers as

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.490 
similar tweak so it's multipliers as
well<00:06:10.610> or<00:06:10.850> else<00:06:10.880> the<00:06:11.300> subby<00:06:11.690> group<00:06:11.960> is<00:06:12.110> going<00:06:12.350> to

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
well or else the subby group is going to

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.860 
well or else the subby group is going to
be<00:06:12.590> even<00:06:12.770> more<00:06:13.100> of<00:06:13.220> a<00:06:13.370> go-to<00:06:13.880> attachment<00:06:14.660> for<00:06:14.840> a

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
be even more of a go-to attachment for a

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.260 
be even more of a go-to attachment for a
lot<00:06:15.080> of<00:06:15.200> weapons<00:06:15.410> but<00:06:16.160> overall<00:06:16.580> I<00:06:16.790> know<00:06:16.850> this

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
lot of weapons but overall I know this

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.990 
lot of weapons but overall I know this
is<00:06:17.420> some<00:06:17.600> fairly<00:06:18.050> major<00:06:18.440> tweaks<00:06:19.010> but<00:06:19.340> honestly

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
is some fairly major tweaks but honestly

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.520 
is some fairly major tweaks but honestly
I<00:06:20.120> just<00:06:20.270> think<00:06:20.690> dies<00:06:20.930> should<00:06:21.290> leave

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
I just think dies should leave

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.380 
I just think dies should leave
attachments<00:06:22.250> alone<00:06:22.490> I<00:06:22.730> don't<00:06:23.090> know<00:06:23.240> if<00:06:23.330> you

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.390 
attachments alone I don't know if you

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.690 
attachments alone I don't know if you
guys<00:06:23.600> will<00:06:23.870> agree<00:06:23.960> with<00:06:24.170> me<00:06:24.350> or<00:06:24.530> not<00:06:24.680> maybe<00:06:25.490> you

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
guys will agree with me or not maybe you

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.370 
guys will agree with me or not maybe you
think<00:06:25.820> some<00:06:26.030> attachments<00:06:26.690> like<00:06:26.720> a<00:06:26.810> slight

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
think some attachments like a slight

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.960 
think some attachments like a slight
nerf<00:06:27.710> here<00:06:28.130> are<00:06:28.220> there<00:06:28.370> but<00:06:28.580> I<00:06:28.610> just<00:06:28.880> think

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
nerf here are there but I just think

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.940 
nerf here are there but I just think
seeing<00:06:29.720> as<00:06:29.900> we're<00:06:30.110> going<00:06:30.290> into<00:06:30.530> another

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 
seeing as we're going into another

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.340 
seeing as we're going into another
weapon<00:06:31.370> balancing<00:06:32.090> pass<00:06:32.300> on<00:06:32.600> CT<00:06:33.080> that's

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
weapon balancing pass on CT that's

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.770 
weapon balancing pass on CT that's
probably<00:06:33.770> going<00:06:34.040> to<00:06:34.160> change<00:06:34.610> quite<00:06:35.180> a<00:06:35.240> lot<00:06:35.540> is

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
probably going to change quite a lot is

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.720 
probably going to change quite a lot is
it<00:06:36.320> a<00:06:36.410> good<00:06:36.620> idea<00:06:36.680> to<00:06:36.980> also<00:06:37.280> change

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:37.730 
it a good idea to also change

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.880 
it a good idea to also change
attachments<00:06:38.570> as<00:06:38.690> well<00:06:38.930> I've<00:06:39.200> always<00:06:39.620> thought

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:39.890 
attachments as well I've always thought

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.500 
attachments as well I've always thought
though<00:06:40.100> well<00:06:40.340> balanced<00:06:40.820> I<00:06:40.940> can't<00:06:41.210> say<00:06:41.450> for

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.510 
though well balanced I can't say for

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.450 
though well balanced I can't say for
hardline<00:06:42.140> their<00:06:42.380> attachments<00:06:43.070> in<00:06:43.160> their<00:06:43.310> game

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
hardline their attachments in their game

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.400 
hardline their attachments in their game
I<00:06:43.490> pretty<00:06:44.060> damn<00:06:44.360> powerful<00:06:44.660> but<00:06:45.290> that's

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.410 
I pretty damn powerful but that's

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.310 
I pretty damn powerful but that's
