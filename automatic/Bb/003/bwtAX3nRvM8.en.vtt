the<00:00:00.179> air-intake<00:00:00.960> mod<00:00:01.740> to<00:00:02.040> my<00:00:03.380> $99<00:00:04.879> 1500

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550 
the air-intake mod to my $99 1500

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:16.129 
the air-intake mod to my $99 1500
basically<00:00:10.160> gotta<00:00:11.160> be<00:00:11.990> pulling<00:00:12.990> off<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:15.139> air

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
basically gotta be pulling off that air

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.650 
basically gotta be pulling off that air
intake<00:00:16.710> an<00:00:17.550> air<00:00:17.730> cleaner<00:00:17.940> system<00:00:19.160> and<00:00:20.510> I'll<00:00:21.510> be

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
intake an air cleaner system and I'll be

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.630 
intake an air cleaner system and I'll be
replacing<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.289> with<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> circular<00:00:23.310> dial<00:00:25.640> and

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
replacing it with a circular dial and

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.130 
replacing it with a circular dial and
just<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.150> little<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:28.080> know<00:00:28.109> very<00:00:28.859> minor<00:00:29.099> stuff

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
just a little you know very minor stuff

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.100 
just a little you know very minor stuff
probably<00:00:31.140> pull<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.790> hose<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.870> valve

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
probably pull that hose to that valve

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.799 
probably pull that hose to that valve
cover<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.500> put<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> filter<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.300> then<00:00:36.780> a

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
cover and put a filter on it and then a

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.709 
cover and put a filter on it and then a
circular<00:00:37.230> air<00:00:37.380> filter<00:00:37.680> like<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> old<00:00:38.070> style

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
circular air filter like the old style

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.780 
circular air filter like the old style
muscle<00:00:39.719> cars<00:00:40.129> and<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.309> eliminate<00:00:41.670> this

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
muscle cars and just eliminate this

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.030 
muscle cars and just eliminate this
whole<00:00:41.969> intake<00:00:42.300> system<00:00:42.629> all<00:00:42.719> together<00:00:43.040> there's

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
whole intake system all together there's

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.990 
whole intake system all together there's
the<00:00:44.250> new<00:00:44.370> air<00:00:44.520> cleaner<00:00:45.829> and<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.879> what

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the new air cleaner and this is what

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.910 
the new air cleaner and this is what
putting<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.899> valve<00:00:49.620> cover<00:00:51.739> already<00:00:52.739> did<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
putting on the valve cover already did a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:02.060 
putting on the valve cover already did a
mod<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.910> my<00:00:54.739> my<00:00:56.059> 2001<00:00:57.059> Dodge<00:00:57.750> Durango<00:01:01.070> already

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
mod to my my 2001 Dodge Durango already

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.990 
mod to my my 2001 Dodge Durango already
did<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.960> air<00:01:03.960> intake<00:01:04.530> mod<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:07.850> went<00:01:08.850> with

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
did a air intake mod to it and went with

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.420 
did a air intake mod to it and went with
a<00:01:09.030> dual<00:01:09.360> snorkel<00:01:09.900> style<00:01:10.260> got<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.130> eBay

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
a dual snorkel style got this on eBay

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.800 
a dual snorkel style got this on eBay
and<00:01:11.939> then<00:01:12.689> another<00:01:12.990> small<00:01:13.939> side<00:01:14.939> vent<00:01:15.270> for<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
and then another small side vent for the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.410 
and then another small side vent for the
I<00:01:16.280> believe<00:01:17.280> that's<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> PCV<00:01:17.970> valve<00:01:18.770> intake

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
I believe that's the PCV valve intake

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.300 
I believe that's the PCV valve intake
but<00:01:21.420> there<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.049> suction<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.159> just

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
but there is suction on it so I just

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.649 
but there is suction on it so I just
added<00:01:23.430> another<00:01:23.700> filter<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.270> instead<00:01:24.509> of

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
added another filter to it instead of

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.570 
added another filter to it instead of
running<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.930> hose<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> backside<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.070> that

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
running a hose to the backside of that

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.819 
running a hose to the backside of that
air<00:01:27.390> cleaner<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.780> connecting<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.350> there<00:01:28.560> just

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
air cleaner and connecting it there just

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.870 
air cleaner and connecting it there just
didn't<00:01:29.070> look<00:01:29.159> good<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:30.329> what<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:30.869> works

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
didn't look good so what this works

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.300 
didn't look good so what this works
works<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.180> functions<00:01:33.329> perfect<00:01:34.130> but<00:01:35.130> they

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
works and functions perfect but they

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.429 
works and functions perfect but they
don't<00:01:35.460> make<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.640> style<00:01:35.939> like<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> 5.9

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
don't make a style like this for a 5.9

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.760 
don't make a style like this for a 5.9
liter<00:01:37.470> which<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.009> what<00:01:38.159> my<00:01:38.310> Dodge<00:01:38.759> Ram<00:01:39.030> has<00:01:39.770> but

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
liter which is what my Dodge Ram has but

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.539 
liter which is what my Dodge Ram has but
the<00:01:40.950> 4.7<00:01:41.729> liter<00:01:42.320> makes<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.560> unique<00:01:44.369> little

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
the 4.7 liter makes a unique little

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.969 
the 4.7 liter makes a unique little
style<00:01:45.000> that's<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.390> twin<00:01:45.740> basically<00:01:46.740> twin

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
style that's a twin basically twin

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.850 
style that's a twin basically twin
snorkel<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.299> see<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.380> works<00:01:49.759> perfect

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
snorkel as you see and it works perfect

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.270 
snorkel as you see and it works perfect
okay<00:01:53.060> we<00:01:54.060> just<00:01:54.090> finished<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.780> modification

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.300 

and<00:01:58.370> this<00:01:58.880> is<00:01:59.120> what<00:01:59.390> it<00:01:59.480> looks<00:01:59.600> like<00:01:59.720> now

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.250 

basically<00:02:04.310> we<00:02:04.700> just<00:02:04.870> had<00:02:05.870> to<00:02:05.960> do<00:02:06.050> some

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
basically we just had to do some

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.719 
basically we just had to do some
modification<00:02:06.860> that<00:02:07.390> threaded<00:02:09.100> rod<00:02:10.100> that<00:02:10.520> came

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
modification that threaded rod that came

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.750 
modification that threaded rod that came
with<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:10.970> because<00:02:11.300> it<00:02:11.570> did<00:02:11.840> not<00:02:12.220> of<00:02:13.220> course<00:02:13.490> you

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
with it because it did not of course you

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.140 
with it because it did not of course you
know<00:02:13.850> not<00:02:14.120> line<00:02:14.330> up<00:02:14.360> you<00:02:14.660> had<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.900> modify<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:15.709> to

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
know not line up you had to modify it to

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.270 
know not line up you had to modify it to
make<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.360> fit<00:02:17.840> we<00:02:18.260> had<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.440> put<00:02:18.560> an<00:02:18.650> S<00:02:18.770> angle<00:02:19.160> in

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
make it fit we had to put an S angle in

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.000 
make it fit we had to put an S angle in
it<00:02:19.420> but<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:20.990> tight<00:02:21.290> in<00:02:21.440> there<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:21.620> can't<00:02:21.920> really

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
it but so tight in there I can't really

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.650 
it but so tight in there I can't really
get<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.220> cover<00:02:22.490> off<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.730> show<00:02:23.120> but<00:02:23.450> yeah<00:02:23.630> I

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
get the cover off the show but yeah I

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.380 
get the cover off the show but yeah I
just<00:02:23.930> have<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.170> kind<00:02:24.350> of<00:02:24.459> cut<00:02:25.459> a<00:02:25.670> good<00:02:26.000> couple

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
just have to kind of cut a good couple

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.060 
just have to kind of cut a good couple
inches<00:02:26.540> off<00:02:26.810> of<00:02:27.020> that<00:02:27.310> threaded<00:02:28.310> rod<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:30.070> bend

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
inches off of that threaded rod and bend

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.130 
inches off of that threaded rod and bend
it<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.730> maybe<00:02:32.030> about<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.330> half<00:02:32.390> inch<00:02:32.810> from

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
it to maybe about a half inch from

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.610 
it to maybe about a half inch from
straight<00:02:33.770> and<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:35.150> half<00:02:35.330> inch<00:02:35.540> maybe<00:02:35.810> close<00:02:36.590> to

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
straight and a half inch maybe close to

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.670 
straight and a half inch maybe close to
an<00:02:36.890> inch<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:38.090> kind<00:02:38.300> of<00:02:38.450> swing<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.230> around<00:02:39.290> so

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
an inch to kind of swing it around so

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.120 
an inch to kind of swing it around so
it'll<00:02:39.860> fit<00:02:39.890> right<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.660> then<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:42.440> know<00:02:42.470> cut<00:02:43.100> it

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
it'll fit right and then you know cut it

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.650 
it'll fit right and then you know cut it
down<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.489> where<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.730> lid<00:02:44.090> would<00:02:44.239> fit<00:02:44.510> because

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
down to where the lid would fit because

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.080 
down to where the lid would fit because
it<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:45.050> such<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.290> tight<00:02:45.590> fit<00:02:45.860> underneath<00:02:46.280> right

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
it is such a tight fit underneath right

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.729 
it is such a tight fit underneath right
there<00:02:47.330> I<00:02:47.360> mean<00:02:47.510> that<00:02:47.690> lid<00:02:48.290> is<00:02:48.440> right<00:02:48.650> up

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
there I mean that lid is right up

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.930 
there I mean that lid is right up
against<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:50.050> top<00:02:51.050> of<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.230> dash<00:02:51.410> basically<00:02:51.980> so

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
against the top of the dash basically so

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.430 
against the top of the dash basically so
are<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.390> firewall<00:02:53.780> but<00:02:54.970> yeah<00:02:55.970> that<00:02:56.450> that's

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
are the firewall but yeah that that's

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.900 
are the firewall but yeah that that's
the<00:02:57.530> mod<00:02:57.709> nasai<00:02:58.130> there's<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.400> loud<00:02:58.580> hissing

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
the mod nasai there's a loud hissing

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.580 
the mod nasai there's a loud hissing
noise<00:02:59.180> when<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.510> give<00:02:59.630> it<00:02:59.780> gas<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.260> hisses<00:03:00.560> a

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
noise when you give it gas it hisses a

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.960 
noise when you give it gas it hisses a
lot<00:03:00.800> louder<00:03:00.980> than<00:03:01.160> it<00:03:01.340> used<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.610> but

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
lot louder than it used to but

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.370 
lot louder than it used to but
apparently<00:03:02.090> that's<00:03:02.450> normal<00:03:02.870> because<00:03:02.989> getting

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
apparently that's normal because getting

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.820 
apparently that's normal because getting
a<00:03:03.500> lot<00:03:03.620> more<00:03:03.650> airflow<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:04.519> that's<00:03:05.209> apparently

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
a lot more airflow and that's apparently

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.250 
a lot more airflow and that's apparently
why<00:03:06.830> that<00:03:07.100> is<00:03:07.310> but<00:03:07.640> yeah<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.540> little<00:03:08.780> breather

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
why that is but yeah the little breather

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.740 
why that is but yeah the little breather
for<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.620> valve<00:03:10.459> cover<00:03:10.760> it<00:03:11.090> just<00:03:11.269> popped<00:03:11.540> right

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
for the valve cover it just popped right

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.900 
for the valve cover it just popped right
on<00:03:11.900> fitting<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:12.410> original<00:03:12.860> grommet<00:03:13.519> that<00:03:13.670> was

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
on fitting the original grommet that was

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.440 
on fitting the original grommet that was
on<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.330> valve<00:03:15.049> cover<00:03:15.140> there<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:16.450> overall

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
on the valve cover there so overall

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.020 
on the valve cover there so overall
pretty<00:03:17.660> simple<00:03:18.080> just<00:03:18.230> modifying<00:03:19.130> that<00:03:19.340> that

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
pretty simple just modifying that that

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.449 
pretty simple just modifying that that
rod<00:03:20.510> for<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.810> wing<00:03:20.959> nut<00:03:21.140> to<00:03:21.260> fit<00:03:21.410> on<00:03:21.560> was<00:03:22.100> about

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
rod for the wing nut to fit on was about

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.340 
rod for the wing nut to fit on was about
it<00:03:22.820> right<00:03:23.530> that's<00:03:24.530> it<00:03:25.900> I'll<00:03:26.900> go<00:03:27.019> ahead<00:03:27.140> and

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
it right that's it I'll go ahead and

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.289 
it right that's it I'll go ahead and
fire<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:28.370> up<00:03:28.430> real<00:03:28.610> quick<00:03:28.640> so<00:03:28.970> you<00:03:29.030> can<00:03:29.150> hear

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
fire it up real quick so you can hear

00:03:29.299 --> 00:04:03.470 
fire it up real quick so you can hear
that<00:03:29.450> hissing<00:03:30.170> sound

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.650 

that's<00:04:03.989> basically<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.560> there<00:04:05.330> this<00:04:06.330> is<00:04:06.510> what

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
that's basically it there this is what

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.610 
that's basically it there this is what
it<00:04:06.750> sounds<00:04:07.050> like<00:04:07.080> inside

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.699 

just<00:04:14.620> for<00:04:14.860> curiosity's<00:04:15.850> sake

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.890 

there<00:04:20.220> we<00:04:20.489> go

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
there we go

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.780 
there we go
where's<00:04:22.500> my<00:04:22.680> actual<00:04:23.070> mileage<00:04:23.630> for<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:24.660> $99<00:04:25.350> am

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
where's my actual mileage for a $99 am

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.050 
where's my actual mileage for a $99 am
only<00:04:26.790> two-wheel<00:04:27.750> drive<00:04:28.040> when<00:04:29.040> it's<00:04:29.190> decked

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
only two-wheel drive when it's decked

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.900 
only two-wheel drive when it's decked
out<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.900> be<00:04:31.050> like<00:04:31.830> a<00:04:31.860> four-wheel<00:04:32.340> drive<00:04:32.370> but<00:04:32.610> of

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
out to be like a four-wheel drive but of

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.480 
out to be like a four-wheel drive but of
course<00:04:33.150> it's<00:04:33.300> not

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.300 

that's<00:04:37.090> it
