00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.140
 we know that conserving the forests as well as providing the system of life 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.050
 natural is one of the largest business sources a country can have 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.539
 you think that getting money from nature always means damaging it 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.640
 Finland one of the most environmentally aware countries in the world 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.640
 has just 20 million hectares of forests and gets 20 thousand 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.329
 millions of dollars in damages 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.080
 for export of forest products 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.910
 mexico whose economy as a first world country is based largely on 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.700
 the responsible export of Serbs 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.749
 Peru treasures more of it 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:56.770
 triple forest than finland 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.920
 72 million details 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.580
 but it was not just 346 million dollars for export in goods of the 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.250
 forest 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.210
 imports 400 million dollars in one of them Manuel Espinoza and similar 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.960
 It is estimated that as an immediate potential journalism should have less than 6 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.020
 one billion dollars of foreign currency 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.420
 only in this area 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.220
 to follow the successful Finnish example the environment ministry has 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.870
 created the national forest conservation program to mitigate the 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.240
 climate change 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.580
 an initiative that protected 54 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.300
 in the 72 million hectares of tropical forest that the country has 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.230
 although it seems hard to believe 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.570
 this initiative does not affect if it does not favor the economic production of the country 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.480
 for example 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.250
 the current 3 146 million dollars that are exported from wood 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.080
 and chestnuts 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.620
 will be enhanced with the entry of companies that market 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.850
 ecotourism is another branch that will grow around a thousand 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.070
 the best thing is that these activities and they are good for them will generate great 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.129
 amount of work welfare in the area 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.560
 the national forest conservation program to mitigate the change 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:18.499
 also understand the payment to the native communities for each 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:21.099
 hectare that conserve properly 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.029
 that means more than 10 million hectares preserved 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:30.169
 and a total of 110 million soles per year for the native communities 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:33.809
 that are environmentally responsible 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:39.209
 another good news the program but this year has aroused admiration in the 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.179
 world 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:44.179
 the goal is that in the year 2021 the deforestation of our trees 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:47.149
 amazonian be 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:52.409
 and today we will see a reduction of 47 comas 5% of carbon emission or of 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.779
 greenhouse effect the european union ap magazine three same dates one 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:59.779
 decrease of athens 20% 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.059
 we have many points of advantage 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:06.269
 the national forest conservation program to mitigate the change 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.269
 climatic change places us as world leaders in natural preservation and 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.559
 productive 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.429
 will multiply or your income couple the two 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:16.839
 protected the water 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:19.819
 the trees 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:20.999
 the Oxigen 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:23.930
 benefit the festive communities to the planet
