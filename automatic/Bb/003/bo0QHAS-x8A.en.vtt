00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:06.170 

hi<00:00:04.859> it's<00:00:05.069> mr.<00:00:05.310> Andersen<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:05.819> in<00:00:05.940> this<00:00:06.000> podcast

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
hi it's mr. Andersen and in this podcast

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.660 
hi it's mr. Andersen and in this podcast
I'm<00:00:06.810> going<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:06.960> talk<00:00:07.020> about<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.440> domain

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
I'm going to talk about the domain

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.790 
I'm going to talk about the domain
Eukarya<00:00:08.670> that's<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.719> domain<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:10.410> you

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
Eukarya that's the domain that you

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.100 
Eukarya that's the domain that you
belong<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.670> because<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.269> like<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.630> chimpanzee

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
belong to because you like a chimpanzee

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.680 
belong to because you like a chimpanzee
have<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.920> nucleus<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.790> have<00:00:14.910> organelles<00:00:15.389> but

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
have a nucleus and have organelles but

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.370 
have a nucleus and have organelles but
so<00:00:16.020> do<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.199> bumblebee<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.220> do<00:00:17.279> these<00:00:18.380> mushrooms

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
so do a bumblebee so do these mushrooms

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.609 
so do a bumblebee so do these mushrooms
and<00:00:19.770> this<00:00:20.060> Volvox<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.539> these<00:00:21.720> flowers<00:00:22.410> and

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
and this Volvox and these flowers and

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.070 
and this Volvox and these flowers and
this<00:00:22.740> yeast<00:00:23.130> we<00:00:23.400> are<00:00:23.460> all<00:00:23.670> eukaryotic<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.960> so

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
this yeast we are all eukaryotic and so

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.349 
this yeast we are all eukaryotic and so
this<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.380> just<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.769> first<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.939> number<00:00:27.330> of

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
this is just the first in the number of

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.670 
this is just the first in the number of
podcasts<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:27.960> are<00:00:28.080> going<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.289> talk<00:00:28.439> about

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
podcasts that are going to talk about

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.730 
podcasts that are going to talk about
the<00:00:28.769> diversity<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.550> eukaryotic<00:00:30.060> life<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.230> so

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
the diversity of eukaryotic life and so

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.799 
the diversity of eukaryotic life and so
what<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> eukaryotic<00:00:32.880> life<00:00:33.059> it's<00:00:33.360> basically

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
what is a eukaryotic life it's basically

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.420 
what is a eukaryotic life it's basically
things<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.469> have<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> nucleus<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.309> they've

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
things that have a nucleus so they've

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.850 
things that have a nucleus so they've
got<00:00:35.579> their<00:00:35.730> DNA<00:00:36.239> contained<00:00:36.750> within<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.410> nucleus

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
got their DNA contained within a nucleus

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.580 
got their DNA contained within a nucleus
they'll<00:00:38.340> have<00:00:38.489> other<00:00:38.670> things<00:00:38.940> like

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
they'll have other things like

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.530 
they'll have other things like
endoplasmic<00:00:40.590> reticulum<00:00:41.550> or<00:00:41.820> Golgi<00:00:42.420> apparatus

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.680 
endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus
or<00:00:43.350> mitochondria<00:00:44.219> but<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.300> domain

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
or mitochondria but this is the domain

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.569 
or mitochondria but this is the domain
that<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.230> belong<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.649> remember<00:00:47.340> there<00:00:47.489> are

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
that you belong to remember there are

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.100 
that you belong to remember there are
other<00:00:47.700> two<00:00:48.000> domains<00:00:48.390> we've<00:00:48.690> got<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.930> domain

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
other two domains we've got the domain

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.470 
other two domains we've got the domain
bacteria<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.340> then<00:00:50.850> we<00:00:50.969> also<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
bacteria and then we also have the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.959 
bacteria and then we also have the
domain<00:00:51.739> archaebacteria<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.430> I've<00:00:53.699> already

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
domain archaebacteria and I've already

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.479 
domain archaebacteria and I've already
talked<00:00:54.239> about<00:00:54.390> both<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.750> those<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.309> are

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
talked about both of those and so we are

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.970 
talked about both of those and so we are
more<00:00:56.820> related<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.420> archaebacteria<00:00:58.230> if<00:00:58.800> we

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
more related to archaebacteria if we

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.670 
more related to archaebacteria if we
look<00:00:59.129> at<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.180> basically<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:00.899> share<00:01:01.649> a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
look at this so basically we share a

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.280 
look at this so basically we share a
common<00:01:02.039> ancestor<00:01:02.399> more<00:01:03.149> recently<00:01:03.600> than<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.110> do

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
common ancestor more recently than we do

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.420 
common ancestor more recently than we do
with<00:01:04.530> bacteria

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
with bacteria

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.399 
with bacteria
but<00:01:05.610> again<00:01:05.850> all<00:01:06.060> life<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.780> our<00:01:06.840> planet<00:01:06.990> are

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
but again all life on our planet are

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.560 
but again all life on our planet are
going<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.619> have<00:01:07.770> some<00:01:08.070> characteristics<00:01:08.970> we

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
going to have some characteristics we

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.390 
going to have some characteristics we
just<00:01:09.840> happen<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.200> belong<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.770> domain

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
just happen to belong to the domain

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.370 
just happen to belong to the domain
Eukarya<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:12.810> what<00:01:12.990> are<00:01:13.080> some<00:01:13.229> other

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
Eukarya and so what are some other

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.810 
Eukarya and so what are some other
things<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.740> are<00:01:13.860> found<00:01:14.100> inside<00:01:14.400> here

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
things that are found inside here

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.760 
things that are found inside here
animals<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.659> fungi<00:01:16.049> but<00:01:16.290> we're<00:01:16.439> also<00:01:16.590> going

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
animals and fungi but we're also going

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.770 
animals and fungi but we're also going
to<00:01:16.830> have<00:01:16.950> things<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.250> slime<00:01:17.729> mold<00:01:18.060> ciliates

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
to have things like slime mold ciliates

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.600 
to have things like slime mold ciliates
flageolets<00:01:19.470> there's<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.040> bunch<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.400> things

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
flageolets there's a bunch of things

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.170 
flageolets there's a bunch of things
that<00:01:20.729> are<00:01:20.850> found<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.869> domain<00:01:22.290> Eukarya<00:01:23.180> but

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
that are found in the domain Eukarya but

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.390 
that are found in the domain Eukarya but
we're<00:01:24.330> more<00:01:24.540> related<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.049> archaebacteria

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
we're more related to archaebacteria

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.010 
we're more related to archaebacteria
what<00:01:26.640> are<00:01:26.729> some<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.060> characteristics<00:01:27.540> of

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
what are some of the characteristics of

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.050 
what are some of the characteristics of
eukaryotic<00:01:28.799> cells<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.250> here's<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.939> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
eukaryotic cells and here's a just a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.569 
eukaryotic cells and here's a just a
typical<00:01:30.390> animal<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.320> cell<00:01:31.710> well<00:01:32.430> we're

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
typical animal like cell well we're

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.740 
typical animal like cell well we're
going<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.729> have<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> nucleus<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.570> we're<00:01:33.659> going

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
going to have a nucleus so we're going

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.030 
going to have a nucleus so we're going
to<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:33.990> nucleus<00:01:34.470> right<00:01:34.650> here<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
to have this nucleus right here in the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.980 
to have this nucleus right here in the
dome<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.700> DNA<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.180> going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> be<00:01:36.570> found<00:01:36.840> on

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
dome and the DNA is going to be found on

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.719 
dome and the DNA is going to be found on
the<00:01:37.140> inside<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.979> then<00:01:38.460> we're<00:01:38.579> going<00:01:38.670> to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
the inside and then we're going to

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.460 
the inside and then we're going to
subdivide<00:01:39.240> work<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:39.960> we're<00:01:40.079> going<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.229> have

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
subdivide work so we're going to have

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.620 
subdivide work so we're going to have
for<00:01:40.829> example<00:01:40.890> Golgi<00:01:41.610> apparatus<00:01:41.729> or

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
for example Golgi apparatus or

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.840 
for example Golgi apparatus or
endoplasmic<00:01:43.140> reticulum<00:01:43.770> or<00:01:44.040> mitochondria

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.940 
endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria
and<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:45.990> we're<00:01:46.110> going<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:46.409> organelles

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and so we're going to have organelles

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.910 
and so we're going to have organelles
that<00:01:47.310> do<00:01:47.540> individual<00:01:48.540> jobs<00:01:48.960> also<00:01:49.500> we're<00:01:49.829> going

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
that do individual jobs also we're going

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.609 
that do individual jobs also we're going
to<00:01:50.009> be<00:01:50.100> much<00:01:50.280> larger<00:01:50.640> than<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.689> cells<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.320> like

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
to be much larger than the cells of like

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.590 
to be much larger than the cells of like
a<00:01:52.649> bacteria<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:53.520> example<00:01:53.939> they<00:01:54.360> just<00:01:54.390> have

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
a bacteria for example they just have

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.749 
a bacteria for example they just have
their<00:01:54.750> DNA<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.350> middle<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.860> they<00:01:56.310> do<00:01:56.369> all

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
their DNA in the middle and they do all

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.270 
their DNA in the middle and they do all
the<00:01:56.939> same<00:01:57.119> jobs<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:57.840> do<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:58.890> kind<00:01:59.159> of

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
the same jobs that we do but we kind of

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.010 
the same jobs that we do but we kind of
divvy<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.729> up<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.329> give<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.659> different

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
divvy that up and give it to different

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.940 
divvy that up and give it to different
parts<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> cells

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
parts of the cells

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.340 
parts of the cells
what's<00:02:02.820> another<00:02:03.180> big<00:02:03.479> characteristic<00:02:04.229> that's

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
what's another big characteristic that's

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.080 
what's another big characteristic that's
different<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.920> eukaryotic<00:02:05.399> cells<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.909> going

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
different in eukaryotic cells is going

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.700 
different in eukaryotic cells is going
to<00:02:06.149> be<00:02:06.240> our<00:02:06.329> chromosomes<00:02:06.990> remember<00:02:07.530> in

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
to be our chromosomes remember in

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.380 
to be our chromosomes remember in
bacteria<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.369> archaea<00:02:08.670> bacteria<00:02:08.729> their

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
bacteria and archaea bacteria their

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.900 
bacteria and archaea bacteria their
chromosome<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> simple<00:02:10.560> loop<00:02:10.860> but<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.730> us

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
chromosome is a simple loop but in us

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.690 
chromosome is a simple loop but in us
it's<00:02:12.150> going<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.330> be<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> linear<00:02:12.870> stretch<00:02:13.410> of

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
it's going to be a linear stretch of

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.720 
it's going to be a linear stretch of
there's<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.420> loop<00:02:14.840> ours<00:02:15.319> is<00:02:15.620> chromosome<00:02:16.099> after

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
there's a loop ours is chromosome after

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.300 
there's a loop ours is chromosome after
chromosome<00:02:17.330> after<00:02:17.780> chromosome<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.709> so<00:02:18.739> it's

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
chromosome after chromosome and so it's

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.210 
chromosome after chromosome and so it's
linear<00:02:19.610> stretches<00:02:20.360> we<00:02:20.540> also<00:02:21.190> will<00:02:22.190> have

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
linear stretches we also will have

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.160 
linear stretches we also will have
introns<00:02:22.880> those<00:02:23.209> are<00:02:23.300> going<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.450> be<00:02:23.599> sections

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
introns those are going to be sections

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.940 
introns those are going to be sections
of<00:02:24.380> our<00:02:24.560> DNA<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.310> don't<00:02:25.880> code<00:02:26.510> for<00:02:27.380> genes

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
of our DNA that don't code for genes

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.490 
of our DNA that don't code for genes
whereas<00:02:28.640> on<00:02:28.849> their<00:02:29.120> DNA<00:02:29.510> every<00:02:29.780> little<00:02:30.200> bit<00:02:30.380> of

whereas on their DNA every little bit of

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
whereas on their DNA every little bit of
it<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.680> going<00:02:30.770> to<00:02:30.860> code<00:02:31.069> for<00:02:31.100> something

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
it is going to code for something

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.460 
it is going to code for something
another<00:02:32.300> characteristic<00:02:32.840> is<00:02:33.110> going<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.350> be

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
another characteristic is going to be

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.740 
another characteristic is going to be
the<00:02:33.650> cytoskeleton<00:02:34.489> so<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.850> cytoskeleton<00:02:35.600> I

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
the cytoskeleton so the cytoskeleton I

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.380 
the cytoskeleton so the cytoskeleton I
put<00:02:35.989> 2.2<00:02:36.739> these<00:02:36.950> right<00:02:37.250> here<00:02:37.550> are<00:02:37.730> going<00:02:38.300> to

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
put 2.2 these right here are going to

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.780 
put 2.2 these right here are going to
give<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.690> structure<00:02:39.290> on<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.860> inside<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.459> the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
give a structure on the inside of the

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.300 
give a structure on the inside of the
eukaryotic<00:02:41.390> cells<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.260> now<00:02:42.769> there<00:02:42.920> is<00:02:43.040> some

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
eukaryotic cells and now there is some

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.040 
eukaryotic cells and now there is some
structure<00:02:43.610> in<00:02:43.819> bacteria<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:44.300> archaea<00:02:44.660> but

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
structure in bacteria and archaea but

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.199 
structure in bacteria and archaea but
it's<00:02:45.200> not<00:02:45.410> as<00:02:45.680> definitive<00:02:46.069> as<00:02:46.459> that<00:02:46.700> found<00:02:47.060> in

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
it's not as definitive as that found in

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.229 
it's not as definitive as that found in
the<00:02:47.239> cytoskeleton<00:02:48.019> of<00:02:48.170> eukaryotic<00:02:48.920> cells<00:02:49.239> how

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells how

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.180 
the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells how
did<00:02:50.450> they<00:02:50.569> come<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:51.050> be<00:02:51.260> in<00:02:51.500> other<00:02:51.620> words<00:02:51.950> we

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
did they come to be in other words we

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.680 
did they come to be in other words we
think<00:02:52.220> eukaryotic<00:02:53.060> cells<00:02:53.299> came<00:02:53.480> much<00:02:53.660> later

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
think eukaryotic cells came much later

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.800 
think eukaryotic cells came much later
so<00:02:54.319> how<00:02:54.530> did<00:02:54.709> we<00:02:54.830> go<00:02:55.010> from<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.430> simple<00:02:55.970> cell<00:02:56.330> to

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
so how did we go from a simple cell to

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.440 
so how did we go from a simple cell to
these<00:02:56.959> complex<00:02:57.739> cells<00:02:58.130> well<00:02:58.970> there's<00:02:59.120> two

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
these complex cells well there's two

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.330 
these complex cells well there's two
ways<00:02:59.480> that<00:02:59.720> we<00:03:00.019> got<00:03:00.260> there<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.860> first<00:03:00.890> way

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
ways that we got there and the first way

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.740 
ways that we got there and the first way
is<00:03:01.610> what's<00:03:01.819> called<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.150> endosymbiotic

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
is what's called the endosymbiotic

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.530 
is what's called the endosymbiotic
theory<00:03:03.530> of<00:03:03.769> eukaryotic<00:03:04.400> evolution<00:03:05.209> that's<00:03:05.360> a

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
theory of eukaryotic evolution that's a

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.660 
theory of eukaryotic evolution that's a
mouthful<00:03:06.080> it<00:03:06.590> was<00:03:06.709> first<00:03:06.980> proposed<00:03:07.459> by<00:03:07.580> dr.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
mouthful it was first proposed by dr.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.630 
mouthful it was first proposed by dr.
Lynn<00:03:08.239> McGill<00:03:08.450> listen<00:03:09.049> I<00:03:09.230> think<00:03:09.489> 1967<00:03:10.489> and

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
Lynn McGill listen I think 1967 and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.940 
Lynn McGill listen I think 1967 and
basically<00:03:11.150> what<00:03:11.330> she<00:03:11.480> said<00:03:11.510> is<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:12.680> perhaps

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
basically what she said is that perhaps

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.789 
basically what she said is that perhaps
cells<00:03:13.670> became<00:03:14.180> more<00:03:14.480> complex<00:03:15.019> by<00:03:15.380> having

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
cells became more complex by having

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.979 
cells became more complex by having
certain<00:03:16.130> cells<00:03:17.709> ingesting<00:03:18.709> or<00:03:19.070> forming

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
certain cells ingesting or forming

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.599 
certain cells ingesting or forming
symbiotic<00:03:20.989> relationships<00:03:21.680> with<00:03:21.920> prokaryotic

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
symbiotic relationships with prokaryotic

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.940 
symbiotic relationships with prokaryotic
cells<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.720> two<00:03:23.930> things<00:03:24.200> that<00:03:24.380> she<00:03:24.530> pointed<00:03:24.920> to

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
cells the two things that she pointed to

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.860 
cells the two things that she pointed to
were<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.489> mitochondria<00:03:26.239> and<00:03:26.329> then<00:03:26.750> the

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
were the mitochondria and then the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.610 
were the mitochondria and then the
chloroplasts<00:03:27.410> that<00:03:27.799> in<00:03:28.549> 1967<00:03:29.450> was<00:03:29.750> craziness

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
chloroplasts that in 1967 was craziness

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.530 
chloroplasts that in 1967 was craziness
but<00:03:30.950> pretty<00:03:31.430> much<00:03:31.609> since<00:03:31.970> then<00:03:32.209> it's<00:03:32.420> been

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
but pretty much since then it's been

fact as you can and so what we have are
these<00:03:37.579> mitochondria<00:03:37.820> and<00:03:38.359> chloroplasts

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
these mitochondria and chloroplasts

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.710 
these mitochondria and chloroplasts
which<00:03:39.019> are<00:03:39.230> almost<00:03:40.090> hijacked<00:03:41.090> their<00:03:41.269> way<00:03:41.450> into

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
which are almost hijacked their way into

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.840 
which are almost hijacked their way into
our<00:03:41.930> cells<00:03:42.410> and<00:03:42.709> they're<00:03:42.799> living<00:03:43.130> within<00:03:43.549> our

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
our cells and they're living within our

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.840 
our cells and they're living within our
cells<00:03:44.180> what<00:03:44.570> some<00:03:44.750> evidence<00:03:45.320> that<00:03:45.530> would<00:03:45.680> be

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
cells what some evidence that would be

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.610 
cells what some evidence that would be
that<00:03:46.850> could<00:03:47.000> support<00:03:47.359> endosymbiotic<00:03:48.019> theory

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
that could support endosymbiotic theory

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.830 
that could support endosymbiotic theory
well<00:03:49.180> mitochondria<00:03:50.180> and<00:03:50.239> chloroplasts<00:03:50.720> have

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
well mitochondria and chloroplasts have

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.690 
well mitochondria and chloroplasts have
their<00:03:50.989> own<00:03:51.109> DNA<00:03:51.380> they<00:03:51.950> have<00:03:52.519> their<00:03:52.670> own

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
their own DNA they have their own

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.660 
their own DNA they have their own
ribosomes<00:03:53.390> and<00:03:54.019> they<00:03:54.440> resemble<00:03:55.370> both

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
ribosomes and they resemble both

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.580 
ribosomes and they resemble both
genetically<00:03:56.299> and<00:03:56.600> morphologically<00:03:56.660> they

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
genetically and morphologically they

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.789 
genetically and morphologically they
resemble<00:03:58.220> bacteria<00:03:58.910> and<00:03:59.120> so<00:03:59.660> basically<00:04:00.410> cells

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
resemble bacteria and so basically cells

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.860 
resemble bacteria and so basically cells
became<00:04:01.190> more<00:04:01.430> complex<00:04:01.850> by<00:04:02.150> grabbing<00:04:02.600> two

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
became more complex by grabbing two

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.569 
became more complex by grabbing two
things<00:04:03.200> I<00:04:03.440> would<00:04:03.560> point<00:04:03.739> to<00:04:03.920> this<00:04:04.220> in<00:04:04.489> the

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
things I would point to this in the

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.819 
things I would point to this in the
chloroplast<00:04:04.880> of<00:04:05.329> the<00:04:05.450> plant<00:04:05.690> cell<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.140> also

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
chloroplast of the plant cell and also

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.590 
chloroplast of the plant cell and also
to<00:04:06.890> this<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.489> mitochondria<00:04:08.150> they<00:04:08.299> became

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
to this the mitochondria they became

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.690 
to this the mitochondria they became
more<00:04:08.870> complex<00:04:09.350> that<00:04:09.590> way<00:04:09.799> one<00:04:10.069> of<00:04:10.160> my<00:04:10.250> favorite

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
more complex that way one of my favorite

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.720 
more complex that way one of my favorite
quotes<00:04:10.940> of<00:04:11.180> Lynn<00:04:11.810> Margulis<00:04:12.139> is<00:04:12.560> that<00:04:12.829> cells

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
quotes of Lynn Margulis is that cells

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.610 
quotes of Lynn Margulis is that cells
became<00:04:14.060> more<00:04:14.299> complex<00:04:14.690> not<00:04:14.930> through<00:04:15.230> combat

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
became more complex not through combat

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.529 
became more complex not through combat
or<00:04:16.070> fighting<00:04:16.519> each<00:04:16.760> other<00:04:16.910> but<00:04:17.060> through

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
or fighting each other but through

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.129 
or fighting each other but through
networking<00:04:18.260> through<00:04:18.739> cooperation<00:04:19.780> also<00:04:20.780> they

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
networking through cooperation also they

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.170 
networking through cooperation also they
became<00:04:21.410> more<00:04:21.620> complex<00:04:21.979> by<00:04:22.190> in<00:04:22.430> folding<00:04:22.880> and<00:04:23.090> so

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
became more complex by in folding and so

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.490 
became more complex by in folding and so
if<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.390> think<00:04:23.510> about<00:04:23.690> if<00:04:23.960> we<00:04:24.080> have<00:04:24.169> a<00:04:24.200> cell

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
if you think about if we have a cell

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.350 
if you think about if we have a cell
like<00:04:24.740> this<00:04:25.070> what's<00:04:25.460> one<00:04:25.729> way<00:04:25.940> that<00:04:26.150> it<00:04:26.240> could

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
like this what's one way that it could

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.800 
like this what's one way that it could
become

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
become

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.230 
become
relax<00:04:27.200> well<00:04:27.560> we<00:04:27.680> could<00:04:27.830> simply<00:04:28.190> fold<00:04:28.550> it<00:04:28.910> in<00:04:29.060> on

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
relax well we could simply fold it in on

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.060 
relax well we could simply fold it in on
the<00:04:29.360> side<00:04:29.600> and<00:04:29.900> once<00:04:30.080> you<00:04:30.230> fold<00:04:30.530> it<00:04:30.710> in<00:04:30.830> on<00:04:30.919> the

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
the side and once you fold it in on the

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.920 
the side and once you fold it in on the
side<00:04:31.250> not<00:04:31.520> only<00:04:31.880> have<00:04:32.060> you<00:04:32.150> increased<00:04:32.780> the

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
side not only have you increased the

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.950 
side not only have you increased the
surface<00:04:33.290> area<00:04:33.590> but<00:04:34.130> you<00:04:34.310> can<00:04:34.580> give<00:04:34.910> that

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
surface area but you can give that

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.080 
surface area but you can give that
organelle<00:04:35.960> different<00:04:36.740> jobs<00:04:37.070> and<00:04:37.400> so<00:04:37.850> all<00:04:38.060> of

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
organelle different jobs and so all of

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.420 
organelle different jobs and so all of
these<00:04:38.450> things<00:04:38.780> from<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.050> endoplasmic

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
these things from the endoplasmic

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.480 
these things from the endoplasmic
reticulum<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.730> nucleus<00:04:41.510> to<00:04:41.840> the

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
reticulum to the nucleus to the

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.280 
reticulum to the nucleus to the
lysosomes<00:04:43.490> all<00:04:43.880> these<00:04:44.090> things<00:04:44.419> we<00:04:44.690> think<00:04:44.720> were

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
lysosomes all these things we think were

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.280 
lysosomes all these things we think were
formed<00:04:45.860> by<00:04:46.010> in<00:04:46.370> folding<00:04:47.090> and<00:04:47.330> so<00:04:47.780> those<00:04:47.960> two

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
formed by in folding and so those two

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.129 
formed by in folding and so those two
things<00:04:48.320> gave<00:04:49.040> us<00:04:49.190> complexity<00:04:50.060> in<00:04:50.240> eukaryotic

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
things gave us complexity in eukaryotic

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.650 
things gave us complexity in eukaryotic
cells<00:04:51.380> both<00:04:51.980> this<00:04:52.280> endosymbiotic<00:04:53.000> working

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
cells both this endosymbiotic working

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.810 
cells both this endosymbiotic working
together<00:04:53.810> and<00:04:54.260> then<00:04:54.410> this<00:04:54.530> in<00:04:54.770> folding<00:04:55.250> what

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
together and then this in folding what

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.820 
together and then this in folding what
evidence<00:04:56.060> would<00:04:56.360> we<00:04:56.510> have<00:04:56.690> that<00:04:56.930> endo<00:04:57.230> the

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
evidence would we have that endo the

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.740 
evidence would we have that endo the
endomembrane<00:04:58.220> system<00:04:58.250> was<00:04:59.120> formed<00:04:59.570> through

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
endomembrane system was formed through

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.129 
endomembrane system was formed through
folding<00:05:00.290> well<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:01.040> proteins<00:05:01.639> on<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.570> outside

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
folding well the proteins on the outside

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.020 
folding well the proteins on the outside
and<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:03.560> proteins<00:05:03.919> on<00:05:04.070> the<00:05:04.190> inside<00:05:04.639> are<00:05:05.000> going

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
and the proteins on the inside are going

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.360 
and the proteins on the inside are going
to<00:05:05.210> be<00:05:05.300> different<00:05:05.900> and<00:05:06.139> so<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:06.740> proteins<00:05:07.220> on

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
to be different and so the proteins on

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.640 
to be different and so the proteins on
the<00:05:07.460> outside<00:05:07.940> if<00:05:08.360> we<00:05:08.840> look<00:05:09.020> on<00:05:09.110> the<00:05:09.169> inside<00:05:09.620> of

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
the outside if we look on the inside of

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.320 
the outside if we look on the inside of
Golgi<00:05:10.070> apparatus<00:05:10.160> are<00:05:10.729> actually<00:05:11.090> going<00:05:11.210> to<00:05:11.270> be

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
Golgi apparatus are actually going to be

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.270 
Golgi apparatus are actually going to be
found<00:05:11.600> on<00:05:11.750> the<00:05:11.960> inside<00:05:12.320> of<00:05:12.680> that<00:05:12.830> if<00:05:13.160> you

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
found on the inside of that if you

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.129 
found on the inside of that if you
imagine<00:05:13.460> it<00:05:13.760> folding<00:05:14.330> in<00:05:14.570> and<00:05:14.840> those<00:05:15.020> that

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
imagine it folding in and those that

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:16.480 
imagine it folding in and those that
were<00:05:15.260> on<00:05:15.410> the<00:05:15.500> inside<00:05:15.800> are<00:05:15.950> actually<00:05:16.280> on<00:05:16.400> the

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
were on the inside are actually on the

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.670 
were on the inside are actually on the
outside<00:05:16.520> of<00:05:17.360> this<00:05:17.479> and<00:05:17.660> so<00:05:18.200> that's<00:05:18.380> pretty

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
outside of this and so that's pretty

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.960 
outside of this and so that's pretty
good<00:05:18.919> evidence<00:05:19.100> that<00:05:19.370> endomembrane<00:05:19.940> system

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
good evidence that endomembrane system

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.659 
good evidence that endomembrane system
form<00:05:20.780> through<00:05:21.020> in<00:05:21.229> folding<00:05:21.710> now<00:05:22.280> how<00:05:22.430> do<00:05:22.490> they

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
form through in folding now how do they

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.219

they make a living well their metabolism

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.360 
they make a living well their metabolism
is<00:05:26.870> going<00:05:26.930> to<00:05:27.080> be<00:05:27.200> diverse<00:05:27.620> in<00:05:27.860> eukaryotic

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
is going to be diverse in eukaryotic

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.760 
is going to be diverse in eukaryotic
cells<00:05:28.820> but<00:05:29.090> two<00:05:29.240> of<00:05:29.330> the<00:05:29.419> big<00:05:29.750> things<00:05:30.139> are

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
cells but two of the big things are

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.700 
cells but two of the big things are
going<00:05:30.919> to<00:05:30.979> be<00:05:31.070> this<00:05:31.280> process<00:05:31.940> where

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
going to be this process where

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.190 
going to be this process where
autotrophs<00:05:33.820> so<00:05:34.820> things<00:05:35.120> like<00:05:35.390> plants<00:05:36.110> and

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
autotrophs so things like plants and

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.350 
autotrophs so things like plants and
algae<00:05:36.380> and<00:05:36.680> bacteria<00:05:37.010> fall<00:05:37.850> into<00:05:38.060> this<00:05:38.180> as

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
algae and bacteria fall into this as

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.390 
algae and bacteria fall into this as
well<00:05:38.510> are<00:05:39.020> taking<00:05:39.500> carbon<00:05:39.710> dioxide<00:05:39.830> water

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
well are taking carbon dioxide water

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.460 
well are taking carbon dioxide water
using<00:05:40.880> energy<00:05:41.240> of<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.450> Sun<00:05:41.660> and<00:05:41.960> converting

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
using energy of the Sun and converting

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.529 
using energy of the Sun and converting
that<00:05:42.620> to<00:05:42.800> organic<00:05:43.280> compounds<00:05:43.789> and<00:05:43.910> then<00:05:44.390> we

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
that to organic compounds and then we

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:46.300 
that to organic compounds and then we
have<00:05:44.660> the<00:05:44.810> reverse<00:05:45.260> in<00:05:45.560> cellular<00:05:46.160> respiration

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
have the reverse in cellular respiration

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.210 
have the reverse in cellular respiration
and<00:05:47.000> so<00:05:47.270> pretty<00:05:48.050> much<00:05:48.229> any<00:05:48.500> niche<00:05:48.890> on<00:05:49.100> our

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
and so pretty much any niche on our

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.730 
and so pretty much any niche on our
planet<00:05:49.669> is<00:05:49.760> going<00:05:49.910> to<00:05:49.970> be<00:05:50.090> filled<00:05:50.390> by

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
planet is going to be filled by

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.779 
planet is going to be filled by
eukaryotic<00:05:51.740> cells<00:05:51.950> they're<00:05:52.220> making<00:05:52.520> a<00:05:52.610> living

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
eukaryotic cells they're making a living

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.120 
eukaryotic cells they're making a living
however<00:05:53.240> they<00:05:53.479> can<00:05:53.720> on<00:05:53.990> the<00:05:54.830> way<00:05:54.979> they

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
however they can on the way they

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.680 
however they can on the way they
reproduce<00:05:55.669> is<00:05:55.850> going<00:05:56.000> to<00:05:56.060> be<00:05:56.150> different

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
reproduce is going to be different

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.980 
reproduce is going to be different
though<00:05:56.840> between<00:05:57.470> bacteria<00:05:58.250> and<00:05:58.990> archaea

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
though between bacteria and archaea

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.680 
though between bacteria and archaea
bacteria<00:06:00.080> and<00:06:00.860> bacteria<00:06:01.190> and<00:06:01.789> so<00:06:02.270> basically

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
bacteria and bacteria and so basically

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.860 
bacteria and bacteria and so basically
they<00:06:03.500> use<00:06:03.530> the<00:06:03.800> process<00:06:04.430> of<00:06:04.639> mitosis<00:06:04.910> mitosis

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
they use the process of mitosis mitosis

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.050 
they use the process of mitosis mitosis
remember<00:06:06.650> is<00:06:06.770> copying<00:06:07.370> those<00:06:07.520> chromosomes

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
remember is copying those chromosomes

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.790 
remember is copying those chromosomes
you<00:06:08.180> can<00:06:08.330> see<00:06:08.450> our<00:06:08.570> linear<00:06:08.960> chromosomes<00:06:09.560> we're

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
you can see our linear chromosomes we're

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.740 
you can see our linear chromosomes we're
copying<00:06:10.280> it<00:06:10.400> and<00:06:10.430> then<00:06:10.700> it's<00:06:10.880> simply<00:06:11.120> dividing

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
copying it and then it's simply dividing

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.529 
copying it and then it's simply dividing
in<00:06:11.900> half<00:06:11.930> and<00:06:12.440> so<00:06:12.919> we<00:06:13.039> take<00:06:13.220> one<00:06:13.520> cell<00:06:13.850> in<00:06:14.330> this

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
in half and so we take one cell in this

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.270 
in half and so we take one cell in this
case<00:06:14.750> this<00:06:14.930> would<00:06:15.110> be<00:06:15.260> a<00:06:15.289> diploid<00:06:15.740> cell<00:06:16.070> and

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
case this would be a diploid cell and

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.890 
case this would be a diploid cell and
we're<00:06:16.400> making<00:06:16.669> two<00:06:16.910> diploid<00:06:17.330> cells<00:06:17.600> that<00:06:17.780> are

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
we're making two diploid cells that are

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.990 
we're making two diploid cells that are
exactly<00:06:18.410> the<00:06:18.590> same<00:06:18.860> and<00:06:19.160> then<00:06:19.729> we<00:06:19.850> have

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
exactly the same and then we have

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.390 
exactly the same and then we have
meiosis<00:06:20.660> and<00:06:20.900> so<00:06:21.020> meiosis<00:06:21.560> produces<00:06:21.590> gametes

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
meiosis and so meiosis produces gametes

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.219 
meiosis and so meiosis produces gametes
remember<00:06:23.030> in<00:06:23.120> this<00:06:23.210> case<00:06:23.419> it<00:06:23.600> could<00:06:23.780> be<00:06:23.810> four

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:24.229 
remember in this case it could be four

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:26.680 
remember in this case it could be four
sperm<00:06:24.770> cells<00:06:25.130> or<00:06:25.700> it<00:06:25.820> could<00:06:25.970> produce<00:06:26.120> just<00:06:26.570> one

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
sperm cells or it could produce just one

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.379 
sperm cells or it could produce just one
egg<00:06:27.169> cell<00:06:27.560> but<00:06:28.310> regardless<00:06:28.970> if<00:06:29.150> you're

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:29.389 
egg cell but regardless if you're

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.090 
egg cell but regardless if you're
something<00:06:29.780> like<00:06:29.960> an<00:06:30.110> anemone<00:06:30.410> so<00:06:30.830> this<00:06:30.979> would

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
something like an anemone so this would

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.529 
something like an anemone so this would
be<00:06:31.190> an<00:06:31.280> anemone<00:06:31.550> right<00:06:31.910> here<00:06:32.150> and<00:06:32.270> you<00:06:32.330> want<00:06:32.479> to

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
be an anemone right here and you want to

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:34.629 
be an anemone right here and you want to
make<00:06:32.660> a<00:06:32.690> copy<00:06:32.960> of<00:06:33.169> it<00:06:33.289> yourself<00:06:34.070> in<00:06:34.310> some

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 
make a copy of it yourself in some

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:36.610 
make a copy of it yourself in some
eukaryotic<00:06:35.360> cells<00:06:35.570> they'll<00:06:35.810> simply<00:06:36.020> just<00:06:36.409> do

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
eukaryotic cells they'll simply just do

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.860 
eukaryotic cells they'll simply just do
mitosis<00:06:37.250> it'll<00:06:37.490> just<00:06:37.729> divide<00:06:38.150> in<00:06:38.419> half<00:06:38.450> and

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870 
mitosis it'll just divide in half and

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.210 
mitosis it'll just divide in half and
you<00:06:38.930> can<00:06:39.080> see<00:06:39.229> this<00:06:39.380> one<00:06:39.590> dividing<00:06:40.010> in

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
you can see this one dividing in

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.220 
you can see this one dividing in
half<00:06:40.340> right<00:06:40.610> here<00:06:40.850> pretty<00:06:41.480> soon<00:06:41.570> what<00:06:41.960> you<00:06:42.050> get

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:42.230 
half right here pretty soon what you get

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.500 
half right here pretty soon what you get
are<00:06:42.470> two<00:06:42.830> sea<00:06:43.250> anemones<00:06:43.700> that<00:06:43.880> are<00:06:44.000> exactly

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
are two sea anemones that are exactly

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.260 
are two sea anemones that are exactly
the<00:06:44.750> same<00:06:44.960> but<00:06:45.650> we<00:06:45.800> also<00:06:45.980> can<00:06:46.340> do<00:06:46.490> sexual

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
the same but we also can do sexual

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.150 
the same but we also can do sexual
reproduction<00:06:47.810> so<00:06:48.170> through<00:06:48.470> the<00:06:48.590> process<00:06:49.010> of

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 
reproduction so through the process of

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.610 
reproduction so through the process of
meiosis<00:06:49.340> we<00:06:49.940> can<00:06:50.090> make<00:06:50.210> gametes<00:06:50.420> and<00:06:50.840> then<00:06:51.470> we

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
meiosis we can make gametes and then we

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.260 
meiosis we can make gametes and then we
can<00:06:51.770> have<00:06:51.860> fertilization<00:06:52.670> and<00:06:52.910> then<00:06:53.120> through

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270 
can have fertilization and then through

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.330 
can have fertilization and then through
mitosis<00:06:53.420> we<00:06:53.930> can<00:06:54.080> get<00:06:54.230> growth<00:06:54.530> and<00:06:54.800> so<00:06:55.010> we<00:06:55.160> can

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
mitosis we can get growth and so we can

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.540 
mitosis we can get growth and so we can
get<00:06:55.580> a<00:06:56.200> genetic<00:06:57.200> variability<00:06:57.650> but<00:06:58.100> like<00:06:58.400> we

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
get a genetic variability but like we

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.860 
get a genetic variability but like we
would<00:06:58.670> have<00:06:58.820> in<00:06:58.970> this<00:06:59.090> little<00:06:59.330> child<00:06:59.540> right

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
would have in this little child right

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:00.250 
would have in this little child right
here

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.260 
here

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.470 
here
and<00:07:00.350> so<00:07:00.800> that's<00:07:00.980> eukaryotic<00:07:01.730> cells<00:07:01.970> again

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:02.480 
and so that's eukaryotic cells again

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.600 
and so that's eukaryotic cells again
they've<00:07:02.690> got<00:07:03.070> nucleus<00:07:04.070> they've<00:07:04.430> got

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
they've got nucleus they've got

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:05.590

they've<00:07:06.200> got<00:07:06.380> mitosis<00:07:06.920> and<00:07:07.070> meiosis<00:07:07.240> but<00:07:08.240> the

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:08.390 
they've got mitosis and meiosis but the

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.540 
they've got mitosis and meiosis but the
diversity<00:07:09.110> of<00:07:09.140> them<00:07:09.500> is<00:07:09.770> massive<00:07:10.340> and<00:07:10.460> we're

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550 
diversity of them is massive and we're

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.680 
diversity of them is massive and we're
going<00:07:10.670> to<00:07:10.700> talk<00:07:10.910> about<00:07:11.030> that<00:07:11.270> over<00:07:11.570> the<00:07:11.600> next

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:11.690 
going to talk about that over the next

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.520 
going to talk about that over the next
few<00:07:12.020> podcasts<00:07:12.290> and<00:07:12.800> I<00:07:12.980> hope<00:07:13.250> that's<00:07:13.400> helpful
