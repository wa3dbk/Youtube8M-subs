less store one of the first things you

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.230 
less store one of the first things you
notice<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:27.960> it's<00:00:28.439> very<00:00:28.650> small<00:00:29.240> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
notice is that it's very small the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.120 
notice is that it's very small the
bottle<00:00:30.599> itself<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.199> made<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.529> glass<00:00:31.769> and

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
bottle itself is made of glass and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.830 
bottle itself is made of glass and
there's<00:00:32.279> plenty<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.730> there<00:00:33.680> but<00:00:34.969> the<00:00:35.969> brush<00:00:38.840> is

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
there's plenty in there but the brush is

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.380 
there's plenty in there but the brush is
small<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.820> therefore<00:00:42.770> quite<00:00:43.770> awkward<00:00:44.390> so

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
small and therefore quite awkward so

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.100 
small and therefore quite awkward so
this<00:00:46.260> isn't<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.770> most<00:00:46.980> expensive<00:00:47.809> mascara<00:00:48.809> I

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
this isn't the most expensive mascara I

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.770 
this isn't the most expensive mascara I
bought<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.680> nor<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.579> most<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.600> least

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
bought and nor is it the most the least

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.819 
bought and nor is it the most the least
expensive<00:00:52.260> mascara

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
expensive mascara

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.689 
expensive mascara
I've<00:00:52.980> bought<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:54.680> although<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.250> I

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
I've bought but although this is a I

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.720 
I've bought but although this is a I
believe<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.750> an<00:00:57.840> ethically<00:00:58.350> good<00:00:58.739> mascara<00:00:59.370> I

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
believe it's an ethically good mascara I

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.939 
believe it's an ethically good mascara I
don't<00:01:00.239> think<00:01:00.570> it's<00:01:00.780> actually<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.440> much<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.859> a

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
don't think it's actually that much of a

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.450 
don't think it's actually that much of a
good<00:01:02.190> mascara<00:01:02.840> I<00:01:03.840> found<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:05.159> quite<00:01:05.309> awkward

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
good mascara I found it's quite awkward

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.050 
good mascara I found it's quite awkward
to<00:01:05.760> put<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.360> I've<00:01:07.260> also<00:01:07.439> found<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.060> it's

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
to put on and I've also found that it's

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.810 
to put on and I've also found that it's
it's<00:01:09.900> not<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.140> darkest<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.250> certainly

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
it's not the darkest is it certainly

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.460 
it's not the darkest is it certainly
doesn't<00:01:12.030> add<00:01:12.270> much<00:01:12.299> volume<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.439> your

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
doesn't add much volume to your

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.920 
doesn't add much volume to your
eyelashes<00:01:14.659> um<00:01:15.740> I've<00:01:16.740> also<00:01:17.130> found<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.360> is

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
eyelashes um I've also found that it is

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.100 
eyelashes um I've also found that it is
very<00:01:19.650> wet<00:01:20.100> mascara<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.420> takes<00:01:21.630> quite<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.900> long

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
very wet mascara it takes quite a long

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.380 
very wet mascara it takes quite a long
time<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.500> dry<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:22.979> if<00:01:23.490> you're<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.880> rush<00:01:24.090> and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
time to dry so if you're in a rush and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.719 
time to dry so if you're in a rush and
you<00:01:24.540> put<00:01:24.750> some<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.860> other<00:01:26.130> things<00:01:26.490> in

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
you put some on you do other things in

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.090 
you put some on you do other things in
you're<00:01:26.970> leaning<00:01:27.840> over<00:01:27.960> or<00:01:28.409> you're<00:01:28.560> looking<00:01:28.920> up

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
you're leaning over or you're looking up

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.010 
you're leaning over or you're looking up
you're<00:01:29.670> probably<00:01:30.000> gonna<00:01:30.360> make<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> bit<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.960> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
you're probably gonna make a bit of a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.999 
you're probably gonna make a bit of a
mess<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.950> found<00:01:33.170> now<00:01:34.170> says<00:01:34.590> nothing<00:01:34.979> about

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
mess as I found now says nothing about

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.999 
mess as I found now says nothing about
how<00:01:35.159> waterproof<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.350> but<00:01:37.350> I've<00:01:37.740> been<00:01:37.890> out

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
how waterproof it is but I've been out

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
in the rain and it's okay but it doesn't

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.289 
in the rain and it's okay but it doesn't
take<00:01:42.420> much<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:43.619> actually<00:01:44.009> get<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.549> move

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
take much to actually get it to move

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.800 
take much to actually get it to move
into<00:01:45.540> kind<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.079> stream<00:01:46.439> down<00:01:46.860> your<00:01:46.979> face<00:01:47.040> um

because<00:02:26.620> you<00:02:26.799> have<00:02:27.480> because<00:02:28.480> it's<00:02:28.629> so<00:02:28.780> short

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
because you have because it's so short

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.949 
because you have because it's so short
you<00:02:29.709> kind<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.220> you're<00:02:30.970> overcompensating<00:02:31.540> a

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
you kind of you're overcompensating a

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.690 
you kind of you're overcompensating a
little<00:02:32.170> bit<00:02:32.319> and<00:02:32.500> he's<00:02:32.799> so<00:02:33.069> easy<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.400> make<00:02:33.670> a

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
little bit and he's so easy to make a

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.330 
little bit and he's so easy to make a
mess<00:02:33.939> so<00:02:33.970> I<00:02:34.180> just<00:02:34.439> remove<00:02:35.439> that<00:02:35.470> because<00:02:36.159> it's

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
mess so I just remove that because it's

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.819 
mess so I just remove that because it's
really<00:02:36.579> easy<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:37.000> come<00:02:37.269> off<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.920> can<00:02:39.099> see

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
really easy to come off so you can see

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:47.280 
really easy to come off so you can see
it<00:02:41.909> is<00:02:42.930> not<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.989> very<00:02:44.319> dark<00:02:45.150> mascara<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.450> advises

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
it is not a very dark mascara it advises

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.559 
it is not a very dark mascara it advises
you<00:02:47.409> put<00:02:47.620> apply<00:02:47.980> about<00:02:48.190> three<00:02:48.489> times<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:49.239> you

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
you put apply about three times so you

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:50.550 
you put apply about three times so you
know<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.810> dry<00:02:49.989> and<00:02:50.109> go<00:02:50.200> through<00:02:50.409> it<00:02:50.440> again

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
know it dry and go through it again

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.119 
know it dry and go through it again
three<00:02:51.069> times<00:02:51.340> but<00:02:52.150> it's<00:02:52.389> quite<00:02:52.599> awkward<00:02:53.129> I

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
three times but it's quite awkward I

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.369 
three times but it's quite awkward I
will<00:02:54.790> say<00:02:55.120> though<00:02:55.359> it's<00:02:55.599> not<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.870> worst

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
will say though it's not the worst

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.940 
will say though it's not the worst
mascara<00:02:57.340> I've<00:02:57.760> used<00:02:58.120> I<00:02:59.049> like<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.680> fact<00:02:59.859> that

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
mascara I've used I like the fact that

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.569 
mascara I've used I like the fact that
it's<00:03:00.129> really<00:03:00.459> quite<00:03:00.639> it<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.030> ethical<00:03:02.579> it's

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
it's really quite it is ethical it's

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.899 
it's really quite it is ethical it's
using<00:03:04.060> only<00:03:04.780> one<00:03:05.280> preservative<00:03:06.280> rather<00:03:06.549> than

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
using only one preservative rather than

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:12.509 
using only one preservative rather than
the<00:03:07.000> usual<00:03:07.389> three<00:03:07.750> I<00:03:08.049> believe<00:03:11.340> but<00:03:12.340> it<00:03:12.489> is

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
the usual three I believe but it is

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.289 
the usual three I believe but it is
awkward<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.329> use<00:03:14.069> it's<00:03:15.069> a<00:03:15.189> real<00:03:15.340> shame<00:03:15.730> perhaps

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
awkward to use it's a real shame perhaps

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.500 
awkward to use it's a real shame perhaps
less<00:03:17.139> could<00:03:17.470> have<00:03:17.590> done<00:03:17.829> a<00:03:18.000> narrower<00:03:19.000> bottle

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
less could have done a narrower bottle

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.080 
less could have done a narrower bottle
using<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.139> same<00:03:20.319> amount<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.739> mascara<00:03:21.730> but<00:03:22.030> a

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
using the same amount of mascara but a

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.509 
using the same amount of mascara but a
narrower<00:03:22.540> bottle<00:03:23.410> so<00:03:23.590> is<00:03:23.739> to<00:03:23.859> get<00:03:24.069> the<00:03:24.310> longer

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
narrower bottle so is to get the longer

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.189 
narrower bottle so is to get the longer
the<00:03:27.519> longer<00:03:27.730> brush<00:03:28.180> really<00:03:28.690> because<00:03:28.989> that's

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
the longer brush really because that's

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.839 
the longer brush really because that's
really<00:03:29.530> awkward<00:03:29.859> especially<00:03:30.310> when<00:03:30.730> you're

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
really awkward especially when you're

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.420 
really awkward especially when you're
trying<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.120> get<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.739> inner<00:03:32.739> parts<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.870> I

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
trying to get the inner parts so I

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.250 
trying to get the inner parts so I
probably<00:03:36.430> wouldn't<00:03:36.940> buy<00:03:37.120> this<00:03:37.180> again<00:03:37.750> I<00:03:37.930> must

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
probably wouldn't buy this again I must

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.530 
probably wouldn't buy this again I must
be<00:03:38.470> honest<00:03:38.799> then<00:03:39.069> I<00:03:39.280> don't<00:03:39.639> think<00:03:39.849> I<00:03:40.000> would<00:03:40.239> I

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
be honest then I don't think I would I

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.259 
be honest then I don't think I would I
do<00:03:40.930> find<00:03:41.440> it<00:03:41.590> if<00:03:41.650> I<00:03:41.819> there<00:03:42.819> you<00:03:42.879> go

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
do find it if I there you go

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.439 
do find it if I there you go
just<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.260> odd<00:03:44.349> blank<00:03:44.829> blink<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:45.699> I've<00:03:46.180> made<00:03:46.419> a

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
just the odd blank blink and I've made a

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.559 
just the odd blank blink and I've made a
mess<00:03:46.750> I'm<00:03:47.680> focused<00:03:48.519> there<00:03:48.669> I<00:03:48.699> do<00:03:48.879> apologize<00:03:49.329> um
