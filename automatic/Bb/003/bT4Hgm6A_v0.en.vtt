MX<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.440> t54<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:18.680> let's<00:00:19.680> take<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> look<00:00:23.779> so<00:00:24.779> here

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
MX a t54 and let's take a look so here

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.560 
MX a t54 and let's take a look so here
is<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.189> sheath<00:00:27.349> um<00:00:29.060> point<00:00:30.060> out<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.359> blade

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
is the sheath um point out the blade

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.049 
is the sheath um point out the blade
design<00:00:30.990> it's<00:00:31.679> very<00:00:31.800> very<00:00:32.309> strange

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
design it's very very strange

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.549 
design it's very very strange
um<00:00:34.610> you<00:00:35.610> got<00:00:35.730> tan<00:00:36.030> towel<00:00:36.210> right<00:00:36.360> here<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.960> I'm

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
um you got tan towel right here and I'm

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.229 
um you got tan towel right here and I'm
guessing<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.070> because<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:38.640> curved<00:00:38.910> you

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
guessing you because it's curved you

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.350 
guessing you because it's curved you
slash<00:00:39.750> here<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.890> maybe<00:00:41.820> because<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.239> is

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
slash here and maybe because this is

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.229 
slash here and maybe because this is
straight<00:00:42.660> edge<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:43.850> chopped

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
straight edge you chopped

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.650 
straight edge you chopped
I<00:00:45.620> have<00:00:46.620> no<00:00:46.770> idea<00:00:47.219> there<00:00:48.030> are<00:00:48.090> serrations<00:00:48.539> on

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
I have no idea there are serrations on

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.520 
I have no idea there are serrations on
the<00:00:48.719> back<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.230> aren't<00:00:49.500> sharp<00:00:49.770> at<00:00:49.950> all<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:51.530> so

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the back that aren't sharp at all and so

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.639 
the back that aren't sharp at all and so
maybe<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:52.949> for<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.430> extra<00:00:53.760> damage<00:00:54.469> when<00:00:55.469> you

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
maybe it's for the extra damage when you

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:03.590 
maybe it's for the extra damage when you
pull<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.219> out<00:00:57.230> no<00:00:58.230> idea<00:00:58.530> um<00:01:01.850> there's<00:01:02.850> depth

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
pull it out no idea um there's depth

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.090 
pull it out no idea um there's depth

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
here just part of the design very thick

guard<00:01:53.430> here<00:01:54.649> I<00:01:55.759> mean<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.820> don't<00:01:57.030> quite<00:01:57.329> know<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
guard here I mean I don't quite know the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.080 
guard here I mean I don't quite know the
practicality<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.439> since<00:01:58.979> if<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.490> blade

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
practicality of that since if a blade

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.550 
practicality of that since if a blade
did<00:02:00.299> hit<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:00.930> kind<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.290> slayed

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
did hit this it just kind of slayed

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.880 
did hit this it just kind of slayed
slide<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:03.259> hit<00:02:04.259> your<00:02:04.829> finger<00:02:05.780> but<00:02:06.780> we<00:02:07.680> got

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
slide and hit your finger but we got

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.360 
slide and hit your finger but we got
lanyard<00:02:08.640> holes<00:02:08.879> here<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.920> purpose<00:02:11.220> of

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
lanyard holes here so the purpose of

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.990 
lanyard holes here so the purpose of
this

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
this

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.380 
this
is<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.990> take<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.200> lanyard<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.090> live<00:02:15.240> it

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
is you take a lanyard and you live it

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.440 
is you take a lanyard and you live it
through<00:02:15.570> these<00:02:15.720> holes<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.520> it<00:02:17.520> goes<00:02:17.700> right

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
through these holes and it goes right

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.330 
through these holes and it goes right
here<00:02:18.860> so<00:02:19.860> when<00:02:20.070> you're<00:02:20.160> in<00:02:20.280> combat<00:02:20.820> and

itself<00:03:29.330> moving<00:03:30.330> on<00:03:30.450> we<00:03:30.660> have<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:30.930> nylon

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680

sheath<00:03:32.100> it<00:03:33.350> snapped<00:03:34.350> here<00:03:34.739> so<00:03:35.780> it's<00:03:36.780> mostly<00:03:37.080> a

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
sheath it snapped here so it's mostly a

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.090 
sheath it snapped here so it's mostly a
preference<00:03:38.340> thing<00:03:38.519> there<00:03:38.760> is<00:03:38.880> velcro<00:03:40.100> down

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
preference thing there is velcro down

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.680 
preference thing there is velcro down
underneath<00:03:41.579> so<00:03:42.329> guess<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:43.049> can<00:03:43.200> go<00:03:43.290> both<00:03:43.500> ways

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.160 
underneath so guess you can go both ways
we<00:03:45.690> have<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:46.230> little<00:03:46.470> pouch<00:03:46.709> here<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:48.540> you<00:03:49.019> can

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
we have a little pouch here that you can

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.910 
we have a little pouch here that you can
hold<00:03:49.320> a<00:03:49.410> sharpener<00:03:49.860> in<00:03:50.010> or<00:03:50.489> another<00:03:50.880> knife

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920

there<00:03:52.920> seems<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.880> be<00:03:54.000> material<00:03:54.660> that<00:03:54.840> gets

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
there seems to be material that gets

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.140 
there seems to be material that gets
stuck<00:03:55.230> here<00:03:55.530> so<00:03:55.769> that<00:03:55.950> might<00:03:56.430> be<00:03:56.549> a<00:03:56.579> problem<00:03:56.820> in

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150
