and we'll go we'll go from the fly line

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.000 
and we'll go we'll go from the fly line
down<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:29.510> this<00:02:29.900> is<00:02:30.080> what<00:02:30.290> this<00:02:30.530> is<00:02:30.590> what<00:02:30.860> the

TJ walks me through the steps in getting

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.949 
TJ walks me through the steps in getting
things<00:02:40.310> rigged<00:02:40.580> up<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:41.090> from<00:02:41.690> what<00:02:41.810> I<00:02:41.840> can

rigging<00:02:42.950> takes<00:02:43.160> attention<00:02:43.519> to<00:02:43.760> detail<00:02:44.090> and

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
rigging takes attention to detail and

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.910 
rigging takes attention to detail and
quick<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:45.140> nimble<00:02:45.260> movements

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
quick and nimble movements

TJ's<00:02:46.670> years<00:02:46.940> of<00:02:47.090> experience<00:02:47.570> make<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:47.930> quick

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
TJ's years of experience make it a quick

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.720 
TJ's years of experience make it a quick
process<00:02:48.350> so<00:02:48.920> those<00:02:49.130> are<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.310> two<00:02:49.489> flies

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
process so those are the two flies

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.910 
process so those are the two flies
you're<00:02:49.910> gonna<00:02:50.030> fish<00:02:50.300> okay<00:02:50.959> this<00:02:51.410> is<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.739> midge

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
you're gonna fish okay this is the midge

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.880 
you're gonna fish okay this is the midge
larvae<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.519> this<00:02:53.150> is<00:02:53.360> your<00:02:53.510> betta<00:02:53.690> snip<00:02:54.050> okay

larvae and this is your betta snip okay
two<00:02:55.370> different<00:02:55.670> cycles<00:02:56.060> of<00:02:56.150> bugs<00:02:56.330> that<00:02:56.450> are

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
two different cycles of bugs that are

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.360 
two different cycles of bugs that are
coming<00:02:56.810> off<00:02:56.930> from<00:02:57.440> under<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.980> rocks<00:02:58.160> right

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
coming off from under the rocks right

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.890 
coming off from under the rocks right
now<00:02:58.430> don't<00:02:58.730> have<00:02:58.850> to<00:02:58.910> be<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.060> biologist<00:02:59.720> when

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
now don't have to be a biologist when

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.640 
now don't have to be a biologist when
you're<00:03:00.050> fly-fishing

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
you're fly-fishing

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.490 
you're fly-fishing
yeah<00:03:00.830> yeah<00:03:01.610> there's<00:03:02.239> a<00:03:02.330> you<00:03:02.840> know<00:03:02.959> just<00:03:03.140> years

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
yeah yeah there's a you know just years

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.350 
yeah yeah there's a you know just years
of<00:03:03.680> watching<00:03:04.070> it<00:03:04.160> happen<00:03:04.519> it's<00:03:04.760> it's<00:03:05.120> really<00:03:05.330> a

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
of watching it happen it's it's really a

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.509 
of watching it happen it's it's really a
science<00:03:05.900> and<00:03:06.080> that's<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.680> thing<00:03:06.890> that<00:03:07.250> makes

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
science and that's the thing that makes

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.610 
science and that's the thing that makes
fly<00:03:08.060> fishing<00:03:08.420> so<00:03:08.600> I<00:03:08.630> think<00:03:09.019> so<00:03:09.140> appealing<00:03:09.500> for

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
fly fishing so I think so appealing for

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.050 
fly fishing so I think so appealing for
people<00:03:09.680> it's<00:03:10.010> like<00:03:10.160> it's<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.400> challenge<00:03:10.850> it's<00:03:11.000> a

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
people it's like it's a challenge it's a

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.240 
people it's like it's a challenge it's a
process<00:03:11.300> yeah<00:03:12.050> you<00:03:12.230> know<00:03:12.350> just<00:03:12.380> throw<00:03:12.769> a<00:03:12.800> line

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
process yeah you know just throw a line

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.910 
process yeah you know just throw a line
out<00:03:13.459> and<00:03:13.610> that's<00:03:13.820> it<00:03:13.970> yeah<00:03:14.269> this<00:03:14.709> gradual<00:03:15.709> you

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
out and that's it yeah this gradual you

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.640 
out and that's it yeah this gradual you
know<00:03:16.180> fishing<00:03:17.180> keeps<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:18.080> lot<00:03:18.230> of<00:03:18.380> people's

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
know fishing keeps a lot of people's

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.120 
know fishing keeps a lot of people's
interest<00:03:18.860> because<00:03:20.230> when<00:03:21.230> you're<00:03:21.560> not

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
interest because when you're not

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.610 
interest because when you're not
catching<00:03:22.400> fish<00:03:22.750> you're<00:03:23.750> doing<00:03:24.080> something<00:03:24.500> to

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
catching fish you're doing something to

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.309 
catching fish you're doing something to
solve<00:03:24.940> why<00:03:25.940> you're<00:03:26.120> not<00:03:26.240> catching<00:03:26.450> fish<00:03:26.660> so

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
solve why you're not catching fish so

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.450 
solve why you're not catching fish so
you<00:03:27.380> always<00:03:27.590> move

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
you always move

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.190 
you always move
moving<00:03:28.640> or<00:03:28.790> thinking<00:03:29.330> or<00:03:29.570> changing<00:03:30.080> your

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
moving or thinking or changing your

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.100 
moving or thinking or changing your
flies<00:03:30.440> or<00:03:31.010> there's<00:03:32.000> a<00:03:32.120> lot<00:03:32.270> to<00:03:32.510> it<00:03:32.540> so<00:03:32.900> what

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
flies or there's a lot to it so what

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.530 
flies or there's a lot to it so what
we'll<00:03:33.230> do<00:03:33.380> now<00:03:33.560> is<00:03:33.590> all<00:03:33.980> if<00:03:34.580> you<00:03:34.940> want<00:03:35.240> to<00:03:35.390> hop

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
a little casting demo here and then we

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.700 
a little casting demo here and then we
can<00:03:40.250> get<00:03:40.400> going<00:03:40.760> so<00:03:41.210> your<00:03:41.420> cast<00:03:41.660> your<00:03:42.200> cast<00:03:42.470> is

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
gonna look like this your fly line is in

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.260 
gonna look like this your fly line is in
your<00:03:45.140> left<00:03:45.290> hand<00:03:45.410> rods<00:03:46.100> in<00:03:46.310> your<00:03:46.430> right<00:03:46.610> okay
