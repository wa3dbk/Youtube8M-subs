00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.260 
divide that number by two for me that
all<00:04:29.270> comes<00:04:29.449> out<00:04:29.629> to<00:04:30.110> about<00:04:30.349> six<00:04:30.830> inches<00:04:31.270> so

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
all comes out to about six inches so

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.180 
all comes out to about six inches so
we're<00:04:32.449> going<00:04:32.569> to<00:04:32.629> take<00:04:32.949> your<00:04:33.949> tape<00:04:34.129> measure

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
we're going to take your tape measure

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.129 
we're going to take your tape measure
put<00:04:34.970> a<00:04:35.000> thumb<00:04:35.210> tack<00:04:35.270> through<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.840> center<00:04:36.110> of

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
put a thumb tack through the center of

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.119 
put a thumb tack through the center of
the<00:04:36.470> zero<00:04:36.770> inside<00:04:37.280> place<00:04:38.240> that<00:04:38.539> in<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:39.129> folded

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:40.129 
the zero inside place that in the folded

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:44.050 
the zero inside place that in the folded
corner<00:04:40.580> of<00:04:40.669> your<00:04:40.819> fabric<00:04:41.800> and<00:04:42.940> then<00:04:43.940> we're

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
corner of your fabric and then we're

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.260 
corner of your fabric and then we're
going<00:04:44.150> to<00:04:44.210> mark<00:04:44.479> off<00:04:44.629> a<00:04:44.930> six<00:04:45.289> inch<00:04:46.270> quarter

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
going to mark off a six inch quarter

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.249 
going to mark off a six inch quarter
circle<00:04:47.990> and<00:04:48.409> then<00:04:49.159> we're<00:04:49.940> going<00:04:50.150> to<00:04:50.479> measure

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259 
circle and then we're going to measure

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.469 
circle and then we're going to measure
from<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:51.889> thumb<00:04:52.220> Tecton<00:04:52.729> I<00:04:52.849> do<00:04:52.909> the<00:04:53.090> fabric

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
from the thumb Tecton I do the fabric

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.719 
from the thumb Tecton I do the fabric
which<00:04:53.630> is<00:04:53.659> about<00:04:54.560> ten<00:04:54.800> and<00:04:54.919> a<00:04:54.949> half<00:04:54.979> inches<00:04:55.460> for

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
which is about ten and a half inches for

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.909 
which is about ten and a half inches for
me<00:04:55.849> and<00:04:56.150> then<00:04:56.900> mark<00:04:57.110> off<00:04:57.289> a<00:04:57.470> 10<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:57.830> a<00:04:57.889> half

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
me and then mark off a 10 and a half

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.300 
me and then mark off a 10 and a half
inch<00:04:58.400> quarter<00:04:59.240> circle<00:04:59.979> now<00:05:00.979> that<00:05:01.159> you<00:05:01.280> have

inch quarter circle now that you have
your<00:05:01.550> little<00:05:02.060> quarter<00:05:02.509> circle<00:05:02.930> marked<00:05:03.139> off

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:03.319 
your little quarter circle marked off

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:11.200 
your little quarter circle marked off
we're<00:05:03.680> going<00:05:03.860> to<00:05:03.949> cut<00:05:04.250> it<00:05:04.370> out<00:05:04.460> on<00:05:04.729> the<00:05:04.909> lines

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.540 

and<00:05:11.569> this<00:05:11.870> is<00:05:12.080> going<00:05:12.259> to<00:05:12.350> give<00:05:12.500> us<00:05:12.530> two<00:05:13.100> half

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
and this is going to give us two half

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:20.080 
and this is going to give us two half
circles<00:05:16.240> okay<00:05:17.240> now<00:05:17.389> our<00:05:17.539> next<00:05:17.569> step<00:05:17.840> is<00:05:18.319> to<00:05:19.090> pin

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
circles okay now our next step is to pin

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.730 
circles okay now our next step is to pin
our<00:05:20.240> half<00:05:20.389> circles<00:05:20.870> together<00:05:21.080> right<00:05:21.500> sides

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
our half circles together right sides

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.850 
our half circles together right sides
together<00:05:23.050> doesn't<00:05:24.050> it<00:05:24.080> does<00:05:24.349> have<00:05:24.560> a<00:05:24.590> right

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
together doesn't it does have a right
