00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.389
 hello girls welcome to fake in rays 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.400
 I am clear and in this video I want 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.290
 talk to them about my routine to take care of my 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.330
 hair I do not consider myself any 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.160
 expert in hair but because of that 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.949
 Many of you have asked me how 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.720
 I do to take care of it I have decided to do 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.640
 this video where I simply want 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.060
 share with you what I do with my 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.060
 hair 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.190
 I'm going to start by washing when I 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.860
 I wash my hair I use this shampoo 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:37.370
 it's called mythical and it's great it smells 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.350
 delicious it is very soft to me and I 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.540
 I know that you need a little bit of 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.220
 Hydration in the hair from Istanbul 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.350
 It can also come great 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.840
 I wash my hair with warm water 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.970
 because washing it with very hot water does not 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.250
 It is good for the hair or for the skin 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.830
 and what is at stake massaging the leather 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.030
 scalp to stimulate circulation 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.920
 of the blood 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.199
 At the end of washing I also usually give 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.479
 a rinse with cold water to close 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.610
 hair cuticles plus water 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.130
 cold helps the products you use 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.790
 in the hair are better fixed and it contributes 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.790
 higher brightness 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.440
 as my hair is long and tends to 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.240
 dry out on the tips of no treatment 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.070
 wash it every day I also do it 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.049
 and the other day because of what my 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.149
 hairdresser the frequency with which 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.159
 we must wash our hair depends 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.640
 of the type of hair we have and 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.770
 also of the activity 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.930
 we realize daily is proven that 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.600
 wash your hair daily do not 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.380
 harm you only need to use the 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.380
 suitable products 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.090
 when I finish washing it applies this 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.429
 my peak's mask be only in 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.310
 the tips sometimes my hair is very 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:52.189
 rebel but with this mask is left 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.979
 super soft my hairstyles is very much defined 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.979
 better and also smells delicious 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.990
 when I want a natural look I use this 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.359
 natural bristle brush to me 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.209
 like to comb it when it's still dry 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:10.550
 before washing it because I find it a lot 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.470
 easier besides that I like a lot 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.720
 how light my hair when it dries 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.520
 naturally and I feel that I do not need 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.920
 brush it again when I want 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.470
 achieve a more groomed look I use a 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.320
 round comb the dryer and a protector 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.120
 of heat to protect my hair if I 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.460
 I would like you to make a video where 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.050
 explain step by step with a comb 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.880
 this way they can put it in the 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.560
 comments by the way to all 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.660
 products that I have shown you in this 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.110
 video can get them in salons 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.110
 beauty 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.310
 I do not make many masks I love 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.560
 because sometimes I do not have time and the 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.780
 most times you have to be very very 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.760
 constant to notice results but of 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.800
 Once in a while I like to put a little bit of 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.800
 olive oil at the tips because it is 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.720
 great for dry and open tips and 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.240
 I let him act at least 1 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.310
 but what definitely helps me 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.260
 a lot not only in my hair but in my 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.660
 daily life is to maintain a good 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.700
 food I am a person who loves 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.920
 eating in my diet includes a lot 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.590
 fruits the vegetables I always cook my 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.630
 food with olive oil I drink a lot 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.270
 water nothing refresh or selfish 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.430
 flavors and I do not consume much sugar and 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.050
 over all I try not to consume I go to 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.940
 industrial nor writing 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.710
 I know that the latter may seem like 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.810
 they have nothing to do with hair 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.850
 but for me it is one of the most 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.220
 important because I know it can sound 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.980
 very clichÃ© but a good diet 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.200
 helps to have a healthier life 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.870
 have a prettier skin to be of 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.420
 better mood and also to have a nice 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.950
 hair and good basically these are 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.290
 all the care I take with my 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.480
 Hair is a routine that seems to me 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.580
 very easy to follow and I hope you guys 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.430
