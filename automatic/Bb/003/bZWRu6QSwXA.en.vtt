00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 they are all short video guys only 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.850
 to show you a comparison of course 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.529
 I can't have the iPhone 5 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.360
 currently overwhelms on the 20th 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.660
 September will be marketed at 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.610
 starting tomorrow 21 September in some 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.460
 countries and September 28 in Italy though 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.820
 managed to get a preview of two covers 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.430
 compatible with iphone 5 which are these 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.650
 so I wanted to make a fair comparison 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.590
 with a galaxy s2 an iphone 4 covers the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.510
 size if it actually looks like a 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.270
 remote control or if the dimensions are 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.149
 still acceptable 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:43.950
 let's start with the iphone 4 here's how you see it 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:46.770
 actually it's higher than around 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.210
 an inch and a half tested concerns 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:57.050
 the width is identical to the time and is 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:01.590
 see c enter so let's say that 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:06.450
 let's say it's a little higher but still 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:12.000
 we have no problem with holding the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.520
 device since as you see it is 44 years old 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.500
 you can get there quite easily 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.110
 so I would say that the dimensions are 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.000
 very acceptable here is how I put myself 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.049
 close a moment in the images it seemed 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.610
 a little bigger actually though 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.070
 finding it here even more is more 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:39.000
 small of a galaxy s ii 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:42.150
 as you can see, tighter and a little higher 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.970
 as you can see here here I must say that 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:51.299
 the dimensions are perfect for me 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.159
 let 's say the same comfort with which one 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.030
 logically hold the screen 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:01.130
 will then come up to here more or less 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.390
 let's say the four corners touch 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.990
 quietly at least that is that 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.689
 what I think 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:16.030
 looking at this guide cover in 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:18.069
 this one as a diet with dimensions 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.750
 we are there 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.970
 so the device according to me will be 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.090
 still comfortable to hold as the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.130
 dimensions are a little bigger but 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.040
 actually I thought more from 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.640
 images that I had seen instead more or 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.489
 the less we are there then said this 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.860
 guys talk to you at the next video 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:42.660
 with the unboxing of the iPhone 5 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.660
 hello all hello hello
