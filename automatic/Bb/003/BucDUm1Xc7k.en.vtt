whorecraft actually does have a purpose

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.590 
whorecraft actually does have a purpose
for<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.950> back<00:02:41.160> so<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.060> can<00:02:42.120> see<00:02:42.270> there's<00:02:42.480> an

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
for the back so you can see there's an

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.470 
for the back so you can see there's an
elastic<00:02:43.170> band<00:02:43.440> right<00:02:43.709> here<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:44.610> this<00:02:45.270> thing

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
elastic band right here and this thing

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.710 
elastic band right here and this thing
which<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.990> can<00:02:46.800> goes<00:02:47.700> up<00:02:47.910> comes<00:02:48.450> right<00:02:48.690> out

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
which you can goes up comes right out

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.470 
which you can goes up comes right out
but<00:02:49.520> goes<00:02:50.520> up<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:50.850> down<00:02:52.280> this<00:02:53.280> sea-doo<00:02:54.180> or

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
but goes up and down this sea-doo or

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.360 
but goes up and down this sea-doo or
ski-doo<00:02:55.140> or<00:02:55.320> whatever<00:02:55.700> goes<00:02:56.700> in<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:57.209> back

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
ski-doo or whatever goes in the back

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.180 
ski-doo or whatever goes in the back
then<00:02:59.630> that<00:03:00.630> attaches<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.560> rubber<00:03:01.740> band<00:03:02.070> it

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
then that attaches the rubber band it

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.820 
then that attaches the rubber band it
goes<00:03:02.310> back<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.820> then<00:03:02.910> walks<00:03:03.180> in<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:04.290> this

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
goes back and then walks in that this

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.790 
goes back and then walks in that this
piece<00:03:06.440> locks<00:03:07.440> in<00:03:07.770> right<00:03:08.040> there<00:03:09.470> so<00:03:10.470> then<00:03:10.680> when

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
piece locks in right there so then when

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.340 
piece locks in right there so then when
you<00:03:10.890> put<00:03:11.100> it<00:03:11.220> in<00:03:12.170> it<00:03:13.170> locks<00:03:13.500> in<00:03:13.800> but<00:03:15.170> does<00:03:16.170> have

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
you put it in it locks in but does have

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.780 
you put it in it locks in but does have

gasoline can the window opens um then in
the<00:04:07.830> back<00:04:08.100> just<00:04:08.989> like<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:11.090> hovercraft<00:04:12.090> if<00:04:12.390> you

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
the back just like the hovercraft if you

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.360 
the back just like the hovercraft if you
put<00:04:13.110> this<00:04:13.500> in<00:04:13.739> here<00:04:14.480> and<00:04:15.680> latch<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:16.950> on<00:04:17.070> does

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
put this in here and latch it on does

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.949 
put this in here and latch it on does
the<00:04:17.489> exact<00:04:17.850> same<00:04:17.880> thing

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
the exact same thing

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.439 
the exact same thing
then<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:20.039> guessed<00:04:20.280> it<00:04:22.970> when<00:04:23.970> you<00:04:24.060> push<00:04:24.270> it

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
then you guessed it when you push it

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:29.240 
then you guessed it when you push it
down<00:04:25.370> it<00:04:26.370> goes<00:04:26.639> the<00:04:27.000> ski-doo<00:04:27.770> I'm<00:04:28.770> not<00:04:29.190> sure

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
down it goes the ski-doo I'm not sure

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.309 
down it goes the ski-doo I'm not sure
why<00:04:29.550> they<00:04:29.699> put<00:04:29.849> the<00:04:30.000> speed<00:04:30.210> turn<00:04:30.419> twice<00:04:30.840> I

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:31.319 
why they put the speed turn twice I

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.640 
why they put the speed turn twice I
guess<00:04:31.830> they<00:04:32.009> really<00:04:33.199> really<00:04:34.199> thought<00:04:34.440> it<00:04:34.470> was

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
guess they really really thought it was

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.490 
guess they really really thought it was
clever<00:04:34.979> so<00:04:35.310> they<00:04:35.400> put<00:04:35.580> it<00:04:35.669> in<00:04:35.759> twice<00:04:36.539> so<00:04:37.229> us

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
clever so they put it in twice so us

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.300 
clever so they put it in twice so us
there<00:04:37.830> get<00:04:38.069> says<00:04:38.280> keep<00:04:38.520> out<00:04:39.860> these<00:04:40.860> rant
