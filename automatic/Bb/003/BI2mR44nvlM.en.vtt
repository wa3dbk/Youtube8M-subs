 Hello, welcome to education in 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.660
 discussion on the new school site and 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.040
 on our channel on youtube.com youtube.com 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.949
 new school magazine bar 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.920
 the Chamber of Deputies approved this month 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.470
 a bill setting a period of 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.859
 six years for teachers of the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.949
 basic education at the secondary level 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.939
 undergraduate and graduate courses or 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.020
 pedagogy 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.690
 the proposal seems a setback once 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.750
 universalization of higher education 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.790
 in teaching has already been established by 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:48.630
 ldb guideline and base law in 1997 or 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.640
 16 years ago today 's subject matter is more 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.070
 once the teacher's training 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.650
 and this is what we discuss in the article 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.890
 that you lei new school dot org.br 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.310
 bar debate professionalize and 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.140
 to value the teaching career are steps 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.240
 key to improving 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.090
 quality of education in brazil 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.670
 This is not discussed but Brazil is still 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.040
 failed to provide the necessary training 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.940
 higher than teachers 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.760
 according to data from the 2011 school census 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:24.000
 25% of the teaching profession is a quarter of 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.270
 teachers do not have a college degree 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.970
 the new school believes it is crucial 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.159
 invest in the training of these teachers 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.250
 but this is not only done by imposing 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.909
 deadlines or creating bills that 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.680
 needs to be done in parallel is 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.960
 restructuring the working day and the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.260
 teaching career plans to 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:52.520
 create the necessary support so that a 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:57.450
 good formation becomes law 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.909
 12,244 of 2010 determines that by 2020 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.990
 all schools in the public and 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.549
 private schools have libraries 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.369
 but for the law to be fulfilled it is 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.500
 I need to build more than 130 thousand 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.630

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.510
