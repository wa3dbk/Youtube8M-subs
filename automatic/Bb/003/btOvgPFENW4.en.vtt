growth as well however when you look at

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.719 
growth as well however when you look at
them<00:01:27.530> drilling<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.680> Bakken<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.280> little

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
went into the pad drilling and lowered

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.039 
went into the pad drilling and lowered
their<00:01:38.280> costs<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.850> their<00:01:38.970> drill<00:01:39.240> times<00:01:39.479> however

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
their costs in their drill times however

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.929 
their costs in their drill times however
there's<00:01:40.229> still<00:01:40.290> about<00:01:40.680> 10<00:01:41.340> million<00:01:41.579> dollars

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939

per<00:01:42.150> well<00:01:42.360> which<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.570> pretty<00:01:42.869> high<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.770> that's

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
per well which is pretty high so that's

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.590 
per well which is pretty high so that's
