00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:19.650
 ray-ban's collection of classics knows 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:25.710
 so the prints of the videos so 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.840

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.450
 have some illustrations of some 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:37.320
 characters during the book 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.309
 queiroz was born in 1845 and an author 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.520
 Portuguese 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.309
 he was a lawyer during his life in 88 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.469
 he took up a consul post in paris 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.550
 and this was the same year that the most was 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.590
 published 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.559
 it took him ten years to write this 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.460
 book is a very chubby book books 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:01.649
 is mostly in Lisbon in the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:05.189
 end of 2008 cent sit there 1875 to 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.020
 Up but with a flashback, people are going 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.409
 accompany the Mayan family 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.000
 mainly carlos eduardo and the grandfather 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.530
 His name is Afonso 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.689
 they are a rich family a noble leaves 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.320
 this more important role in society 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.970
 on multiple properties in various places 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.030
 They are moving to Lisbon because 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.270
 carlos eduardo has graduated in medicine 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.700
 and wants to work professionally in 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.159
 lisboa and ends up going along with him 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.360
 was living in the smallest place and had 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.079
 two moved to a property 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.549
 called a deal that they had then 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.320
 he lisboa 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.850
 We know the merck that 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.520
 happened to Carlos Eduardo's father 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.860
 that there is no more book a little too 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.380
 the family before them or the parents 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.409
 and ons grandmas 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.719
 but that part shorter alckmin is 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.030
 What kind of book that takes a while? 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.570
 to unfold and to arrive at a 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.280
 big a big gain all free but is 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.160
 mainly to show with what 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.390
 this society works then we 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.810
 have parties friends 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.090
 social events in Jenin all 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:22.360
 tricks are happening in this society 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:25.550
 then who is with whom and treason and 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.190
 Anyone who talks about someone is a 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.590
 confusion in this interesting part 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.040
 see how this company is maintaining its 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.230
 appearances as well as appear some 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.150
 very important thing is I being some 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.030
 thing for other people is very 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.410
 important this is the first part 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.050
 The second part that I 'm talking about is not 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.750
 a formal division is the only one I am 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.209
 driving so it's more or less on the 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.100
 half 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.560
 while the first half worries 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.269
 more with then exact environment of it alone 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.440
 will be what these relations between 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.870
 people 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.380
 in the second part begins to develop 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.810
 and is the main plot of 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.989
 involves Carlos Eduardo who involves a 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.480
 girl and finally 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.610
 I think knowing that the main theme 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.930
 of the book is uncertain, you can already know more 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.120
 or less what you want 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.030
 Carlos Eduardo is that boy started 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.000
 very dreamy Galicia very bad says 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.370
 here that the children of this society 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.160
 richer did not use medicine 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:32.920
 because the profession did not take as much 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.500
 beautiful at that time moves with a pendant 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.120
 type thales the profession was lawyer 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.870
 on the way so when it solves 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.180
 do medicine but supports it says is a 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.100
 great profession and then support but he 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.870
 in fact never been able to exercise 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.660
 right profession 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.660
 He's a good son of a rhythm so never 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.880
 I want to work a lot and like this 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.360
 realizes that he is a boy more 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.019
 innocent there is a good heart and finally 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.030
 one among many others it seems to be 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.579
 more accurate so my characters 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.459
 I'm gum who is friends with him. 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:13.280
 also of this same face of itself 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.260
 of this same set to him has his 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.120
 creative impulses and have an idea of 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.030
 writing books and is always changing 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.890
 idea and such a very funny lode 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.440
 the theme that is present in the 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.840
 politics many 10 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.080
 the men of nobility so that 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.970
 nobility are other politicians involved in 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.380
 some way with politics but also 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.600
 some criticism of the way in which 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.640
 Portugal is being governed and how 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.800
 that things are happening 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:43.000
 she has a little bit of Brazil is better 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:47.320
 pass yes but this relationship has 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.200
 between the colony and the country and then 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.060
 a bit of that is also a very 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.400
 It's cool a book to meet these 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.980
 customs and this way to follow this 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.840
 At the time I thought it was very cool. 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.540
 Lisbon in the end did not seem to be 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.510
 a city so big it's funny 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.250
 Another interesting thing is that as 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.080
 there are several words that people 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.610
 never more accustomed to using Portuguese 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.500
 in which the footer cans 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.540
 clarifying it a little better because 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.490
 they are so this is very helpful 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.080
 Anyway, people, I really enjoyed reading the 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.720
 book is one of the most important books 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.650
 I do not think it's legal to have 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.520
 read 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.920
 I took a break and through him and 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.870
 but that was a matter of 23 days in 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.900
 other things and come back here then he 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.520
 deceived even happens to myself and 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.080
 always with a bigger book in which I 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.620
 I do not think it's a big 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.960
 book so I ended up tiring one 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.840
 few of the most chubby books anyway 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.250
 I recommend everyone and I wait there 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.350
 Did you like the video who? 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.430
 already read tell me what you found there in 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.430
 comments and until now
