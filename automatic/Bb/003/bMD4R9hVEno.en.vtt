00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
long snake and I cut it into equal links

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.980 
long snake and I cut it into equal links
working<00:01:18.399> with<00:01:18.520> equal<00:01:18.819> amounts<00:01:19.240> helps<00:01:19.630> ensure

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
working with equal amounts helps ensure

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.480 
working with equal amounts helps ensure
that<00:01:20.049> all<00:01:20.380> these<00:01:20.560> teeth<00:01:20.799> will<00:01:20.950> be<00:01:21.069> the<00:01:21.279> same

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490

all<00:02:15.930> mixed<00:02:16.439> thoroughly<00:02:17.329> still<00:02:18.329> a<00:02:18.359> little<00:02:18.510> dark

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:18.719 
all mixed thoroughly still a little dark

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.349 
all mixed thoroughly still a little dark
but<00:02:18.930> I'm<00:02:19.019> gonna<00:02:19.109> go<00:02:19.290> with<00:02:19.319> it<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:21.120> make

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
but I'm gonna go with it and to make

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.110 
but I'm gonna go with it and to make
this<00:02:21.659> I'm<00:02:22.079> basically<00:02:22.709> just<00:02:23.129> I<00:02:23.489> would<00:02:23.969> join

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
this I'm basically just I would join

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.330 
this I'm basically just I would join
them<00:02:24.329> together<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.989> I'm<00:02:25.260> pulling<00:02:25.499> them<00:02:25.829> long

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
them together and I'm pulling them long

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.789 
them together and I'm pulling them long
ways<00:02:26.609> and<00:02:27.090> keep<00:02:27.780> joining<00:02:28.109> them<00:02:28.409> and<00:02:28.620> just

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
ways and keep joining them and just

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.640 
ways and keep joining them and just
alternating<00:02:29.700> how<00:02:30.030> they<00:02:30.239> go<00:02:30.389> together<00:02:30.650> this

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
alternating how they go together this

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.729 
alternating how they go together this
creates<00:02:32.099> a<00:02:32.219> long<00:02:32.519> grain<00:02:32.969> and<00:02:33.420> then<00:02:34.109> I<00:02:34.170> spin<00:02:34.709> it

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
creates a long grain and then I spin it

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.459 
creates a long grain and then I spin it
fold<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.909> smush<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.480> hold<00:02:37.109> it

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:37.469 
fold it smush it hold it

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.849 
fold it smush it hold it
smoosh<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.040> again<00:02:38.340> fold<00:02:38.609> it<00:02:38.730> again<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.859> see

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
smoosh it again fold it again and see

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.289 
smoosh it again fold it again and see
how<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.010> long<00:02:41.310> grain<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.730> was<00:02:41.939> going<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.120> use

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
how the long grain I was going to use

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.920 
how the long grain I was going to use
that<00:02:42.329> at<00:02:42.599> first<00:02:42.810> but<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:44.040> didn't<00:02:44.370> like<00:02:44.689> the<00:02:45.689> long

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
that at first but I didn't like the long

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.240 
that at first but I didn't like the long
grain<00:02:46.200> look<00:02:46.469> so<00:02:47.459> I<00:02:47.489> later<00:02:47.790> discovered<00:02:48.419> that<00:02:49.250> if

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
grain look so I later discovered that if

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.309 
grain look so I later discovered that if
I<00:02:50.459> cut<00:02:50.639> it<00:02:50.730> against<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.359> grain<00:02:51.419> it<00:02:51.959> gives<00:02:52.169> me<00:02:52.290> a

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
I cut it against the grain it gives me a

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.869 
I cut it against the grain it gives me a
busy<00:02:52.709> pattern<00:02:52.889> like<00:02:53.219> this<00:02:53.569> much<00:02:54.569> better<00:02:55.459> so<00:02:56.459> I

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
busy pattern like this much better so I

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.759 
busy pattern like this much better so I
just<00:02:57.180> wound<00:02:57.389> up<00:02:57.540> taking<00:02:57.870> all<00:02:57.989> my<00:02:58.169> pieces<00:02:58.409> and

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
just wound up taking all my pieces and

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.369 
just wound up taking all my pieces and
stacking<00:02:59.010> them<00:02:59.189> back<00:02:59.430> up<00:02:59.689> cutting<00:03:00.689> them<00:03:00.870> into

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
stacking them back up cutting them into

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.179 
stacking them back up cutting them into
some<00:03:01.620> sections<00:03:03.019> joining<00:03:04.019> them<00:03:04.139> up<00:03:04.290> this<00:03:05.010> is

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
some sections joining them up this is

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:06.679 
some sections joining them up this is
not<00:03:05.340> really<00:03:05.669> like<00:03:05.849> how<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.090> make<00:03:06.329> a<00:03:06.359> tie-dye

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
not really like how to make a tie-dye

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:08.839 
not really like how to make a tie-dye
tutorial<00:03:07.469> if<00:03:07.680> y'all<00:03:08.010> would<00:03:08.159> like<00:03:08.189> one<00:03:08.579> let<00:03:08.819> me

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
tutorial if y'all would like one let me

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.319 
tutorial if y'all would like one let me
know<00:03:09.980> I'm<00:03:10.980> just<00:03:11.189> showing<00:03:11.699> you<00:03:11.819> how<00:03:11.909> I<00:03:11.939> did<00:03:12.209> in

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
know I'm just showing you how I did in

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.149 
know I'm just showing you how I did in
time-lapse<00:03:12.599> but<00:03:13.049> here's<00:03:13.199> the<00:03:13.409> finished

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
time-lapse but here's the finished

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.860 
time-lapse but here's the finished
result<00:03:14.489> about<00:03:14.699> I<00:03:14.969> think<00:03:15.419> that<00:03:15.510> looks<00:03:15.659> way

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
result about I think that looks way

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.920 
result about I think that looks way
better<00:03:16.139> and<00:03:16.939> then<00:03:17.939> the<00:03:18.030> trick<00:03:18.269> here<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.750> cut

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
better and then the trick here is I cut

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.039 
better and then the trick here is I cut
it<00:03:19.049> into<00:03:19.199> four<00:03:19.560> slices<00:03:20.299> because<00:03:21.299> four<00:03:21.689> slices

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
it into four slices because four slices

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.920 
it into four slices because four slices
that<00:03:22.409> I<00:03:22.590> can<00:03:22.859> open<00:03:23.220> these<00:03:23.340> up<00:03:23.579> like<00:03:23.939> pages<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.900> a

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
that I can open these up like pages to a

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.539 
that I can open these up like pages to a
book<00:03:25.259> and<00:03:25.530> they'll<00:03:25.829> be<00:03:26.009> pretty<00:03:26.280> much

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
book and they'll be pretty much

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.860 
book and they'll be pretty much
symmetrical<00:03:27.590> it's<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.650> really<00:03:28.979> really<00:03:29.220> awesome

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
symmetrical it's a really really awesome

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.030 
symmetrical it's a really really awesome
feature<00:03:30.870> with<00:03:31.229> this<00:03:31.379> polymer<00:03:31.949> clay<00:03:33.079> I<00:03:34.079> think

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
feature with this polymer clay I think

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.999 
feature with this polymer clay I think
they<00:03:35.099> call<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.310> mirroring<00:03:35.909> I'm<00:03:36.090> not<00:03:36.329> sure

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:37.009 
they call it mirroring I'm not sure

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:40.569 
they call it mirroring I'm not sure
getting<00:03:38.009> these<00:03:38.189> ready<00:03:38.699> I'm<00:03:39.299> adding<00:03:39.689> TLS<00:03:40.319> and

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
getting these ready I'm adding TLS and

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.809 
getting these ready I'm adding TLS and
putting<00:03:41.579> one<00:03:41.849> sheet<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.419> the<00:03:43.489> clay<00:03:44.489> mixture

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
putting one sheet of the clay mixture

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.369

I<00:03:57.569> made<00:03:58.319> the<00:03:58.500> teeth<00:03:58.680> just<00:03:58.979> a<00:03:59.729> moment<00:04:00.060> ago

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
I made the teeth just a moment ago

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.300 
I made the teeth just a moment ago
and<00:04:01.169> once<00:04:01.439> I<00:04:01.560> line<00:04:01.769> them<00:04:01.859> all<00:04:01.979> in<00:04:02.129> there

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
and once I line them all in there

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
comments that it was a little too narrow

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.659 
comments that it was a little too narrow
that<00:04:22.500> this<00:04:22.620> plant<00:04:22.889> needs<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.250> be<00:04:23.400> a<00:04:23.430> little

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
that this plant needs to be a little

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:24.250 
that this plant needs to be a little
round

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
round

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.280 
round
and<00:04:24.380> I<00:04:24.440> agree<00:04:25.130> so<00:04:25.940> to<00:04:26.390> help<00:04:26.510> compensate<00:04:26.810> I'm

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
and I agree so to help compensate I'm

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.840 
and I agree so to help compensate I'm
just<00:04:27.500> putting<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.740> gums<00:04:27.980> on<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.280> outside

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
just putting the gums on the outside

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.640 
just putting the gums on the outside
it'd<00:04:29.570> have<00:04:29.690> been<00:04:29.780> much<00:04:29.930> easier<00:04:30.380> if<00:04:30.530> I<00:04:30.620> just

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
it'd have been much easier if I just

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.380 
it'd have been much easier if I just
made<00:04:30.980> a<00:04:31.010> larger<00:04:31.460> shell<00:04:31.700> though<00:04:31.940> so<00:04:32.150> I<00:04:32.210> could

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
made a larger shell though so I could

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.760 
made a larger shell though so I could
line<00:04:32.570> them<00:04:32.780> on<00:04:32.900> the<00:04:32.990> inside<00:04:35.260> now<00:04:36.260> I'm<00:04:36.410> wrapping

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
line them on the inside now I'm wrapping

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.250 
line them on the inside now I'm wrapping
it<00:04:36.890> with<00:04:36.920> the<00:04:37.220> skin<00:04:37.490> that<00:04:37.910> I<00:04:37.970> just<00:04:38.150> made<00:04:38.330> to<00:04:39.050> get

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
it with the skin that I just made to get

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.410 
it with the skin that I just made to get
it<00:04:39.410> to<00:04:39.530> go<00:04:39.680> in<00:04:39.890> there<00:04:40.130> I'm<00:04:40.340> just<00:04:40.760> using<00:04:40.970> a<00:04:41.180> dry

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
it to go in there I'm just using a dry

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.130 
it to go in there I'm just using a dry
clean<00:04:42.280> nylon<00:04:43.280> brush<00:04:43.640> and<00:04:43.970> pressing<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:45.020> in

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
clean nylon brush and pressing it in

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.410 
clean nylon brush and pressing it in
pressing<00:04:45.680> just<00:04:46.190> stabbing<00:04:46.640> it<00:04:46.790> basically<00:04:47.240> over

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
pressing just stabbing it basically over

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.420 
pressing just stabbing it basically over
and<00:04:47.540> over<00:04:47.690> it<00:04:47.780> does<00:04:47.900> nothing<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:48.440> clay<00:04:48.650> but

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
and over it does nothing to the clay but

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.950 
and over it does nothing to the clay but
it<00:04:49.520> really<00:04:49.730> does<00:04:49.970> really<00:04:50.300> good<00:04:50.510> the<00:04:50.780> clay

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
it really does really good the clay

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.190 
it really does really good the clay
sticky<00:04:51.470> it<00:04:52.220> really<00:04:52.550> gets<00:04:52.790> it<00:04:52.910> all<00:04:53.060> worked<00:04:54.020> in

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
sticky it really gets it all worked in

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.720 
sticky it really gets it all worked in
there<00:04:54.470> you<00:04:54.650> see<00:04:54.770> how<00:04:54.890> that<00:04:55.070> turned<00:04:55.310> out

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
there you see how that turned out

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.470 
there you see how that turned out
is<00:04:56.330> that<00:04:56.570> not<00:04:57.020> amazing<00:04:57.350> it's<00:04:58.070> just<00:04:58.330> it<00:04:59.330> looks

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
is that not amazing it's just it looks

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.600 
is that not amazing it's just it looks
very<00:04:59.630> plant<00:05:00.050> like<00:05:00.320> -<00:05:00.620> I<00:05:01.210> don't<00:05:02.210> know<00:05:02.410> districts

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
very plant like - I don't know districts

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.200 
very plant like - I don't know districts
um<00:05:04.640> I<00:05:05.510> added<00:05:06.170> a<00:05:06.440> piece<00:05:06.710> of<00:05:06.980> wax<00:05:07.700> paper<00:05:07.940> in

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
um I added a piece of wax paper in

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.580 
um I added a piece of wax paper in
between<00:05:08.240> the<00:05:08.720> two<00:05:08.900> so<00:05:09.140> they<00:05:09.260> wouldn't<00:05:09.440> get

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
between the two so they wouldn't get

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.460 
between the two so they wouldn't get
stuck<00:05:09.890> together<00:05:10.040> because<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:11.330> Cato's<00:05:11.750> clay

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
stuck together because the Cato's clay

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.530 
stuck together because the Cato's clay
is<00:05:12.740> very<00:05:13.190> sticky<00:05:13.610> I<00:05:13.940> don't<00:05:14.150> know<00:05:14.240> if<00:05:14.330> you<00:05:14.390> ever

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
is very sticky I don't know if you ever

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.810 
is very sticky I don't know if you ever
used<00:05:14.780> it<00:05:14.960> and<00:05:15.620> I'm<00:05:15.740> using<00:05:15.890> a<00:05:16.130> compass<00:05:16.550> just

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
used it and I'm using a compass just

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.780 
used it and I'm using a compass just
staggering<00:05:17.330> my<00:05:17.630> marks<00:05:17.990> and<00:05:19.750> then<00:05:21.760> kind<00:05:22.760> of

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
staggering my marks and then kind of

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.270 
staggering my marks and then kind of
getting<00:05:23.120> myself<00:05:23.300> a<00:05:23.750> head<00:05:23.930> start<00:05:24.260> here<00:05:24.530> using<00:05:25.160> a

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
getting myself a head start here using a

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.190 
getting myself a head start here using a
just<00:05:25.640> a<00:05:25.760> needle<00:05:26.060> tool<00:05:26.270> to<00:05:26.630> kind<00:05:26.810> of<00:05:26.900> give<00:05:27.050> me<00:05:27.170> a

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
just a needle tool to kind of give me a

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.650 
just a needle tool to kind of give me a
little<00:05:27.410> hole<00:05:27.680> and<00:05:28.010> I'm<00:05:28.940> putting<00:05:29.180> these<00:05:29.390> in

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
little hole and I'm putting these in

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.420 
little hole and I'm putting these in
there<00:05:29.870> and<00:05:30.110> positioning<00:05:31.040> them<00:05:31.160> the<00:05:31.280> way<00:05:31.400> I

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
there and positioning them the way I

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.210 
there and positioning them the way I
want<00:05:31.550> how<00:05:32.270> they<00:05:32.300> look<00:05:32.570> really<00:05:32.720> good<00:05:33.100> had<00:05:34.100> to

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
want how they look really good had to

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.270 
want how they look really good had to
cut<00:05:34.400> the<00:05:34.520> back<00:05:34.700> too<00:05:34.970> and<00:05:35.350> I<00:05:36.350> pull<00:05:36.590> each<00:05:36.860> one<00:05:37.160> of

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
cut the back too and I pull each one of

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.700 
cut the back too and I pull each one of
them<00:05:37.400> out<00:05:37.580> individually<00:05:37.820> and<00:05:38.660> add<00:05:39.200> a<00:05:39.470> little

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
them out individually and add a little

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.270 
them out individually and add a little
bit<00:05:39.830> of<00:05:39.890> TLS<00:05:40.280> and<00:05:40.750> then<00:05:41.750> I<00:05:41.990> make<00:05:42.440> a<00:05:42.470> little<00:05:42.860> tiny

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
bit of TLS and then I make a little tiny

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.700 
bit of TLS and then I make a little tiny
snake<00:05:43.910> that's<00:05:44.420> basically<00:05:45.110> the<00:05:45.290> matching

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
snake that's basically the matching

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.370 
snake that's basically the matching
material<00:05:46.250> and<00:05:46.570> work<00:05:47.570> that<00:05:47.780> on<00:05:47.990> with<00:05:48.260> the

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
material and work that on with the

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.220 
material and work that on with the
stylus<00:05:48.860> tool<00:05:49.070> each<00:05:49.580> individual<00:05:50.510> tooth<00:05:50.780> I<00:05:51.050> did

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
stylus tool each individual tooth I did

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.070 
stylus tool each individual tooth I did
this<00:05:51.470> I<00:05:51.710> pulled<00:05:51.950> it<00:05:52.070> back<00:05:52.220> out<00:05:52.430> absent<00:05:53.000> Els<00:05:53.390> and

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
this I pulled it back out absent Els and

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.320 
this I pulled it back out absent Els and
the<00:05:54.170> results<00:05:54.650> turned<00:05:54.890> out<00:05:55.040> amazing<00:05:55.330> each

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
the results turned out amazing each

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.110 
the results turned out amazing each
tooth<00:05:56.690> is<00:05:56.900> set<00:05:57.200> in<00:05:57.380> there<00:05:57.650> real<00:05:58.400> well<00:05:58.640> and<00:05:58.970> they

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
tooth is set in there real well and they

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.780 
tooth is set in there real well and they
don't<00:05:59.330> move<00:05:59.450> around<00:05:59.660> they<00:05:59.990> don't<00:06:00.170> wiggle<00:06:00.790> I'm
