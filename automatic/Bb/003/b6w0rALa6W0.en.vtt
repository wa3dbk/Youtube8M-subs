mark you put into the game and the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.160 
mark you put into the game and the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
amount players put into the game it's

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.429 
amount players put into the game it's
kind<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:08.000> yeah<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.659> mean<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:10.020> wouldn't<00:01:10.200> take

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
kind of yeah I mean we wouldn't take

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.810 
kind of yeah I mean we wouldn't take
that<00:01:10.470> away<00:01:10.680> from<00:01:10.770> them<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.250> think<00:01:11.460> also<00:01:11.580> it

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
that away from them and I think also it

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.910 
that away from them and I think also it
gives<00:01:11.939> us<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.270> good<00:01:12.420> discipline<00:01:12.900> because<00:01:13.200> you

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
gives us a good discipline because you

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.950 
gives us a good discipline because you
start<00:01:14.549> with<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.820> features<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.150> LBP<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:15.720> and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
start with the features of LBP one and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.499 
start with the features of LBP one and
there<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.229> familiarity<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:18.030> with<00:01:18.180> lbp2

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
there the familiarity so but with lbp2

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.210 
there the familiarity so but with lbp2
and<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:18.990> new<00:01:19.170> features<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.799> actually<00:01:20.070> makes

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and the new features it actually makes

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.830 
and the new features it actually makes
it<00:01:20.340> easier<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:20.850> recently<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:21.360> got<00:01:21.630> some

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
it easier so recently we got some

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.679 
it easier so recently we got some
creators<00:01:22.200> into<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> office<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.420> we<00:01:24.420> asked

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
creators into the office and we asked

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.730 
creators into the office and we asked
them<00:01:24.750> we<00:01:24.900> showed<00:01:25.049> them<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.259> demo<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.710> game

game<00:05:58.080> room<00:05:58.230> I<00:05:58.530> tend<00:05:59.520> to<00:05:59.640> go<00:05:59.760> for<00:05:59.790> those<00:06:00.030> kind<00:06:00.270> of

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300

game room I tend to go for those kind of
games<00:06:00.450> and<00:06:00.750> so<00:06:00.870> what<00:06:01.470> they've<00:06:01.680> done<00:06:01.710> is

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.440 
games and so what they've done is
they've<00:06:02.280> really<00:06:02.490> lowered<00:06:02.850> the<00:06:02.970> barrier<00:06:03.150> to

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
they've really lowered the barrier to

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:04.670 
they've really lowered the barrier to
entry<00:06:03.510> they've<00:06:03.930> really<00:06:04.110> made<00:06:04.170> it<00:06:04.290> easy<00:06:04.560> to

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
entry they've really made it easy to

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.160 
entry they've really made it easy to
create<00:06:04.770> a<00:06:05.340> little<00:06:06.030> bit<00:06:06.150> planet<00:06:06.420> to<00:06:06.660> we're

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
create a little bit planet to we're

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.380 
create a little bit planet to we're
focusing<00:06:07.710> on<00:06:07.770> breath<00:06:08.070> that<00:06:08.520> one<00:06:08.760> word<00:06:09.030> summary

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
focusing on breath that one word summary

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.510 
focusing on breath that one word summary
of<00:06:09.630> a<00:06:09.690> little<00:06:09.870> bit<00:06:09.960> too<00:06:10.290> is<00:06:10.440> more<00:06:10.980> power<00:06:11.250> to<00:06:11.430> the

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
of a little bit too is more power to the

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.460 
of a little bit too is more power to the
users<00:06:11.820> which<00:06:11.970> simultaneously<00:06:12.320> makes<00:06:13.320> it

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
users which simultaneously makes it

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.070 
users which simultaneously makes it
easier<00:06:13.770> for<00:06:14.370> people<00:06:15.240> to<00:06:15.420> create<00:06:15.690> but<00:06:15.900> at<00:06:15.990> the

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
easier for people to create but at the

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.040 
easier for people to create but at the
same<00:06:16.260> time<00:06:16.440> the<00:06:16.620> top<00:06:16.800> end<00:06:17.010> can<00:06:17.670> just<00:06:17.940> go<00:06:18.090> wild

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
same time the top end can just go wild

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.080 
same time the top end can just go wild
so<00:06:19.199> I<00:06:19.620> don't<00:06:19.830> know<00:06:20.009> the<00:06:20.099> industry<00:06:20.400> needs<00:06:20.759> to<00:06:20.970> do

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
so I don't know the industry needs to do

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.450 
so I don't know the industry needs to do
that<00:06:21.270> but<00:06:21.569> what<00:06:21.720> I<00:06:21.750> love<00:06:21.810> is<00:06:22.139> we've<00:06:22.949> really

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
that but what I love is we've really

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.649 
that but what I love is we've really
shown<00:06:23.490> that<00:06:23.909> there's<00:06:24.090> an<00:06:24.180> untapped

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:24.659 
shown that there's an untapped

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:26.240 
shown that there's an untapped
creativity<00:06:25.349> that<00:06:25.530> there<00:06:25.740> are<00:06:25.830> people<00:06:25.860> out

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
creativity that there are people out

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.860 
creativity that there are people out
there<00:06:26.280> even<00:06:27.150> people<00:06:27.300> who<00:06:27.419> don't<00:06:27.509> consider

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
there even people who don't consider

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.930 
there even people who don't consider
themselves<00:06:28.229> creative<00:06:28.919> who<00:06:29.610> actually

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
themselves creative who actually

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.520 
themselves creative who actually
discovered<00:06:30.330> that<00:06:30.750> they<00:06:30.930> have<00:06:31.139> something<00:06:31.379> to

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
discovered that they have something to

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.200 
discovered that they have something to
bring<00:06:31.770> they<00:06:32.039> have<00:06:32.220> game<00:06:32.610> design<00:06:32.940> in<00:06:33.090> them

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
bring they have game design in them

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.939 
bring they have game design in them
sometimes<00:06:33.690> gamers<00:06:33.930> can<00:06:34.229> be<00:06:34.319> the<00:06:34.470> best<00:06:34.710> game

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:34.949 
sometimes gamers can be the best game

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:38.059 
sometimes gamers can be the best game
designers<00:06:35.460> and<00:06:35.690> I<00:06:36.690> guess<00:06:37.229> thats<00:06:37.650> that's<00:06:37.949> a

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:38.069 
designers and I guess thats that's a

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:40.219 
designers and I guess thats that's a
message<00:06:38.280> which<00:06:38.610> can<00:06:38.849> go<00:06:39.300> through<00:06:39.539> all<00:06:39.690> genres

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:40.229 
message which can go through all genres

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:42.680 
message which can go through all genres
whether<00:06:40.470> it's<00:06:40.680> something<00:06:41.400> pure<00:06:42.180> like<00:06:42.419> little

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
whether it's something pure like little

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.020 
whether it's something pure like little
big<00:06:42.810> planet<00:06:42.840> which<00:06:43.229> is<00:06:43.319> very<00:06:43.620> into<00:06:43.889> ugc<00:06:44.340> but<00:06:44.550> it

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 
big planet which is very into ugc but it

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.909 
big planet which is very into ugc but it
could<00:06:45.270> percolate<00:06:46.080> all<00:06:46.229> the<00:06:46.349> way<00:06:46.470> until<00:06:46.650> you

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
could percolate all the way until you

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:48.439 
could percolate all the way until you
know<00:06:47.039> the<00:06:47.190> biggest<00:06:47.400> franchises<00:06:47.940> oh<00:06:48.180> and<00:06:48.389> I

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.899 
know the biggest franchises oh and I
really<00:06:48.750> hope<00:06:48.900> it<00:06:49.050> does<00:06:49.199> it<00:06:49.379> become<00:06:49.819> thank<00:06:50.819> you
