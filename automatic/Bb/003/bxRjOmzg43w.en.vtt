point<00:00:17.940> 2<00:00:18.180> megapixel<00:00:18.960> camera<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.500> it's<00:00:19.770> got

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
point 2 megapixel camera and it's got

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.670 
point 2 megapixel camera and it's got
amazing<00:00:20.400> technology<00:00:21.300> improvements<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.410> let's

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
amazing technology improvements so let's

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.700 
amazing technology improvements so let's
dive<00:00:22.859> right<00:00:22.920> into<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:24.029> 70d<00:00:24.630> uses<00:00:25.439> on-chip

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
phase detection autofocus now that's

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.769 
phase detection autofocus now that's
been<00:00:29.460> around<00:00:29.550> for<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.000> while<00:00:30.029> actually<00:00:30.359> since

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
been around for a while actually since

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.680 
been around for a while actually since
2010<00:00:31.650> but<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.399> been<00:00:32.579> kind<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.940> limited<00:00:33.450> it

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690

percent of frame width and height and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.420 
percent of frame width and height and
cover<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.079> low-light<00:00:55.559> conditions<00:00:55.800> down

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
cover you in low-light conditions down

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.599 
cover you in low-light conditions down
to<00:00:56.699> zero<00:00:57.210> eV<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.469> closed<00:00:58.800> aperture<00:00:59.460> of

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
to zero eV and the closed aperture of

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.180 
to zero eV and the closed aperture of
f11<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.840> you're<00:01:00.960> really<00:01:01.260> going<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.829> great

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
f11 so you're really going to have great

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.680 
f11 so you're really going to have great
flexibility<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.059> any<00:01:03.239> lighting<00:01:03.539> condition

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
flexibility in any lighting condition

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.039 
flexibility in any lighting condition
now<00:01:04.530> all<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.040> means<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.939> 70d<00:01:06.600> focus

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
now all of this means that the 70d focus

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.620 
now all of this means that the 70d focus
is<00:01:07.229> faster<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.010> more<00:01:08.310> accurately<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.600> can

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
is faster and more accurately you can

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.750 
is faster and more accurately you can
almost<00:01:09.930> see<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> dark<00:01:10.619> let's<00:01:11.400> talk<00:01:11.610> about

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
almost see in the dark let's talk about

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.300 
almost see in the dark let's talk about
the<00:01:11.970> sensor<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.869> 20<00:01:13.200> point<00:01:13.409> 2<00:01:13.590> megapixel

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
the sensor the 20 point 2 megapixel

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.090 
the sensor the 20 point 2 megapixel

highest resolution aps-c sensor to date

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.270 
highest resolution aps-c sensor to date
and<00:01:20.540> they've<00:01:21.540> even<00:01:21.990> given<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.650> digit<00:01:23.040> 5

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
and they've even given it the digit 5

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.090 
and they've even given it the digit 5
plus<00:01:23.759> processor<00:01:24.240> that's<00:01:25.140> currently<00:01:25.560> used<00:01:25.890> in

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
plus processor that's currently used in

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.550 
plus processor that's currently used in
the<00:01:26.250> 5d<00:01:26.640> Mark<00:01:26.880> 3<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.750> does<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.049> helps

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
the 5d Mark 3 what that does is helps

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.859 
the 5d Mark 3 what that does is helps
reduce<00:01:28.950> noise<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.909> cups<00:01:30.150> correct<00:01:30.570> for

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
reduce noise and it cups correct for

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.450 
reduce noise and it cups correct for
more<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> patterning<00:01:31.950> which<00:01:32.100> can<00:01:32.280> be<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.400> problem

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
more a patterning which can be a problem

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.670 
more a patterning which can be a problem
in<00:01:32.909> video<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.600> that's<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.079> nice<00:01:34.229> feature<00:01:34.470> to

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
in video so that's a nice feature to

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.069 
in video so that's a nice feature to
have<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:35.159> will<00:01:35.729> also<00:01:35.909> help<00:01:36.390> with<00:01:36.479> real-time

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
have it will also help with real-time

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.069 
have it will also help with real-time
compensation<00:01:38.070> for<00:01:38.549> chromatic<00:01:38.880> aberration<00:01:39.600> so

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
compensation for chromatic aberration so

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.020 
compensation for chromatic aberration so
again<00:01:40.500> you're<00:01:40.710> getting<00:01:40.829> really<00:01:41.280> sharp<00:01:41.729> clean

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
again you're getting really sharp clean

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.560 
again you're getting really sharp clean

that's<00:02:07.320> something<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.950> won't<00:02:08.190> get<00:02:08.550> if

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
that's something that you won't get if

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.440 
that's something that you won't get if
you're<00:02:08.879> shooting<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.390> 60<00:02:09.780> D
