here<00:00:53.460> because<00:00:53.789> apparently<00:00:54.239> there's<00:00:54.480> a

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
here because apparently there's a

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.959 
here because apparently there's a
copyright<00:00:55.110> issue<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.890> textures<00:00:56.789> or

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
copyright issue with the textures or

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.369

meshes that he was using for the
original<00:00:58.770> models<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.550> replace<00:01:00.059> them<00:01:00.300> with

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
original models so you replace them with

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.569 
original models so you replace them with
the<00:01:00.600> hollow<00:01:01.559> textures<00:01:02.129> because<00:01:02.309> that's

the hollow textures because that's

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.950
