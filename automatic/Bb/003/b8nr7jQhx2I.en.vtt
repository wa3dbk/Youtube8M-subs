that about reading comics it's so good

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.910 
that about reading comics it's so good
it<00:02:55.120> was<00:02:55.239> kind<00:02:55.630> of<00:02:55.660> like<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.900> weird<00:02:56.260> epiphany<00:02:56.890> of

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
it was kind of like a weird epiphany of

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.890 
it was kind of like a weird epiphany of
mine<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.430> shouldn't<00:02:57.730> have<00:02:57.849> been<00:02:58.030> but<00:02:58.299> it<00:02:58.630> was

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
mine it shouldn't have been but it was

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.199 
mine it shouldn't have been but it was
and<00:02:59.260> it's<00:02:59.410> cool<00:02:59.620> like<00:03:00.040> this<00:03:00.310> panel<00:03:00.760> or<00:03:00.880> going

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
and it's cool like this panel or going

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.509 
and it's cool like this panel or going
on<00:03:01.390> right<00:03:01.660> here<00:03:01.690> it's<00:03:02.140> so<00:03:02.470> great<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.340> more

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
on right here it's so great the more

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.670 
on right here it's so great the more
panels<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.239> better<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.540> think<00:03:04.989> at<00:03:05.140> least<00:03:05.319> with

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
panels the better I think at least with

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.740 
panels the better I think at least with
the<00:03:05.799> playing<00:03:06.099> of<00:03:06.340> panels<00:03:06.730> this<00:03:07.030> way<00:03:07.299> it<00:03:07.569> gives

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
the playing of panels this way it gives

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.020 
the playing of panels this way it gives
me<00:03:08.410> a<00:03:08.440> sense<00:03:08.739> of<00:03:08.980> more<00:03:09.190> movement<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:09.849> action

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
me a sense of more movement and action

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.580 
me a sense of more movement and action
which<00:03:10.420> I<00:03:10.569> really<00:03:10.840> like<00:03:11.019> so<00:03:11.200> with<00:03:11.319> that<00:03:11.440> being

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590
