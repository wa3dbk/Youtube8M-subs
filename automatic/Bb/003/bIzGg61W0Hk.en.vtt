00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.199
 factory with 502 this one he finished 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.380
 be formatted it is clean up the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.789
 start screen I go I go 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.800
 put here to turn off the others 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.010
 two devices for you to see the time 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.840
 that it takes to turn this unit off and 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.450
 this other device here since he already 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:42.800
 went to another screen here come O 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:42.800
 123 and engine is gone 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.929
 now that was the motogp he took a 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.519
 some time before when he is 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:59.839
 the owner of the device 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:02.570
 he had made the upgrade of 4445 is 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.699
 it took about 1 to 2 minutes and 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.939
 even after formatting from 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:11.810
 formatted in civil as long as it 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:15.350
 in relation to the vote and 2015 that 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:19.009
 came with android 5.0 installed it 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.229
 ie the android is in this device 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.670
 here is should have some problem because 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.850
 It's taking so long, there are lots of people. 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.520
 complaining of the slowness there are many people 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.229
 wanting to go back to 444 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.200
 I even talked to a motorola person. 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.380
 It was the Sindal imagine this happening. 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.780
 They do not assume this, I think it's a 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.270
 mistake I think I have to assume yes I can 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.000
 they put an android there that much 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.979
 people complaining about the channel itself is a 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.619
 two three five are several people 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.390
 complaining and slowness in the thirst wall 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.819
 there are several people who are loving it 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:59.569
 said that it is very fluid but must be 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:02:01.789
 Yes, some part is part of the people who 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:03.560
 have 1 moto gp and claiming another part 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.479
 You're loving it, you understand, you can not 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.819
 you can not measure more or less 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:14.690
 percentage is 50 50 60 40 understood more 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.970
 there are many devices that are slow 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.640
 many second generation motorcycle g 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.670
 Slowly, then it has to stay. 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.099
 very clear that if you update it 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.780
 for 502 you run the risk of having 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.830
 slowness as well as many people 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.840
 updated samsung galaxy s 5 pro 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.209
 uepa the android pop five that have had 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.209
 calendar to aaa calendar contacts 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.599
 deleted returned the bank's problem 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.890
 camera understood in my s5 I did not have 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.700
 any problem 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.769
 It's good being with you in relation to s5 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.830
 It was a motorola guy who told me 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.450
 maybe the problem is a person's 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.040
 samsung who also told me about this 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.300
 problem and I also read it on the 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.069
 I respect that 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.650
 now the motorola itself 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.180
 recognize that you are having trouble talking 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.849
 so do not just do a restore of 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:09.290
 factory that is normal does not stay normal 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:12.260
 It's not even you who have 1 444 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:17.510
 turn the device off if it 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:19.639
 have formatted is divisible time 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.069
 that it takes to hang up if it is the 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:25.280
 same time to connect with android 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.840
 with android 5750 2 leaves description 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.900
 of the video because then I do another 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.969
 video talking but he kept reading it 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.560
 It was slow so it's good the staff then 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:35.120
 I hope you enjoyed it. 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.719

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.760
 channel
