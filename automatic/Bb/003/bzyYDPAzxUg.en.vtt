00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
about the product what I thought of it

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.340 
about the product what I thought of it
and<00:00:31.410> how<00:00:32.309> well<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.579> does<00:00:32.700> its<00:00:32.850> job<00:00:32.940> etc<00:00:33.350> so

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
and how well it does its job etc so

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.870 
and how well it does its job etc so
let's<00:00:34.380> get<00:00:34.829> started<00:00:35.100> with<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.309> unboxing<00:00:35.430> I

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
let's get started with the unboxing I

00:00:35.880 --> 00:01:00.740 
let's get started with the unboxing I
guess<00:00:54.680> so<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:56.120> is<00:00:57.120> what<00:00:58.219> we<00:00:59.219> get<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.239> box

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
guess so this is what we get in the box

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.560 
guess so this is what we get in the box
okay<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:02.039> get<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.430> savvy<00:01:02.969> sticker<00:01:03.359> that's

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
okay so we get a savvy sticker that's

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.630 
okay so we get a savvy sticker that's
actually<00:01:03.960> quite<00:01:04.769> common<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.159> today's

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
actually quite common with today's

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.730 
actually quite common with today's

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
products then a lot companies are

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.039

to<00:02:55.730> changed<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.510> EPI<00:02:56.750> he's<00:02:57.079> actually<00:02:57.320> on<00:02:57.620> the

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
to changed the EPI he's actually on the

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.530 
to changed the EPI he's actually on the
bottom<00:02:58.010> of<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.250> mouse<00:02:58.459> now<00:02:59.000> in<00:02:59.239> my<00:02:59.390> opinion

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
bottom of the mouse now in my opinion

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.509 
bottom of the mouse now in my opinion
that's<00:03:00.109> a<00:03:00.260> really<00:03:00.829> good<00:03:00.980> idea

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
that's a really good idea

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.670 
that's a really good idea
seeing<00:03:01.940> as<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.840> mouse<00:03:02.989> how<00:03:03.170> I<00:03:03.200> have<00:03:03.440> at<00:03:03.620> the

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
seeing as the mouse how I have at the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.890 
seeing as the mouse how I have at the
moment<00:03:04.190> I<00:03:04.220> sometimes<00:03:05.060> accidentally<00:03:05.720> press

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
moment I sometimes accidentally press

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.960 
moment I sometimes accidentally press
the<00:03:06.049> DPI<00:03:06.470> button<00:03:06.890> which<00:03:07.370> changes<00:03:07.790> my

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
the DPI button which changes my

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.670 
the DPI button which changes my
sensitivity<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.870> he<00:03:08.930> can<00:03:09.200> throw<00:03:09.230> me<00:03:09.590> off

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
sensitivity and he can throw me off

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.170 
sensitivity and he can throw me off

drinks and such shouldn't be a problem
as<00:04:33.380> it<00:04:33.889> is<00:04:34.580> resistant<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:35.389> liquids<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:37.330> edges

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
as it is resistant to liquids the edges

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.480 
as it is resistant to liquids the edges
are<00:04:38.540> actually<00:04:38.720> triple<00:04:39.440> stitched<00:04:39.770> this<00:04:40.040> is<00:04:40.250> to

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
are actually triple stitched this is to

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.659 
are actually triple stitched this is to
stop<00:04:41.180> fry<00:04:41.690> on<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.110> edges<00:04:42.590> and<00:04:42.770> that<00:04:43.220> should

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
stop fry on the edges and that should

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.640 
stop fry on the edges and that should
give<00:04:43.850> it<00:04:44.229> much<00:04:45.229> longer<00:04:45.590> life<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:47.470> edges<00:04:48.470> are

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
give it much longer life the edges are

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.120 
give it much longer life the edges are
also<00:04:48.800> rolled<00:04:49.510> so<00:04:50.510> when<00:04:51.140> you've<00:04:51.350> got<00:04:51.380> your<00:04:51.770> hand

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
on there it should actually be quite

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.810 
on there it should actually be quite
comfortable<00:04:54.680> for<00:04:54.979> your<00:04:55.160> wrist<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.460> be<00:04:55.550> on<00:04:55.669> the
