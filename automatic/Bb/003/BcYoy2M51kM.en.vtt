gold detailing and these are really easy

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.570 
gold detailing and these are really easy
to<00:06:21.290> put<00:06:21.500> on<00:06:21.650> because<00:06:21.860> they're<00:06:22.220> actually<00:06:22.400> a

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
to put on because they're actually a

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.370 
to put on because they're actually a
Velcro<00:06:23.120> at<00:06:23.240> the<00:06:23.330> bottom<00:06:23.600> but<00:06:23.750> this<00:06:23.870> one<00:06:24.050> you<00:06:24.200> do

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
Velcro at the bottom but this one you do

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.580 
Velcro at the bottom but this one you do
have<00:06:24.410> to<00:06:24.890> clip<00:06:25.670> on<00:06:25.910> such<00:06:26.570> like<00:06:26.840> bags<00:06:27.110> I<00:06:27.380> then

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
have to clip on such like bags I then

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.260 
have to clip on such like bags I then
got<00:06:27.800> a<00:06:27.830> necklace<00:06:28.280> and<00:06:28.580> I<00:06:28.790> thought<00:06:29.000> it<00:06:29.150> was

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
got a necklace and I thought it was

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.640 
got a necklace and I thought it was
gonna<00:06:29.450> be<00:06:29.660> different<00:06:29.900> because<00:06:30.140> it<00:06:30.410> looks<00:06:30.560> a

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
gonna be different because it looks a

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.290 
gonna be different because it looks a
little<00:06:30.710> bit<00:06:30.980> different<00:06:31.100> on<00:06:31.400> the<00:06:31.520> website<00:06:31.940> but

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
little bit different on the website but

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.850 
little bit different on the website but
I<00:06:32.390> still<00:06:32.630> really<00:06:32.720> like<00:06:32.990> it<00:06:33.140> because<00:06:33.230> you<00:06:33.710> can

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
I still really like it because you can

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.070 
I still really like it because you can
just<00:06:34.010> wear<00:06:34.220> like<00:06:34.250> a<00:06:34.430> plain<00:06:34.790> outfit<00:06:35.720> and<00:06:35.930> then

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
just wear like a plain outfit and then

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.170 
just wear like a plain outfit and then
just<00:06:36.380> spice<00:06:36.680> it<00:06:36.890> up<00:06:36.919> on<00:06:37.190> with<00:06:37.340> this<00:06:37.490> pretty
