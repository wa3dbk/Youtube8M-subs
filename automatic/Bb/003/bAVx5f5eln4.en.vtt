00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
beach's to these I had a um an adapter

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.249 
beach's to these I had a um an adapter
but<00:01:35.159> uh<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:36.119> turns<00:01:36.450> out<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.840> didn't<00:01:37.079> really

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
but uh it turns out that I didn't really

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.450 
but uh it turns out that I didn't really
need<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.500> use<00:01:37.650> one<00:01:37.799> because<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.159> forgot<00:01:38.430> that

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
need to use one because I forgot that

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.330 
need to use one because I forgot that
the<00:01:38.880> back<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:40.079> turtle<00:01:40.710> beach's<00:01:41.070> already

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
the back of the turtle beach's already

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.920 
the back of the turtle beach's already
have<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> little<00:01:41.729> hole<00:01:41.939> for<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.630> go<00:01:42.750> through

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
have a little hole for it to go through

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.539 
have a little hole for it to go through
so<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.500> not<00:01:43.619> necessary<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.220> could<00:01:44.369> just

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
so this is not necessary you could just

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.660 
so this is not necessary you could just
connect<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:46.320> will<00:01:46.439> work

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
connect it like this and it will work

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.830 
connect it like this and it will work
