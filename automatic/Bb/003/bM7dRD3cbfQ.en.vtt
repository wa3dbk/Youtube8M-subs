00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:04.430
 the polar bear is still on the shirts the intention is to put one there 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.140
 sponsor name 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.740
 In the past two weeks, more than 300 companies have been approached but have not yet arrived 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.209
 very happy I hope that the coming days also have some more certainty 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.209
 because at the moment I have signed a contract 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.279
 this still 39 to go 39 but on one of this week I hope to say it 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.339
 significantly less smoothly 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:29.199
 however, no bills can be paid after the end 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.180
 during the presentation prior to the match against eindhoven a 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.559
 number of potential sponsors see themselves but commitments at feyenoord always 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.130
 is our greatest enemy 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.170
 you look this should just be sold so you should try to get it that is 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.600
 a big disadvantage of normally you do there quietly reduce it's time again 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.980
 before the conversation the object 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.960
 now is just that way 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.620
 that can be in two weeks lasted three weeks lasted four weeks but certainly 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.130
 is that to make a decision in December or worse yet 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.030
 for the publicity can help with a positive decision the new code was maes 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.990
 sun takes care of it anyway 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.790
 he is the son of actress dolby hand and grabbed for basel maybe they can 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.220
 offer help that said pda teacher leader 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.270
 yes there are more than in May 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.210
 Ramadan I can hear from you, but what the maere the first match were 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.300
 but where 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.890
 after what they do but the offender 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.990
 christie's for this often means big numbers 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.460
 offender was on which is not yet entitled to change 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.540
 to take the lead and 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.960
 carter had it alone in the garden 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.800
 both but i did say that i did leave in the first half in an hour 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.140
 see weird club that time you want to do the climbs and ria three times 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.460
 the two keepers by the washing water 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.680
 in the summer weather thereby he becomes unwell by the cork I have 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.060
 my baby has to and let's chose the movie theaters 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.929
 we pick up the match against Eindhoven in the second period at the stand 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.280
 de vries plays in the red shirts 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.310
 has a man less on the ice, that is what eindhoven benefits from 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.369
 the wind pulled scores for eindhoven 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.980
 not even two minutes later 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.820
 christie's has two more men on the ice and then they have to go 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.549
 taking advantage 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.209
 this comes equality of man a shot it's hard to see but through 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.209
 katwijk this is then 2 to 2 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.950
 in the last period the groningers get many chances to do it though 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:36.929
 decide 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:41.209
 nothing happens and so often the hit falls on the other side 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.879
 Eindhoven become a 4 show and he makes the winning goal 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.730
 there's nothing wrong with 3 2 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.760
 but the game level is getting better now with enough money to continue 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.930
 being able
