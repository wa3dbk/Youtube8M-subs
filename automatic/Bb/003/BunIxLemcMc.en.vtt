00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:19.010
 Canon color image scanner 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.010
 As we purchased a scanner 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:27.910
 I think it's easy to introduce roughly roughly 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:39.989
 this 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.989
 Scanner Scanner It's hard to say 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.350
 This is an affordable guy who can buy for less than 10,000 yen 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.680
 It feels like 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.160
 It's a very important instrument here- 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:11.220
 It is the second thin to sell here 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.220
 It is such a feeling that it is column 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:22.980
 It's a vertical stand here 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:26.470
 It is a manual after this is attached 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.090

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.620

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:37.850
 8 Basically here 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:40.710
 It's a usb cable and it's also included 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:47.479
 And connect here to the PC 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.479
 It has a mechanism to turn on automatically 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:59.100
 So there is no power on / off button 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.100
 The front panel looks like this 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.520
 Eh 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.360
 As a matter of caution, first of all 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.820
 this 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:17.580
 Setup cd-rom After installing this driver 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:22.310
 Connect this 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:26.630
 It has become settled, such as 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:30.050
 It is something like a break and do not keep it 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.490
 8 Written in the manual 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.490
 It is unlocked afterward 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:44.140

 It will turn on if you do so 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.560
 It's a little small place, but this time I took a little shot here 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.890
 We do 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.890

 I want to see it in the bird book 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.209
 It is such a feeling to match here 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.550
 Cover 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.550

 If the auto-scan here by pressing the Do and Pochitsu 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.239
 The scan starts 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.080
 It is like this 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.940
 It will be confused is such the I bird intuition Street is here now feel 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.140

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.740
 It is not Kangakuin school 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:29.440
 It's like this Ska Suka Naa was a bit tired but there is no horse 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.530

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.180

 Less than 10,000 yen 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.270
 It is such feeling that purchased a cheap model 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.500
 You can work on it properly 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:13.259
 a software is here 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:24.789

 Click here for the Canon printer 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.620
 It's not a scanner, is it? 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.180
 Scanner of the person 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.180

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.190
 Ochanetto usb type blue 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.720
 on the other hand 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.830
 Because 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:21.420
 It is very difficult to use 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.689
