video<00:00:05.069> we'd<00:00:05.549> like<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.850> quickly<00:00:06.120> show<00:00:06.480> you<00:00:06.509> what

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
video we'd like to quickly show you what

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.870 
video we'd like to quickly show you what
we<00:00:07.140> think<00:00:07.170> is<00:00:07.529> so<00:00:07.680> special<00:00:08.130> about<00:00:08.160> smart<00:00:08.610> slope

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
we think is so special about smart slope

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.730 
we think is so special about smart slope
and<00:00:09.090> how<00:00:09.540> it<00:00:09.719> looks<00:00:09.929> when<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.200> actually<00:00:10.380> take

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
and how it looks when you actually take

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.530 
and how it looks when you actually take
it<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.099> field<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.700> build<00:00:12.150> them<00:00:12.330> into

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
it to the field and you build them into

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.530 
it to the field and you build them into
a<00:00:12.900> living<00:00:13.200> wall<00:00:13.820> smart<00:00:14.820> slopes<00:00:15.059> got<00:00:15.240> great

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
a living wall smart slopes got great

very<00:00:25.529> accurate<00:00:26.010> for<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.220> contractor<00:00:26.820> it's

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
very accurate for the contractor it's

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.540 
very accurate for the contractor it's
got<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> very<00:00:27.930> large<00:00:28.260> fill<00:00:28.650> receiving<00:00:29.099> pocket

got a very large fill receiving pocket

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.370 
got a very large fill receiving pocket
that<00:00:29.970> means<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.420> can<00:00:30.570> hold<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.810> lot<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.170> soil

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
that means you can hold a lot of soil

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.799
