like I said the 20 gram to the small

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.510 
like I said the 20 gram to the small
tube<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.450> going<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:07.020> last<00:02:07.200> me<00:02:07.469> six<00:02:07.500> months<00:02:08.569> so<00:02:09.569> I

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
tube is going to last me six months so I

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.540 
tube is going to last me six months so I
put<00:02:12.520> it<00:02:12.640> on<00:02:12.790> very<00:02:13.150> very<00:02:13.360> sparsely<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.740> think

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
put it on very very sparsely I think

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.150 
put it on very very sparsely I think
this<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:15.940> why<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.239> didn't<00:02:16.870> have<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.440> mean<00:02:17.739> red

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
this is why I didn't have the mean red

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.260 
this is why I didn't have the mean red
skin<00:02:18.610> when<00:02:18.819> I<00:02:18.849> first<00:02:19.209> started<00:02:19.569> last<00:02:19.810> August<00:02:20.050> I

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
skin when I first started last August I

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.660 
skin when I first started last August I
I<00:02:22.380> think<00:02:23.380> it's<00:02:23.530> because<00:02:23.860> I<00:02:23.890> used<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.340> small

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
I think it's because I used a small

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.510
