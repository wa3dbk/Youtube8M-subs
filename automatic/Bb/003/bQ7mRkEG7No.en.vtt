 between these two squads the two 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.160
 last were in games 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.020
 Central Americans and the Caribbean 2014 with 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.370
 balance of a tie and a victory for 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.650
 ours 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.600
 the Mexican women's soccer team 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.460
 will face on Tuesday its similar 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.560
 from Colombia in his debut in the cup of 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.690
 world that is celebrated in canada within 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.240
 of the efe group sharing a space with the 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.160
 oncenas France and England 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.200
 third time in less than a year 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.610
 will measure before the coffee growers since 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.520
 in Central American games and the 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.870
 caribbean in veracruz in 2014 saw the 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.360
 faces twice 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.460
 now those directed by leonardo cuÃ©llar 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.710
 they have the difficult task of facing 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.210
 again before this combined that 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.309
 football has had a 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.199
 important growth in a first 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.089
 match of the maximum just where the 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.059
 Mexicans can not afford to 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.190
 let go points we come with a 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.790
 humility and with a great commitment 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.760
 then we know very well that we will have 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.409
 to make a perfect match to get out 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.179
 with the victory 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.119
 and I think that the team is very 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:18.290
 motivated clearly understands that there is a 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:22.340
 great rivalry 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.840
 we respect the Colombian program but 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.850
 tomorrow will be the third world cup 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.190
 for the national team and 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.820
 which had participation in germany 2011 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.530
 and in the us in 1999 while in the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.810
 first participation did not harvest 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.330
 units four years ago the female tri 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.330
 added his first two points with draws 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.150
 before england and new zealand is a 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.640
 colombia team that has always been 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.980
 difficult not to play is a team 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.170
 very good he did not underestimate any and 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.780
 a fairly similar team not a team 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.150
 latin like mexico that comes out 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.950
 make your game too and well no 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.810
 We are confident but sure of what 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.240
 that we have worked on how we come
