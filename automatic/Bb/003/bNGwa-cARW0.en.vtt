put off by it i'm only using it because

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.230 
put off by it i'm only using it because
it<00:00:12.630> means<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.900> can<00:00:13.019> see<00:00:13.200> what<00:00:13.290> i'm<00:00:13.349> doing<00:00:13.500> any

when you're learning to do the hell is

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.130 
when you're learning to do the hell is
to<00:00:46.829> actually<00:00:47.550> do<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.210> curve<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.510> back<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.050> it

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
to actually do to curve the back of it

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.770 
to actually do to curve the back of it
like<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.710> which<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.730> what<00:00:50.879> we<00:00:51.000> want<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
like that which is what we want for the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.319 
like that which is what we want for the
sea<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.260> don't<00:00:52.469> want<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.770> curve<00:00:53.190> for<00:00:53.550> now<00:00:53.699> we

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
sea we don't want that curve for now we

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.959 
sea we don't want that curve for now we
do<00:00:54.539> want<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> capital<00:00:55.590> c<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.100> be<00:00:56.699> going

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
do want it for a capital c and be going

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.029 
do want it for a capital c and be going
to<00:00:57.059> even<00:00:57.270> exaggerate<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.930> slightly<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
to even exaggerate it slightly and the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.979 
to even exaggerate it slightly and the
other<00:00:59.160> part<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.940> sea<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.510> bottom<00:01:00.809> part

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
other part of the sea is the bottom part

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.520 
other part of the sea is the bottom part
of<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.260> which<00:01:01.379> curves<00:01:01.710> around<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.510> in<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:04.229> so

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
of it which curves around and in like so

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.340 
of it which curves around and in like so
we<00:01:05.280> put<00:01:05.460> them<00:01:05.549> together<00:01:05.670> now<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.210> you'll<00:01:07.080> see

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
we put them together now and you'll see

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.570 
we put them together now and you'll see
how<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.610> data<00:01:08.930> functions<00:01:10.010> we<00:01:11.010> come<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.400> on<00:01:11.549> a

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
how the data functions we come up on a

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.060 
how the data functions we come up on a
nap<00:01:11.760> stroke<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:13.170> we<00:01:13.260> come<00:01:13.500> down<00:01:13.710> curve<00:01:14.369> in

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
nap stroke and we come down curve in

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.990 
nap stroke and we come down curve in
like<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.310> that's<00:01:18.030> rather<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:19.110> generous

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
like that that's rather a generous

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.340 
like that that's rather a generous
capital<00:01:21.000> C<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:22.170> also<00:01:22.320> possible<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.520> do<00:01:23.759> a

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
capital C it's also possible to do a

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:32.070 
capital C it's also possible to do a
thinner<00:01:25.350> version<00:01:28.070> like<00:01:29.070> that

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.580 

I<00:01:33.300> tend<00:01:34.300> to<00:01:34.390> do<00:01:34.600> this<00:01:34.750> slightly<00:01:35.260> thinner

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
I tend to do this slightly thinner

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.800 
I tend to do this slightly thinner
version<00:01:35.680> when<00:01:36.160> I'm<00:01:36.280> doing<00:01:36.430> it<00:01:36.610> myself<00:01:36.810> which

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
version when I'm doing it myself which

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.350 
version when I'm doing it myself which
is<00:01:37.840> more<00:01:38.640> like<00:01:39.640> a<00:01:39.670> bee<00:01:40.030> that<00:01:40.330> curves<00:01:40.660> in<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:42.360> I

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
is more like a bee that curves in and I

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.840 
is more like a bee that curves in and I
tend<00:01:43.600> to<00:01:43.690> go<00:01:43.870> around<00:01:44.140> a<00:01:44.290> little<00:01:44.410> bit<00:01:44.530> more<00:01:44.850> on

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
tend to go around a little bit more on

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.290 
tend to go around a little bit more on
the<00:01:46.060> inside<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:47.320> few<00:01:47.800> feeling<00:01:48.190> like<00:01:49.000> having<00:01:49.270> a

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
the inside a few feeling like having a

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.740 
the inside a few feeling like having a
bit<00:01:49.420> of<00:01:49.450> fun<00:01:49.540> and<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.970> can<00:01:52.000> go<00:01:52.270> around<00:01:52.420> even

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
bit of fun and you can go around even

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.510 
bit of fun and you can go around even
more<00:01:52.780> on<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.260> inside<00:01:54.990> but<00:01:55.990> that's<00:01:56.260> really

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
more on the inside but that's really

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.440 
more on the inside but that's really
taking<00:01:57.520> it<00:01:57.610> a<00:01:57.670> bit<00:01:57.700> far<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:59.380> our<00:01:59.650> capital<00:02:00.100> C<00:02:00.450> and

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
taking it a bit far so our capital C and

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.580 
taking it a bit far so our capital C and
to<00:02:01.810> do<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:02.020> follow-on<00:02:07.110> we<00:02:08.110> have<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.350> pick<00:02:08.470> up

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
to do the follow-on we have to pick up

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.660 
to do the follow-on we have to pick up
our<00:02:08.679> pens<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.750> go<00:02:10.750> on<00:02:11.020> like<00:02:11.290> so<00:02:14.670> another

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
our pens and go on like so another

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.550 
our pens and go on like so another
version<00:02:15.910> of<00:02:16.240> the<00:02:16.330> capital<00:02:16.720> see<00:02:16.930> if<00:02:17.140> we<00:02:17.440> have

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
version of the capital see if we have

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.510 
version of the capital see if we have
our<00:02:17.740> our<00:02:18.520> lines<00:02:18.820> like<00:02:19.090> so<00:02:20.130> simply<00:02:21.130> starts<00:02:21.430> at

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
our our lines like so simply starts at

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.580 
our our lines like so simply starts at
the<00:02:21.580> top<00:02:21.760> curves<00:02:22.570> in<00:02:23.730> like<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:25.470> that's<00:02:26.470> a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
the top curves in like that that's a

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.040 
the top curves in like that that's a

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
ballpoint but you do have to push on it

light<00:05:47.160> on<00:05:47.190> the<00:05:47.370> way<00:05:47.460> up<00:05:48.380> so<00:05:49.380> it<00:05:49.620> is<00:05:49.740> possible<00:05:49.889> to

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
light on the way up so it is possible to

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.800 
light on the way up so it is possible to
make<00:05:51.260> quite<00:05:52.340> good<00:05:53.340> tone<00:05:54.120> distinctions<00:05:54.660> with<00:05:54.780> a

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
make quite good tone distinctions with a

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.370 
make quite good tone distinctions with a
ballpoint<00:05:55.050> but<00:05:55.440> it<00:05:55.500> does<00:05:55.650> take<00:05:55.890> practice

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
ballpoint but it does take practice

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:04.700 
ballpoint but it does take practice
light<00:05:58.380> up<00:05:58.940> dark<00:05:59.940> down<00:06:00.740> curve<00:06:01.740> in<00:06:03.560> one<00:06:04.560> more

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
light up dark down curve in one more

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
light up dark down curve in one more
time<00:06:05.360> and<00:06:06.360> also<00:06:07.110> the<00:06:07.560> sea<00:06:07.740> can<00:06:07.950> start<00:06:08.310> down<00:06:08.580> the

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.730 
time and also the sea can start down the

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.270 
time and also the sea can start down the
bottom<00:06:09.000> here<00:06:09.030> as<00:06:09.510> i<00:06:09.570> have<00:06:10.050> here<00:06:10.440> or<00:06:10.800> it<00:06:11.160> can

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
bottom here as i have here or it can

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.150 
bottom here as i have here or it can
start<00:06:11.580> near<00:06:11.940> the<00:06:12.120> top<00:06:13.400> like<00:06:14.400> that<00:06:16.160> so

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
start near the top like that so

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.219 
start near the top like that so
depending<00:06:17.669> on<00:06:17.669> your<00:06:18.210> mood<00:06:18.600> or<00:06:18.870> what<00:06:19.020> type<00:06:19.200> of

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
depending on your mood or what type of

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:22.129 
depending on your mood or what type of
see<00:06:19.470> you<00:06:19.590> wish<00:06:19.740> to<00:06:19.889> do<00:06:20.630> you<00:06:21.630> can<00:06:21.780> start<00:06:21.990> your

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 
see you wish to do you can start your

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:28.280 
see you wish to do you can start your
see<00:06:22.320> down<00:06:22.500> here<00:06:24.020> like<00:06:25.020> that<00:06:25.169> or<00:06:26.040> here<00:06:27.290> like

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
see down here like that or here like

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.550 
see down here like that or here like
that

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.550 

let's<00:06:32.220> try<00:06:32.460> this<00:06:32.520> again<00:06:33.139> and<00:06:34.139> show<00:06:34.290> you<00:06:34.380> what<00:06:34.530> I

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
let's try this again and show you what I

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.100 
let's try this again and show you what I
mean<00:06:34.650> with<00:06:35.280> the<00:06:35.490> black<00:06:35.730> pen<00:06:36.030> so<00:06:36.660> you<00:06:36.690> can<00:06:36.810> start

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
mean with the black pen so you can start

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:42.430 
mean with the black pen so you can start
your<00:06:37.230> seat<00:06:37.530> up<00:06:37.770> here<00:06:39.410> that's<00:06:40.410> a<00:06:40.940> pretty

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
your seat up here that's a pretty

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.850 
your seat up here that's a pretty
similar<00:06:43.440> to<00:06:43.470> a<00:06:43.650> printed<00:06:44.610> see<00:06:44.820> in<00:06:45.000> a<00:06:45.090> way<00:06:45.240> or<00:06:45.860> you

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
similar to a printed see in a way or you

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.280 
similar to a printed see in a way or you
can<00:06:47.070> do<00:06:47.190> the<00:06:47.220> sea<00:06:47.490> with<00:06:47.669> the<00:06:47.840> the<00:06:48.840> ligature

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.290 
can do the sea with the the ligature

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:54.020 
can do the sea with the the ligature
stroke<00:06:49.700> connecting<00:06:50.700> stroke<00:06:52.460> like<00:06:53.460> that<00:06:53.700> or

our thinner see like that there we have

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.030 
our thinner see like that there we have
it<00:07:02.250> to<00:07:02.610> let<00:07:02.760> us<00:07:02.880> see
