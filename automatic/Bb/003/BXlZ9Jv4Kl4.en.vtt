00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.089
 ah 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.650
 they 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.360
 I think teach you how to record your videos 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.610
 minecraft hd without them going so messed 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.620
 well I'll go in two parts first 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.830
 part so that they are on the computer 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.599
 very slow or a little slow and the second 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.519
 part that I will bring it later will be for 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.769
 a fast compute that can render 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.330
 faster with the program than I 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.779
 I use to record is called leaving 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.779
 here it is 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.189
 is this 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.740
 here good is going to explain what is it 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.740
 which has in general 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:45.220
 here you put where the video is saved 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.390
 but that has nothing to do with this is going to 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.030
 be the key with which you are about to start 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.820
 Record 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.190
 this is the configuration here you are going to 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.199
 add a microphone so you can hear 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.199
 also the recording these are the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.379
 configurations here put them 1280 x 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.589
 720 so that it is h of 30 fps is and 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.830
 quality 78 70 or following hung what 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.830
 want 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.460
 and this is already dry, well, I'm going to put together 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:15.060
 a piece of minecraft to see 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.060
 how is it 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.369
 he knows he believes the world 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.369
 I already know why 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.850
 but since I have the shadows installed 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.220
 ok not here is 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.030
 Now so you see them here 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.400
 it appeared that they are already going well 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.009
 when you already press the key where you 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.289
 we installed that is done 12 in my case and 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.220
 is already recording anything that is 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.220
 moving is already recording 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.510
 ok we already recorded a piece we closed this 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.549
 we can already the rest and we go to the folder 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.510
 where we keep our file that 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.510
 is mine is this 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.890
 here we can see that everything opens up well 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.159
 but wait for it to open it is already recording 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.159
 anything that 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.900
 ok if you are earning well 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.160
 then we will go to reuse the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.150
 pitcher 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.030
 we had it here we opened it and this 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.290
 we drag to the timeline and here 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:00.920
 in dimensions they put 1280 x 720 if not 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.959
 it's here they sting you here 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.790
 ok in case your video is not 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.420
 covered like this for the fifth time is it 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.420
 will try to explain 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.610
 here they are 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.610
 we add it alone here 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.680
 because in case your video looks 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.040
 if you have to click right not 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.680
 they have to give him a clip kings weeks 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.000
 blue and here the right click and here already 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.270
 you see that the whole video was pasted here in 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.270
 the corner 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:00.360
 the audio on the 1st in all configured 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:04.470
 to walk here and here 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:08.010
 and they give him in the next course mp4 is 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:13.080
 important here you put no controls 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:15.000
 here option mp4 and here they put it 50 or 40 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.799
 It is your choice if you want to tell if 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.549
 they put 40 will weigh much less the video 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.550
 of what happened before 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.169
 then the next 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.480
 this is a watermark that appears 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.920
 what down 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.260
 the next you put a name 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.009
 for example try and here they tell you where 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.770
 they want it to come out 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.150
 good they could put the desk in 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.500
 reality at the end and it starts to 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.810
 render the video 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.890
 and that no longer wait for the video 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.890
 original heavy 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:53.120
 3 megabytes 3 megabytes and has a duration of 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.120
 little less than a minute 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.470
 if they are 10 seconds taking out the 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:04.240
 rendering will already be ready for what 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:08.639
 can upload to youtube 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.639
 and as the hb 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.749
 do not wait for him to surrender 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:23.879
 how would we sell that yes if your video 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:25.619
 it is not in what he has to give him the 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:27.239
 nap I do not know what story is going to take a 

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:31.849
 little more to perform because this one is 

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:31.849
 making the image bigger 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.480
 that is already imprisoned at 3 megabytes 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:43.820
 and already directly here we can already 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:46.190
 upload this video to youtube 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.800
 and that will be everything I hope you liked 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:53.320
 have served them soon to 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.320
 a quick coma and see you later
