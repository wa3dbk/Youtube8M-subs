00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.269
 let's talk about the regime and as not cool 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.130
 dogs are predators and tend to be active 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.230
 in the evening and in the morning during the period when 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.240
 lit this is the best time for 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.740
 hunting but that doesn't mean your dog 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.820
 will always rage in the evenings and not 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.829
 give you sleep in the morning 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.260
 for this you need to set a rule and 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.640
 stick them first find a way out 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.469

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.649

 continue 3 active games until the guards and 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.010

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.090
 Do not take her to bed in the middle of the night 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.979

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.840
 Nose your hand just ignore if you 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.909
 want to teach her not to sleep with you 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.920
 in the end she will have to go to her 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.600

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.060

 well please and now about two 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.700
 major problems 1 if the puppy 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.800
 wakes up too early in the morning before 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.720
 you program of action for 6 nights for 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.940
 order to eradicate this habit and you 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.490
 It will take another 14 nights to create 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.229
 new night the first puppy whined pulls 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.630
 blanket bed makes you wake up 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.340
 look at the clock for example time 430 a 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.160
 do you want him to wake up at 6 am 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.350
 remember this night 2 set the alarm on 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.890
 4 o'clock in the morning the alarm bell does not get up 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.990
 be lazy 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.060
 will puppy lead him to where enemies 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.979
 and household eyes play feed 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.259
 walk what you usually do with it in 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.030
 this age in the morning put 3 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.160
 alarm clock at 4:15 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.710
 the alarm bell get up me lazy and 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.140
 all the same as yesterday night 4 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.929
 set the alarm at 4:45 all the same 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.120
 and most importantly do not be lazy 5 night set 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.640
 Service at 525 and all the same 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.890
 the sixth night set the alarm at 6 am 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.510
 the bell rings and the puppy rhodes believes you 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.800
 fasting we noticed that he no longer 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.350
 will you be up to the alarm bell 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.330
 next 14 nights be sure to put 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.370
 alarm clock get up at the same time 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.130
 and no weekend or late waking 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.690
 remember the main thing is not to be lazy but after two 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.280
 weeks you can try not to bet 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.620
 alarm clock or set for another time 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.690
 problem number two if the puppy wanders around 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.190
 nights actually that means he 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.200
 very excited you should more 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.030
 engage with him in the afternoon or communicate with him 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.380
 calmer but it happens that the owner 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.360
 therefore nervous because not 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.250
 finds time to practice a puppy in this 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.590
 case you should start retractable 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.989
 house it may be trouble. channel house 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.880
 reticulate his cell and then 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.470
 in the evening bring a puppy into a cage and 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.600
 set the alarm for about half an hour 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.459
 earlier than he usually wakes up and 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.200
 starts to call back after the call 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.180
 open version try to sleep more 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.220
 how much will succeed all the same 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.230
 the diagram above is every night 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.660
 release everything later but the main thing 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.150
