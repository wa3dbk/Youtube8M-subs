two minutes or so and we're going to
move<00:02:00.330> right<00:02:00.360> over<00:02:00.600> here<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.830> what<00:02:02.430> we're

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
move right over here and what we're

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.190 
move right over here and what we're
going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.789> do<00:02:02.940> is<00:02:03.240> we're<00:02:03.539> going<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.690> take<00:02:03.930> all

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
going to do is we're going to take all

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.430 
going to do is we're going to take all
of<00:02:04.259> these<00:02:05.100> coconut<00:02:06.000> shreds<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.930> place<00:02:07.200> them

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
of these coconut shreds and place them

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.320 
of these coconut shreds and place them
right<00:02:07.470> inside<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:08.250> breadcrumbs<00:02:08.759> just<00:02:09.179> like

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
right inside the breadcrumbs just like

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.820 
right inside the breadcrumbs just like
this<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:10.110> mix<00:02:10.319> them<00:02:10.410> up<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.739> real<00:02:10.890> good<00:02:12.830> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
this and mix them up the real good the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.910 
this and mix them up the real good the
ratios<00:02:14.400> are<00:02:14.550> back<00:02:14.850> about<00:02:15.360> one<00:02:15.720> third<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.380> if

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
ratios are back about one third so if

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.690 
ratios are back about one third so if
you<00:02:17.040> figure<00:02:17.459> if<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.239> have<00:02:18.560> two<00:02:19.560> thirds<00:02:19.890> bread

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
you figure if you have two thirds bread

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.690 
you figure if you have two thirds bread
crumb<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.209> one-third<00:02:22.050> coconut<00:02:22.800> shred<00:02:23.069> it's

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
crumb and one-third coconut shred it's

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.880 
crumb and one-third coconut shred it's
perfect<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.780> what<00:02:24.900> this<00:02:25.019> does<00:02:25.080> is<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.739> creates

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
perfect and what this does is it creates

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.850 
perfect and what this does is it creates
a<00:02:26.220> nice<00:02:26.580> texture<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.299> the<00:02:27.870> breading<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.709> when

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
a nice texture to the breading so when

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.280 
a nice texture to the breading so when
you're<00:02:28.980> frying<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.930> you'll<00:02:30.930> see<00:02:31.170> the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
you're frying this you'll see the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.140 
you're frying this you'll see the
coconut<00:02:31.709> shreds<00:02:31.980> kind<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.370> sticking<00:02:32.910> out<00:02:33.120> a
