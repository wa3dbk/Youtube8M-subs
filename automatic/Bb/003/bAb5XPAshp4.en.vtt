pull them apart a little bit because I

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.580

don't<00:02:12.510> want<00:02:12.540> them<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.870> hit<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.140> top<00:02:13.379> of<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
don't want them to hit the top of the

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.979 
don't want them to hit the top of the
box<00:02:13.770> when<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.790> put<00:02:14.970> your<00:02:15.000> eggs<00:02:15.239> in<00:02:15.510> even<00:02:15.780> if<00:02:15.900> i

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
box when you put your eggs in even if i

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.589 
box when you put your eggs in even if i
push<00:02:16.379> these<00:02:16.530> way<00:02:16.739> down<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.700> if<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.090> box<00:02:18.330> touch

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
push these way down and if the box touch

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.330 
push these way down and if the box touch
is<00:02:18.810> what<00:02:18.989> happens<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.500> makes<00:02:19.530> windows<00:02:20.069> and

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
is what happens is it makes windows and

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.610 
is what happens is it makes windows and
the<00:02:20.819> windows<00:02:21.120> can<00:02:21.270> actually<00:02:21.599> ruin<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.440> eggs

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
the windows can actually ruin the eggs

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.729 
the windows can actually ruin the eggs
eventually<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:24.090> we<00:02:24.209> don't<00:02:24.390> want<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.599> do<00:02:24.690> that

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
eventually so we don't want to do that

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.410 
eventually so we don't want to do that
so<00:02:25.739> I<00:02:25.770> set<00:02:26.069> them<00:02:26.129> up<00:02:26.280> dry<00:02:26.550> for<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.879> first<00:02:27.150> week
