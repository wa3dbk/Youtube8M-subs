let's see if I can give ya the female

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.510 
let's see if I can give ya the female
ones<00:04:11.910> so<00:04:12.330> if<00:04:12.810> you're<00:04:13.320> using<00:04:13.470> like<00:04:13.710> krylon<00:04:14.220> or

ones so if you're using like krylon or

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.840 
ones so if you're using like krylon or
one<00:04:15.450> of<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.630> more<00:04:15.810> generic<00:04:16.400> brands<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:17.640> you

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
one of the more generic brands that you

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.520 
one of the more generic brands that you
can<00:04:17.880> find<00:04:18.180> in<00:04:18.270> like<00:04:18.390> Home<00:04:18.600> Depot<00:04:18.630> or<00:04:19.140> something

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
can find in like Home Depot or something

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.940 
can find in like Home Depot or something
or<00:04:19.799> Walmart<00:04:20.250> then<00:04:20.610> then<00:04:21.600> it's<00:04:22.320> also<00:04:22.530> got<00:04:22.740> couch

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
or Walmart then then it's also got couch

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.130 
or Walmart then then it's also got couch
for<00:04:23.190> that<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:24.150> I<00:04:24.480> guess<00:04:24.690> that's<00:04:24.780> pretty<00:04:25.050> nice

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
for that so I guess that's pretty nice

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:31.730 
for that so I guess that's pretty nice
to<00:04:25.590> have<00:04:27.200> also<00:04:28.200> got<00:04:28.440> thin<00:04:28.710> cap<00:04:28.920> sampler<00:04:29.400> and<00:04:30.740> I

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
to have also got thin cap sampler and I

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.720 
to have also got thin cap sampler and I
think<00:04:31.950> this<00:04:32.070> one<00:04:32.280> is<00:04:32.310> another<00:04:32.820> thin<00:04:33.090> cap<00:04:33.380> and

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730
