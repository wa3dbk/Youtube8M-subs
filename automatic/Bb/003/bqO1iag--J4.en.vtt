00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.889
 well now let's paint the part of 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:09.639
 inside the eyes white 

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:09.639
 acrylic equal 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.370
 ah 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.989
 I remember you if they were rayon quoted if you 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:25.720
 you went out with the black or the pencil 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:27.429
 If you frame do not worry for that 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.029
 we have the yellow to give you the 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.029
 touch-ups needed 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.210
 what a bear dries we paint him the 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.210
 another because you have to give them two passes 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.370
 while it dries I'm going to do the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.240
 tongue here I will use textile paint 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.240
 red 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.720
 and we are going to give him the little tongue that is 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.720
 here we are going to see 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.430
 textile paint when it dries 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.900
 inflates then that gives you how well it goes 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.320
 well now let's take advantage of what 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.770
 that the joke is drying is not 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.770
 waste time 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.920
 we clean very very very well our 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.920
 Brushes 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.380
 that I have fine point with that I 'm going to 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.380
 do 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.400
 from inside the eyes 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.890
 How are we going to do it well? 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.880
 get a foothold and we're going to 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.880
 make a circle 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.930
 Now the eyes are optional to taste 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.580
 of each and obviously if you want 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.580
 make little eyes in love 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.050
 and that's it, the eyes are like that 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.720
 we wait for them to dry to put them 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.420
 a little white dot in the meantime 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.780
 I'm going to touch up the eyebrows the outline of 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.380
 eyes and mouth so it looks good 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.380
 jet black 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.900
 and now we are going to mark the mouth well 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.970
 while it dries we are here whistle 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.620
 and meanwhile what are we going to do what 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.950
 we put here in turn and it is better 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.360
 it's drying we 're going to make the wings 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.100
 we close our paintings so that 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.100
 no accident will happen there 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.650
 so do not give us the hard plague 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.890
 meanwhile and now we are going to do the 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.620
 rooms will occupy as wire 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.710
 good while we already form our wing 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.290
 we give you here to make it 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.440
 Keep well and since we list 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.040
 we are going to occupy hot silicone and go 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:34.599
 to also get tulle 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.599
 already good with our tour 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.020
 how to make children 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.410
 we see a piece of tule we measure more or 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.410
 less 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.680
 we cut the piece that we are going to occupy 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.510
 obviously there you are measuring not me anymore 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.010
 have so much I do not measure it but it is 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.569
 good to measure it 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.569
 we expose our tour here 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.790
 and we have it there 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:11.500
 while it is drying and now with the 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.500
 hot silicone all around 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.830
 of our wire we are going to put the 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.830
 hot silicone 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.759
 we place the tunnel 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.860
 as they do on the turn our 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.710
 our wing 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.710
 the structure shown 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.400
 He did it with that to not burn my eye 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.050
 be very careful with working with silicone 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.200
 hot I have had many people who 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.960
 burn be careful 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.380
 it was already ours and I saw that the 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.960
 we have thus ready with textile paint 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:56.610
 white or the color that you like him 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.610
 let's put the whole contour 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.020
 in this way in such a way that we are going 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.889
 to stay our wings 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.889
 A) Yes 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.310
 our rooms do not stay like this and since 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.260
 we have thus our rooms are not 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.810
 let's place our bee 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:24.170
 and sometimes I miss out there we're going to take advantage 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:27.050
 we painted the ball of the eye of the 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:30.220
 part of inside we put a dot and 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.220
 then we are making it grow 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.130
 and I remember something important in the eyes 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.990
 are the windows of the soul so it's that 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.640
 you depend on how objects do you 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.740
 because it's going to give you all the fuss 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.230
 French toast is ready for you bee 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.210
 I decide you put my wings 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.320
 I in my case decided to eat them here 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.760
 right where it starts 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.760
 the piggy eye 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:06:00.300
 the nails well well well well we wait 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.300
 to dry or cool as you say 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.590
 if you have to support them because they are 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.590
 cooling
