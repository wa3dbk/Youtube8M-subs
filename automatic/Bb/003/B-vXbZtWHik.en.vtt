has not had anything done to it this is
the<00:00:33.390> instrument<00:00:33.840> cluster<00:00:33.899> out<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.320> my<00:00:34.410> truck

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
the instrument cluster out of my truck

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.200 
the instrument cluster out of my truck
you<00:00:35.190> notice<00:00:35.460> there's<00:00:35.670> no<00:00:35.790> tachometer<00:00:38.210> so

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
you notice there's no tachometer so

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.389 
you notice there's no tachometer so
let's<00:00:39.390> go<00:00:39.510> look<00:00:39.690> at<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.899> ones<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:41.040> my<00:00:41.160> truck

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
let's go look at the ones in my truck

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.740 
let's go look at the ones in my truck
right<00:00:42.239> now<00:00:43.579> here<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.670> are<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:44.969> truck<00:00:45.329> and

you'll<00:00:48.750> notice<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.320> have<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.800> sr5

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
you'll notice that I have the sr5

00:00:50.129 --> 00:01:00.450 
you'll notice that I have the sr5
instrument<00:00:50.730> cluster

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.450 

look<00:01:01.320> don't<00:01:02.320> get<00:01:02.500> in<00:01:02.620> trouble<00:01:02.680> with<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:02.980> radio

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
look don't get in trouble with the radio

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.880 
look don't get in trouble with the radio
being<00:01:03.700> on<00:01:04.229> alright<00:01:05.229> so<00:01:05.440> let's<00:01:05.590> do<00:01:05.740> a<00:01:05.770> little

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
being on alright so let's do a little

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.800 
being on alright so let's do a little
startup<00:01:07.320> neutral

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.569 

the<00:01:14.350> oil<00:01:14.530> pressure<00:01:14.649> gauge<00:01:14.829> is<00:01:15.100> pretty<00:01:15.310> slow

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
the oil pressure gauge is pretty slow

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.219 
the oil pressure gauge is pretty slow
but<00:01:16.149> it<00:01:16.329> moves<00:01:16.509> up<00:01:17.520> temperature<00:01:18.520> gauge<00:01:19.229> not

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
but it moves up temperature gauge not

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.270 
but it moves up temperature gauge not
only<00:01:20.380> does<00:01:20.530> it<00:01:20.590> have<00:01:20.710> an<00:01:20.829> oil<00:01:20.950> pressure<00:01:21.159> gauge

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
only does it have an oil pressure gauge

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.399 
only does it have an oil pressure gauge
well<00:01:21.850> it<00:01:22.180> does<00:01:22.329> but<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.720> old<00:01:22.869> one<00:01:22.960> was<00:01:23.229> just

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
well it does but the old one was just

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.730 
well it does but the old one was just
dummy<00:01:23.740> like<00:01:23.860> this<00:01:24.039> one<00:01:24.159> has<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.310> gauge<00:01:25.740> it's

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
dummy like this one has a gauge it's

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.889 
dummy like this one has a gauge it's
also<00:01:26.860> got<00:01:27.009> a<00:01:27.070> voltmeter<00:01:27.340> and<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:28.509> trip<00:01:28.659> meter

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
also got a voltmeter and a trip meter

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.109 
also got a voltmeter and a trip meter
which<00:01:29.590> is<00:01:29.740> nice<00:01:29.890> I<00:01:30.159> already<00:01:30.729> took<00:01:31.060> the

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
which is nice I already took the

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.639 
which is nice I already took the
odometer<00:01:31.630> apart<00:01:31.899> and<00:01:31.990> I<00:01:32.020> rolled<00:01:32.200> it<00:01:32.320> back<00:01:32.380> to

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
odometer apart and I rolled it back to

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:33.749 
odometer apart and I rolled it back to
the<00:01:32.740> same<00:01:32.920> mileage<00:01:33.159> that<00:01:33.429> was<00:01:33.520> on<00:01:33.640> the

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
the same mileage that was on the

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.170 
the same mileage that was on the
original<00:01:33.820> speedometer<00:01:34.600> so<00:01:35.409> that's<00:01:35.590> nice

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.940 

I<00:01:42.140> think<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.230> pretty<00:01:43.320> cool<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.680> an<00:01:43.740> attack

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
I think it's pretty cool have an attack

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:52.250 
I think it's pretty cool have an attack
on<00:01:44.100> without<00:01:44.370> they<00:01:44.550> I<00:01:44.820> like<00:01:45.120> it

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.290 

so<00:01:53.260> that's<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:53.980> truck<00:01:54.160> there<00:01:54.400> also<00:01:55.150> got

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
so that's the the truck there also got

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.700 
so that's the the truck there also got
new<00:01:55.450> tires<00:01:55.630> on<00:01:55.870> it<00:01:55.930> all<00:01:56.110> around<00:01:56.380> i<00:01:56.560> got

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
new tires on it all around i got

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.140 
new tires on it all around i got
