00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
rather than grilled ice cream I think I

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.030

we<00:03:18.550> need<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.270> have<00:03:19.930> several<00:03:20.320> runs<00:03:20.530> on<00:03:20.770> it<00:03:20.920> to

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040

could<00:03:23.560> have<00:03:23.710> a<00:03:23.740> hard<00:03:23.980> time<00:03:24.220> yeah<00:03:25.180> with<00:03:25.390> this

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
could have a hard time yeah with this

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.800 
could have a hard time yeah with this
recipe<00:03:25.720> I<00:03:26.230> think<00:03:26.770> being<00:03:27.370> intimidated<00:03:28.180> by<00:03:28.390> the

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810
