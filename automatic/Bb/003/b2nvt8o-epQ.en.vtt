may not be a cure but here's the thing
Eve<00:00:20.579> you<00:00:21.539> have<00:00:21.570> compaction<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.560> your<00:00:22.710> farm

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
Eve you have compaction on your farm

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.279 
Eve you have compaction on your farm
whether<00:00:23.429> you<00:00:23.669> admit<00:00:23.819> it<00:00:23.999> or<00:00:24.179> not<00:00:24.300> everybody

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
whether you admit it or not everybody

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.169 
whether you admit it or not everybody
has<00:00:25.499> some<00:00:25.710> compaction<00:00:26.069> issues<00:00:26.339> you<00:00:26.819> know<00:00:26.939> we

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:27.179 
has some compaction issues you know we

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.239 
has some compaction issues you know we
live<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.659> the<00:00:27.989> real<00:00:28.259> world<00:00:28.289> here<00:00:28.829> it's<00:00:28.949> nice<00:00:29.099> to

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:29.249 
live in the real world here it's nice to

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:30.589 
live in the real world here it's nice to
talk<00:00:29.399> about<00:00:29.609> all<00:00:29.880> we<00:00:30.149> don't<00:00:30.239> want<00:00:30.449> any

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
talk about all we don't want any

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.790 
talk about all we don't want any
compaction<00:00:31.140> then<00:00:31.259> we'll<00:00:31.409> get<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.619> best

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
compaction then we'll get the best

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.439 
compaction then we'll get the best
yields<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.519> mother<00:00:32.730> nature<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.269> deal

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449 
yields you have mother nature to deal

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:34.790 
yields you have mother nature to deal
with<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:33.870> know<00:00:34.170> we're<00:00:34.410> gonna<00:00:34.500> have<00:00:34.590> some

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
with we know we're gonna have some

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.490 
with we know we're gonna have some
compaction<00:00:35.340> problems<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:36.480> our<00:00:36.899> farm<00:00:37.260> what

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
compaction problems so on our farm what

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.369 
compaction problems so on our farm what
we'll<00:00:37.710> try<00:00:37.859> to<00:00:37.949> do<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.519> the<00:00:38.760> fall<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.300> at<00:00:39.809> least

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
we'll try to do in the fall is at least

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.049 
we'll try to do in the fall is at least
we<00:00:40.710> want<00:00:40.859> to<00:00:40.980> handle<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.489> heavy<00:00:41.730> traffic

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
we want to handle the heavy traffic

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.900 
we want to handle the heavy traffic
areas<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:43.469> also<00:00:43.679> want<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.070> do<00:00:44.250> some<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.820> our

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
areas and we also want to do some of our

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.849 
areas and we also want to do some of our
let's<00:00:45.239> say<00:00:45.420> new<00:00:45.780> fields<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.440> we've<00:00:46.589> just

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 
let's say new fields that we've just

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.009 
let's say new fields that we've just
picked<00:00:47.039> up<00:00:47.280> where<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:48.089> more<00:00:48.390> compaction

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
picked up where we have more compaction

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.930 
picked up where we have more compaction
issues<00:00:49.170> than<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.679> probably<00:00:49.890> should<00:00:50.429> and<00:00:50.670> what

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
issues than we probably should and what

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.389 
issues than we probably should and what
we<00:00:51.089> like<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.359> do<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.809> go<00:00:51.960> out<00:00:51.989> with<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.620> briliant

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
we like to do is go out with a briliant

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.029 
we like to do is go out with a briliant
zone<00:00:53.699> commander<00:00:54.269> deep<00:00:54.660> running<00:00:55.350> about<00:00:55.559> 20

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
zone commander deep running about 20

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.250 
zone commander deep running about 20
inches<00:00:56.339> deep<00:00:56.820> or<00:00:57.089> so<00:00:57.359> to<00:00:57.660> get<00:00:57.780> below<00:00:58.019> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
inches deep or so to get below the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.590 
inches deep or so to get below the
deepest<00:00:58.920> level<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.399> compaction<00:00:59.820> typically<00:01:00.480> in

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
deepest level of compaction typically in

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.180 
deepest level of compaction typically in
fields<00:01:00.929> you're<00:01:01.019> gonna<00:01:01.109> find<00:01:01.379> two<00:01:01.739> layers<00:01:02.039> of

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
fields you're gonna find two layers of

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.940 
fields you're gonna find two layers of
compaction<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.999> man-made<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.170> natural<00:01:04.680> well

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.860 
compaction a man-made and a natural well
with<00:01:05.460> those<00:01:05.670> compassion<00:01:06.300> layers<00:01:06.480> what<00:01:06.720> we're

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
with those compassion layers what we're

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.440 
with those compassion layers what we're
trying<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.290> do<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.950> man-made<00:01:08.340> layer<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.240> we

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
trying to do that man-made layer that we

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.600 
trying to do that man-made layer that we
call<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> plow<00:01:10.080> pan<00:01:10.440> or<00:01:10.950> if<00:01:11.220> you've<00:01:11.400> got<00:01:11.430> some

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
call a plow pan or if you've got some

heavy traffic through the field just
tire<00:01:13.770> compaction<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.880> want<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.150> break<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.600> up

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
tire compaction we want to break that up

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.380 
tire compaction we want to break that up
completely<00:01:16.320> that's<00:01:16.650> just<00:01:16.980> fine<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.760> natural

completely that's just fine the natural

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
down 14 to 18 inches for most of our

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.860 
down 14 to 18 inches for most of our
area<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.700> want<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.970> slice<00:01:24.240> through<00:01:24.600> that

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
area we just want to slice through that

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.870 
area we just want to slice through that
and<00:01:25.050> just<00:01:25.080> make<00:01:25.290> some<00:01:25.830> little<00:01:26.010> slits<00:01:26.490> through

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
and just make some little slits through

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.360

that<00:01:27.090> deep<00:01:27.420> compassion<00:01:28.020> layer<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.770> roots<00:01:29.070> can

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
that deep compassion layer so roots can

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.400 
that deep compassion layer so roots can
get<00:01:29.550> through<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.150> water<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.780> get<00:01:30.930> away<00:01:31.050> these

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
get through so water can get away these

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.510 
get through so water can get away these
kind<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.710> things<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:32.070> don't<00:01:32.190> want<00:01:32.340> to

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
kind of things we don't want to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.330 
kind of things we don't want to
completely<00:01:33.000> blow<00:01:33.600> up<00:01:33.870> that<00:01:34.440> lower<00:01:34.860> natural

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
completely blow up that lower natural

layer of compaction because when we do

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.460 
layer of compaction because when we do
the<00:01:37.680> soil<00:01:38.010> gets<00:01:38.160> so<00:01:38.490> soft<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.510> you<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:40.110> sink

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the soil gets so soft that you just sink

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.470 
the soil gets so soft that you just sink
away<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> spring<00:01:41.370> and<00:01:41.520> there's<00:01:41.700> no<00:01:41.940> base

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
away in the spring and there's no base

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.820 
away in the spring and there's no base
to<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.900> yeah<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.230> here's<00:01:43.440> what<00:01:43.620> we're<00:01:43.800> looking

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
to it yeah so here's what we're looking

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.270 
to it yeah so here's what we're looking
at<00:01:44.280> rather<00:01:44.640> than<00:01:44.910> using<00:01:45.330> a<00:01:45.780> sea<00:01:46.530> shank<00:01:47.010> that's

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
at rather than using a sea shank that's

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.130 
at rather than using a sea shank that's
curved<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.270> probably<00:01:48.750> gonna<00:01:48.900> bring

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
curved and is probably gonna bring

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.590 
curved and is probably gonna bring
subsoil<00:01:49.800> up<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.310> top<00:01:50.490> soil<00:01:50.790> we<00:01:51.300> want<00:01:51.480> to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
subsoil up to the top soil we want to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.660 
subsoil up to the top soil we want to
run<00:01:51.720> with<00:01:51.870> a<00:01:51.930> straight<00:01:52.530> shank<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.310> we're<00:01:53.550> not

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
run with a straight shank so we're not

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.790 
run with a straight shank so we're not
doing<00:01:53.910> that<00:01:54.150> we're<00:01:54.360> just<00:01:54.570> basically<00:01:54.800> slicing

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
doing that we're just basically slicing

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.530 
doing that we're just basically slicing
almost<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.190> a<00:01:56.220> butter<00:01:56.550> knife<00:01:56.640> slicing

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
almost like a butter knife slicing

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.600 
almost like a butter knife slicing
through<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.990> soil<00:01:58.260> with<00:01:58.770> with<00:01:59.220> a<00:01:59.250> narrow

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
through the soil with with a narrow

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.730 
through the soil with with a narrow
point<00:02:00.030> -<00:02:00.270> not<00:02:00.510> with<00:02:00.690> a<00:02:00.720> way<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.260> tip<00:02:01.530> we

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
point - not with a way of the tip we

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.470 
point - not with a way of the tip we
don't<00:02:02.010> want<00:02:02.220> a<00:02:02.280> winged<00:02:02.610> point<00:02:03.000> that's<00:02:03.330> gonna

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
don't want a winged point that's gonna

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.000 
don't want a winged point that's gonna
really<00:02:03.840> create<00:02:04.200> lots<00:02:04.410> of<00:02:04.560> soil<00:02:04.770> disturbance

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
really create lots of soil disturbance

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.670 
really create lots of soil disturbance
we're<00:02:05.670> talking<00:02:06.000> about<00:02:06.120> a<00:02:06.420> narrow<00:02:06.930> point<00:02:07.380> so

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
we're talking about a narrow point so

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.230 
we're talking about a narrow point so
you<00:02:08.009> want<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:08.399> have<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.610> narrow<00:02:08.910> point

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
you want to just have a narrow point

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.570 
you want to just have a narrow point
straight<00:02:09.899> shank<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.470> don't<00:02:10.770> care<00:02:11.009> who<00:02:11.280> what

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
straight shank I don't care who what

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.310 
straight shank I don't care who what
brand<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.180> or<00:02:12.510> anything<00:02:12.540> else<00:02:12.990> if<00:02:13.200> you've

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
brand it is or anything else if you've

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.030 
brand it is or anything else if you've
got<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.470> narrow

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
got a narrow

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.009 
got a narrow
point<00:02:14.159> straight<00:02:14.430> shank<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:14.939> you'd<00:02:15.180> find<00:02:15.689> in

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
point straight shank and you'd find in

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.720 
point straight shank and you'd find in
your<00:02:16.170> soil<00:02:16.409> your<00:02:16.739> man-made<00:02:17.159> layer<00:02:17.400> of

going you're not gonna know unless you

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.339 
going you're not gonna know unless you
dig<00:04:02.579> yeah<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.239> do<00:04:03.389> some<00:04:03.599> digging<00:04:03.959> out<00:04:04.109> there

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
dig yeah and do some digging out there

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.559 
dig yeah and do some digging out there
with<00:04:04.530> a<00:04:04.560> shovel<00:04:04.949> use<00:04:05.579> a<00:04:05.609> pen<00:04:05.909> at<00:04:06.030> Ramat<00:04:06.419> or

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
with a shovel use a pen at Ramat or

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.059 
with a shovel use a pen at Ramat or
whatever<00:04:06.959> it<00:04:07.109> takes<00:04:07.379> to<00:04:07.620> find<00:04:07.889> those

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
whatever it takes to find those

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.379 
whatever it takes to find those
compaction<00:04:08.579> layers<00:04:08.790> in<00:04:08.879> your<00:04:09.000> field<00:04:09.209> and

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
compaction layers in your field and

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:10.969 
compaction layers in your field and
address<00:04:09.900> them<00:04:10.169> this<00:04:10.470> fall

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:10.979 
address them this fall

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:12.589 
address them this fall
so<00:04:11.040> you<00:04:11.129> can<00:04:11.220> have<00:04:11.310> a<00:04:11.370> successful<00:04:11.939> crappie

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
so you can have a successful crappie

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.599 
so you can have a successful crappie

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.180 
that's how I would dig with a skid steer
loader<00:04:30.420> it<00:04:30.930> only<00:04:31.080> takes<00:04:31.350> a<00:04:31.470> few<00:04:31.500> minutes<00:04:31.860> you

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
loader it only takes a few minutes you

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.590 
loader it only takes a few minutes you
can<00:04:32.340> dig<00:04:32.580> doubt<00:04:32.820> and<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.120> reason<00:04:33.420> why<00:04:33.540> I

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
can dig doubt and the reason why I

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.330 
can dig doubt and the reason why I
suggest<00:04:34.080> that<00:04:34.260> is<00:04:34.440> then<00:04:34.680> you<00:04:34.800> can<00:04:34.950> see<00:04:35.130> that

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
suggest that is then you can see that

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.790 
suggest that is then you can see that
whole<00:04:35.610> soil<00:04:36.180> profile<00:04:36.840> rather<00:04:37.380> than<00:04:37.590> just

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
whole soil profile rather than just

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.110 
whole soil profile rather than just
digging<00:04:38.100> with<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.220> shovel<00:04:38.550> that's<00:04:38.820> a<00:04:38.910> lot<00:04:39.090> of

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
digging with a shovel that's a lot of

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.490 
digging with a shovel that's a lot of
work<00:04:39.360> and<00:04:39.510> you're<00:04:39.630> gonna<00:04:39.720> quit<00:04:40.050> before<00:04:40.290> you

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
work and you're gonna quit before you

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.470 
work and you're gonna quit before you
you<00:04:40.980> probably<00:04:41.340> should<00:04:41.670> just<00:04:41.850> dig<00:04:42.150> a<00:04:42.180> bigger

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
you probably should just dig a bigger

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.780 
you probably should just dig a bigger
hole<00:04:42.780> dig<00:04:43.230> a<00:04:43.260> rip<00:04:43.530> pit<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:43.980> you'll<00:04:44.280> see<00:04:44.550> what's

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
hole dig a rip pit and you'll see what's

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:45.860 
hole dig a rip pit and you'll see what's
going<00:04:45.120> on<00:04:45.270> you'll<00:04:45.480> see<00:04:45.510> where<00:04:45.780> those

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
going on you'll see where those

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.510 
going on you'll see where those
compaction<00:04:46.440> layers<00:04:46.620> are<00:04:46.860> at<00:04:46.980> and<00:04:47.220> then<00:04:47.400> you

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
compaction layers are at and then you

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.190 
compaction layers are at and then you
can<00:04:47.640> appropriately<00:04:48.240> do<00:04:48.540> that<00:04:48.750> deep<00:04:48.990> tillage

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
can appropriately do that deep tillage

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.870 
can appropriately do that deep tillage
that<00:04:49.500> you<00:04:49.590> should<00:04:49.800> well<00:04:50.160> deep<00:04:50.370> tillage<00:04:50.610> is

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
that you should well deep tillage is

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.520 
that you should well deep tillage is
great<00:04:51.150> for<00:04:51.420> helping<00:04:51.720> with<00:04:51.750> compaction<00:04:52.410> issues

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
great for helping with compaction issues

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.650 
great for helping with compaction issues
but<00:04:52.890> it<00:04:53.010> doesn't<00:04:53.460> necessarily<00:04:54.150> stop<00:04:54.210> our

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
but it doesn't necessarily stop our

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.330 
but it doesn't necessarily stop our
weight<00:04:54.900> of<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.080> week<00:04:55.230> we'll<00:04:55.530> show<00:04:55.560> you<00:04:55.830> coming
