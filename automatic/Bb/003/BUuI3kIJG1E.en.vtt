frustrating how hard they are to get

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.130 
frustrating how hard they are to get
when<00:01:49.470> they<00:01:49.530> can<00:01:49.680> just<00:01:49.710> grow<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.970> readily<00:01:51.479> but

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
when they can just grow so readily but

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.780 
when they can just grow so readily but
people<00:01:52.590> chop<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.890> trees<00:01:53.159> down<00:01:53.399> or<00:01:53.579> people

anyway so that's how you open a jack for

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.870 
anyway so that's how you open a jack for
it<00:01:57.360> easy<00:01:57.659> no<00:01:58.049> tools<00:01:58.290> required
