00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.220
 hello dear welcome to 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.820
 with chili to my very first youtube 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.219
 Video 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.519
 yes I'm a little bit upset, too 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.130
 happy and yes we say today 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.720
 make rolls and that is what I intend to do 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.430
 a few weeks on my insta 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.070
 Photo posted by the satirist 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.189
 baked buns and indeed it works 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.480
 that's why I have the original recipe for the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.980
 Sattler buns a little bit 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.850
 modified to my taste 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.020
 adapted and many of you have 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.760
 commented that they are the buns whole 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.680
 Great and that they are good 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.160
 look like you would like the recipe 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.550
 and that's why I thought we just call 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.250
 live this channel-ins and so is 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.110
 just easier to show you the recipe 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.850
 and you can is this should be done 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.850
 there's a bit of trouble 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:59.489
 and yes, I'm happy okay then I say 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.019
 now what we need and indeed 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:10.369
 are the 125 grams of pungent oatmeal 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:16.049
 and 125 grams of fine oatmeal also 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:18.150
 150 grams of lean quark and 100 grams 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.610
 light cream cheese that is now the of 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.830
 ines at 0.2 percent but in principle 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.070
 can you go fresh next to each one 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:30.540
 is characterized as a satiety 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:33.210
 then we have a two teaspoon salt 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.540
 I have to say that to the salt 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.229
 my buns like to first prove 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.079
 cold cuts and immediately but if you yours 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.540
 Buns prefer sweet food was when with 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.970
 I would then jam nutella 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.390
 recommend only half teaspoon place too 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.530
 to take 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.130
 then we have two teaspoons here 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.659
 baking powder and a teaspoon of sodium 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.520
 does not want to use any loses or is 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.210
 not find then just take two 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.530
 teaspoon of baking powder and now comes 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.849
 something you probably very much 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.830
 strangely over and say my god 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:14.310
 I have a teaspoon of vinegar here and 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.980
 we need that for nato and 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.849
 to activate baking powder in baking process 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.580
 This makes the buns more airy and 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.620
 not like bricks so i like it 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.720
 not if they are that hard and that's why 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.549
 may also omit it because it is not 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.060
 use word but I guarantee you one 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:35.069
 does not taste it ethically and how 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.370
 I like to say my buns 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.040
 salty evidence so with cold cuts evidence 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.780
 I have here a teaspoon tk 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.280
 You do not have to cut blue either 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.470
 kick it but I like the quite like 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:53.420
 and it looks good on him too 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.420
 then we want to start 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:30.479
 We love the bun cups shot 

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:30.919
 come and I think they look very good 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.879
 out 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:37.709
 mine were now exactly 21 minutes in it 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:39.419
 because she likes a bit darker 

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:42.869
 you can vary it so between 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:44.579
 20 and 22 minutes and the old ones 

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:46.109
 We'll cut one up for that 

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:48.929
 so you too , from the inside 

00:05:46.109 --> 00:06:01.619
 look I push to talk about the 

00:05:48.929 --> 00:06:03.779
 Tin is still from the outside 

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:05.969
 Of course they are not crispy, of course 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:08.309
 to compare with bread rolls one 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:09.899
 from the baker gets because I always like 

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:12.959
 she looked like they are still smoking they are 

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:16.679
 still hot and inviting on the 

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:19.139
 Chives also well distributed and shows 

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:25.319
 the inner one is also fluid and 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:26.759
 soft very good means that 's it 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:29.249
 that I mean with the vinegar that you 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:31.909
 kind of hold on the inside a little bit 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:34.979
 become more fluid 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:36.899
 yes, these were our sattmacher buns 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:39.479
 I am glad that you are keeping it and 

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:41.369

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:44.519

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:46.799

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:49.409
