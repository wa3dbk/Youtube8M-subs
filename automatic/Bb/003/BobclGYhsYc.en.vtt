00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
the droid DNA it does have wireless

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.969 
the droid DNA it does have wireless
charging<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.430> beats<00:01:15.090> audio<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.229> me<00:01:16.560> person<00:01:16.890> I

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
charging and beats audio so me person I

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.800 
charging and beats audio so me person I
want<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.250> get<00:01:17.369> into<00:01:17.549> software<00:01:18.150> because<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.540> have

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
want to get into software because I have

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.609 
want to get into software because I have
Android<00:01:19.560> jelly<00:01:19.799> bean<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.310> also<00:01:20.759> iOS<00:01:21.479> 6<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.320> it

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
Android jelly bean and also iOS 6 so it

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.469 
Android jelly bean and also iOS 6 so it
really<00:01:22.650> comes<00:01:23.130> down<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.400> both<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.119> my<00:01:24.240> great

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
really comes down to both of my great

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.060 
really comes down to both of my great
operating<00:01:24.900> system<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.380> most<00:01:25.680> people<00:01:25.979> would

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
operating system and most people would

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.490 
operating system and most people would
say<00:01:26.100> android<00:01:26.610> slowing<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.930> know<00:01:28.049> lagging

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
say android slowing you know lagging

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.719 
say android slowing you know lagging
stuff<00:01:28.650> like<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.799> but<00:01:29.040> that's<00:01:29.220> not<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.579> case

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
stuff like that but that's not the case

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.760 
stuff like that but that's not the case
with<00:01:29.939> jelly<00:01:30.150> bean<00:01:30.360> anymore<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.350> very<00:01:31.500> very

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
with jelly bean anymore it is very very

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.440 
with jelly bean anymore it is very very
fast<00:01:32.040> one<00:01:32.610> thing<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.880> note<00:01:33.030> with<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.240> droid

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
fast one thing to note with the droid

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.990 
fast one thing to note with the droid
DNA<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.320> does<00:01:34.500> come<00:01:34.710> with<00:01:34.799> HTC<00:01:35.369> sense<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.970> I

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
DNA the does come with HTC sense so I

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.670 
DNA the does come with HTC sense so I
don't<00:01:36.299> know<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.509> may<00:01:36.659> like<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.470> don't<00:01:37.530> know

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.940 
Sense and it didn't like at all it was
actually<00:01:43.020> kind<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.259> smoothing<00:01:43.590> when<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.799> had

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
actually kind of smoothing when you had

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.429 
actually kind of smoothing when you had
the<00:01:44.130> HTC<00:01:44.430> Sense<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.180> but<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.960> know<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:46.320> to

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
the HTC Sense on but you know it's up to

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.200 
the HTC Sense on but you know it's up to
you<00:01:46.560> if<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.710> want<00:01:46.950> stock<00:01:47.220> Android<00:01:47.700> if<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.970> if

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
you look for stock Android I would

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.920 
you look for stock Android I would
recommend<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.399> nexus<00:01:50.759> phone<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:51.570> going<00:01:51.750> back

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
recommend a nexus phone but going back

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.260 
recommend a nexus phone but going back
into<00:01:52.140> software<00:01:52.649> both<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.610> them<00:01:53.700> are<00:01:53.790> very<00:01:54.030> very

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
into software both of them are very very

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.050 
into software both of them are very very
nice<00:01:54.649> very<00:01:55.649> smooth<00:01:56.009> operating<00:01:56.490> systems<00:01:56.909> I

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
nice very smooth operating systems I

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.760 
nice very smooth operating systems I
think<00:01:57.420> they<00:01:57.540> both<00:01:57.570> i<00:01:57.990> think<00:01:58.229> andruw's<00:01:58.469> really

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
think they both i think andruw's really

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.160 
think they both i think andruw's really
caught<00:01:58.979> up<00:01:59.130> with<00:01:59.250> iOS<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.969> um<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.840> know<00:02:00.869> I

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
caught up with iOS and um you know I

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.870 
caught up with iOS and um you know I
think<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.590> main<00:02:01.740> thing<00:02:01.799> comes<00:02:02.219> down<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.670> is

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
think the main thing comes down to is

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.789 
think the main thing comes down to is
application<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.960> if<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.259> already<00:02:04.409> have<00:02:04.649> an

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
application so if you already have an

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.709 
application so if you already have an
ipad<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.399> imac<00:02:05.579> then<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.390> would<00:02:06.479> pretty<00:02:06.630> much

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
ipad and imac then it would pretty much

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.180 
ipad and imac then it would pretty much
make<00:02:06.869> sense<00:02:07.259> for<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.530> go<00:02:07.740> ahead<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.099> get

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
make sense for you to go ahead and get

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.490 
make sense for you to go ahead and get
an<00:02:08.310> iphone<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.300> ecosystem<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.170> just<00:02:10.349> all

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
an iphone the ecosystem it just all

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.500 
an iphone the ecosystem it just all
cramps<00:02:10.979> together

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
cramps together

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.259 
cramps together
really<00:02:11.780> really<00:02:12.019> well<00:02:12.230> but<00:02:13.159> you<00:02:13.670> know<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:14.030> lot<00:02:14.239> of

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
really really well but you know a lot of

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.789 
really really well but you know a lot of
people<00:02:14.330> say<00:02:14.659> androids<00:02:15.140> marketplace<00:02:15.650> is

people say androids marketplace is
lagging<00:02:16.129> behind<00:02:16.220> that's<00:02:17.000> not<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.269> case

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
lagging behind that's not the case

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.289 
lagging behind that's not the case
anymore<00:02:18.010> insurance<00:02:19.010> marketplace<00:02:19.489> is<00:02:19.730> very

anymore insurance marketplace is very
very<00:02:20.420> good<00:02:20.689> it's<00:02:20.930> really<00:02:20.989> catching<00:02:21.590> up<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.860> iOS

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
very good it's really catching up to iOS

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.179 
very good it's really catching up to iOS
but<00:02:22.939> i<00:02:23.180> will<00:02:23.480> say<00:02:23.659> iowa<00:02:24.049> still<00:02:24.409> does<00:02:24.650> have<00:02:24.920> a

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
but i will say iowa still does have a

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.270 
but i will say iowa still does have a
lot<00:02:25.610> more<00:02:25.819> better<00:02:26.659> quality<00:02:27.319> applications<00:02:27.829> i

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
lot more better quality applications i

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.250 
lot more better quality applications i
will<00:02:28.790> say<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.030> so<00:02:29.420> if<00:02:29.599> you're<00:02:29.810> in<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.079> market
