00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
this branch here on the naked taupo road

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.480 
this branch here on the naked taupo road
where<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.930> grows<00:01:07.110> no<00:01:07.590> quite<00:01:08.010> there's<00:01:08.310> quite

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
where it grows no quite there's quite

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.640 
where it grows no quite there's quite
calm<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:09.000> now<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.930> problem<00:01:10.380> with<00:01:10.470> this

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
calm in there now the problem with this

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.760 
calm in there now the problem with this
native<00:01:11.640> bush<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.900> firstly<00:01:13.560> it's

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
native bush is that firstly it's

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.920 
native bush is that firstly it's
poisonous<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.549> stop<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.180> farmers<00:01:15.570> will<00:01:15.720> try

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
poisonous to stop so farmers will try

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.410 
poisonous to stop so farmers will try
and<00:01:16.110> eradicate<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.070> from<00:01:17.100> their<00:01:17.340> farms<00:01:17.850> but

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
and eradicate it from their farms but

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.230 
and eradicate it from their farms but
the<00:01:18.659> other<00:01:18.840> thing<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:20.520> patient<00:01:21.000> vine

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
the other thing is that the patient vine

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.719 
the other thing is that the patient vine
hopper<00:01:21.630> which<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> little<00:01:22.830> unstable<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
hopper which is a little unstable to the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.899 
hopper which is a little unstable to the
lacy<00:01:23.970> wings<00:01:24.360> will<00:01:25.020> feed<00:01:25.290> off<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.860> plant<00:01:26.220> and

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
lacy wings will feed off this plant and

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.539 
lacy wings will feed off this plant and
when<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.210> feeds<00:01:27.420> often<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.020> produces<00:01:28.590> Conejo

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
when it feeds often it produces Conejo

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.260 
when it feeds often it produces Conejo
which<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> sticky<00:01:30.420> sippy<00:01:31.610> exudate<00:01:32.610> that

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
which is a sticky sippy exudate that

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.140 
which is a sticky sippy exudate that
honeybees<00:01:34.170> will<00:01:34.500> feed<00:01:34.799> off<00:01:35.009> now<00:01:35.850> they're<00:01:36.030> more

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
honeybees will feed off now they're more

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.090 
honeybees will feed off now they're more
likely<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.540> feed<00:01:36.840> off<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.229> honey<00:01:37.470> -<00:01:37.560> in

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
likely to feed off this honey - in

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.249 
likely to feed off this honey - in
summer<00:01:38.790> when<00:01:39.299> there's<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.600> when<00:01:39.900> they're<00:01:40.079> maybe

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
summer when there's a when they're maybe

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.840 
summer when there's a when they're maybe
not<00:01:40.530> be<00:01:41.100> enough<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.820> got<00:01:42.329> food<00:01:42.810> sources<00:01:43.320> around

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
not be enough I got food sources around

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.249 
not be enough I got food sources around
so<00:01:44.850> they'll<00:01:45.030> come<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> plant<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:45.930> their

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
so they'll come to the plant in their

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.929 
so they'll come to the plant in their
own<00:01:46.380> they'll<00:01:46.799> feed<00:01:47.070> off<00:01:47.189> pager<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.820> they'll

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
own they'll feed off pager and they'll

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.300 
own they'll feed off pager and they'll
take<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.149> back<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.509> their<00:01:48.630> hive<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.350> when<00:01:50.159> they

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
take it back to their hive and when they

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.889 
take it back to their hive and when they
turn<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:51.420> honey<00:01:52.350> Jo<00:01:52.590> into<00:01:53.220> honey<00:01:53.899> it

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
turn this honey Jo into honey it

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.520 
turn this honey Jo into honey it
produces<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.799> toxin<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.520> UI<00:01:57.049> neurotoxin<00:01:58.079> which

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
produces a toxin and UI neurotoxin which

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.280 
produces a toxin and UI neurotoxin which
is<00:01:58.740> very<00:01:58.979> poisonous<00:01:59.579> and<00:02:00.180> even<00:02:00.509> deadly<00:02:00.719> to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
is very poisonous and even deadly to

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.380 
is very poisonous and even deadly to
humans<00:02:01.939> so<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:04.680> way<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.890> avoid<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.030> to

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
humans so the way to avoid this is to

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.449 
humans so the way to avoid this is to
