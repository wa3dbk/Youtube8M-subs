you a picture that upcoming event going

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.180 
you a picture that upcoming event going
into<00:00:54.109> the<00:00:54.229> some<00:00:54.620> of<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:54.769> features<00:00:55.069> and

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
into the some of the features and

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.500 
into the some of the features and
benefits<00:00:55.309> of<00:00:55.670> these<00:00:55.760> carburetors<00:00:56.089> they<00:00:56.389> all

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
benefits of these carburetors they all

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.449 
benefits of these carburetors they all
tune<00:00:56.749> very<00:00:57.049> similar<00:00:57.469> we<00:00:58.010> actually<00:00:58.309> use<00:00:58.429> a

00:00:58.449 --> 00:00:58.459 
tune very similar we actually use a

00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:00.369 
tune very similar we actually use a
metering<00:00:58.909> rod<00:00:59.179> setup<00:00:59.600> and<00:00:59.780> each<00:01:00.079> of<00:01:00.260> these

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
metering rod setup and each of these

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.110 
metering rod setup and each of these
that<00:01:00.769> makes<00:01:00.920> it<00:01:01.069> very<00:01:01.219> simplistic<00:01:01.639> to<00:01:01.909> tune

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
that makes it very simplistic to tune

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.329 
that makes it very simplistic to tune
you<00:01:02.780> literally<00:01:03.199> pull<00:01:03.409> off<00:01:03.559> two<00:01:03.769> screws<00:01:04.070> off

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
you literally pull off two screws off

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.639 
you literally pull off two screws off
the<00:01:04.610> top<00:01:04.789> that<00:01:05.630> will<00:01:05.780> pull<00:01:05.990> out<00:01:06.110> two<00:01:06.289> metering

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
the top that will pull out two metering

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.050 
the top that will pull out two metering
rods<00:01:06.680> that<00:01:06.979> are<00:01:07.070> actually<00:01:07.369> a<00:01:07.399> tapered<00:01:07.820> rod

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
rods that are actually a tapered rod

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.999 
rods that are actually a tapered rod
makes<00:01:08.630> it<00:01:08.780> very<00:01:08.899> simple<00:01:09.140> you<00:01:09.590> don't<00:01:09.740> have<00:01:09.890> to

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
makes it very simple you don't have to

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.950 
makes it very simple you don't have to
drain<00:01:10.189> the<00:01:10.310> fuel<00:01:10.490> out<00:01:10.729> of<00:01:10.759> the<00:01:10.909> bowls<00:01:11.090> unlike

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
drain the fuel out of the bowls unlike

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.209 
drain the fuel out of the bowls unlike
some<00:01:12.350> of<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:12.500> competitors<00:01:12.860> that<00:01:12.979> are<00:01:13.070> out

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
some of the competitors that are out

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:14.679 
some of the competitors that are out
there<00:01:13.250> so<00:01:13.610> it<00:01:13.729> makes<00:01:13.909> tuning<00:01:14.270> very<00:01:14.450> easy

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
there so it makes tuning very easy

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.959 
there so it makes tuning very easy
there's<00:01:15.590> two<00:01:15.829> little<00:01:16.070> springs<00:01:16.369> one<00:01:16.729> in<00:01:16.850> each

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969 
there's two little springs one in each
