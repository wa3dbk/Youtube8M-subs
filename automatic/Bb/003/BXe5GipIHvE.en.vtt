00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:13.080
 in a personal search of which he spoke affirming 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.960
 that we are in the third episode of 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.789
 our map of ventura port or kraft and 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.460
 which at the same time is an analysis of the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.859
 portugal is a module that allows 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.150
 use and we have the game for such as 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.970
 setting up portals company history 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.710
 where bce and also and many other 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.840
 things like the sentinels that we go 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.710
 see throughout this episode has 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.500
 sure is we were not used and stayed 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.410
 in this test room of 6 and we need 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.030
 for 17 we will only continue the match 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.640
 here and see how it flows I am 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.890
 quite accurately with certainty that 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.079
 I spent a very straight sentinel in 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:08.450
 castela sun art films is what she 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:13.770
 knew how to tell the feelings of her clothes 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:19.049
 did not win a motif another achievement 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.020
 to tell this one I can see what I 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.900
 Can I do it for Wii? 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.860
 now we need to move more portals 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.860
 we will see 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.740
 It's complicated and I'll put it here. 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:40.170
 easier exact 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.790
 now I'll put it there it 's very fast 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.790
 already behind her 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.930
 no hart sentimental she was from 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.820
 Sentinel was 10 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.510
 It was one of the funniest items 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.960
 placed on this of this portal wins 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:10.000
 because they are equal even equal to aa 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:18.550
 sentinels who put them right 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:23.230
 a game even through the glass 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:28.690
 just walk I'm going to say it I think 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:44.740
 I 'm going to need to remember this challenge 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:47.200
 is this dwarf given the mountain is worth 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:53.050
 Give it a try I think it was worth trying 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:59.700
 move on also spoke to no okay we 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.700
 so let's think we promoted then 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:09.870
 we think ourselves right 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:14.920
 I did not kill you feel the damn silver life. 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:19.260
 regenerates and then we still do not know 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.680
 do what we are going to try to pass 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.680
 quickly there 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.560
 do not game over 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.560
 Oops I died and come here to stop many me 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.900
 asked to be seen in this room 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.880
 of shape you can see here 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.320
 this way estimating guy that's going to 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:49.930
 take ten test rooms 15 rooms 10 and 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.720
 10 11 15 16 20 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.959
 this is basically our pole we die 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.240
 stop here because our on cartoon 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.880
 we were in room 17 if not me 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.700
 But deception is not here is a 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:15.070
 push and I want here we are 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:16.510
 the right room to mind the room that we 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.330
 we need it 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.060
 in this case the exit room 20 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:26.340
 we have a room where they were 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:32.190
 suspended and has to leave'll have to see 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.190
 this very very huge 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.490
 let's continue 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.870
 we are each of the three largest 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.460
 want to record is just to see 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:54.140
 how does that work very oops is 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:58.280
 not stay here and been here maybe 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:01.210
 I think it will equip the 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.210
 exactly 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.610
 Let's see how this works now as 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.220
 we 'll get through the 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.850
 sentinels 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:24.100
 We only think we have to start. 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:25.090
 we already have here we have to use more 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:33.100
 portals 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:37.150
 we will need we have we will not go 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:39.730
 neither super useful and now do not know promise 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.340
 maybe back and behind them 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:55.120
 I hope you have no sign of the other 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:06:06.070
 Exactly new side but with so much 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:13.690
 story the kills the law and not mate 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:26.130
 Teacher, can I put this thing down? 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:26.130
 I'm not against sentinel rules 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:35.190
 do the same as they have already done the same 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:46.960
 we are at the personal end finally to the end 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:50.170
 of 13 episodes end of beta 9 8 by 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:55.120
 please destroy this cube that history 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:07:00.090
 of which one is the component silva and the game 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:05.230
 is economical enough to say it's a 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:07.720
 It is the game portal everyone has 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:10.270
 played knows this is at the same time 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:14.730
 we won an achievement that the rain was 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.730
 light start I do not know what you mean 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:20.530
 only 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:23.110
 that's what it's saying very well android 

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:28.240
 the enrichment center again 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:32.700
 remembers that the hell of android is the 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:34.510
 real place to scare and if something 

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.030
 of this genus 

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.700
 we finally think and and I climb to 

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:43.090
 The team was only able to 

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:45.100
 like it is that this is it 

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:48.190
 quite favorite and closed subtracting 

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:50.650
 as you already know and I ask that you 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:54.040
 make it lonely to cost even 

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:58.240
 video not being on nor like new sale 

00:07:54.040 --> 00:08:00.669
 even I'll leave the links on the map 

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.580
 module and everything else from texture to 

00:08:00.669 --> 00:08:05.530
 description who you want to try by 

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.660
 If you can do it, I'll leave everything. 

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:11.080
 in the description so that it is much more 

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:13.240
 It's easy for you to play, that 's all. 

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.000
 I hope you have enjoyed it so much I am 

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:18.510
 enjoying the team - a hug and even 

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.510
