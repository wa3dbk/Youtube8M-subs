00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 It's Friday Friday 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.560
 the season 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.640
 today he speaks to you 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.550
 a situation that happens to me in a meeting 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.510
 with my friends it turned out that there was music 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.250
 of food man man men I see 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.320
 One other woman was having it 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.630
 really very very well until a 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.420
 someone thought to start throwing 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.910
 the food that there were damn tacos of 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.910
 spinning or shepherd and started singing 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.640
 Anger laughed as they were thrown 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.640
 and very ugly I do not know why I got a 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.790
 very strong feeling so strong that I 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.770
 I started to cry I started to cry I started 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.200
 cry like when a child was taken away 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.480
 sweet as when your boyfriend cries because 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.309
 you cut it like when your dads 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.730
 Take your chihuahua puppy to the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.510
 Naughty puppies farm 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.760
 and so I started crying exactly all 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.100
 they saw and enjoyed themselves while they lamented 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.409
 the tacos and me 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.360
 cried because the children of Africa do not 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.340
 they have to eat or obviously not 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.860
 I cried because I'm a fat girl which 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.960
 cries when they throw food then 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.600
 I cried too much and decided to go home 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.050
 to sleep I was very tired and 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.450
 the rest 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.940
 I was fed up but the next day 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.590
 I woke up with an extreme headache 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.530
 I put that it was therefore to cry I do not say 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.350

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.780

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.229
