00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.779
 the recombination of chromosomes 

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:08.599
 counterparts that carry some investment is 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.210
 very interesting because it produces some 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.240
 results with different types of 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.640
 losses of election gains 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.150
 etcetera for example it is represented that 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.519
 an investment for centric investment 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.920
 you see because these segments of 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.320
 different colors are seen that match 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.050
 here the blue and the gray but on the other hand the 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.390
 orange and yellow are inverted 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.450
 this is the region that has the investment 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.780
 that as we see does not include the mere center 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.580
 that's why it's an investment for centric 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.850
 when these two chromosomes have 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.620
 to align during meiosis 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.930
 obviously they can not because of the 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.890
 inversion and the chromosome that leads to 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.500
 investment adopts a loop structure 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.110
 so that now both chromosomes 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.160
 can be aligned correctly in all 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.760
 its regions 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.070
 when there is a 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.350
 recombination within the loop 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.680
 the result is going to be that one of the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.500
 chromosomes will be downtown takes two 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.110
 centromeres and the other chromosome is a 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.619
 fragment to downtown without center but that 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.220
 is lost and therefore the gametes go to 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.000
 bring structural alterations 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.550
 unbalanced important 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.170
 in the case of a peri investment 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.290
 centric like this one that we have 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.800
 represented here the investment includes 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.870
 the regions in orange and yellow and 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.870
 also within the investment for the 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.690
 center mere in this case when it forms 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.380
 also during meiosis the loop in 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.990
 the chromosome that leads to the inversion is 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.660
 can align both counterparts and in this 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.050
 case a recombination at this level 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.080
 inside the handle will lead to two 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.660
 normal chromosomes in that each 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.920
 one of them has a mere center but 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.750
 we see that they carry different types of 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.119
 elections or duplication is for example 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.760
 one of them has a region duplicated 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.980
 in this case the gray and instead has 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.340
 lost the regions that carried the 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.670
 blue markers and the other chromosome the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.870
 another ga the other gametes will carry 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.730
 duplication of these regions that 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.280
 they carried the blue marker and instead 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.830
 they will have lost elections 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.019
 regions that carried the markers 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.239
 gray so in the gametes 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.510
 There will also be different 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.510
 types of structural alterations 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.510
 unbalanced
