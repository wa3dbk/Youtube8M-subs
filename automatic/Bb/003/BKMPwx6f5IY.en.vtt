windows look like this basically it's
just<00:00:05.339> using<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.730> gradient<00:00:06.000> in<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.359> background

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
just using a gradient in the background

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.880 
just using a gradient in the background
and<00:00:06.990> you're<00:00:07.080> going<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.290> put<00:00:07.410> this<00:00:07.529> checkered

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
start off by choosing where your windows

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.500 
start off by choosing where your windows
are<00:00:17.039> going<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.220> go<00:00:17.310> like<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.760> front<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.390> and

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
I like to make a little outside part of

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:29.839 
I like to make a little outside part of
glass<00:00:22.800> just<00:00:23.250> around<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.760> edges<00:00:27.140> and<00:00:28.849> then

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
glass just around the edges and then

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.540 
glass just around the edges and then
we're<00:00:30.000> going<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.150> put<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.539> stained<00:00:31.439> glass

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
we're going to put the stained glass

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.510 
we're going to put the stained glass
panes<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.030> inside<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:35.280> stained

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
panes on the inside and the stained

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.000 
panes on the inside and the stained
glass<00:00:35.550> panes<00:00:36.000> are<00:00:36.180> really<00:00:36.540> what<00:00:36.770> is<00:00:37.770> going<00:00:37.950> to

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
glass panes are really what is going to

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.100 
glass panes are really what is going to
glow<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:39.149> other<00:00:39.300> stuff<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.660> there<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:40.050> to

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
glow the other stuff is there just to

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.430 
glow the other stuff is there just to
kind<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.410> make<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.559> look<00:00:40.860> like<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.160> glowing

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.500 

so<00:00:46.440> I'm<00:00:46.500> going<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.680> stack<00:00:47.039> nine<00:00:47.520> minus<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.329> and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
so I'm going to stack nine minus a and

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.330 
so I'm going to stack nine minus a and
it's<00:00:48.989> going<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.140> stack<00:00:49.410> one<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:49.860> top<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.100> each

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
it's going to stack one on top of each

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.690 
it's going to stack one on top of each
other

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
other

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.459 
other
and<00:00:50.789> if<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.750> don't<00:00:51.840> have<00:00:51.989> worldedit<00:00:52.289> you

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
and if you don't have worldedit you

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:00.910 
and if you don't have worldedit you
could<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:52.890> part<00:00:53.160> by<00:00:53.280> hand

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.410 

now<00:01:01.920> it's<00:01:02.160> important<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.519> you<00:01:02.610> go<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.879> back

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
now it's important that you go to back

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.830 
now it's important that you go to back
not<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.320> one<00:01:04.710> we<00:01:05.369> need<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.610> go<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.759> and<00:01:06.299> then

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
not just one we need to go to and then

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.340 
not just one we need to go to and then
right<00:01:07.170> here<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:08.580> where<00:01:08.880> your<00:01:09.140> next<00:01:10.140> layer

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
right here this is where your next layer

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.800 
right here this is where your next layer
of<00:01:10.500> glass<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.190> start<00:01:11.509> so<00:01:12.509> I'm

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
of glass is going to start so I'm

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.320 
of glass is going to start so I'm
actually<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.500> put<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:18.060> wool

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
actually going to put the the wool

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.210 
actually going to put the the wool
behind<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.110> first<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.040> where

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
behind this first and just this is where

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.160 
behind this first and just this is where
the<00:01:23.399> gradient<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:24.060> going<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.299> go<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.690> I<00:01:25.049> don't

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
the gradient is going to go and I don't

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.160 
the gradient is going to go and I don't
want<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.710> like<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> straight<00:01:26.369> line<00:01:26.580> like

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
want it to be like a straight line like

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.210 
want it to be like a straight line like
straight<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.350> top<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.619> each<00:01:28.740> other<00:01:28.920> because

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
straight on top of each other because

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.830 
straight on top of each other because
they<00:01:29.580> don't<00:01:29.729> really<00:01:29.820> blend<00:01:30.149> in<00:01:30.330> you<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.630> see

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
they don't really blend in you can see

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.029 
they don't really blend in you can see
it<00:01:30.960> really<00:01:31.170> easily<00:01:31.410> from<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.679> other<00:01:31.830> side<00:01:37.039> so

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
it really easily from the other side so

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.290 
it really easily from the other side so
we're<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.159> going<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.399> keep<00:01:38.610> adding<00:01:38.820> this

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
we're just going to keep adding this

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.279 
we're just going to keep adding this
gradient<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:39.960> orange<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.530> top<00:01:40.679> of<00:01:40.830> red<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
gradient so orange on top of red and

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.919 
gradient so orange on top of red and
then<00:01:43.289> we're<00:01:44.220> going<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.369> add<00:01:44.550> yellow<00:01:45.300> on<00:01:45.569> top<00:01:45.780> of

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
then we're going to add yellow on top of

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:55.790 
then we're going to add yellow on top of
orange<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.460> also<00:01:53.610> use<00:01:54.300> different<00:01:54.800> kinds

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
orange you can also use different kinds

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.080 
orange you can also use different kinds
of<00:01:55.860> wools<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.310> stuff<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:56.789> you<00:01:56.970> can

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
of wools and stuff like that so you can

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.960 
of wools and stuff like that so you can
use<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:58.009> bunch<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.039> different<00:01:59.310> colors<00:01:59.550> and<00:01:59.700> kind

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
use a bunch of different colors and kind

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.130 
use a bunch of different colors and kind
of<00:02:00.030> play<00:02:00.179> around<00:02:00.300> see<00:02:00.630> what<00:02:00.780> kind<00:02:00.929> of<00:02:00.990> cool

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
of play around see what kind of cool

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.160 
of play around see what kind of cool
colors<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.500> can<00:02:01.619> get<00:02:01.799> with<00:02:01.950> this

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
colors you can get with this

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.700 
colors you can get with this
so<00:02:04.170> then<00:02:04.380> down<00:02:04.770> here<00:02:05.159> you're<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.790> put

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
so then down here you're going to put

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.960 
so then down here you're going to put
purple<00:02:07.710> over<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.220> red<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.640> we're<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:08.850> going
