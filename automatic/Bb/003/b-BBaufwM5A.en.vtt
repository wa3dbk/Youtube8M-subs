00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.670 
I mean it's uh it's v1 and and I guess I
look<00:01:29.430> forward<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.200> slightly<00:01:31.200> more<00:01:31.500> than

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
look forward to that slightly more than

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.390 
look forward to that slightly more than
this

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
this

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.240 
this
um<00:01:32.760> probably<00:01:33.480> this<00:01:34.320> one<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.860> because<00:01:34.980> it's

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
um probably this one just because it's

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.150 
um probably this one just because it's
it's<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.240> bigger<00:01:36.420> buying<00:01:36.660> and<00:01:37.050> especially<00:01:37.830> for

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
it's a bigger buying and especially for

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.070 
it's a bigger buying and especially for
me<00:01:38.250> last<00:01:38.460> year<00:01:38.610> getting<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.090> close<00:01:39.240> I've<00:01:39.870> been

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
me last year getting so close I've been

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.450 
me last year getting so close I've been
waiting<00:01:40.230> for<00:01:40.410> another<00:01:40.710> shot<00:01:40.920> at<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.160> for<00:01:41.430> a

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
waiting for another shot at it for a

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.420 
waiting for another shot at it for a
whole<00:01:41.580> year<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.350> that<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.740> probably<00:01:44.190> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
whole year so that this is probably the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.860 
whole year so that this is probably the
most<00:01:44.610> amost<00:01:45.150> important<00:01:45.510> tournament<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
most amost important tournament of the

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.990 
most amost important tournament of the
year<00:01:45.930> for<00:01:46.140> manufacture<00:01:46.650> well<00:01:47.580> this<00:01:47.730> is<00:01:47.760> my

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
year for manufacture well this is my

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.660 
year for manufacture well this is my
first<00:01:48.180> time<00:01:48.330> playing<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.750> one<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.950> I

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
first time playing this one and and I

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.850 
first time playing this one and and I
hadn't<00:01:51.060> really<00:01:51.420> thought<00:01:51.750> about<00:01:52.290> playing<00:01:52.620> it

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
hadn't really thought about playing it

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.260 
hadn't really thought about playing it
in<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:52.980> past<00:01:53.220> but<00:01:53.400> been<00:01:53.790> having<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> good<00:01:54.210> year

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
in the past but been having a good year

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.150 
in the past but been having a good year
and<00:01:54.510> really<00:01:54.750> comfortable<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.380> game<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.980> I

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
and really comfortable in the game so I

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.120 
and really comfortable in the game so I
guess<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:58.020> haven't<00:01:58.530> thought<00:01:58.650> about<00:01:58.800> it<00:01:59.040> in

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
guess I I haven't thought about it in

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.850 
guess I I haven't thought about it in
that<00:01:59.190> respect<00:02:00.090> yet<00:02:00.300> so<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.840> think<00:02:01.530> those<00:02:01.800> are

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
that respect yet so I think those are

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.830 
that respect yet so I think those are
two<00:02:02.040> very<00:02:02.070> different<00:02:02.340> different<00:02:02.850> but<00:02:03.180> you

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
two very different different but you

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.270 
two very different different but you
know<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.990> me<00:02:04.230> personally<00:02:04.440> obviously<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.160> main

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
know to me personally obviously the main

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.609 
know to me personally obviously the main
event<00:02:05.400> is<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.940> know<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.270> gray<00:02:06.840> loved<00:02:07.320> all<00:02:07.500> the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
event is you know the gray loved all the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.380 
event is you know the gray loved all the
tournaments<00:02:08.100> but<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> 50k<00:02:08.790> has<00:02:09.000> something

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
tournaments but the 50k has something

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.090 
tournaments but the 50k has something
very<00:02:09.510> special<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:10.440> they<00:02:10.590> ate<00:02:10.770> gaming

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
very special if they ate gaming

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.760 
very special if they ate gaming
rotations<00:02:11.670> it's<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.120> big<00:02:12.300> by<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.870> final<00:02:13.500> table

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
rotations it's a big by in a final table

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.380 
rotations it's a big by in a final table
that<00:02:13.890> last<00:02:14.070> year<00:02:14.220> also<00:02:14.400> some<00:02:14.700> very<00:02:14.880> motivated

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
that last year also some very motivated

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.660 
that last year also some very motivated
to<00:02:15.480> be<00:02:15.600> out<00:02:15.720> there<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:16.410> guess<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.220> two<00:02:17.370> kind<00:02:17.580> of

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
to be out there I guess the two kind of

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.460 
to be out there I guess the two kind of
equals<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.240> just<00:02:18.420> want<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.600> do<00:02:18.690> well<00:02:18.900> in<00:02:19.140> both<00:02:19.290> of

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
equals I just want to do well in both of

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.620 
equals I just want to do well in both of
them<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:20.280> one<00:02:20.430> has<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.580> lot<00:02:20.820> less<00:02:21.000> players<00:02:21.300> so

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
them this one has a lot less players so

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.660 
them this one has a lot less players so
it's<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.170> lot<00:02:22.320> more<00:02:22.350> easier<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.190> go<00:02:23.310> through<00:02:23.580> the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
it's a lot more easier to go through the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.760 
it's a lot more easier to go through the
final<00:02:23.940> table<00:02:24.240> it's<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.840> very<00:02:25.050> tough<00:02:25.200> event<00:02:25.560> so

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
final table it's a very tough event so

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.980 
final table it's a very tough event so
we'll<00:02:26.160> see<00:02:26.250> what<00:02:26.340> happens<00:02:26.630> for<00:02:27.630> me<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:27.930> is

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
we'll see what happens for me this is

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.650 
we'll see what happens for me this is
the<00:02:28.200> number<00:02:28.470> one<00:02:28.680> event<00:02:29.490> of<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.700> year<00:02:29.940> because

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
the number one event of the year because

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.740 
the number one event of the year because
