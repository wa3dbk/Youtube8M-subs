to<00:01:03.449> roll<00:01:03.629> over<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.589> what<00:01:04.739> that's<00:01:04.920> going<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.100> do

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
to roll over and what that's going to do

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.250 
to roll over and what that's going to do
is<00:01:05.430> set<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.909> its<00:01:05.939> proper<00:01:06.390> angle<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.900> what

is set it on its proper angle and what

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.480 
is set it on its proper angle and what
does<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.500> look<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.710> I'm<00:01:08.159> going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.310> show

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
does that look like I'm going to show

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.149 
does that look like I'm going to show
you<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.760> as<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:09.000> bring<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> club<00:01:09.540> back<00:01:09.570> down

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
you so as we bring the club back down

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.190 
you so as we bring the club back down
you<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.310> see<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.880> angle<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> shaft<00:01:12.840> at

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
you can see the angle of the shaft at

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.440 
you can see the angle of the shaft at
address<00:01:13.650> what<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.700> want<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.939> do<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.240> when<00:01:15.360> we

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
address what we want to do is when we

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.880 
address what we want to do is when we
hit<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.750> ball<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:16.080> want<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.320> return<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.860> to

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
hit the ball we want to return it to

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.640 
hit the ball we want to return it to
this<00:01:17.159> original<00:01:18.000> angle<00:01:18.150> as<00:01:18.509> closely<00:01:18.960> as<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.409> can

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
this original angle as closely as we can

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.160 
this original angle as closely as we can
so<00:01:20.340> Steve<00:01:20.610> will<00:01:20.759> take<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.090> back<00:01:21.240> again<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.810> as

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
so Steve will take it back again and as

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.200 
so Steve will take it back again and as
he<00:01:22.290> goes<00:01:22.409> back<00:01:22.680> he'll<00:01:22.950> roll<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.640> as<00:01:24.030> you

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
he goes back he'll roll it and as you

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.170 
he goes back he'll roll it and as you
can<00:01:24.299> see<00:01:24.799> it's<00:01:25.799> sitting<00:01:26.220> at<00:01:26.340> approximately

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
can see it's sitting at approximately

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.179 
can see it's sitting at approximately
the<00:01:27.210> same<00:01:27.479> angle<00:01:27.869> as<00:01:28.110> when<00:01:28.320> he<00:01:28.409> started<00:01:28.770> it

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
the same angle as when he started it

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.130 
the same angle as when he started it
doesn't<00:01:29.520> have<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.850> perfect<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.540> just<00:01:30.930> needs

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
doesn't have to be perfect it just needs

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.590 
doesn't have to be perfect it just needs
to<00:01:31.229> be<00:01:31.320> as<00:01:31.560> close<00:01:31.650> as<00:01:32.009> we<00:01:32.159> can<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:33.299> we're<00:01:33.479> gonna

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
to be as close as we can so we're gonna

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
you the difference between the short

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.640 
you the difference between the short

difference you're gonna see with this

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.140 
difference you're gonna see with this
swing<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:22.950> angle<00:02:23.400> when<00:02:23.580> he<00:02:23.670> comes<00:02:23.880> back

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
swing is this angle when he comes back

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.759 
swing is this angle when he comes back
and<00:02:24.420> let's<00:02:24.569> just<00:02:24.660> do<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> quick<00:02:25.140> little<00:02:25.170> slo-mo

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
and let's just do a quick little slo-mo

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.280 
and let's just do a quick little slo-mo
for<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.280> people-watching<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:27.090> as<00:02:27.930> he<00:02:28.080> comes

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
for the people-watching is as he comes

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.960 
for the people-watching is as he comes
back<00:02:28.500> go<00:02:28.709> ahead<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:28.950> slow-mo<00:02:29.250> back<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:29.850> can

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
back go ahead and slow-mo back you can

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.400 
back go ahead and slow-mo back you can
see<00:02:30.150> it's<00:02:30.330> gonna<00:02:30.390> be<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.630> little<00:02:30.870> bit<00:02:31.080> flatter

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
see it's gonna be a little bit flatter

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.410 
see it's gonna be a little bit flatter
than<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.370> other<00:02:32.519> Club<00:02:32.819> when<00:02:33.030> he<00:02:33.090> sets<00:02:33.330> the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
short Club the shorter Club is going to

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.009 
short Club the shorter Club is going to
be<00:02:34.769> at<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:34.920> taller<00:02:35.519> or<00:02:35.730> steeper<00:02:36.090> angle<00:02:36.239> this<00:02:36.959> is

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
be at a taller or steeper angle this is

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.780 
be at a taller or steeper angle this is
going<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.350> be<00:02:37.440> at<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.650> more<00:02:37.799> shallow<00:02:38.100> or<00:02:38.430> flatter

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
going to be at a more shallow or flatter

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.910 
going to be at a more shallow or flatter
angle<00:02:39.049> okay<00:02:40.049> so<00:02:40.110> now<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.410> we've<00:02:40.680> done<00:02:40.799> the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
angle okay so now that we've done the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.910 
angle okay so now that we've done the
slow-mo<00:02:41.280> let's<00:02:41.459> go<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:41.730> see<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:41.940> driver<00:02:42.180> in

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
slow-mo let's go and see the driver in

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.660 
slow-mo let's go and see the driver in
live-action<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.069> what<00:02:44.220> you're<00:02:44.310> gonna<00:02:44.400> notice

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.449 
live-action and what you're gonna notice
is<00:02:44.940> when<00:02:45.060> Steve<00:02:45.530> sets<00:02:46.530> up<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.799> ball<00:02:46.980> just

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459

a<00:02:53.970> little<00:02:54.120> more<00:02:54.480> clearly<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.440> go<00:02:55.500> ahead<00:02:55.560> and

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
a little more clearly so go ahead and

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
there's going to be slight adjustments

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.890 
there's going to be slight adjustments
