00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
making enough spark we don't know what

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.300 
making enough spark we don't know what
it<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.020> before<00:01:07.350> we've<00:01:07.740> changed<00:01:08.100> stator<00:01:09.200> CDI

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
it is before we've changed stator CDI

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.920 
it is before we've changed stator CDI
everything<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:12.000> still<00:01:12.210> made<00:01:12.390> weeks<00:01:12.600> part

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
everything and it still made weeks part

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.170 
everything and it still made weeks part
but<00:01:13.110> for<00:01:13.200> some<00:01:13.350> reason<00:01:13.729> now<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:15.030> been

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
but for some reason now it's been

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:57.410 
but for some reason now it's been
running<00:01:15.390> really<00:01:15.570> good<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.610> guess

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:10.400 

I<00:02:07.940> guess<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.119> popped<00:02:09.450> off<00:02:09.660> um<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.080> put<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
I guess this popped off um and put the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.860 
I guess this popped off um and put the
hood<00:02:10.590> back<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:11.100> they<00:02:12.090> shouldn't<00:02:12.390> be<00:02:12.510> like<00:02:12.660> that

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
hood back on they shouldn't be like that

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.640 
hood back on they shouldn't be like that
but<00:02:14.120> that's<00:02:15.120> my<00:02:15.330> dad's<00:02:16.190> 1993<00:02:17.300> already<00:02:18.300> cat

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.229 
Panther deluxe 440 but forgot to mention
it<00:02:26.040> but<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:26.280> engine<00:02:26.670> has<00:02:26.819> quite<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.060> good

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
it but this engine has quite a good

it but this engine has quite a good
Rumble<00:02:27.660> for<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.870> little<00:02:28.020> 340<00:02:28.590> listen<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.890> it

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980

again

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.890 

that<00:02:51.129> almost<00:02:51.280> sounds<00:02:51.730> like<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.879> tuna<00:02:52.180> fight<00:02:52.420> but

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
that almost sounds like a tuna fight but

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.449 
that almost sounds like a tuna fight but
it's<00:02:53.260> not<00:02:53.439> because<00:02:53.769> they<00:02:54.040> don't<00:02:54.219> make<00:02:54.280> two

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
it's not because they don't make two

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.389 
it's not because they don't make two
pipes<00:02:54.760> or<00:02:55.319> two<00:02:56.319> up<00:02:56.469> slides<00:02:57.060> but<00:02:58.060> there<00:02:58.239> you<00:02:58.359> go
