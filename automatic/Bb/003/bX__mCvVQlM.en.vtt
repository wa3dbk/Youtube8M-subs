00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
thoughts on it ear disgusting because he

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.230 
thoughts on it ear disgusting because he
doesn't<00:01:13.979> think<00:01:14.189> those<00:01:14.400> foods<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:14.880> Korean

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240

foods<00:01:15.509> at<00:01:15.689> both<00:01:15.840> Korean<00:01:16.200> foods<00:01:16.409> should<00:01:17.040> be

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
foods at both Korean foods should be

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.179 
foods at both Korean foods should be
mixed<00:01:17.580> whereas<00:01:18.509> my<00:01:18.840> feeling<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.470> Korea<00:01:19.979> has

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
mixed whereas my feeling is Korea has

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.700 
mixed whereas my feeling is Korea has
corrupted<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.060> many<00:01:21.390> western<00:01:21.869> food<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.500> I

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:53.570 
effort for really nervous really just

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.020 
effort for really nervous really just
like<00:06:54.110> just<00:06:54.440> mineral<00:06:54.770> water<00:06:55.160> you<00:06:55.370> buy<00:06:55.640> things

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
like just mineral water you buy things

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.320 
like just mineral water you buy things
and<00:06:56.390> then<00:06:56.600> you<00:06:57.440> just<00:06:57.680> drink<00:06:58.490> it<00:06:58.700> but<00:06:59.030> this<00:06:59.270> one

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
and then you just drink it but this one

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.780 
and then you just drink it but this one
you<00:06:59.540> need<00:06:59.870> to<00:06:59.900> forward<00:07:00.590> and<00:07:00.950> put<00:07:01.130> the<00:07:01.280> tea<00:07:01.520> in

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:01.790 
you need to forward and put the tea in

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.090 
you need to forward and put the tea in
it<00:07:01.970> but<00:07:02.660> I<00:07:02.780> sort<00:07:03.290> of<00:07:03.320> have<00:07:03.470> the<00:07:03.590> opposite

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.100 
it but I sort of have the opposite

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.950 
it but I sort of have the opposite
opinion<00:07:04.520> of<00:07:04.640> that<00:07:04.790> when<00:07:04.970> I<00:07:05.000> go<00:07:05.210> into<00:07:05.420> korean

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 
opinion of that when I go into korean

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.370 
opinion of that when I go into korean
restaurants<00:07:06.560> and<00:07:06.710> they're<00:07:06.830> using<00:07:06.980> the<00:07:07.250> tea<00:07:07.520> I

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:08.380 
restaurants and they're using the tea I

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.020 
restaurants and they're using the tea I
think<00:07:09.380> this<00:07:09.710> is<00:07:09.890> really<00:07:10.130> lazy<00:07:10.460> because<00:07:10.760> you've

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.030 
think this is really lazy because you've

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.370 
think this is really lazy because you've
just<00:07:11.060> got<00:07:11.330> the<00:07:11.450> water<00:07:11.690> out<00:07:11.780> of<00:07:11.930> the<00:07:12.110> tap<00:07:12.350> and

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
just got the water out of the tap and

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.800 
just got the water out of the tap and
patina<00:07:13.250> whereas<00:07:13.940> other<00:07:14.090> ones<00:07:14.300> I've<00:07:14.450> got<00:07:14.600> the

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:14.810 
patina whereas other ones I've got the

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.520 
patina whereas other ones I've got the
purified<00:07:15.770> water<00:07:16.750> you<00:07:17.750> know<00:07:17.900> I<00:07:17.930> feel<00:07:18.230> like<00:07:18.380> the

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.530 
purified water you know I feel like the

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.590 
purified water you know I feel like the
purified<00:07:18.890> water<00:07:19.070> is<00:07:19.310> more<00:07:19.490> effort<00:07:19.940> and<00:07:20.120> cooled

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:20.600 
purified water is more effort and cooled

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.440 
purified water is more effort and cooled
