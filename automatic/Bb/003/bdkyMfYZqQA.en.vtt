formation<00:02:47.370> which<00:02:47.820> we<00:02:48.030> call<00:02:48.270> Ace<00:02:48.570> this

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
formation which we call Ace this

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.560 
formation which we call Ace this
formations<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.250> balanced<00:02:50.670> formation<00:02:51.210> it's<00:02:51.360> two

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
formations a balanced formation it's two

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.780 
formations a balanced formation it's two
by<00:02:51.750> two<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:52.740> as<00:02:52.830> a<00:02:52.860> defense<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.490> have<00:02:53.520> to

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
by two so as a defense you have to

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.220 
by two so as a defense you have to
declare<00:02:53.940> where<00:02:54.480> are<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:54.660> gonna<00:02:54.780> put<00:02:54.870> your

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230

declare where are you gonna put your
strength<00:02:55.500> in<00:02:56.160> this<00:02:56.310> particular<00:02:56.670> picture<00:02:57.090> I'm

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
strength in this particular picture I'm

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.720 
strength in this particular picture I'm
gonna<00:02:57.450> make<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.840> strength<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.620> left<00:02:58.890> so

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
gonna make the strength to the left so

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.580 
gonna make the strength to the left so
the<00:02:59.760> linebackers<00:03:00.600> again<00:03:00.930> would<00:03:01.110> come<00:03:01.290> up<00:03:01.440> and

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
the linebackers again would come up and

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.950 
the linebackers again would come up and
make<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.770> left<00:03:02.040> call<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:03.090> will<00:03:03.330> backer<00:03:03.630> would

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
make a left call the will backer would

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.510 
make a left call the will backer would
not<00:03:04.110> change<00:03:04.410> his<00:03:04.590> in<00:03:04.710> alignment<00:03:04.950> he<00:03:05.220> would<00:03:05.370> be

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
not change his in alignment he would be

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.910 
not change his in alignment he would be
in<00:03:05.610> tan<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.690> Mike<00:03:06.930> backer<00:03:07.230> had<00:03:07.500> not<00:03:07.650> changed

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
in tan the Mike backer had not changed

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.770 
in tan the Mike backer had not changed
his<00:03:08.100> alignment<00:03:08.520> he'd<00:03:08.880> be<00:03:09.030> in<00:03:09.120> zero<00:03:09.390> lega

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
his alignment he'd be in zero lega

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.280 
his alignment he'd be in zero lega
center<00:03:10.400> however<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.580> Sam<00:03:11.880> backer<00:03:12.210> now<00:03:12.630> will

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
center however the Sam backer now will

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.770 
center however the Sam backer now will
move<00:03:13.500> into<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:13.950> stack<00:03:14.490> position<00:03:15.150> behind<00:03:15.360> the

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
move into a stack position behind the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.740 
move into a stack position behind the
defensive<00:03:16.470> end<00:03:16.850> because<00:03:17.850> again<00:03:18.239> essentially

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
defensive end because again essentially

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.390 
defensive end because again essentially
we're<00:03:19.110> saying<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.590> offense<00:03:20.010> has<00:03:20.160> shown

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
we're saying that the offense has shown

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.820 
we're saying that the offense has shown
us<00:03:20.580> where<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.910> eighth<00:03:21.060> gap<00:03:21.360> is<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:22.290> us<00:03:22.500> this<00:03:22.650> is

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
us where the eighth gap is to us this is

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.490 
us where the eighth gap is to us this is
like<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.070> split<00:03:23.610> flow<00:03:23.910> play<00:03:24.239> so<00:03:25.110> if<00:03:25.230> there<00:03:25.410> was

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
like a split flow play so if there was

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.710 
like a split flow play so if there was
any<00:03:25.680> action<00:03:26.340> that<00:03:26.520> came<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.239> Sam<00:03:27.450> backer

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
any action that came to the Sam backer

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.979 
any action that came to the Sam backer
side<00:03:28.140> he<00:03:29.070> would<00:03:29.190> immediately<00:03:29.520> be<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.420> fast

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
side he would immediately be a fast

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.130 
side he would immediately be a fast
player<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.830> D<00:03:32.040> gap<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.670> like<00:03:33.630> this<00:03:33.870> because

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
player to the D gap I like this because

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.680 
player to the D gap I like this because
again<00:03:34.770> I<00:03:35.310> don't<00:03:35.370> have<00:03:35.580> any<00:03:35.820> kind<00:03:36.060> of<00:03:36.150> changes

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
again I don't have any kind of changes

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.510 
again I don't have any kind of changes
from<00:03:36.810> my<00:03:36.989> linebackers<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.860> Mike<00:03:38.070> backer<00:03:38.340> on

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
from my linebackers to Mike backer on

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.120 
from my linebackers to Mike backer on
that<00:03:38.730> same<00:03:39.030> particular<00:03:39.390> action<00:03:40.020> a<00:03:40.110> weak<00:03:40.380> play

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
that same particular action a weak play

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.330 
that same particular action a weak play
would<00:03:41.790> go<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.300> fast<00:03:42.600> B<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:44.130> will

the three man side and you'll see that

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:48.939 
the three man side and you'll see that
the<00:06:46.519> fits<00:06:46.759> to<00:06:46.939> the<00:06:47.029> weak<00:06:47.209> side<00:06:47.589> become<00:06:48.589> exactly

the same with the Sam boxing and the

00:06:50.929 --> 00:06:56.709 
the same with the Sam boxing and the
Mike<00:06:51.139> coming<00:06:51.409> to<00:06:51.589> the<00:06:51.709> fast<00:06:51.949> be<00:06:55.629> in<00:06:56.629> this

00:06:58.989 --> 00:06:58.999 
particular case this guy's alignment

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:02.109 
particular case this guy's alignment
should<00:06:59.089> probably<00:06:59.449> be<00:06:59.689> a<00:06:59.719> step<00:07:00.110> wider<00:07:00.409> I<00:07:01.119> like

00:07:02.109 --> 00:07:02.119 
should probably be a step wider I like

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:04.029 
should probably be a step wider I like
where<00:07:02.329> the<00:07:02.449> Sam<00:07:02.959> backer<00:07:03.229> is<00:07:03.559> right<00:07:03.799> here

where the Sam backer is right here

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:06.609 
where the Sam backer is right here
though<00:07:04.389> they<00:07:05.389> really<00:07:05.659> stretched<00:07:06.229> their

though they really stretched their

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:08.509 
blocking scheme so your nose man really

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:10.659 
blocking scheme so your nose man really
should<00:07:08.659> become<00:07:08.929> involved<00:07:09.049> here<00:07:09.709> and<00:07:09.889> he<00:07:10.489> does

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:10.669 
should become involved here and he does

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:12.519 
should become involved here and he does
a<00:07:10.699> nice<00:07:10.969> job<00:07:10.999> of<00:07:11.329> flattening<00:07:11.869> getting<00:07:12.139> out<00:07:12.259> and

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:12.529 
a nice job of flattening getting out and

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:16.149 
a nice job of flattening getting out and

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:17.559 
the Mike backer to the football finally
we'll<00:07:16.309> take<00:07:16.489> a<00:07:16.519> look<00:07:16.849> at<00:07:16.939> the<00:07:17.029> adjustment

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:17.569 
we'll take a look at the adjustment
