a<00:00:00.089> bunch<00:00:00.960> of<00:00:01.079> wire<00:00:01.260> rings<00:00:01.560> for<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.370> long

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
a bunch of wire rings for the long

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.519 
a bunch of wire rings for the long
cleverly<00:00:03.060> woven<00:00:03.360> in<00:00:03.480> a<00:00:03.570> special<00:00:03.929> way<00:00:04.080> and<00:00:04.440> it's

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
cleverly woven in a special way and it's

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.190 
cleverly woven in a special way and it's
been<00:00:04.589> designed<00:00:04.770> by<00:00:05.100> dentistry<00:00:05.609> and<00:00:06.140> used<00:00:07.140> to

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
been designed by dentistry and used to

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.299 
been designed by dentistry and used to
work<00:00:07.350> with<00:00:07.379> back<00:00:07.560> mr.<00:00:07.859> fuller

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
work with back mr. fuller

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.610 
work with back mr. fuller
and<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:09.090> calls<00:00:09.330> it<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.510> ring<00:00:09.840> about<00:00:09.960> it

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
and you calls it a ring about it

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.499 
and you calls it a ring about it
opens<00:00:10.920> up<00:00:11.040> like<00:00:11.099> that<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.519> four<00:00:11.730> pieces<00:00:11.940> now

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
opens up like that the four pieces now

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.570 
opens up like that the four pieces now
let's<00:00:12.750> go<00:00:12.900> into<00:00:13.080> three<00:00:13.230> dimensions<00:00:13.710> each

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
let's go into three dimensions each

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.779 
let's go into three dimensions each
piece<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.059> have<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.420> tease<00:00:15.719> out<00:00:16.520> into<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> sort

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
piece you have to tease out into a sort

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.790 
piece you have to tease out into a sort
of<00:00:17.820> all<00:00:18.060> type<00:00:18.390> thing<00:00:18.660> end<00:00:19.199> up<00:00:19.350> with<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.560> very

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
of all type thing end up with a very

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.470 
of all type thing end up with a very
elegant<00:00:20.100> structure<00:00:21.830> consisting<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:23.480> four

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
elegant structure consisting of four

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.230 
elegant structure consisting of four
here<00:00:24.810> at<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.019> top<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:26.189> upside<00:00:26.519> down<00:00:26.760> four

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
here at the top and upside down four

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.759 
here at the top and upside down four
more<00:00:27.449> here<00:00:28.429> now<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.460> do<00:00:29.580> take<00:00:29.820> opposites

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
more here now I do take opposites

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.889 
more here now I do take opposites
circles<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.009> push<00:00:32.460> them<00:00:32.610> together<00:00:32.899> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
circles and push them together the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.229 
circles and push them together the
central<00:00:34.380> bit<00:00:34.500> dances<00:00:35.010> rather<00:00:35.340> like<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
central bit dances rather like the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.810 
central bit dances rather like the
jitterbug<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.899> Delos<00:00:37.200> designed<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:40.820> also

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
jitterbug that Delos designed I also

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.400 
jitterbug that Delos designed I also
found<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.480> central<00:00:42.840> space<00:00:43.050> which<00:00:43.290> is

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
found that the central space which is

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.020 
found that the central space which is
interesting<00:00:43.680> it's<00:00:44.520> filled<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:44.850> something

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
interesting it's filled with something

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.479 
interesting it's filled with something
rigid<00:00:45.329> let's<00:00:46.050> get<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> balloon<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:47.250> makes<00:00:47.430> a

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
rigid let's get a balloon it makes a

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:59.599 
rigid let's get a balloon it makes a
whole<00:00:47.610> structure<00:00:48.059> balance<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.780> bit<00:00:48.870> more<00:00:58.609> let's

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
whole structure balance a bit more let's

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.430 
whole structure balance a bit more let's
now<00:00:59.760> fill<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.270> space<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.989> center<00:01:01.260> with<00:01:01.379> a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
now fill the space in the center with a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:09.350 
now fill the space in the center with a
bit<00:01:01.590> more<00:01:01.739> tension<00:01:03.470> it<00:01:04.470> bounces<00:01:08.210> collapses<00:01:09.210> a

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
bit more tension it bounces collapses a

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:18.770 
bit more tension it bounces collapses a
bit<00:01:09.479> trickier<00:01:17.150> collapse<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.659> to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
bit trickier collapse this you have to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.960 
bit trickier collapse this you have to
start<00:01:19.049> with<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.409> four<00:01:21.890> pieces<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.130> top<00:01:23.340> this

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
start with the four pieces the top this

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.160 
start with the four pieces the top this
is<00:01:24.030> what<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.420> do<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.840> open

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
is what you have to do you have to open

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.620 
is what you have to do you have to open
up<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.290> little<00:01:25.909> slit<00:01:26.909> here<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.420> slit<00:01:27.600> here

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
up a little slit here and a slit here

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.719 
up a little slit here and a slit here
and<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.290> here<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.890> slit<00:01:29.130> here<00:01:29.159> four

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
and this is here and a slit here four

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:30.230 
and this is here and a slit here four
slits

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
slits

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.480 
slits
here<00:01:30.659> there<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.470> intervals<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.159> put<00:01:32.340> your

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
here there in intervals you put your

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.920 
here there in intervals you put your
fingers<00:01:32.820> one<00:01:33.390> two<00:01:34.820> three<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.210> some<00:01:36.450> four

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
fingers one two three and the some four

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.130 
fingers one two three and the some four
fingers<00:01:37.290> squeeze<00:01:38.159> them<00:01:38.310> together<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:39.570> then

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
fingers squeeze them together and then

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.179 
fingers squeeze them together and then
you<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.409> same<00:01:40.590> thing<00:01:40.740> with<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.920> bottom

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
you do the same thing with the bottom

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.560 
you do the same thing with the bottom
where<00:01:41.310> you've<00:01:41.400> got<00:01:41.490> four<00:01:41.759> slits<00:01:42.060> again<00:01:42.390> with<00:01:42.540> a

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570
