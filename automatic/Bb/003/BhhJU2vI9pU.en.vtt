00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.229
 tanks and reservoirs 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.140
 the reservoirs and tanks and the grace are extremely efficient versatile 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.190
 able to store food and drinking water instead 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.119
 lack chemical aggressiveness 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.160
 know our manufacturing line vertical and horizontal reservoirs 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.189
 its high mechanical resistance makes it possible to use as reactors with 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.550
 application of agitators hydraulic systems 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.059
 pressure vessel, cassis washer, vinasse cooling towers 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.590
 among others 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.290
 the reservoirs can be manufactured with a capacity of 200 to 500 thousand liters 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.610
 inter-island transport tanks live 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.050
 the company produces and supplies glass fiber tanks for various segments 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.600
 and load types 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.080
 especially the sugar and alcohol segment with more than two thousand and 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.710
 500 units delivered showing its superiority in the sector 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.530
 transport tanks for those who use 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.200
 in 1992 the company asked the really technical Swiss company 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.390
 the development of the transport tank to my home 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.380
 this project contemplated the optimization of the transportation capacity to high 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.700
 corrosion resistance and the low cost of maintenance by creating a 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.380
 progressive suspension for rough terrain 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.870
 transport tanks for hazardous products 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.390
 the letter after five years of research investment developed in conjunction with 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.770
 inmetro and technical commission the technical quality regulation that 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.920
 will regulate the construction of the transport tank for hazardous products in 15 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.850
 days of life 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.410
 showing the quality of its products environmental safety responsibility
