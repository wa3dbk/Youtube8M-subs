 [music] 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.910
 after a brief analysis still come back 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.129
 the main question what this will do 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.140
 a great expert on fighting asya on 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.090
 the territory of the enemy states to him in 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.440
 first the opposition will have a holiday 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.300
 since unlike his 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.250
 predecessor mcfola who loved 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.019
 talk to the Russian opposition then 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.390
 I didn't throw much money 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.060

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.720
 development of civil society 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.870
 American training manual 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.430
 here and in Ukraine back in 2012 he 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.530
 the text let out what was wrong 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.239
 funding from the state department which 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.220
 going on with it and already 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.440
 distributed I hope not 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.209
 funding this morning I change 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.609
 communicated by e-mail with my 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.350
 colleagues at the State Department discussing 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.910
 the possibility of obtaining additional 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.050
 grants for the development of civil 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.360
 society in Ukraine 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.010
 I hope that if the congress vote for 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.380
 allocation of aid from the budget to the next 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.270
 fiscal year is not yet approved we 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.400
 we can continue to provide this assistance 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.860
 because this is one of the basic facts 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.260
 development of democracy in Ukraine in the second 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.910
 john tefft with enviable regularity 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.889
 showed defiantly and inattention to 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.590
 laws in force in the country 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.020
 in which he is in so many arena 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.490
 he kept saying the need 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.500
 Immediately release Ms. Tymoshenko 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.110
 and other members of her former government 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.449
 how can you immediately release a person 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.759
 me 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.259
 which has been proven by the court and which 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:01.569
 was serving a sentence unequivocal and 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:03.520
 by sentence these test questions are never 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.680
 interested 1 st america said 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:10.389
 release means you need to immediately 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.089
 perform the third ones with particular trepidation 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.860
 refers to any manifestations 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:16.960
 non-standard sexual orientation so 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.819
 being the US ambassador to Ukraine pace 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.039
 constantly organized armor-piercing 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:23.050
 support for all sorts of promotions and 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.770
 gay parade we conducted by sexual 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.289
 minorities 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.509
 as the us ambassador in kiev, i would like 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.969
 express my support and my support 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:32.800
 countries to all who take part in the first 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:35.499
 project machine lesbians and gays and 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.499
 bisexual and transsexual Ukraine 20 

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:40.150
 May 12, I must sadly note that 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:41.229
 in many countries of the world members of the community 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.210
 lgbt 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.069
 continue to suffer from violence and 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.259
 discrimination prosecution for their 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:50.919
 sexual orientation or gender 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:52.539
 identity according to him as claimed 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.279
 US Secretary of State 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:59.860
 and at that time it was Hillary Clinton 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:06:01.960
 gay rights are not a human right 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.729
 working holiday apparently so the test 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.349
 decided to collect my embassy all 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:07.300
 friends are cold and as they say 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:09.189
 premature conclusions do not of course 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.199
 professional so far we have 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:13.120
 just watch his actions 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:15.159
 nonetheless looking back we 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.450
 we understand how not just this 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:26.830
 person 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:26.830
