00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:11.160
 with people welcome to technology 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.530
 teacher on this occasion we have a new 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.539
 that no longer shows advertising at first 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.849
 part is called skyline skater and it's about 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.369
 of a young man who is running on a skateboard 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.790
 throughout the city the game presents 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.060
 some graphics of very good quality and 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:33.150
 it really can be very entertaining 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:36.830
 It reminds me of an old and well-known game 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:42.360
 for android called software and software 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:45.450
 software software which would have a 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.420
 similar theme but this is much more 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.679
 entertaining 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.320
 we can see how to play is very 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:58.180
 simple 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:01.030
 and we should just jump the obstacles that 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.300
 yes it will not always be so easy and also if 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.450
 we collide we have a helicopter 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.000
 policeman right behind waiting for you 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.930
 crash twice to grab him by 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.320
 example 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.170
 there is a movie, for example, we can crash 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.750
 time and it shows up immediately and if 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.320
 we hit again we catch so 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.320
 works 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.300
 is what they present at the beginning and 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.550
 we can see here this is to tell these 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.620
 pigeons or birds also give us 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.620
 point as we will see later the place 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:39.270
 the good game do you manage to say no 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.270
 you can sell the video a lot but 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.100
 there as good shock almost on purpose 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.979
 for the helicopter to appear 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.020
 and that's what happens when we crash 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.440
 once and twice we got caught 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.990
 the game has 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.420
 many particularities that make it 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.950
 pretty entertaining for example we have 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.590
 to fight in a world league where 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.550
 everyone competes for a championship or 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.550
 trophies and awards 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.489
 and also that we can share everything with 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:19.209
 our facebook friends even if 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:22.420
 we do it gives us extra points for 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.939
 Daily example can not give a ticket 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.560
 to buy inside the escrow inside 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.700
 of the game 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:34.390
 here we see we have these metal bands 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:38.690
 as a professional skateboard 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.730
 skaters that skater skateboard as you 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.989
 tell in your country 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.209
 here we have to crash again and already 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.519
 we would stay one and we also have the 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.220
 address that we must dodge that is the 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.640
 Which is why it's so entertaining 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.580
 I only have one egg 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.680
 of 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.950
 days playing and the truth that quite 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.810
 entertained here we can see other 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.150
 actions of the game such as the league 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.690
 world and to participate we must 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:14.220
 first collect the 50 or 50 thousand 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.650
 coins or take out one of these skateboards 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.560
 What are they 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.180
 quite 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.920
 caritas can be obtained from another 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.040
 way for example the first here I 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.050
 says we can count on getting all 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.270
 the chips or the names that we 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.819
 appear as we could see the place 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:36.130
 we can get this skateboard that is the 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.130
 simpler or you'll wait to get 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:43.480
 to 50,000 coins of these which is the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:47.380
 play daily and there I have 10 in 10 thousand 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.349
 almost increased level this has fabric that 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.530
 I have but I need a skateboard of the 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:55.780
 more professionals of these to be able 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.640
 play in the league if we agree with 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.739
 facebook we can publish the 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.760
 record we make and all on facebook and 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.069
 they also give us a daily prize 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.420
 here we have the skateboards that we can 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:15.390
 buy if we have friends added 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.900
 we can see it right 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.870
 spout 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.040
 these are our friends characters 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.040
 they are in another section 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.729
 these are the characters that we can 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.729
 choose but 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.889
 here also it appears to us in the thing that 

00:04:33.149 --> 00:04:37.979
 we can buy depending on the currency 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.779
 that we have and until we get the 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.719
 50 thousand coins we must continue playing 

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:45.300
 here and collect all the letters 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:46.940
 right now I teach what are the letters 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.610
 that says 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.520
 with which we can acquire the skateboard 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.920
 without any cost it is easier than 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:59.100
 collect the 50,000 coins but 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.540
 not as easy as it seems since we can 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:06.250
 spend a coin 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:09.590
 a letter without knowing it since the game is 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:14.530
 it comes back quite fast after several 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.530
 several steps to the place several minutes 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.650
 even of state that is the letter the s 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.980
 the collections is down here this in 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.980
 the p 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.210
 I almost lose there there is a little 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.460
 good people this is a pretty game 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:37.120
 Free entertaining that can serve 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:39.460
 to get rid of those boring times 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.270
 I hope you have an excellent day and very 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.750
 good for life 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.750
 you
