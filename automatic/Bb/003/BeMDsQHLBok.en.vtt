00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.550
 the handball academy is a promising group with a selective group 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.670
 student in creative people work hard for nine months 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.670
 concept development strategy drug development 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.019
 the region tv is present we have all expats that is desperately needed shoulders 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.810
 the spokeswoman is the 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.599
 actually a selection 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.949
 the work that the students have made 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.759
 fifteen students this year 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.830
 they receive lessons from Saturday as a guest in the center 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.450
 that is behind me at least not in living bodies but the names and you 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.120
 you can from about 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.230
 25 assignment one in nine months 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.760
 without school holidays it was hard work 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.450
 and from that 25 the voters commission the best work and 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.880
 the best we fit their ambition 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.010
 French students but also come to advertising agencies and communication consultancy firms 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.700
 these are ultimately residents but also with the TV makers 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.710
 program makers 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.710
 cultural institutions such as the culture factory 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.110
 and that is what exhibitions show 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.740
 two promising student to tell about their projects the assignment was even 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.940
 animals and platforms digital platform the same for time 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.380
 8 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.320
 there are five members all over the world 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.159
 8 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.890
 what a pint of people it is without creating a language barrier 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.270
 and bliss watching pop music, there is something universal even if i don't 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.270
 likes or dislikes no you would rather not depend on language skills 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.640
 and they went looking then you can bind those people after among other things by the 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.090
 to ensure that people around the world can make something together 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.620
 8 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.150
 contest is of course known because they enter people with dance 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.450
 and that is well known for taking cd v out on kabul 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.220
 and I keep doing this this time 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.420
 make use of music very simple 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.420
 and what have come up specifically is an application 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.699
 and what is out again is the following 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:21.479
 very simple you come in a chat room you make your own band it is exactly out 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.139
 who you want is an instrument first 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:25.809
 for example the icc in the hague 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:29.059
 and you make the sequence of ten seconds 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.099
 fifteen times cup of maes and you basically have all and offers for example 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.400
 and what you do she then gets to work with people all over the world 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.519
 to make a number 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.719
 But that is actually exactly the same as we at home led to people 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:44.719
 bind with those people with music 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.829
 He has come up with an alternative to the glamor stiletto heels 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.149
 what do you have to keep 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:59.149
 I thought what could be nicer than 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.499
 a handbag is always with you 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:04.439
 and they hang above the canals 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.790
 and the idea was to make something easy that everyone can look at where 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.989
 everyone to participate 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.109
 and that it is nice and much in the hague 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.839
 dust blows up so I thought hanging jeans for women 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:18.429
 was going on hanging above a Amsterdam canal 

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:21.629
 hence you go to alternatives for the country for the smaller stiletto 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.009
 well i was thinking investors that there was growth for five years 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:28.939
 10 the first few times it's a joke 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.279
 and then a little bit the same 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:36.279
 so yes and there is also secretly asked the suitcase what new could come to 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:38.289
 sit but you know what we do then just there 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:39.629
 and that was open to us 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.829
 also got interested in training 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.879
 check wwd which game set the mood
