00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.569 
a wig out of the hair but a lot of
people<00:01:46.590> wanted<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.860> know<00:01:46.950> if<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.250> still

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
people wanted to know if I still

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.990 
people wanted to know if I still
recommended<00:01:48.890> buying<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.100> hair<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.549> yes<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.939> do

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
recommended buying the hair and yes I do

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.789 
recommended buying the hair and yes I do
recommend<00:01:51.540> buying<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.079> hair<00:01:52.259> because<00:01:52.590> it's

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
recommend buying the hair because it's

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.039 
recommend buying the hair because it's
very<00:01:52.950> manageable<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.820> very<00:01:54.030> soft<00:01:54.420> like<00:01:54.930> I

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
very manageable it's very soft like I

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.630 
very manageable it's very soft like I
said<00:01:55.259> before<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.950> only<00:01:56.130> thing<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.490> that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
said before but the only thing is that

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.880 
said before but the only thing is that
it<00:01:57.030> sheds<00:01:57.390> now<00:01:57.869> I'm<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.140> sure<00:01:58.380> if<00:01:58.500> every

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
it sheds now I'm not sure if every

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.880 
it sheds now I'm not sure if every
texture<00:01:59.490> will<00:01:59.729> shed<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> Peruvian<00:02:01.680> hair

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
texture will shed but the Peruvian hair

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.410 
texture will shed but the Peruvian hair
is<00:02:02.070> very<00:02:02.130> very<00:02:02.399> very<00:02:02.700> fine

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
is very very very fine

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.520 
is very very very fine
so<00:02:03.810> I'm<00:02:04.229> thinking<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.890> at<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.219> factory<00:02:05.670> when

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
so I'm thinking that at the factory when

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.270 
so I'm thinking that at the factory when
sewing<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.740> weft<00:02:07.950> together<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
sewing the weft together that the

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.600 
sewing the weft together that the
strands<00:02:09.550> of<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.140> Peruvian<00:02:11.140> hair<00:02:11.319> is<00:02:11.500> so<00:02:11.800> thin

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
strands of the Peruvian hair is so thin

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.500 
strands of the Peruvian hair is so thin
and<00:02:12.850> so<00:02:13.060> fine<00:02:13.420> that<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:14.650> cannot<00:02:15.610> grab<00:02:16.060> every

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
and so fine that it cannot grab every

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.710 
and so fine that it cannot grab every
single<00:02:16.540> hair<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:17.680> that's<00:02:17.890> probably<00:02:18.160> why<00:02:18.720> they

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
single hair so that's probably why they

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.350 
single hair so that's probably why they
would<00:02:19.870> recommend<00:02:20.410> sealing<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.400> weft<00:02:21.610> so<00:02:22.060> I

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
would recommend sealing the weft so I

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.150 
would recommend sealing the weft so I
would<00:02:23.230> say<00:02:23.410> that<00:02:23.590> if<00:02:23.709> you<00:02:23.800> do<00:02:23.950> buy<00:02:24.100> the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
the third week I kind of started

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.710 
the third week I kind of started
noticing<00:03:26.739> it<00:03:27.160> was<00:03:27.579> shedding<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:28.150> I<00:03:28.239> thought

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
noticing it was shedding and I thought

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.449 
noticing it was shedding and I thought
maybe<00:03:28.959> it<00:03:29.200> was<00:03:29.290> because<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.829> was<00:03:29.980> keeping<00:03:30.160> it<00:03:30.370> in

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
maybe it was because I was keeping it in

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.170 
maybe it was because I was keeping it in
a<00:03:30.519> in<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.060> bun<00:03:31.299> like<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:32.019> entire<00:03:32.320> leaf<00:03:32.560> but<00:03:33.220> it

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
a in a bun like the entire leaf but it

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.520 
a in a bun like the entire leaf but it
was<00:03:34.360> just<00:03:34.570> too<00:03:34.660> much<00:03:34.780> reading<00:03:34.989> for<00:03:35.230> me<00:03:35.350> so<00:03:35.440> I'm
