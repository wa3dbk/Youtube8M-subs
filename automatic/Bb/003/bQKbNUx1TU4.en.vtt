no joke as well it creates separation is

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.070 
no joke as well it creates separation is
across<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.620> field<00:02:58.420> but<00:02:59.420> really<00:02:59.750> that's

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
across the field but really that's

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.180 
across the field but really that's
something<00:03:00.500> you're<00:03:00.590> really<00:03:00.620> going<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:00.890> throw

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
something you're really going to throw

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.430 
something you're really going to throw
if<00:03:01.489> they're<00:03:01.880> paying<00:03:02.239> crazy<00:03:02.750> attention<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.350> the

if they're paying crazy attention to the
outside<00:03:03.739> receivers<00:03:04.569> it<00:03:05.569> also<00:03:05.720> gets<00:03:06.680> open

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
outside receivers it also gets open

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.850 
outside receivers it also gets open
relative<00:03:07.459> to<00:03:07.819> where<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.900> defender<00:03:09.410> is<00:03:09.590> if

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
relative to where the defender is if

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.699 
relative to where the defender is if
they're<00:03:10.100> playing<00:03:10.250> over<00:03:10.700> him<00:03:10.850> or<00:03:11.000> outside<00:03:11.420> him

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
they're playing over him or outside him

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.500 
they're playing over him or outside him
like<00:03:12.709> saying<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.130> diamond<00:03:13.489> formation<00:03:13.820> then

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
like saying a diamond formation then

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
like saying a diamond formation then
that's<00:03:14.720> where<00:03:14.900> you're<00:03:14.989> gonna<00:03:15.049> see<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.350> best

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
that's where you're gonna see the best

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.350 
that's where you're gonna see the best
separation<00:03:16.100> is<00:03:16.250> when<00:03:16.400> they<00:03:16.549> cross<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.180> field

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
separation is when they cross the field

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.690 
separation is when they cross the field
otherwise<00:03:18.260> you're<00:03:18.650> going<00:03:18.739> to<00:03:18.829> go<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.040> Forte

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
otherwise you're going to go to Forte

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.270 
otherwise you're going to go to Forte
Forte's<00:03:20.570> route<00:03:20.870> is<00:03:21.109> that<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.470> layer<00:03:21.650> out<00:03:21.859> but

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
Forte's route is that the layer out but

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.039 
Forte's route is that the layer out but
you'll<00:03:22.430> notice<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:22.790> it<00:03:23.030> does<00:03:23.269> not<00:03:23.299> wait<00:03:23.900> at

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
you'll notice that it does not wait at

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.720 
you'll notice that it does not wait at
all<00:03:24.200> we<00:03:24.620> snap<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.070> ball<00:03:25.190> and<00:03:25.400> Forte

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
all we snap the ball and Forte

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.620 
all we snap the ball and Forte
automatically<00:03:26.239> just<00:03:26.420> runs<00:03:26.630> his<00:03:26.810> route<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.970> his

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
automatically just runs his route so his

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.920 
automatically just runs his route so his
route<00:03:29.930> gets<00:03:30.620> pretty<00:03:30.950> good<00:03:31.329> separation<00:03:32.329> and<00:03:32.780> if

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
route gets pretty good separation and if

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.210 
route gets pretty good separation and if
they're<00:03:33.079> running<00:03:33.200> zone<00:03:33.620> that's<00:03:33.920> something

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
they're running zone that's something

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.780 
they're running zone that's something
that<00:03:34.250> you<00:03:34.459> can<00:03:34.609> throw<00:03:34.820> as<00:03:35.000> well<00:03:36.670> you'll<00:03:37.670> just

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
that you can throw as well you'll just

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.090 
that you can throw as well you'll just
notice<00:03:38.000> how<00:03:38.260> Forte's<00:03:39.260> route<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:39.769> can<00:03:39.920> hike

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
notice how Forte's route you can hike

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.440 
notice how Forte's route you can hike
throw<00:03:40.370> it<00:03:40.489> out<00:03:40.579> of<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:40.700> backfield<00:03:40.880> and<00:03:41.269> pick

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
throw it out of the backfield and pick

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.630 
throw it out of the backfield and pick
up<00:03:41.570> the<00:03:41.660> guards<00:03:41.900> underneath<00:03:42.260> against<00:03:42.590> zone<00:03:42.799> so

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
up the guards underneath against zone so

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.390 
up the guards underneath against zone so
that's<00:03:44.150> something<00:03:44.359> that<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:44.660> can<00:03:44.840> really

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
that's something that you can really

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.250 
that's something that you can really
cause<00:03:46.400> havoc<00:03:46.850> with<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.299> then<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.810> last<00:03:47.989> round

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
cause havoc with and then the last round

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.990 
cause havoc with and then the last round
we're<00:03:48.380> going<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.560> show<00:03:48.680> is<00:03:48.859> Jeffrey's<00:03:49.730> it

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
we're going to show is Jeffrey's it
