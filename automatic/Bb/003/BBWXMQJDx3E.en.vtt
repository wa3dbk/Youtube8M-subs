this open end is opening up top note
that<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.269> numbers<00:00:27.570> are<00:00:27.720> actually<00:00:27.779> running

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
that the numbers are actually running

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.890 
that the numbers are actually running
upside<00:00:28.680> down<00:00:28.890> now<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.179> may<00:00:30.300> actually<00:00:30.480> seem

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
upside down now this may actually seem

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.440 
upside down now this may actually seem
very<00:00:31.080> baffling<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.040> until<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.090> realize

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
very baffling to you until you realize

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.750 
very baffling to you until you realize
of<00:00:33.480> course<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.290> uni<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.980> when<00:00:35.280> gases

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
of course that a uni on that when gases

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.639 
of course that a uni on that when gases
are<00:00:35.880> being<00:00:35.969> produced<00:00:36.420> they<00:00:37.050> will<00:00:37.170> push<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
are being produced they will push the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.290 
are being produced they will push the
water<00:00:37.829> out<00:00:38.160> because<00:00:38.640> what<00:00:38.940> happens<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.270> that

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
water out because what happens is that

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.020 
water out because what happens is that
you<00:00:39.540> diameter<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.469> actually<00:00:40.860> set<00:00:41.040> up<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.790> one

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
you diameter is actually set up this one

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.260 
you diameter is actually set up this one
so<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:42.989> set<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.260> with<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.590> closed<00:00:43.920> end

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
so it is set up with the closed end

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.270 
so it is set up with the closed end
pointing<00:00:45.270> up<00:00:45.539> now<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.410> see<00:00:46.710> very<00:00:46.739> strange

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
pointing up now that I see very strange

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.549 
pointing up now that I see very strange
I<00:00:47.670> told<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.059> remember<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.510> fact<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.350> get

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
I told you remember the fact that to get

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.380 
I told you remember the fact that to get
that<00:00:49.770> what<00:00:50.280> happens<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.180> when<00:00:51.360> a

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
that what happens is that when a

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.920 
that what happens is that when a
reaction<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.440> produces<00:00:52.559> gas<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.399> being<00:00:53.579> done

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
reaction that produces gas is being done

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.990 
reaction that produces gas is being done
the<00:00:54.930> Union<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.590> gets<00:00:55.860> was<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.399> push<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
the Union that gets was you push the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.349 
the Union that gets was you push the
water<00:00:57.210> out<00:00:57.390> as<00:00:57.980> they<00:00:58.980> expand<00:00:59.520> because<00:00:59.850> due<00:01:00.270> to

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
water out as they expand because due to

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.540 
water out as they expand because due to
the<00:01:00.420> pressure<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.870> gases<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:02.039> will<00:01:02.160> push<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the pressure of gases it will push the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.119 
the pressure of gases it will push the
water<00:01:02.879> out<00:01:03.030> with<00:01:03.660> one<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.559> when<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.860> water

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
water out with one and when that water

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.789 
water out with one and when that water
being<00:01:05.369> pushed<00:01:05.670> out<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.240> gas<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.380> bottom<00:01:07.740> of

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
being pushed out the gas the bottom of

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.410 
being pushed out the gas the bottom of
the<00:01:07.890> Gatsby<00:01:08.250> renews<00:01:08.549> can<00:01:08.729> actually<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.119> read

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the Gatsby renews can actually be read

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.810 
the Gatsby renews can actually be read
with<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.080> numbers<00:01:10.380> here<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> certain

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
with the numbers here to a certain

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.920 
with the numbers here to a certain
degree<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> certain<00:01:12.540> degree<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.780> precision

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
degree to a certain degree of precision

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.670 
degree to a certain degree of precision
obviously<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.479> here<00:01:15.479> we<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.869> see<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.530> can

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
obviously so here we can see that we can

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.499 
obviously so here we can see that we can
therefore<00:01:16.890> see<00:01:17.280> how<00:01:17.729> much<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.150> volume<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.479> gas

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
therefore see how much the volume of gas

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.999 
therefore see how much the volume of gas
has<00:01:18.869> actually<00:01:19.259> been<00:01:19.350> produced<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
has actually been produced in the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.880 
has actually been produced in the
reaction<00:01:20.570> furthermore<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:22.350> also<00:01:22.380> want<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:22.860> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
reaction furthermore we also want have a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.770 
reaction furthermore we also want have a
cap<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> bottom<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.450> liquid

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
cap on the bottom so that the liquid

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.109 
cap on the bottom so that the liquid
doesn't<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.140> drain<00:01:25.470> out<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> tube<00:01:26.369> as<00:01:27.030> well

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
doesn't is drain out of the tube as well

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:27.649 
doesn't is drain out of the tube as well
see<00:01:27.270> shortly

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
see shortly

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.620 
see shortly
so<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.710> UD<00:01:29.070> under<00:01:29.430> we<00:01:29.610> look<00:01:29.790> now<00:01:30.060> we've<00:01:30.360> put

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
so this UD under we look now we've put

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.319 
so this UD under we look now we've put
on<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> cure<00:01:31.470> X<00:01:31.680> lamp<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.310> although<00:01:33.090> it's

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
on to a cure X lamp and although it's

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.179 
on to a cure X lamp and although it's
really<00:01:33.390> used<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.439> hold<00:01:34.650> your<00:01:34.890> rights<00:01:35.070> you

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
really used to to hold your rights you

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.230 
really used to to hold your rights you
could<00:01:35.310> really<00:01:35.430> use<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:35.820> hold<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.060> lot<00:01:36.210> of

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
could really use it on hold a lot of

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.600 
could really use it on hold a lot of
things<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.780> also<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.799> burek<00:01:38.070> lamp<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.369> also

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
things and also the burek lamp is also

such as hydrochloric acid and what

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.809 
such as hydrochloric acid and what
happens<00:02:23.019> is<00:02:23.079> that<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.319> hydrochloric<00:02:23.920> acid<00:02:24.340> we

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
happens is that the hydrochloric acid we

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.910 
happens is that the hydrochloric acid we
cannot<00:02:25.269> react<00:02:25.689> with<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.290> copper<00:02:26.530> on<00:02:26.769> this

cannot react with the copper on this

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.410 
cannot react with the copper on this
wire<00:02:27.129> but<00:02:27.849> it<00:02:28.269> can<00:02:28.659> react<00:02:29.109> with<00:02:29.879> the<00:02:30.879> compounds

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.030 
wire but it can react with the compounds
that<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.569> can<00:02:31.810> put<00:02:32.019> into<00:02:32.319> the<00:02:32.560> copper<00:02:32.769> wire

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
that you can put into the copper wire

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.559 
that you can put into the copper wire
that<00:02:33.220> is<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.579> can<00:02:33.730> actually<00:02:33.879> make<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.150> cage

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
that is you can actually make a cage

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.809 
that is you can actually make a cage
around<00:02:34.959> a<00:02:35.709> concern<00:02:36.069> compound<00:02:36.579> that<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:36.730> would

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
around a concern compound that you would

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.360 
around a concern compound that you would
react<00:02:37.150> such<00:02:37.389> as<00:02:37.510> magnesium<00:02:37.870> or<00:02:38.230> zinc<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:39.220> you

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
react such as magnesium or zinc and you

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.580 
react such as magnesium or zinc and you
can<00:02:39.549> wrap<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.239> copper<00:02:40.480> wire<00:02:40.810> around<00:02:41.019> it<00:02:41.349> and

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
can wrap the copper wire around it and

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.229 
can wrap the copper wire around it and
therefore<00:02:42.219> you'll<00:02:42.609> be<00:02:42.700> able<00:02:42.819> to<00:02:43.030> stay<00:02:43.209> in

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
therefore you'll be able to stay in

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.470 
therefore you'll be able to stay in
place<00:02:43.480> while<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.709> have<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.609> react<00:02:45.970> with

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
place while you have it react with

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.259 
place while you have it react with
hydrochloric<00:02:46.870> acid<00:02:47.439> and<00:02:47.590> so<00:02:48.519> that<00:02:48.849> reaction

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
hydrochloric acid and so that reaction

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.020 
hydrochloric acid and so that reaction
we<00:02:49.510> know<00:02:49.659> produces<00:02:50.200> hydrogen<00:02:50.530> gas<00:02:50.769> and<00:02:51.069> a<00:02:51.609> salt

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
we know produces hydrogen gas and a salt

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.879 
we know produces hydrogen gas and a salt
namely<00:02:52.540> introduces<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:53.260> chloride<00:02:53.709> or

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
namely introduces the chloride or

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.229 
namely introduces the chloride or
magnesium<00:02:54.159> point<00:02:54.730> depending<00:02:54.970> what<00:02:55.090> you're

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
magnesium point depending what you're

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.240 
magnesium point depending what you're
using<00:02:55.450> so<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:56.349> is<00:02:56.500> used<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.829> actually<00:02:57.069> grab

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
using so this is used to actually grab

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.679 
using so this is used to actually grab
your<00:02:57.400> metal<00:02:57.639> around<00:02:57.849> so<00:02:58.000> that<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.269> will<00:02:58.389> react

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
your metal around so that it will react

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.199 
your metal around so that it will react
while<00:02:59.109> providing<00:02:59.470> an<00:02:59.709> inert<00:03:00.040> compound<00:03:00.790> that

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
while providing an inert compound that

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.780 
while providing an inert compound that
won't<00:03:01.510> react<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.109> therefore<00:03:02.639> make<00:03:03.639> your

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
won't react and therefore make your

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.619 
won't react and therefore make your
results<00:03:04.359> have<00:03:04.689> confounding<00:03:05.230> factors<00:03:05.739> so

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
results have confounding factors so

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.460 
results have confounding factors so
right<00:03:07.629> here<00:03:07.900> we're<00:03:08.079> just<00:03:08.200> going<00:03:08.349> to<00:03:08.379> assume

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
right here we're just going to assume

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.039 
right here we're just going to assume
that<00:03:08.739> this<00:03:09.159> tangled<00:03:09.790> end<00:03:10.030> is<00:03:10.269> actually<00:03:10.750> has

am<00:03:24.489> using<00:03:24.669> here<00:03:24.849> is<00:03:25.269> that<00:03:25.389> obviously<00:03:25.870> not<00:03:26.019> a

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
am using here is that obviously not a

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.539 
am using here is that obviously not a
nasty<00:03:26.500> because<00:03:26.680> there's<00:03:26.829> a<00:03:26.919> solid<00:03:27.220> line<00:03:27.340> but

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
nasty because there's a solid line but

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.430 
nasty because there's a solid line but
that's<00:03:27.760> sodium<00:03:28.000> quorum<00:03:28.540> but<00:03:28.989> what<00:03:29.169> you<00:03:29.260> want

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
that's sodium quorum but what you want

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.770 
that's sodium quorum but what you want
but<00:03:29.590> notice<00:03:30.519> that<00:03:30.669> because<00:03:31.060> of<00:03:31.389> the<00:03:31.449> salt<00:03:31.690> on

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
but notice that because of the salt on

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.210 
but notice that because of the salt on
the<00:03:31.870> bottom<00:03:32.169> of<00:03:32.199> the<00:03:32.349> solution<00:03:32.799> this<00:03:32.919> is<00:03:32.979> a<00:03:33.069> cue

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
the bottom of the solution this is a cue

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.339 
the bottom of the solution this is a cue
very<00:03:33.370> saturated<00:03:33.609> solutions<00:03:34.239> concentrate<00:03:34.810> the

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
very saturated solutions concentrate the

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.439 
very saturated solutions concentrate the
same<00:03:35.590> thing<00:03:35.739> with<00:03:35.859> your<00:03:35.979> acids<00:03:36.400> it<00:03:36.790> also<00:03:37.209> in

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:37.449 
same thing with your acids it also in

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.990 
same thing with your acids it also in
most<00:03:37.750> cases<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:39.190> will<00:03:39.340> be<00:03:39.400> using<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:39.849> very

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
most cases you will be using a very

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.949 
most cases you will be using a very
concentrated<00:03:40.599> acid<00:03:41.379> to<00:03:41.859> do<00:03:42.129> this<00:03:42.549> lab<00:03:42.849> and<00:03:43.209> you

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
concentrated acid to do this lab and you

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.899 
concentrated acid to do this lab and you
do<00:03:44.319> not<00:03:44.590> want<00:03:45.069> to<00:03:45.129> spill<00:03:45.370> its<00:03:45.519> acid<00:03:45.819> on

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
do not want to spill its acid on

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.180 
do not want to spill its acid on
yourself<00:03:46.209> so<00:03:46.449> what<00:03:46.569> you<00:03:46.659> want<00:03:46.810> to<00:03:46.870> do<00:03:47.019> is<00:03:48.010> that

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
yourself so what you want to do is that

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.670 
yourself so what you want to do is that
you<00:03:48.310> want<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.489> get<00:03:48.669> a<00:03:48.879> trusty<00:03:49.569> funnel<00:03:49.900> you<00:03:50.530> want

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
you want to get a trusty funnel you want

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.170 
you want to get a trusty funnel you want
to<00:03:50.739> put<00:03:50.889> it<00:03:50.979> on<00:03:51.129> the<00:03:51.340> top<00:03:51.519> of<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:51.699> geography

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
to put it on the top of the geography

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.210 
to put it on the top of the geography
and<00:03:52.419> you<00:03:53.169> want<00:03:53.379> to<00:03:53.440> feel<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.650> unity<00:03:53.829> under<00:03:53.979> to

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
and you want to feel the unity under to

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.059 
and you want to feel the unity under to
about<00:03:54.459> fifth<00:03:54.909> so<00:03:55.120> about<00:03:55.359> to<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.659> 10<00:03:56.260> or<00:03:56.829> maybe

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
about fifth so about to the 10 or maybe

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.250 
about fifth so about to the 10 or maybe
even<00:03:57.189> the<00:03:57.430> 12<00:03:57.699> if<00:03:58.000> you<00:03:58.060> want<00:03:58.419> to<00:03:58.540> if<00:03:59.049> I<00:03:59.109> learn

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
even the 12 if you want to if I learn

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.360 
even the 12 if you want to if I learn
how<00:03:59.290> much<00:03:59.470> as<00:03:59.620> if<00:03:59.769> you<00:03:59.859> wish<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:00.159> but<00:04:00.310> you

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
how much as if you wish to you but you

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.219 
how much as if you wish to you but you
don't<00:04:00.549> fill<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:00.879> up<00:04:00.970> more<00:04:01.419> than<00:04:01.629> more<00:04:02.199> than

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:02.229 
don't fill it up more than more than

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:03.449 
don't fill it up more than more than
halfway<00:04:02.530> you<00:04:02.709> only<00:04:02.859> want<00:04:03.040> to<00:04:03.069> throw<00:04:03.189> that<00:04:03.340> but

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
halfway you only want to throw that but

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.119 
halfway you only want to throw that but
fill<00:04:03.790> it<00:04:03.879> up<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.120> about<00:04:04.209> a<00:04:04.299> quarter<00:04:04.739> so<00:04:05.739> it

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
fill it up to about a quarter so it

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.140 
fill it up to about a quarter so it
supports<00:04:06.250> in

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
supports in

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.630 
supports in
you<00:04:09.140> can<00:04:09.260> care<00:04:09.470> not<00:04:09.769> to<00:04:09.799> spill<00:04:10.159> the<00:04:10.280> acid<00:04:10.730> and

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
you can care not to spill the acid and

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.710 
you can care not to spill the acid and
there<00:04:13.640> are<00:04:13.730> burgers<00:04:13.970> that<00:04:14.000> spill<00:04:14.299> be<00:04:14.480> sure

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
there are burgers that spill be sure

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.999 
there are burgers that spill be sure
that<00:04:14.870> you<00:04:14.959> hadn't<00:04:15.170> studied<00:04:15.319> bicarbonate

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:16.009 
that you hadn't studied bicarbonate

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:17.890 
that you hadn't studied bicarbonate
around<00:04:16.430> to<00:04:16.850> clean<00:04:17.030> it<00:04:17.150> out<00:04:17.209> so<00:04:17.479> this<00:04:17.600> is<00:04:17.660> about

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
around to clean it out so this is about

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.400 
around to clean it out so this is about
amount<00:04:18.380> about<00:04:18.709> how<00:04:18.859> much<00:04:19.009> you<00:04:19.100> want<00:04:20.289> and<00:04:21.289> then

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
amount about how much you want and then

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.010 
amount about how much you want and then
for<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.590> rest<00:04:21.769> of<00:04:21.859> it<00:04:22.509> now<00:04:23.509> this<00:04:23.660> may<00:04:23.840> actually

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
for the rest of it now this may actually

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.320 
for the rest of it now this may actually
seem<00:04:24.380> counterintuitive<00:04:25.340> but<00:04:25.850> you<00:04:26.000> actually

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
seem counterintuitive but you actually

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.909 
seem counterintuitive but you actually
want<00:04:26.479> to<00:04:26.539> pour<00:04:26.810> in<00:04:27.020> and<00:04:27.289> fill<00:04:27.440> up<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.590> rest<00:04:27.770> of

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
want to pour in and fill up the rest of

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.159 
want to pour in and fill up the rest of
the<00:04:27.979> udl<00:04:28.310> river<00:04:28.520> with<00:04:28.729> water<00:04:29.060> now<00:04:29.840> here<00:04:30.080> I'm

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
the udl river with water now here I'm

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.570 
the udl river with water now here I'm
just<00:04:30.259> using<00:04:30.380> tap<00:04:30.740> water<00:04:30.770> but<00:04:31.190> in<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.370> real

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
just using tap water but in the real

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.550 
just using tap water but in the real
that<00:04:32.210> in<00:04:32.360> the<00:04:32.479> real<00:04:32.690> lab<00:04:32.930> you'd<00:04:33.110> want<00:04:33.320> to<00:04:33.380> use

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
that in the real lab you'd want to use

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.469 
that in the real lab you'd want to use
distilled<00:04:34.220> water<00:04:34.460> as<00:04:34.759> pure<00:04:35.000> water<00:04:35.180> as<00:04:35.270> you<00:04:35.360> can

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
distilled water as pure water as you can

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.080 
distilled water as pure water as you can
get<00:04:35.690> and<00:04:36.650> I<00:04:37.220> don't<00:04:37.280> want<00:04:37.460> to<00:04:37.520> flip<00:04:37.729> close<00:04:38.000> to

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
get and I don't want to flip close to

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.439 
get and I don't want to flip close to
the<00:04:38.150> top<00:04:41.620> so<00:04:42.620> now<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.460> question<00:04:43.760> maybe<00:04:44.180> come

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
the top so now the question maybe come

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.460 
the top so now the question maybe come
and<00:04:44.479> I'll<00:04:44.660> just<00:04:44.780> chop<00:04:45.169> it<00:04:45.289> off<00:04:47.380> now<00:04:48.380> the

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
and I'll just chop it off now the

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.080 
and I'll just chop it off now the
coarser<00:04:48.710> mikanos<00:04:49.070> why<00:04:49.400> is<00:04:49.460> it<00:04:49.699> that<00:04:49.789> I<00:04:49.850> did

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
coarser mikanos why is it that I did

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.629 
coarser mikanos why is it that I did
that<00:04:50.270> well<00:04:50.720> remember<00:04:51.410> that<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:52.010> solution<00:04:52.580> is

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
that well remember that the solution is

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.400 
that well remember that the solution is
made<00:04:52.820> because<00:04:53.270> we<00:04:53.479> actually<00:04:53.660> is<00:04:53.990> made<00:04:54.199> very

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
made because we actually is made very

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.890 
made because we actually is made very
quickly<00:04:54.650> now<00:04:55.039> in<00:04:55.280> reality<00:04:55.520> reality<00:04:55.970> if<00:04:56.510> you

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
quickly now in reality reality if you

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.779 
quickly now in reality reality if you
left<00:04:57.169> us<00:04:57.289> if<00:04:57.500> you<00:04:57.590> just<00:04:57.800> pour<00:04:58.100> sodium<00:04:58.460> chloride

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
left us if you just pour sodium chloride

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.550 
left us if you just pour sodium chloride
into<00:04:58.910> water<00:04:59.240> and<00:04:59.479> you<00:04:59.599> didn't<00:04:59.900> mix<00:05:00.050> it<00:05:00.199> or<00:05:00.289> stir

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
into water and you didn't mix it or stir

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.170 
into water and you didn't mix it or stir
it<00:05:00.680> or<00:05:00.770> anything<00:05:00.979> it<00:05:01.639> would<00:05:01.760> take<00:05:01.880> a<00:05:01.910> very<00:05:01.970> long

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
it or anything it would take a very long

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
traveled bottom yet but we will see

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.300 
traveled bottom yet but we will see
shortly<00:05:53.539> how<00:05:53.990> exactly<00:05:54.590> this<00:05:54.710> will<00:05:54.860> work

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
shortly how exactly this will work

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.550 
shortly how exactly this will work
so<00:05:55.580> I<00:05:55.639> cap<00:05:55.880> it<00:05:56.090> and<00:05:56.270> then<00:05:56.930> I<00:05:57.080> have<00:05:57.199> an<00:05:57.289> assistant

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
so I cap it and then I have an assistant

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.560 
so I cap it and then I have an assistant

you'll<00:06:37.340> notice<00:06:37.610> that<00:06:37.760> the<00:06:37.910> salt<00:06:38.180> is<00:06:38.270> actually

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:38.420 
you'll notice that the salt is actually

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.390 
you'll notice that the salt is actually
traveling<00:06:38.780> down<00:06:39.170> and<00:06:39.470> when<00:06:39.890> it<00:06:39.920> actually<00:06:40.280> gets

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
traveling down and when it actually gets

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.220 
traveling down and when it actually gets
to<00:06:40.430> the<00:06:40.520> bottom<00:06:40.850> as<00:06:40.970> it<00:06:41.120> already<00:06:41.270> has<00:06:41.600> it<00:06:42.080> will

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:42.230 
to the bottom as it already has it will

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.320 
to the bottom as it already has it will
immediately<00:06:42.590> begin<00:06:43.100> to<00:06:43.160> react<00:06:43.550> with<00:06:43.910> whatever

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330 
immediately begin to react with whatever

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.270 
immediately begin to react with whatever
metal<00:06:44.600> you<00:06:44.660> can<00:06:44.750> put<00:06:44.960> in<00:06:45.080> there<00:06:45.290> and<00:06:45.470> therefore

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
metal you can put in there and therefore

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.520 
metal you can put in there and therefore
the<00:06:46.640> gas<00:06:46.850> will<00:06:47.090> be<00:06:47.120> produced<00:06:47.210> and<00:06:47.780> the<00:06:48.290> water

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
the gas will be produced and the water

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.290 
the gas will be produced and the water
will<00:06:48.710> the<00:06:48.890> water<00:06:49.130> and<00:06:49.400> the<00:06:49.520> solution<00:06:49.940> we<00:06:50.060> push

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300 
will the water and the solution we push

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.390 
will the water and the solution we push
down<00:06:50.330> the<00:06:50.600> two<00:06:50.810> now<00:06:51.440> you<00:06:51.500> want<00:06:51.890> to<00:06:51.950> be<00:06:52.100> by<00:06:52.340> this

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 
down the two now you want to be by this

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.250 
down the two now you want to be by this
at<00:06:52.640> all<00:06:52.760> time<00:06:53.060> do<00:06:53.330> to<00:06:53.510> make<00:06:53.660> sure<00:06:53.690> that<00:06:54.110> the

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:54.260 
at all time do to make sure that the

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.470 
at all time do to make sure that the
pressure<00:06:54.470> of<00:06:54.710> the<00:06:54.800> gas<00:06:54.980> is<00:06:55.310> not<00:06:55.790> too<00:06:55.970> great<00:06:56.120> and

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:56.480 
pressure of the gas is not too great and

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.660 
pressure of the gas is not too great and
the<00:06:56.810> real<00:06:56.990> lab<00:06:57.200> you'll<00:06:57.410> see<00:06:57.590> you'll<00:06:58.040> see<00:06:58.100> a<00:06:58.310> lot

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:58.670 
the real lab you'll see you'll see a lot

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.000 
the real lab you'll see you'll see a lot
of<00:06:58.700> Bovie<00:06:59.210> produced<00:06:59.600> as<00:06:59.810> one<00:07:00.050> as<00:07:00.260> the<00:07:00.440> gas

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.010 
of Bovie produced as one as the gas

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.100 
of Bovie produced as one as the gas
produced<00:07:01.400> in<00:07:01.580> front<00:07:01.820> of<00:07:01.940> the<00:07:02.000> water<00:07:02.210> and<00:07:02.540> then

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
produced in front of the water and then

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.110 
produced in front of the water and then
you'll<00:07:03.320> see<00:07:03.560> a<00:07:03.590> space<00:07:03.950> we<00:07:04.460> can<00:07:04.640> perform<00:07:04.760> the

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 
you'll see a space we can perform the

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.210 
you'll see a space we can perform the
top<00:07:05.300> now<00:07:05.480> it<00:07:05.600> will<00:07:05.720> begin<00:07:05.870> very<00:07:06.560> quickly<00:07:06.950> at

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.220 
top now it will begin very quickly at

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.160 
top now it will begin very quickly at
first<00:07:07.550> but<00:07:08.090> later<00:07:08.240> on<00:07:08.510> it<00:07:08.750> would<00:07:08.840> eventually

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.170 
first but later on it would eventually

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.280 
first but later on it would eventually
become<00:07:10.040> less<00:07:11.030> and<00:07:11.330> less<00:07:11.390> it<00:07:11.660> will<00:07:11.750> become<00:07:12.020> less

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.290 
become less and less it will become less

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.110 
become less and less it will become less
and<00:07:12.500> less<00:07:12.560> it<00:07:13.070> would<00:07:13.250> be<00:07:13.370> warm<00:07:13.640> because<00:07:13.790> of<00:07:13.970> the

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 
and less it would be warm because of the

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.940 
and less it would be warm because of the
fact<00:07:14.390> that<00:07:14.510> you<00:07:14.840> have<00:07:14.960> less<00:07:15.110> reactants<00:07:15.710> and

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:15.950 
fact that you have less reactants and

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.200 
fact that you have less reactants and
also<00:07:16.280> because<00:07:16.490> you<00:07:16.550> have<00:07:16.730> a<00:07:16.760> lot<00:07:16.940> of<00:07:16.970> gas

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.210 
also because you have a lot of gas

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.360 
also because you have a lot of gas
already<00:07:17.690> so<00:07:18.530> it<00:07:18.740> will<00:07:18.830> seem<00:07:19.040> that<00:07:19.070> the

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:19.370 
already so it will seem that the

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.250 
already so it will seem that the
struggle<00:07:19.670> seemed<00:07:19.910> relatively<00:07:20.300> slower<00:07:20.840> that's

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.260 
struggle seemed relatively slower that's

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.450 
struggle seemed relatively slower that's
because<00:07:21.440> the<00:07:21.530> concentration<00:07:22.070> to<00:07:22.160> be<00:07:22.190> acted

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.460 
because the concentration to be acted

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.250 
because the concentration to be acted
for<00:07:22.610> calm<00:07:22.820> and<00:07:22.910> chemical<00:07:23.270> kinetics<00:07:23.510> that<00:07:24.170> in

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:24.260 
for calm and chemical kinetics that in

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.050 
for calm and chemical kinetics that in
fact<00:07:24.470> as<00:07:24.680> the<00:07:25.100> concentrate<00:07:25.550> as<00:07:25.700> a<00:07:25.730> reaction

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:26.060 
fact as the concentrate as a reaction

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.940 
fact as the concentrate as a reaction
progresses<00:07:26.390> the<00:07:27.110> reaction<00:07:27.470> rate<00:07:27.620> becomes

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:27.950 
progresses the reaction rate becomes

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.230 
progresses the reaction rate becomes
slower<00:07:28.250> because<00:07:28.520> due<00:07:28.850> to<00:07:28.940> the<00:07:29.030> fact<00:07:29.210> that

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240 
slower because due to the fact that

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.050 
slower because due to the fact that
there<00:07:29.420> is<00:07:29.510> less<00:07:29.660> concentration<00:07:30.230> of<00:07:30.470> reactants

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.060 
there is less concentration of reactants

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.840 
there is less concentration of reactants
so<00:07:32.290> well<00:07:33.290> that<00:07:33.950> is<00:07:34.100> basically<00:07:34.340> said<00:07:34.640> about<00:07:34.730> you

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:34.850 
so well that is basically said about you

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.600 
so well that is basically said about you
diab<00:07:35.090> there<00:07:35.330> another<00:07:36.200> other<00:07:36.830> few<00:07:37.130> precautions

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:37.610 
diab there another other few precautions

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.490 
diab there another other few precautions
you<00:07:37.640> want<00:07:37.940> to<00:07:38.000> take<00:07:38.180> make<00:07:38.720> sure<00:07:39.050> that<00:07:39.260> you

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:39.500 
you want to take make sure that you

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.190 
you want to take make sure that you
don't<00:07:39.830> again<00:07:40.160> don't<00:07:40.430> spill<00:07:40.820> the<00:07:41.000> acid<00:07:41.420> also

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:42.200 
don't again don't spill the acid also

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.720 
don't again don't spill the acid also
make<00:07:42.350> sure<00:07:42.380> that<00:07:42.650> you're<00:07:42.770> using<00:07:42.950> an<00:07:43.160> acid

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:43.730 
make sure that you're using an acid

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.220 
make sure that you're using an acid
if<00:07:43.880> your<00:07:44.030> instructor<00:07:44.120> gives<00:07:44.540> you<00:07:44.630> a<00:07:44.660> base<00:07:44.930> and

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:45.230 
if your instructor gives you a base and

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.500 
if your instructor gives you a base and
they<00:07:45.800> they<00:07:46.160> probably<00:07:46.430> screwed<00:07:46.850> up<00:07:47.000> please

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:47.510 
they they probably screwed up please

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.150 
they they probably screwed up please
tell<00:07:47.780> them<00:07:47.960> that<00:07:48.020> they<00:07:48.230> that<00:07:48.530> they<00:07:48.740> giving<00:07:49.040> you

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:49.160 
tell them that they that they giving you

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.040 
tell them that they that they giving you
the<00:07:49.280> wrong<00:07:49.460> compound<00:07:50.060> we<00:07:50.420> were<00:07:50.480> sitting<00:07:50.840> for

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.050 
the wrong compound we were sitting for

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.920 
the wrong compound we were sitting for
this<00:07:51.320> unless<00:07:51.560> you're<00:07:51.920> doing<00:07:52.130> some<00:07:52.490> other

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:52.930 
this unless you're doing some other

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.720 
this unless you're doing some other
reaction<00:07:53.930> you<00:07:54.710> are<00:07:54.860> probably<00:07:55.280> going<00:07:55.520> to<00:07:55.610> be

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:55.730 
reaction you are probably going to be

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.140 
reaction you are probably going to be
using<00:07:56.000> an<00:07:56.300> acid<00:07:56.780> to<00:07:57.650> react<00:07:58.520> the<00:07:58.700> metal<00:07:59.000> to

00:07:59.140 --> 00:07:59.150 
using an acid to react the metal to

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.710 
using an acid to react the metal to
reduce<00:08:00.050> hydrogen<00:08:00.470> so<00:08:01.190> I<00:08:01.640> hope<00:08:02.210> this<00:08:02.330> video<00:08:02.510> was

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 
reduce hydrogen so I hope this video was

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.320 
reduce hydrogen so I hope this video was
very<00:08:02.930> helpful<00:08:03.230> and<00:08:03.940> you're<00:08:04.940> going<00:08:05.210> to<00:08:05.240> be

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:05.330 
very helpful and you're going to be

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.700 
very helpful and you're going to be
doing<00:08:05.450> this<00:08:05.630> lab<00:08:05.810> I<00:08:06.020> hope

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:06.710 
doing this lab I hope

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.130 
doing this lab I hope
very<00:08:07.220> fun<00:08:07.490> lab<00:08:07.700> and<00:08:08.150> also<00:08:08.420> you<00:08:08.570> can<00:08:08.690> ignite<00:08:08.990> the

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:09.140 
very fun lab and also you can ignite the

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.360 
very fun lab and also you can ignite the
hydrogen<00:08:09.260> at<00:08:09.530> the<00:08:09.620> end<00:08:09.800> is<00:08:09.980> your<00:08:10.130> shirt

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:10.370 
hydrogen at the end is your shirt
