00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:29.489 
it too long ago I guess just because the

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:30.620 
it too long ago I guess just because the

figure<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.760> legends<00:00:36.090> line<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.570> don't<00:00:37.530> know

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
figure in the legends line I don't know

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.410 
figure in the legends line I don't know
if<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.890> would<00:00:38.100> actually<00:00:38.220> go<00:00:38.490> that<00:00:38.790> far<00:00:39.090> but<00:00:39.360> it

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
if I would actually go that far but it

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.780 
if I would actually go that far but it
is<00:00:39.630> one<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.350> best<00:00:40.590> looking<00:00:40.950> Hulk<00:00:41.400> figures

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
is one of the best looking Hulk figures

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.460 
is one of the best looking Hulk figures
mostly<00:00:42.240> because<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.630> articulation<00:00:43.320> is

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
mostly because the articulation is

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.170 
mostly because the articulation is
designed<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.010> look<00:00:44.160> good<00:00:44.340> not<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.760> function

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
designed to look good not to function

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.240 
designed to look good not to function
well<00:00:45.330> anyway<00:00:46.260> he<00:00:46.470> stands<00:00:47.600> roughly<00:00:49.040> eight<00:00:50.040> and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
well anyway he stands roughly eight and

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.650 
well anyway he stands roughly eight and
a<00:00:50.280> quarter<00:00:50.610> inches<00:00:50.850> tall<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.120> he<00:00:51.300> definitely

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
a quarter inches tall so he definitely

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.780 
a quarter inches tall so he definitely
has<00:00:51.780> some<00:00:51.810> size<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.350> your<00:00:53.010> standard<00:00:53.430> legends

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
has some size on your standard legends

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.060 
has some size on your standard legends
and<00:00:54.240> he<00:00:54.300> has<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.450> much<00:00:54.690> more<00:00:54.870> realistic<00:00:55.380> sculpt

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
and he has a much more realistic sculpt

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.980 
and he has a much more realistic sculpt
throughout<00:00:56.760> even<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.270> face<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.810> body

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 
throughout even the face the body

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.350 
throughout even the face the body
everything<00:00:58.560> much<00:00:59.100> more<00:00:59.370> realistic<00:00:59.820> looking

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
everything much more realistic looking

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.140 
everything much more realistic looking
figure<00:01:00.980> and<00:01:01.980> most<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.760> reason<00:01:02.880> they<00:01:03.090> were

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
figure and most of the reason they were

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.279 
figure and most of the reason they were
able<00:01:03.240> to<00:01:03.390> accomplish<00:01:03.630> that<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:03.960> because<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:04.289 
able to accomplish that is because the

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:06.709 
able to accomplish that is because the
articulation<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.009> this<00:01:05.159> guy<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.939> pretty<00:01:06.359> junky

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:06.719 
articulation on this guy is pretty junky

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:08.450 
articulation on this guy is pretty junky
it's<00:01:07.049> not<00:01:07.229> very<00:01:07.469> good<00:01:07.649> at<00:01:07.799> all<00:01:07.890> which<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.280> why<00:01:08.429> I

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
it's not very good at all which is why I

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.580 
it's not very good at all which is why I
don't<00:01:08.820> put<00:01:09.030> him<00:01:09.210> at<00:01:09.329> the<00:01:09.359> top<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:10.320> he<00:01:10.469> is

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
don't put him at the top but he is

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.590 
don't put him at the top but he is
definitely<00:01:10.829> one<00:01:11.249> of<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.460> best-looking<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.479> I

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
definitely one of the best-looking and I

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.639 
definitely one of the best-looking and I
could<00:01:12.780> definitely<00:01:12.869> understand<00:01:13.380> why<00:01:13.590> people

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
could definitely understand why people

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.709 
could definitely understand why people
like<00:01:14.219> him<00:01:14.520> over<00:01:15.090> some<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.329> the<00:01:15.390> other<00:01:15.509> figures

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:15.719 
like him over some of the other figures

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:17.929 
like him over some of the other figures
as<00:01:16.619> far<00:01:16.799> as<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.950> articulation<00:01:17.490> goes<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
as far as the articulation goes for the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.359 
as far as the articulation goes for the
head<00:01:18.229> he<00:01:19.229> does<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.649> little<00:01:19.859> bit<00:01:20.100> up<00:01:20.219> and

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
head he does have a little bit up and

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.309 
head he does have a little bit up and
down<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.880> then<00:01:21.119> side<00:01:21.359> to<00:01:21.479> side<00:01:21.659> no<00:01:21.929> problem

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319 
down and then side to side no problem

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.679 
down and then side to side no problem
the<00:01:22.469> shoulders<00:01:23.060> not<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.299> bad

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
the shoulders not so bad

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.859 
the shoulders not so bad
in<00:01:24.749> the<00:01:25.079> hinge<00:01:25.319> for<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:26.359> for<00:01:27.359> the<00:01:27.420> ball<00:01:27.600> hinge

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
in the hinge for the for the ball hinge

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.289 
in the hinge for the for the ball hinge
they<00:01:28.469> do<00:01:28.530> come<00:01:28.920> up<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.639> they<00:01:29.789> get<00:01:29.939> really

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
they do come up but they get really

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.209 
they do come up but they get really
stiff<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.899> can<00:01:31.109> pretty<00:01:31.649> much<00:01:31.740> get<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
stiff you can pretty much get the

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:33.739 
stiff you can pretty much get the
shoulders<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.819> what<00:01:32.999> you<00:01:33.119> want<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:33.539> as<00:01:33.659> you

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:33.749 
shoulders to do what you want but as you

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:35.359 
shoulders to do what you want but as you
can<00:01:33.840> see<00:01:33.899> they're<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:34.350> circular<00:01:35.159> they're

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
can see they're not circular they're

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.889 
can see they're not circular they're
kind<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.670> ovular<00:01:36.149> shaped<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.780> your

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
kind of ovular shaped to your

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:38.690 
kind of ovular shaped to your
drop-shaped<00:01:37.289> almost<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.219> you<00:01:38.280> do<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.490> some

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
drop-shaped almost so you do have some

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.910 
drop-shaped almost so you do have some
troubles<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.450> then<00:01:39.569> just<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:40.350> most<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
troubles and then just like most of the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.459 
troubles and then just like most of the
other<00:01:41.100> faceoff<00:01:41.880> figures<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.509> QC<00:01:42.929> wasn't<00:01:43.319> very

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
other faceoff figures the QC wasn't very

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.160 
other faceoff figures the QC wasn't very
good<00:01:43.709> for<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.609> line<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.060> at<00:01:45.299> all<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.959> you<00:01:46.049> had

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
good for this line of at all so you had

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.260 
good for this line of at all so you had
to<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.380> really<00:01:46.560> careful<00:01:46.740> with<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.219> but<00:01:47.490> it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
to be really careful with that but it

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.330 
to be really careful with that but it
looks<00:01:48.929> really<00:01:49.259> good<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.469> if<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.069> don't<00:01:50.219> mind

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
looks really good so if you don't mind

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.399 
looks really good so if you don't mind
not<00:01:50.549> posing<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.060> much<00:01:51.209> that's<00:01:51.450> fine<00:01:51.719> bicep

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
not posing it much that's fine bicep

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.260 
not posing it much that's fine bicep
swivel<00:01:52.709> works<00:01:52.920> really<00:01:53.189> well<00:01:53.429> but<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.880> tricep

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
swivel works really well but the tricep

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.849 
swivel works really well but the tricep
goes<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.659> far<00:01:54.899> up<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.499> it's<00:01:55.619> really

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:55.859 
goes so far up on it that it's really

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:58.069 
goes so far up on it that it's really
hard<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.159> not<00:01:56.340> hit<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.270> part<00:01:57.600> when<00:01:57.990> you're

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
hard to not hit this part when you're

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.190 
hard to not hit this part when you're
trying<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.350> rotate<00:01:58.529> that<00:01:59.869> single<00:02:00.869> jointed

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
trying to rotate that single jointed

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.919 
trying to rotate that single jointed
elbow<00:02:01.529> with<00:02:02.149> minimal<00:02:03.149> range<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.600> motion

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
elbow with minimal range of motion

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:05.929 
elbow with minimal range of motion
that's<00:02:04.139> all<00:02:04.319> the<00:02:04.409> way<00:02:04.499> out<00:02:04.709> that's<00:02:05.639> all<00:02:05.850> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
that's all the way out that's all the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.740 
that's all the way out that's all the
way<00:02:06.060> bent<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.659> not<00:02:07.020> quite<00:02:07.289> 45<00:02:07.920> degrees<00:02:08.659> we<00:02:09.659> have

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
way bent so not quite 45 degrees we have

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.330 
way bent so not quite 45 degrees we have
a<00:02:09.780> wrist<00:02:10.049> swivel<00:02:10.500> but<00:02:10.739> doesn't<00:02:11.069> look<00:02:11.189> good

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
a wrist swivel but doesn't look good

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.729 
a wrist swivel but doesn't look good
because<00:02:11.549> of<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.849> way<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.120> done<00:02:13.019> so<00:02:13.409> it<00:02:13.590> means

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
because of the way it's done so it means

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:14.150 
because of the way it's done so it means
not<00:02:13.860> bad

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
not bad

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.040 
not bad
but<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.460> not<00:02:14.550> great<00:02:14.730> we<00:02:15.390> have<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.540> wrist<00:02:15.810> hinge

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
but it's not great we have a wrist hinge

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.870 
but it's not great we have a wrist hinge
which<00:02:16.320> would<00:02:16.530> be<00:02:16.680> fine<00:02:16.860> that's<00:02:17.130> no<00:02:17.370> problem<00:02:17.760> at

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
which would be fine that's no problem at

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.000 
which would be fine that's no problem at
all<00:02:18.000> but<00:02:18.660> then<00:02:18.810> we<00:02:18.930> have<00:02:19.110> these<00:02:19.290> hands<00:02:19.980> that

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
all but then we have these hands that

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.340 
all but then we have these hands that
are<00:02:20.280> just<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.790> don't<00:02:21.540> know<00:02:21.600> what<00:02:21.900> they're<00:02:22.110> going

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
are just I don't know what they're going

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.080 
are just I don't know what they're going
for<00:02:22.470> with<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:22.980> hand<00:02:23.220> sculpt<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.790> doesn't

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
for with that hand sculpt it doesn't

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.160 
for with that hand sculpt it doesn't
look<00:02:24.240> good<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.600> just<00:02:24.630> looks<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.110> is

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
look good it just looks like it is

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.780 
look good it just looks like it is
arthritis<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:26.010> then<00:02:26.100> we<00:02:26.190> have<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.520> hinge

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
arthritis and then we have this hinge

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.700 
arthritis and then we have this hinge
for<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.210> fingers<00:02:27.600> which<00:02:27.840> doesn't<00:02:28.500> let<00:02:28.590> them

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
for the fingers which doesn't let them

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.370 
for the fingers which doesn't let them
grab<00:02:28.920> stuff<00:02:29.280> still<00:02:29.820> looks<00:02:30.030> dumb<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:31.140> just

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
grab stuff still looks dumb it just

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.050 
grab stuff still looks dumb it just
doesn't<00:02:31.740> look<00:02:31.770> good<00:02:31.920> he's<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.670> don't<00:02:32.850> know

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
doesn't look good he's I don't know

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.630 
doesn't look good he's I don't know
that's<00:02:33.540> one<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.930> my<00:02:34.200> least<00:02:34.530> liked<00:02:35.070> things

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
that's one of the my least liked things

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.430 
that's one of the my least liked things
on<00:02:35.970> this<00:02:36.180> figure<00:02:36.390> is<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.630> hand<00:02:36.840> sculpt<00:02:37.260> and

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
on this figure is the hand sculpt and

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.260 
on this figure is the hand sculpt and
then<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.220> one<00:02:38.430> at<00:02:38.640> least<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:38.970> looks<00:02:39.000> like<00:02:39.240> a

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
then this one at least it looks like a

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.370 
then this one at least it looks like a
normal<00:02:39.510> open<00:02:39.960> hand<00:02:40.260> but<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.850> hinge<00:02:42.380> it's

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
normal open hand but that hinge it's

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.110 
normal open hand but that hinge it's
pretty<00:02:43.680> much<00:02:43.830> pointless<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:44.580> I'm<00:02:44.670> not<00:02:44.820> sure

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
pretty much pointless so I'm not sure

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.760 
pretty much pointless so I'm not sure
why<00:02:45.420> they<00:02:45.600> didn't<00:02:45.840> just<00:02:45.870> give<00:02:46.110> them<00:02:46.200> fists<00:02:46.620> or

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
why they didn't just give them fists or

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.860 
why they didn't just give them fists or
something<00:02:47.190> has<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.550> basically<00:02:48.150> just<00:02:48.600> be<00:02:48.720> in<00:02:48.780> a

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
something has to basically just be in a

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.080 
something has to basically just be in a
walking<00:02:49.320> pose<00:02:49.560> or<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:49.830> standing<00:02:50.280> pose<00:02:50.460> in<00:02:50.790> order

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
walking pose or a standing pose in order

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.890 
walking pose or a standing pose in order
to<00:02:51.240> not<00:02:51.450> look<00:02:51.690> goofy<00:02:52.790> no<00:02:53.790> torso<00:02:54.300> articulation

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
to not look goofy no torso articulation

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.440 
to not look goofy no torso articulation
at<00:02:55.110> all<00:02:55.320> other<00:02:55.740> than<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.130> waist<00:02:56.340> swivel<00:02:56.670> which

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
at all other than the waist swivel which

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.440 
at all other than the waist swivel which
gives<00:02:57.690> us<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.870> nice<00:02:57.990> sculpt<00:02:58.440> but<00:02:59.450> articulation

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
gives us a nice sculpt but articulation

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.320 
gives us a nice sculpt but articulation
is<00:03:00.630> important<00:03:01.140> for<00:03:01.260> Marvel<00:03:01.590> legends<00:03:01.860> figure

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
is important for Marvel legends figure

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.360 
is important for Marvel legends figure
for<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.420> hips<00:03:03.660> we<00:03:04.230> get<00:03:04.410> T<00:03:04.590> jointed<00:03:04.980> hips<00:03:05.160> but

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
for the hips we get T jointed hips but

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.980 
for the hips we get T jointed hips but
the<00:03:05.490> range<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.790> motion<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.240> minimal<00:03:06.720> due<00:03:06.870> to

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
the range of motion is minimal due to

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.500 
the range of motion is minimal due to
the<00:03:07.080> sculpt<00:03:07.500> they<00:03:08.460> do<00:03:08.520> have<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.030> hinge<00:03:09.270> in

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
the sculpt they do have the hinge in

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.940 
the sculpt they do have the hinge in
there<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:09.930> they<00:03:10.080> can't<00:03:10.290> go<00:03:10.380> out<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.710> side

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
there so they can't go out to the side

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.500 
there so they can't go out to the side
guess<00:03:11.730> that's<00:03:11.940> okay

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
guess that's okay

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.050

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
not great but it's not bad as far as

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.410 
not great but it's not bad as far as
whether<00:03:20.130> or<00:03:20.310> not<00:03:20.400> you<00:03:20.550> like<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.940> particular

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
whether or not you like that particular

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.960 
whether or not you like that particular
sculpt<00:03:21.870> slash<00:03:22.200> joint<00:03:22.860> combo<00:03:23.400> that's<00:03:23.580> up<00:03:23.820> to

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
sculpt slash joint combo that's up to

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.940 
sculpt slash joint combo that's up to
you<00:03:24.090> it's<00:03:24.240> not<00:03:24.270> my<00:03:24.570> favorite<00:03:25.170> but<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:25.500> works

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
you it's not my favorite but it works

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.550 
you it's not my favorite but it works
well<00:03:26.190> enough<00:03:26.630> as<00:03:27.630> far<00:03:27.690> as<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.080> ankle<00:03:28.350> goes

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
well enough as far as the ankle goes

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.890 
well enough as far as the ankle goes
this<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.550> really<00:03:29.940> unique<00:03:30.330> kind<00:03:30.780> of

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
this is really unique kind of

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.260 
this is really unique kind of
articulation<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.860> it's<00:03:32.040> it's<00:03:32.790> really

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
articulation and it's it's really

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.510 
articulation and it's it's really
good-looking<00:03:33.600> again<00:03:34.230> but<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.620> doesn't<00:03:35.070> work

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
good-looking again but it doesn't work

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.790 
good-looking again but it doesn't work
very<00:03:35.580> well<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.510> ankle<00:03:36.750> hinge<00:03:37.020> is<00:03:37.320> right<00:03:37.590> there

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
very well the ankle hinge is right there

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.590 
very well the ankle hinge is right there
which<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:38.070> okay<00:03:38.459> but<00:03:39.090> then<00:03:39.240> we<00:03:39.330> have<00:03:39.450> this

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
which is okay but then we have this

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.890 
which is okay but then we have this
ankle<00:03:39.930> rocker<00:03:40.370> it's<00:03:41.370> just<00:03:41.700> I<00:03:41.970> don't<00:03:42.600> know<00:03:42.660> I

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
ankle rocker it's just I don't know I

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.030 
ankle rocker it's just I don't know I
guess<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.709> works<00:03:43.860> better<00:03:44.070> than<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.370> remembered

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
guess it works better than I remembered

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.290 
guess it works better than I remembered
better<00:03:47.040> than<00:03:47.340> probably<00:03:47.489> most<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.000> current

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
better than probably most of the current

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.580 
better than probably most of the current
one<00:03:48.360> so<00:03:48.570> to<00:03:48.660> be<00:03:48.750> completely<00:03:49.050> honest<00:03:49.440> the

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
one so to be completely honest the

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.110 
one so to be completely honest the
ankles<00:03:49.890> aren't<00:03:50.130> that<00:03:50.250> bad<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.489> remember<00:03:50.940> not

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
ankles aren't that bad I remember not

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.850 
ankles aren't that bad I remember not
liking<00:03:51.239> them<00:03:51.480> as<00:03:51.630> much<00:03:51.750> but<00:03:52.020> see<00:03:52.410> this<00:03:52.560> is<00:03:52.739> why

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
liking them as much but see this is why

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.729 
liking them as much but see this is why
every<00:03:53.130> reviews<00:03:53.520> are<00:03:53.640> important<00:03:54.030> sometimes

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
every reviews are important sometimes

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.140 
every reviews are important sometimes
that<00:03:55.739> ankle<00:03:56.010> rocker<00:03:56.220> works<00:03:56.610> better<00:03:56.880> than<00:03:57.090> I

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
that ankle rocker works better than I

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.640 
that ankle rocker works better than I
remember<00:03:57.480> it<00:03:57.630> so<00:03:57.660> that's<00:03:57.930> okay<00:03:58.140> I<00:03:58.170> do<00:03:58.290> wish

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
remember it so that's okay I do wish

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.190 
remember it so that's okay I do wish
though<00:03:58.920> very<00:03:59.850> similarly<00:04:00.270> to<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.570> newest<00:04:00.959> Hulk

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
though very similarly to the newest Hulk

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.680 
though very similarly to the newest Hulk
figures<00:04:01.560> for<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.800> Avengers<00:04:02.040> movie<00:04:02.420> you<00:04:03.420> can't

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
figures for the Avengers movie you can't

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.449 
figures for the Avengers movie you can't
bring<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:03.930> foot<00:04:04.260> up<00:04:04.470> at<00:04:04.680> all<00:04:04.830> so<00:04:05.130> you<00:04:05.190> can't

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
bring that foot up at all so you can't

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.250 
bring that foot up at all so you can't
really<00:04:05.760> bend<00:04:05.910> his<00:04:06.090> knee<00:04:06.270> that<00:04:06.750> much<00:04:07.080> unless

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
really bend his knee that much unless

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.449 
really bend his knee that much unless
you're<00:04:07.410> going<00:04:07.500> to<00:04:07.560> use<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.860> toe<00:04:08.010> joint<00:04:08.310> which

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
you're going to use the toe joint which

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.040 
you're going to use the toe joint which
does<00:04:08.700> work<00:04:08.910> pretty<00:04:08.940> well<00:04:09.270> he's<00:04:09.480> got<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.690> really

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
does work pretty well he's got a really

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.949 
does work pretty well he's got a really
decent<00:04:10.350> toe<00:04:10.920> hinge<00:04:11.220> so<00:04:11.850> huh<00:04:12.150> contrary<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.810> what

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
decent toe hinge so huh contrary to what

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.190 
decent toe hinge so huh contrary to what
I<00:04:12.989> remember<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.709> ankles<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.430> toe<00:04:15.150> joints<00:04:15.959> are

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
I remember the ankles and toe joints are

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.840 
I remember the ankles and toe joints are
much<00:04:16.980> better<00:04:17.160> than<00:04:17.310> I<00:04:17.459> thought<00:04:17.640> so<00:04:17.700> that's

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
much better than I thought so that's

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.420 
much better than I thought so that's
pretty<00:04:18.150> good<00:04:18.419> your<00:04:19.049> basic<00:04:19.500> limitations<00:04:20.310> are

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
pretty good your basic limitations are

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.580 
pretty good your basic limitations are
really<00:04:20.669> just<00:04:20.790> going<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.030> be<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.419> elbow<00:04:21.900> well

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
really just going to be the elbow well

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.409 
really just going to be the elbow well
basically<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:23.100> arm<00:04:23.250> including<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.000> hand<00:04:24.240> so

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
basically the arm including the hand so

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.880 
basically the arm including the hand so
otherwise<00:04:24.690> he's<00:04:24.870> pretty<00:04:25.169> good<00:04:25.350> so<00:04:25.560> that's<00:04:25.710> not

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
otherwise he's pretty good so that's not

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.000 
otherwise he's pretty good so that's not
so<00:04:26.100> bad<00:04:26.130> so

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
so bad so

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.760 
so bad so
I<00:04:27.100> know<00:04:27.520> you<00:04:27.760> guys<00:04:28.060> are<00:04:28.330> curious<00:04:28.570> about<00:04:28.930> how<00:04:29.500> he

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
I know you guys are curious about how he

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.950 
I know you guys are curious about how he
stacks<00:04:30.100> up<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.340> maybe<00:04:30.640> like<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.240> Hulkbuster

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
stacks up to maybe like the Hulkbuster

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.500 
stacks up to maybe like the Hulkbuster
or<00:04:32.200> maybe<00:04:33.190> Captain<00:04:33.610> America<00:04:33.970> or<00:04:34.030> something<00:04:34.240> so

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
or maybe Captain America or something so

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.090 
or maybe Captain America or something so
in<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:35.140> photos<00:04:35.440> make<00:04:35.590> sure<00:04:35.740> you<00:04:35.830> stick<00:04:36.010> around

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
in the photos make sure you stick around

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.560 
in the photos make sure you stick around
for<00:04:36.400> that<00:04:36.430> so<00:04:36.610> you<00:04:36.700> can<00:04:36.820> see<00:04:37.090> what<00:04:37.330> he<00:04:37.420> does

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
for that so you can see what he does

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.240 
for that so you can see what he does
look<00:04:37.810> like<00:04:37.990> once<00:04:38.260> you<00:04:38.410> get<00:04:38.530> imposed<00:04:38.890> a<00:04:39.040> little

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
look like once you get imposed a little

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.560 
look like once you get imposed a little
bit<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:39.520> put<00:04:39.670> up<00:04:39.760> against<00:04:40.060> another<00:04:40.210> figure

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
bit and put up against another figure

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.970 
bit and put up against another figure
but<00:04:40.690> I<00:04:40.720> do<00:04:40.780> recommend<00:04:41.110> it<00:04:41.350> it's<00:04:41.470> a<00:04:41.560> cool<00:04:41.770> figure

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
but I do recommend it it's a cool figure

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.850 
but I do recommend it it's a cool figure
good<00:04:42.370> looking<00:04:42.730> and<00:04:42.910> then<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:44.230> setbacks

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
good looking and then the setbacks

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.740 
good looking and then the setbacks
aren't<00:04:45.220> that<00:04:45.340> bad<00:04:45.730> so<00:04:46.090> I<00:04:46.120> think<00:04:46.420> I'm<00:04:46.570> probably

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
aren't that bad so I think I'm probably

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.120 
aren't that bad so I think I'm probably
going<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.050> recommend<00:04:47.500> it<00:04:47.620> if<00:04:47.710> you're<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:47.890> Hulk

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
going to recommend it if you're a Hulk

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.770 
going to recommend it if you're a Hulk
fan<00:04:48.340> go<00:04:48.610> grab<00:04:48.850> one<00:04:49.090> before<00:04:49.420> they<00:04:49.540> get<00:04:49.690> even

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
fan go grab one before they get even

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.350 
fan go grab one before they get even
more<00:04:50.110> valuable<00:04:50.500> because<00:04:50.800> they<00:04:51.010> are<00:04:51.360> becoming

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
more valuable because they are becoming

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.690 
more valuable because they are becoming
harder<00:04:52.840> and<00:04:52.930> harder<00:04:53.140> to<00:04:53.230> find<00:04:53.460> one<00:04:54.460> thing<00:04:54.580> I

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
harder and harder to find one thing I

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.820 
harder and harder to find one thing I
just<00:04:54.730> realized<00:04:55.240> it<00:04:55.420> looks<00:04:55.630> like<00:04:55.840> in<00:04:56.170> the<00:04:56.590> video

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
just realized it looks like in the video

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.470 
just realized it looks like in the video
his<00:04:57.100> torso<00:04:57.520> is<00:04:57.580> going<00:04:57.640> to<00:04:57.790> look<00:04:57.970> like<00:04:58.000> a<00:04:58.180> much

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
his torso is going to look like a much

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.780 
his torso is going to look like a much
different<00:04:58.930> color<00:04:59.110> green<00:04:59.440> than<00:04:59.680> the<00:04:59.710> arms<00:05:00.190> that

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
different color green than the arms that

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.110 
different color green than the arms that
is<00:05:01.060> not<00:05:01.360> apparent<00:05:02.230> on<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.650> figure<00:05:03.400> in<00:05:03.580> person

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
is not apparent on the figure in person

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.210 
is not apparent on the figure in person
so<00:05:04.810> don't<00:05:05.500> worry<00:05:05.590> about<00:05:05.770> that<00:05:06.040> it's<00:05:06.070> not

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
so don't worry about that it's not

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.430 
so don't worry about that it's not
nearly<00:05:06.580> as<00:05:07.060> bad<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:07.630> shading<00:05:08.020> that<00:05:08.050> you<00:05:08.230> see

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
nearly as bad the shading that you see

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.990 
nearly as bad the shading that you see
throughout<00:05:08.770> the<00:05:08.950> arms<00:05:09.190> kind<00:05:09.400> of<00:05:09.490> brown<00:05:09.730> this

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
throughout the arms kind of brown this

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.030 
throughout the arms kind of brown this
here<00:05:10.480> and<00:05:10.630> here<00:05:10.900> and<00:05:10.990> then<00:05:11.110> heavy<00:05:11.770> shading

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
here and here and then heavy shading

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.650 
here and here and then heavy shading
here<00:05:12.250> that<00:05:12.460> is<00:05:12.640> like<00:05:12.880> that<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.300> paint's<00:05:13.600> not

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
here that is like that the paint's not

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.480 
here that is like that the paint's not
