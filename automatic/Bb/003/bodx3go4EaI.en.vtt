00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
angle just like that and you have your

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.480 
angle just like that and you have your
typing<00:01:11.729> angle<00:01:12.140> pretty<00:01:13.140> cool

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
typing angle pretty cool

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.789 
typing angle pretty cool
this<00:01:15.060> case<00:01:15.270> also<00:01:15.479> has<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> sleep<00:01:16.229> wavefunction

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
this case also has a sleep wavefunction

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.359
