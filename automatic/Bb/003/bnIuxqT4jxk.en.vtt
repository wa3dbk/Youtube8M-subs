00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.300 
that black of a top platform really like
yep<00:03:51.569> I<00:03:51.870> used<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.709> say<00:03:52.830> that<00:03:52.950> that<00:03:53.040> made<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.250> big

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
yep I used to say that that made a big

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.190 
yep I used to say that that made a big
difference<00:03:53.489> in<00:03:53.970> Falcon<00:03:54.450> matchups<00:03:54.840> when<00:03:55.020> like

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
difference in Falcon matchups when like

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.020 
difference in Falcon matchups when like
because<00:03:56.010> tech<00:03:56.190> chasing<00:03:56.489> on<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.670> platform

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
because tech chasing on the platform

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.600 
because tech chasing on the platform
wasn't<00:03:57.360> really<00:03:57.540> a<00:03:57.569> thing<00:03:57.870> back<00:03:58.140> then<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:59.010> so<00:03:59.280> I

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
wasn't really a thing back then and so I

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.490 
wasn't really a thing back then and so I
always<00:04:00.060> wanted<00:04:00.300> to<00:04:00.360> stomp<00:04:00.660> me<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.319> just

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
always wanted to stomp me and it just

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.840 
always wanted to stomp me and it just
felt<00:04:01.709> like<00:04:01.770> stadium<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.430> was<00:04:02.550> so<00:04:02.670> much<00:04:02.790> easier

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
felt like stadium it was so much easier

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.430 
felt like stadium it was so much easier
so<00:04:03.270> I<00:04:03.330> stopped<00:04:03.569> you<00:04:03.690> anywhere<00:04:04.020> in<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.200> middle

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
so I stopped you anywhere in the middle

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.160 
so I stopped you anywhere in the middle
I<00:04:04.530> get<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.830> name<00:04:05.040> easy<00:04:05.810> this<00:04:06.810> is<00:04:06.930> like<00:04:07.050> the

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
I get the name easy this is like the

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.520 
I get the name easy this is like the
2009<00:04:07.800> logic<00:04:08.220> yeah<00:04:08.760> we<00:04:09.720> need<00:04:09.870> more<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:10.140> okay

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
2009 logic yeah we need more that okay

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.630 
2009 logic yeah we need more that okay
so<00:04:11.150> probably<00:04:12.150> took<00:04:12.330> away<00:04:12.570> Stadium<00:04:13.430> dark<00:04:14.430> seems

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
so probably took away Stadium dark seems

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.190 
so probably took away Stadium dark seems
like<00:04:14.760> an<00:04:14.850> old<00:04:15.000> people<00:04:15.180> guy<00:04:15.300> to<00:04:15.360> like<00:04:16.049> he'd

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.069 
probably have no how yeah that's played
he<00:04:19.590> thought<00:04:19.799> about<00:04:19.829> it<00:04:20.040> for<00:04:20.160> a<00:04:20.310> second<00:04:21.079> thought

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
he thought about it for a second thought

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.730

think<00:05:22.809> the<00:05:23.289> thing<00:05:23.439> about<00:05:23.649> that<00:05:23.830> is<00:05:23.889> like<00:05:24.189> you

00:05:24.299 --> 00:05:24.309 
think the thing about that is like you

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:25.920 
think the thing about that is like you
don't<00:05:24.430> want<00:05:24.580> to<00:05:24.639> get<00:05:24.699> hit<00:05:24.849> by<00:05:25.059> Morse<00:05:25.539> apiece

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
don't want to get hit by Morse apiece

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.239 
don't want to get hit by Morse apiece
the<00:05:26.229> thing<00:05:26.439> I<00:05:26.559> do<00:05:26.619> is<00:05:27.899> humans<00:05:28.899> react<00:05:29.379> faster

00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:30.249 
the thing I do is humans react faster

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:31.889 
the thing I do is humans react faster
than<00:05:30.279> sound<00:05:30.580> than<00:05:30.999> they<00:05:31.119> do<00:05:31.180> to<00:05:31.449> what<00:05:31.599> they<00:05:31.719> see

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:31.899 
than sound than they do to what they see

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:33.989 
than sound than they do to what they see
you<00:05:32.080> just<00:05:32.259> listen<00:05:32.559> for<00:05:32.589> it<00:05:32.800> I'm<00:05:33.369> right<00:05:33.729> there

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:33.999
