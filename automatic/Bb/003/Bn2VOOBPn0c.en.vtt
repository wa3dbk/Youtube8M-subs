I<00:01:28.200> believe<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.040> uh<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.180> he's<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> great<00:01:30.659> player

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
I believe so uh and he's a great player

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.679 
I believe so uh and he's a great player
he's<00:01:31.439> reaching<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.340> don't<00:01:32.490> know<00:01:32.579> 27<00:01:33.299> years<00:01:33.479> old

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
he's reaching I don't know 27 years old

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.990 
he's reaching I don't know 27 years old
so<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.380> can't<00:01:35.040> see<00:01:35.250> him<00:01:35.310> making<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.670> much<00:01:35.850> of

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
so I can't see him making that much of

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.060 
so I can't see him making that much of
an<00:01:36.119> impact<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.630> Portugal<00:01:37.140> even<00:01:37.409> play<00:01:37.650> for

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
an impact in Portugal even play for

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.700 
an impact in Portugal even play for
channel<00:01:38.280> at<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.490> point<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.000> mean<00:01:39.180> he's

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
channel at this point but I mean he's

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.980 
channel at this point but I mean he's
he's<00:01:40.710> rejected<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.549> know<00:01:41.670> by<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.909> team<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.750> I

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
he's rejected you know by the team and I

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.780 
he's rejected you know by the team and I
really<00:01:43.530> don't<00:01:43.860> know<00:01:43.979> why<00:01:44.250> because<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.610> think

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
really don't know why because I think

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.330 
really don't know why because I think
he'd<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:44.909> good<00:01:45.470> left-back<00:01:46.470> were<00:01:46.680> going<00:01:46.979> on<00:01:47.159> to

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
he'd be good left-back were going on to

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.700 
he'd be good left-back were going on to
and<00:01:47.490> tunes<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.180> tues<00:01:48.509> used<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.500> play<00:01:49.649> for

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
and tunes and tues used to play for

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.560 
and tunes and tues used to play for
posture<00:01:50.340> ephrata<00:01:50.759> when<00:01:50.909> they<00:01:51.000> were<00:01:51.060> good<00:01:51.329> and

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
posture ephrata when they were good and

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.630 
posture ephrata when they were good and
then<00:01:51.750> he<00:01:51.840> got<00:01:52.020> loaned<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.890> malaga<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.460> i

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
then he got loaned out to malaga and i

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.510 
then he got loaned out to malaga and i
think<00:01:53.909> bob<00:01:54.299> by<00:01:54.600> Malecha<00:01:54.990> actually<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.189> he's

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
think bob by Malecha actually so he's

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.580 
think bob by Malecha actually so he's
pretty<00:01:56.790> good<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.210> know<00:01:57.240> he's<00:01:57.479> left<00:01:57.810> back<00:01:58.049> he

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
pretty good you know he's left back he

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.499 
pretty good you know he's left back he
you<00:01:59.159> see<00:01:59.310> his<00:01:59.399> stats<00:01:59.670> are<00:01:59.909> pretty<00:02:00.090> good<00:02:00.299> he's

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
you see his stats are pretty good he's

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.649 
you see his stats are pretty good he's
having<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.140> decent<00:02:01.380> seasons<00:02:02.340> at<00:02:02.549> Malaga<00:02:03.030> but

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
you know five points down so that's the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.950 
you know five points down so that's the
reason<00:02:05.700> why<00:02:05.939> he's<00:02:06.180> not<00:02:06.329> going<00:02:06.479> on<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.750> team

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
reason why he's not going on the team

yellow whoops
she<00:02:13.620> was<00:02:13.740> on<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.890> year<00:02:14.070> 2012<00:02:14.670> squad<00:02:15.030> but<00:02:15.570> he<00:02:16.320> is

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
she was on the year 2012 squad but he is

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.780 
she was on the year 2012 squad but he is
not<00:02:16.620> going<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.830> be<00:02:16.920> making<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.370> result<00:02:17.610> this

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
not going to be making the result this

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.220 
not going to be making the result this
year<00:02:18.180> usually<00:02:18.450> because<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.870> think<00:02:18.990> of

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
year usually because I think of

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.160 
year usually because I think of
disciplinary<00:02:19.920> issues<00:02:20.420> he<00:02:21.420> got<00:02:21.600> into<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.780> fight

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
disciplinary issues he got into a fight

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.080 
disciplinary issues he got into a fight
back<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.860> training<00:02:23.100> two<00:02:23.490> years<00:02:23.670> ago<00:02:23.880> for<00:02:24.060> the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
back in training two years ago for the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.700 
back in training two years ago for the
arrow<00:02:24.300> with<00:02:24.510> another<00:02:25.050> player<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.470> did<00:02:25.590> make

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
arrow with another player that did make

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.250 
arrow with another player that did make
it<00:02:25.860> on<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.040> squad<00:02:26.280> Chicago<00:02:26.820> desma<00:02:27.180> they<00:02:28.110> both

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
it on the squad Chicago desma they both

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.500 
it on the squad Chicago desma they both
got<00:02:28.470> into<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.680> fight<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.700> think<00:02:30.270> is<00:02:30.390> the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
got into a fight and I think is the

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.510 
got into a fight and I think is the
reason<00:02:30.660> why<00:02:30.900> both<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.560> them<00:02:31.710> didn't<00:02:32.250> play<00:02:32.490> much

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
reason why both of them didn't play much

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.360 
reason why both of them didn't play much
at<00:02:32.940> all<00:02:33.060> during<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.690> year<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:33.990> tears<00:02:34.260> ago<00:02:34.530> so

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
at all during the year of tears ago so

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.770 
at all during the year of tears ago so
you<00:02:35.460> know<00:02:35.580> that's<00:02:35.910> probably<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.390> reason<00:02:36.420> why

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
you know that's probably the reason why

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.360 
you know that's probably the reason why
this<00:02:36.810> guy's<00:02:37.260> been<00:02:37.560> making<00:02:37.890> under<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.190> team
