 on 17 Matchday of the football group league on the box FC Nuremberg 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.570
 Since the introduction of the Relegation in the 2008 season 2009, the 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.679
 AStA FC Nuremberg will not miss this event 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.130
 First against the clubberer thanks to this game in 2009 in the Bundesliga 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.609
 the last song reached the Nürnberger in the relegation match against 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:27.390
 The FC Augsburg relegation from Dieter Hecking resigned round of the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.609
 last season the successor of Michael Oenning 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.149
 Hecking who was previously three years as a coach and two red carpet 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.250
 then also his former assistant coach Birte Bremser 

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:41.380
 to join in not only learned a lot at Hannover 96 but also 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.820
 elsewhere in the street election campaign 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.920
 because you have a lot of experience and I think also percent 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.920
 yes, you benefit in the course of your life 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.130
 with Mehmet Ekici switched a playmaker type to act the 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.359
 Nürnberger derive the 20-year-old talent from FC Bayern München 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.390
 who Nilsson in the FCN already in the winter of last season by the TSG 

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:07.340
 Hoffenheim finally wanted to switch to the new season 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.789
 Rheinland Nilsson signed a three-year contract Jens Hegeler came before 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.070
 the season on loan from Bayer Leverkusen to the club as done two 

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:19.940
 Years borrowed by the Werkself 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.350
 Andreas Wolf is the captain of the clubberer and is on the 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.180
 Center-back position set so far Wolf came in 15 league games to two 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.890
 Torerfolgen 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.510
 despite his only 20 years working for the local press achievers 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.090
 The pilot of the German-Turk is so far the best scorer of the Hechinger 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.510
 with five wins and four draws and seven defeats is just something 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.600
 change there is currently in midfield with 19 points to rank eleven 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.750
 but from the last five could play the troupe of Dieter Hecking 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.630
 only one point against Hoffenheim 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.619
 For our large, the St means the downward trend of Nuremberg continues 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.659
 speed up and get another victory before the winter break 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.150
 after all, this could be another day in table rank two most significant
