00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.110

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.279
 get my ex points back as in this 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.080
 video we will address a question 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.880
 which is very important how to do 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.219
 to get an appointment in 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.259
 face-to-face with my ex then the art 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.849
 delicate to recover an ex pass 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.260
 necessarily at a given moment or at a 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.270
 other by the fact of their regrets because 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.830
 that well to come out together he 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.000
 must be seen in true to be 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.980
 to see in real must necessarily send a 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.180
 little sms before and then ben to send 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.410
 a sms and to see an answer must that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.269
 it goes a little good with it is 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.529
 you see there is a whole kind of two 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.119
 pathways everything leads to this 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.920
 appointments but eventually the real 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.020
 question what is the type of sms to 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.190
 send and how to propose to his ex 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.899
 a face-to-face meeting teklak 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.520
 is accepted knowing that often 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.200
 we are in bad terms 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.879
 we fought last time 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.280
 what we saw that does not happen 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.300
 necessarily very well and that's so I 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.739
 will give you a technique that is 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.930
 awesome and works in 80% of cases 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.489
 it's technical is to act as if 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.379
 nothing was wrong and you send 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.160
 simply cuckoo sms I go to the concert 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.510
 of stuff 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.000
 would that tell you my girlfriend is 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.579
 while you have a concert ticket 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.809
 or not it changes nothing if ever your ex 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.550
 divine can you go and buy them 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.840
 in the emergency it is not necessarily a 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.070
 concert it can be as important 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.339
 what fun activity in your 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.689
 city 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.799
 it may be I do not know if I have my 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.640
 level we are in winter it can be 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.990
 to go to the ice rink 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.880
 if it's ever summer it can be 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.439
 to go surfing at the beach etc 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.630
 it may just be to go and visit 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.909
 an exhibition at the museum that is nice and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.890
 the big advantage is that it 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.509
 firstly for you it does not engage you 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.670
 nothing so that means 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.560
 that officially the true purpose of this 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.060
 of this meeting is to go see 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.220
 something else and not 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.750
 chat together and interact and bat 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.189
 for your ex if ever your ex to a 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.810
 doubt today if he does not know too much if 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.250
 love you or not, well, it gives him a 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.810
 excellent excuse to see you again 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.100
 also and he will tell himself that it is a 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.700
 excellent solution because there is 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.829
 no pressure 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.540
 and again the attention is 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.040
 focused on something else 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.570
 in there than on your than on your 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.310
 couple problems so I recap 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.720
 done as if nothing had been sent a 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.329
 small sms to do an activity 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.770
 together to go bus to go in 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.630
 a museum to go see something 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.729
 fun to see a concert 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.920
 to go I do not know anything 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.329
 funny but launched here and there 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.579
 do everything for it to be a 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.869
 meeting that is nice and you 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.130
 have a good time together 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.700
 here I think the next video 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.700
 soon to see again
