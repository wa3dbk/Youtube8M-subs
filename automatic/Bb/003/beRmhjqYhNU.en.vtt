00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello people want a new zealand this is there are no other 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.949
 and today I have a movie about how to make a good photo epa 4 

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:13.159
 this photo was made 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.359
 well you need a few things for that 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.159
 don't go very strange 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:22.519
 that you see they can build themselves it is a bit awkward because the me 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:25.609
 i also see it while can build 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.490
 and you do have some things that trade that you can do in others 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:30.960
 do colors 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.570
 the way I am 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.850
 petra 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.400
 9 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.680
 spend the army diving there is one purely boring but you can also do another 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.490
 color if you want 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.050
 and me holes 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.110
 for carp 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.030
 are you going to get it does me can also have another color if you want 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.470
 so how do you start well we do not place two animals for bidding too 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.590
 finally gave up it was a canvas now seems then chance that step back then 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.360
 those points 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.809
 at the same pace 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:03.989
 these are for whom 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.220
 then you can 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.510
 e 2 to serve takes place at fourth place in lochem little existing site 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.140
 at work 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.930
 that's how it is 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.130
 and those buttons on it 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.450
 when comes out 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.630
 then you grab 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.310
 price a quarter die ox Christmas who wants to find the quarter self-conscious 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.950
 especially with the following 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.600
 and then the solo can do so can do so 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.710
 I personally think it is beautiful that there is something higher 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.840
 one that you have here 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.000
 dirk sterckx suffered 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 who walk around here it doesn't look like it 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.760
 and then that 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.450
 now applies 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.450
 a package of ditches that a 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.700
 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.020
 one two three four five cities 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.020
 and that too 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.530
 you grab 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.820
 and then too 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.100
 at the dealer 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.610
 coming soon 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.870
 or if you want you can too 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.280
 how to perse you per se but you can also only use it yourself to dot 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.449
 pop star financial stadium 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.549
 or stronger so are the side 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.179
 likes yourself best 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:22.819
 they even take three hours 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.869
 zweeloo is also know 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:27.309
 heemstede 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:30.979
 you can also do a little less depending on what your own beautiful marker 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:32.030
 after earlier 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.449
 when we belong to the little ones here 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:35.699
 2 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:37.459
 and here 3 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.509
 you get this 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:41.509
 can also do this the patient is beautiful I think is beautiful 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:45.679
 Well then you have in itself already a few men to punch 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:48.679
 but then we would like to be able to sit in it even more naturally 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:52.439
 so grab something and my kart 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.299
 so and so 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.469
 and if the rails are the other way around it says this then you keep it on you and it has it 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:58.459
 worked 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.759
 that you leave the example of that afterwards but it remains these books 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:04.049
 were as good as it is 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.119
 action after wall street 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.119
 and this package a strange night 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:13.789
 this one here 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:16.869
 new Zealand 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:20.549
 That is of course not necessary if you do in about fifty it is a bit expensive late 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.799
 put it that way 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.779
 that the best way 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:24.959
 the 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.979
 Instead think more and do the latest test that they send 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.549
 look you see the led psv led 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.339
 2 also come 

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:39.049
 and thereby 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.919
 the campaign outward it seems more than two thousand trainers 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.919
 and there we do Brunopress Chieftain 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.419
 and reduce the red color 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.880
 this together with his wife 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.069
 to prevent the earth from doing this with this 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.459
 so then it shouldn't be either 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.459
 then grab your take 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.599
 and that place on the back 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.299
 so that and call that kum derijck I now know another cars san 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.099
 coco 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.600
 the company would buy 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.799
 and then I do this as the name 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.709
 pim 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.770
 super 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.379
 not because it is not that far 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:29.340
 so just wrong because I don't think so 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.199
 well then this is not a hotel in itself 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:33.740
 I think so 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.490
 I have not forgotten 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.490
 ma beautiful car 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:41.909
 together 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:45.309
 I might still build parking spaces around it and then 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:47.169
 make you see what it looks like 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.439
 if you have parking places in your own sensor 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:54.089
 Well then you immediately have a nice car and a parking space 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.090
 it is beautiful anyway 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.189
 a beautiful 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:04.189
 cipers superspeed 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.669
 I've done 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.249
 the design is of 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:12.210
 from a charmer 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.759
 sometimes it gets worse 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:15.740
 caps lasts 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.999
 and I have changed something about the design 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:22.309
 because some nice things come a bit nicer to make Jeffrey no more 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:25.339
 otherwise not 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:27.839
 but with the cap on it is 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:31.729
 you have a lot of ideas for mine that are baarn 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.760
 in my opinion but it would tell you the changes I made is mine 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.789
 it's just a complete one 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.469
 there are no butter 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:41.909
 come into existence 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.749
 well that's great 

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:47.990
 so amco superspeed 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.229
 and then say one thing time 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:51.469
 they get 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:53.870
 stayed like 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.870
 and do something in the church says something of spiritual guide 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:59.059
 normal 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:01.460
 important consequences 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.770
 when 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.020
 I don't know what you are doing
