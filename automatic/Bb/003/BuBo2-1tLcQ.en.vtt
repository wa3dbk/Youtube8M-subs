00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.080
 latest video today i play diablo 3 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.580
 and how it is about my art, I have me 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.650
 looking for a special challenge 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.690
 i play the over bronze for the the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.730
 Not knowing it is special 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.460
 strong versions of the bosses in the game 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.470
 and always two of them 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.330
 I play on your piano monsterstorm 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.160
 monster strength level 10 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.570
 So the highest level of difficulty in 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.150
 the game has to offer and so too 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.340
 the biggest challenge and the whole 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.560
 I'm still naked so completely without 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.059
 Armor So the character is like me 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.040
 I'm not naked I have that essential 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.410
 So also t shirt use socks gloves 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.700
 well so that hold substantial and 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.559
 keep watch the weapon on my 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.559
 character and the rest I have filed 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.030
 as you can see, and now I have mine 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.460
 I took a close look at everything 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.730
 just the skills that I 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.579
 have my weapon damage left of mine 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.680
 grain the life that the day that the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.680
 have monsters and so more everything 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.969
 just with pen and note and 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.140
 Now I'll try it 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.790
 let's go and I'm finished 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.290
 come that such fast past 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.710
 That should not be too difficult too 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.710
 create 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:31.660
 and let's go this is a pity 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.040
 Unfortunately, that does not work now 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.700
 I have no idea why this 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.420
 Lies is maybe called back 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.100
 programming error that the only one 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.610
 explanation that comes to mind, yes 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.710
 maybe I'll have a couple too 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.869
 make a mistake at the comma 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.380
 when I could have calculated that 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.970
 well, well, I 'll be the same 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.869
 I try again and then try 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.840
 I will do it again if I have it 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.670
 have done 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.680
 well, at least in one respect right 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.680
 It was over quickly in this sense
