00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
twist our in a mortar so I hope they

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.050 
twist our in a mortar so I hope they
both<00:02:25.470> go<00:02:25.650> down<00:02:25.680> if<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.190> doesn't<00:02:26.670> then<00:02:26.850> we're

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
screwed but say let's go to see what it

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.350 
screwed but say let's go to see what it
does<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:30.380> drop<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.590> both<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.270> there<00:02:33.270> we

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
does and drop that both you and there we

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.180 
does and drop that both you and there we
go<00:02:33.540> they're<00:02:33.750> both<00:02:33.930> down<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.500> now<00:02:34.800> we<00:02:34.860> only<00:02:35.100> have

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
go they're both down so now we only have

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.680 
go they're both down so now we only have
a<00:02:35.280> motor<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.730> take<00:02:35.910> here<00:02:36.090> because<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.420> one<00:02:36.600> is

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
a motor to take here because this one is

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.390 
a motor to take here because this one is
outside<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.320> obviously<00:02:38.010> it's<00:02:38.130> not<00:02:38.190> gonna<00:02:38.310> be

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
outside and obviously it's not gonna be

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.910 
outside and obviously it's not gonna be
doing<00:02:38.610> anything<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:39.360> us<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:39.990> he<00:02:40.230> has<00:02:40.770> some

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
doing anything to us so he has some

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.560 
doing anything to us so he has some
tongue<00:02:41.040> clicks<00:02:41.250> in<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.490> outside<00:02:41.970> which<00:02:42.420> I'm

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
tongue clicks in the outside which I'm

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.850 
tongue clicks in the outside which I'm
gonna<00:02:42.720> go<00:02:42.810> ahead<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.140> try<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.290> get<00:02:43.620> obviously

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
gonna go ahead and try to get obviously

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.790 
gonna go ahead and try to get obviously
and<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:45.270> doesn't<00:02:45.510> look<00:02:45.600> like<00:02:45.630> he<00:02:45.840> has<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.990> lot<00:02:46.620> of

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
and it doesn't look like he has a lot of

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.130 
and it doesn't look like he has a lot of
insight<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.610> what<00:02:47.940> I'm<00:02:48.030> gonna<00:02:48.120> do<00:02:48.270> is<00:02:49.020> I'm

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
insight so what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.780 
insight so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna<00:02:49.200> go<00:02:49.380> just<00:02:49.590> trading<00:02:50.100> me<00:02:50.190> base<00:02:50.370> no

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
gonna go just trading me base no

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.370 
gonna go just trading me base no

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
strategy I'm not even take care of that
