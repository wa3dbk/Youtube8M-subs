 remove items from the start menu just them 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.170
 hide here there is a scroll bar with 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.239
 by means of which we seize the left 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.909
 mouse button move up and down and 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.430
 we can read all the points before 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.090
 which we can add or remove from 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.369
 start menu 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.490
 note the data name 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.189
 items here for example we are now 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.380
 find what items we have in 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.840
 start menu 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.320
 here for example devices and printers to 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.960
 this menu 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.060
 this item in the start menu we have here 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.070
 he also has a program here for example 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.380
 default help same thing all 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.810
 can be found here and let's for example 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.140
 disable default program help 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.119
 and remove the devices and printers in order 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.630
 to exclude these items from the menu 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.179
 start 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:46.310
 now click ok click apply and 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:48.350
 open the start menu u you see that these 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.520
 I have three items from the start menu 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.740
 disappeared in exactly the same way we can 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.869
 here add some elements well or 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.060
 respectively disable some other 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.560
 items as unnecessary now 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.569
 pay attention to this area 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.539
 which is called the size of the start menu 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:08.300
 there are fields in which we can 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.700
 set number of icons recently 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.410
 open programs that is the number of those 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.660
 icons that we will have displayed 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.600
 here in this area dynamic by 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.090
 default as i say we have here 10 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.819
 badges 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.720
 here we can choose a value from 0 to 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.480
 thirty 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.300
 here there is another one area we they 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.980
 talk a little later and still have 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.720
 one button that I want you 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.030
 tell a is called parameters by 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.840
 default I have said several times 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.660
 this is the default term given 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.370
 phrase yes by default she often 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.030
 enough used in computer 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.129
 lexicon 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.560
 I have already used it several times 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.299
 as a rule it means any 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.780
 program settings or operating 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.269
 system 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.700
 which were set by programmers when 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.920
 creating a program but setting data 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.440
 can be changed manually by yourself and 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.720
 here for example yes there is a button 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.519
 default parameters it means something 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.480
 what if you produce here some 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.390
 your settings 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.400
 and after some time you want to return 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.310
 everything is in original condition that is 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.769
 as she was you can just push 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.780
 button defaults and all your 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.390
 settings will revert to the example of the 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.190
 pressing the default settings button 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.799
 click ok and click apply 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.209
 now I go to the start menu and we see 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.209
 that here I had three again 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.510
 the last item that is you can not 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.630
 fear that you are here by chance 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.459
 change 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.500
 and then forget where some tick 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.450
 set you can always go back to 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.400
 initial settings by clicking just 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.030
 button default settings 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.670
 well now let's move on to again 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.359
 this window and turn our attention 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.489
 here 's a drop-down list for ghana here we are 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.639
 we can choose the action that will be 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.859
 produce computer after we 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.290
 I'll click the button here on this here before 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.269
 shutdown for example let's 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.150
 choose sleep click apply 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.430
 look see now we have completion 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.139
 work changed to sleep it means that 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.680
 this button we will have no 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.069
 turn off the computer and bring it in 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.700
 power saving mode 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.410
 in this way you can 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.549
 tune 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:22.740
 my start menu on this video 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.930
 I also finish the lesson on this
