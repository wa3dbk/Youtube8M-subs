00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.420
 this video takes stock of three 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.700
 essential notions that are often 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.000
 confused namely the definition of 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.680
 the image 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.599
 the size of the document and the resolution 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.460
 the definition expressing pixels and 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.579
 corresponds to the IT dimension 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.110
 a digital image 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.509
 usually we express the definition 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.239
 an image indicating the number of 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:36.480
 pixels spread across the width and on the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.040
 height of this one for example we say 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.980
 of the next image that its definition 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.829
 is 40 by 30 which means that she 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.170
 has 40 pixels across and 30 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.030
 on the height is 1200 pixels in 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.769
 most often we are concerned about 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.690
 defining an image 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.379
 when it is intended to be displayed 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.510
 on the screen 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.579
 if this image is intended for 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.929
 the impression will rather be interested in the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.449
 size of the image 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.129
 also called document size the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.380
 size of the document is expressed according to 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.479
 a unit of length most often the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.790
 inch or cm and corresponds to the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.650
 physical dimension of the document it is 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.380
 usually the width of an image 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.910
 by its height on the following example the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.270
 document size and 4 inches from 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.160
 wide by six inches tall 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.720
 the definition and size of documents 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.940
 are two different ways but 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.600
 complementary to describe an image 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.270
 digital 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.070
 indeed the resolution corresponds to the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.020
 number of elements that can be placed at 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.210
 inside a unit of length 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.550
 data to better understand what 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.620
 the resolution let's take a box of 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.040
 rectangular measurement format imposes 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.050
 wide by two inches tall 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.670
 it is possible to align saint bihy's 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.130
 same size inside this box 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.870
 one inch wide 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.360
 if we take back what we saw more 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.490
 early one can say by analogy that the 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.910
 resolution of the box and saint-bihy 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.860
 per inch if we replace this one hand 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.520
 countries smaller in size but 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.009
 same weight 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.989
 it is then possible to align one 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.050
 larger quantity on the same unit 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.420
 length then there are diby by 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.909
 inches the size of the box remains 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.180
 unchanged but its resolution is changed 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:23.579
 she is now 10 countries per inch 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.959
 and as there are now four times 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:30.569
 more balls of the same weight in the 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:32.519
 box the weight of the quadruple box there 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.439
 exactly the same thing happens with 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.810
 the matrix of a completed digital image 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.730
 pixels 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.310
 the box corresponds to a size of 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:46.290
 Documents 4 by 6 inches and each 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.060
 ball corresponds to a pixel so the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.099
 number of pixels that can be placed at 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.379
 inside a linear thumb little 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.049
 varied and determines the resolution of 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.599
 the image and its weight in the example 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.599
 following the resolution of the image is from 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.790
 2 pixels per inch an image composed of 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:06.540
 so few pixels is certainly little 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.489
 heavy but also poorly defined by cons 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.299
 when you add twice as many 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.639
 pixels per inch 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.079
 we increase the resolution of this image 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.870
 to four countries 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.719
 the weight of this quadruple image but 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.450
 it's better defined and so on 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:23.489
 the more we increase the resolution the more 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.680
 document weight increases and more 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.129
 the image displays pixels and therefore 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.829
 details 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:31.530
 it is better defined and gains in 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.750
 quality plus the image and high 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.889
 resolution plus the file that the 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.319
 contains is heavy 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:40.019
 it can be difficult to perceive 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.949
 the difference between two images of very 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.019
 high resolution 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.909
 that's why it's advisable to 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.010
 always choose a resolution that is 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.439
 high enough to get a 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.970
 image of good quality without 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.970
 clutter with files that are too heavy
