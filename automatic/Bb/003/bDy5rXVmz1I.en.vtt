00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.550
 hello so today i'm going to show you how to recover photos 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.920
 on one hand 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.079
 memory cards of the photos that have been erased 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:13.369
 so I say not formatted but easy because formatting can make them 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.049
 disappear completely erased 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.720
 if you are tired of the photos on a map know that they are still not 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.820
 on the map 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.120
 and they disappear little by little in time so if you see that 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.560
 you have it erase pictures on your memory card from your device 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.819
 Photo 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:31.819
 first thing not to take more pictures 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.870
 and then put everything on the card from the microphone to a card reader or 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.500
 other cameras to connect it 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.020
 to your computer and then use the software I'm going to show you this 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.820

 aaron rome the k player 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:42.859
 Sunday for the quarters because 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.950
 and the art on the right he asks me in which directory we wanted to put 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.399
 entry 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:53.399
 but put your pictures and a few years 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.809
 you click on these three small dots 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:58.189
 she told us 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.189
 to your work 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:02.920
 The software 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.890
 that you hands in a donetsk directory that's the one you want 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.359
 you can put in my documents for example 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.089
 ok but pictures 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:13.439
 you can create a pure stop and that it lists cup is reassuring by 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:14.539
 example here 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:17.140
 it asks you after the prefix for images 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.269
 p frauds all the rest 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.959
 so here we start 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.529
 but there it will calm down all the images that are on your device on 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:31.639
 Your card 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.609
 he will also turn the images 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.509
 who are then 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:39.869
 always visible and the images that have been erased 

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:45.679
 some will be 100% recoverable and then you will see and hear the 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:50.939
 images are going to degrade touati that's why just let it 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.509
 work here you see the 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:57.339
 that they work and then if progress up a map he 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:00.339
 this is above all the work will be quickly 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.209
 for me who starts to show recovery photos 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.509
 of if 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:08.579
 so let's finish working 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.269
 of course make sure 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.409
 remains that on the hard drive you have that room left to contain in this 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:15.349
 sense of your card 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.189
 knowing that if jk rowling keeps its vigor 

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:22.229
 it takes at least gilles german we will say 18 gigabit free on my disk 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:22.960
 hard 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.680
 independence is not 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.499
 and then you will see you recover a lot of photos 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:29.580
 here 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.139
 I hope 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.349
 helping us and then maybe helping to save 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:35.680
