your car by yourself is by engaging the
chicken<00:02:22.050> lupus<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:22.590> once<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:22.890> engage<00:02:23.010> the

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
chicken lupus so once you engage the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.470 
chicken lupus so once you engage the
chicken<00:02:23.520> loop<00:02:23.670> you'll<00:02:23.850> see<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.150> kite<00:02:24.360> is

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
chicken loop you'll see the kite is

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.960 
chicken loop you'll see the kite is
going<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.720> fall<00:02:25.140> out<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.410> sky<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.010> land<00:02:26.640> on

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
going to fall out of the sky and land on

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.570 
going to fall out of the sky and land on
the<00:02:27.210> beach<00:02:27.420> or<00:02:27.870> on<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.260> water<00:02:28.590> right<00:02:29.130> now<00:02:29.310> I

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
the beach or on the water right now I

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.610 
the beach or on the water right now I
calculate<00:02:30.240> to<00:02:30.330> land<00:02:30.540> on<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.810> beach<00:02:30.960> then<00:02:31.380> once

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
calculate to land on the beach then once

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.350 
calculate to land on the beach then once
on<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.950> beach<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.400> it's<00:02:32.790> sitting<00:02:32.970> there<00:02:33.090> all

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
on the beach and it's sitting there all

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.450 
on the beach and it's sitting there all
you<00:02:33.450> have<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.630> do<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:33.990> fish<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.590> line<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.070> go

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
you have to do is fish the line and go

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.030 
you have to do is fish the line and go
towards<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.000> kite<00:02:36.990> you'll<00:02:37.590> see<00:02:37.800> you're<00:02:37.920> going

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
towards the kite you'll see you're going

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.100 
towards the kite you'll see you're going
to<00:02:38.100> pass<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.520> bar<00:02:38.730> if<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.660> want<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.900> relaunch

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
to pass the bar if you want to relaunch

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.840 
to pass the bar if you want to relaunch
the<00:02:40.230> kite<00:02:40.440> all<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.650> have<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:40.830> do<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.310> grab

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
the kite all you have to do is a grab

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.410 
the kite all you have to do is a grab
the<00:02:41.970> bar

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
the bar

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.210 
the bar
reset<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.900> chicken<00:02:43.230> loop<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.770> then<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.010> can

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
reset the chicken loop and then you can

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.440 
reset the chicken loop and then you can
relaunch<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.610> car<00:02:44.760> but<00:02:44.880> right<00:02:45.030> now<00:02:45.180> we've

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
relaunch the car but right now we've

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.080 
relaunch the car but right now we've
done<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.930> kiting<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.620> we<00:02:47.370> want<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.670> secure<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
walking towards the kite once you get to

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.720 
walking towards the kite once you get to
the<00:02:51.510> kite<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:52.380> grab<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.709> kite<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.220> you

you<00:02:57.570> another<00:02:58.140> way<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.770> learning<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.550> card<00:02:59.880> by

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
you another way of learning the card by

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.870 
you another way of learning the card by
yourself<00:03:00.450> again<00:03:00.900> there's<00:03:01.770> many<00:03:02.100> ways<00:03:02.280> of

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
yourself again there's many ways of

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.970 
yourself again there's many ways of
lending<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.570> kite<00:03:03.810> or<00:03:04.110> launching<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.770> card

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
lending the kite or launching the card

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.580 
lending the kite or launching the card
but<00:03:05.100> that's<00:03:05.280> another<00:03:05.520> way<00:03:06.170> there's<00:03:07.170> nobody<00:03:07.500> on

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
but that's another way there's nobody on

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.930 
but that's another way there's nobody on
the<00:03:07.739> beach<00:03:07.920> right<00:03:08.070> now<00:03:08.130> it's<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.520> pretty<00:03:08.550> empty

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
the beach right now it's a pretty empty

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.050 
the beach right now it's a pretty empty
okay<00:03:09.600> it's<00:03:09.840> blind<00:03:10.110> probably<00:03:10.560> I'll<00:03:10.770> say<00:03:11.310> 9<00:03:11.670> to

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
okay it's blind probably I'll say 9 to

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.750 
okay it's blind probably I'll say 9 to
12<00:03:12.570> knots<00:03:12.840> I'm<00:03:13.320> on<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.650> infinity<00:03:14.190> right<00:03:14.580> now

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
12 knots I'm on the infinity right now

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.910 
12 knots I'm on the infinity right now
you<00:03:14.820> can<00:03:15.120> see<00:03:15.300> out<00:03:15.390> there<00:03:16.850> it's<00:03:17.850> a<00:03:18.060> pretty<00:03:18.920> it's

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
you can see out there it's a pretty it's

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.860 
you can see out there it's a pretty it's
gusty<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.850> wind<00:03:21.030> has<00:03:21.090> picked<00:03:21.299> up<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.720> mean

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
gusty and the wind has picked up I mean

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.140 
gusty and the wind has picked up I mean
I<00:03:22.140> think<00:03:22.320> that's<00:03:22.560> dose<00:03:22.799> of<00:03:22.980> 12<00:03:23.250> up<00:03:23.430> there<00:03:23.610> so<00:03:23.880> it

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
I think that's dose of 12 up there so it

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.840 
I think that's dose of 12 up there so it
is<00:03:24.510> pretty<00:03:24.900> lit<00:03:25.290> on<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.650> Infinity<00:03:26.130> so<00:03:26.340> there's

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
is pretty lit on the Infinity so there's

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.030 
is pretty lit on the Infinity so there's
few<00:03:27.060> ways<00:03:27.239> I<00:03:27.450> can<00:03:27.660> land<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.500> can<00:03:28.680> release<00:03:28.950> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
few ways I can land it I can release the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.830 
few ways I can land it I can release the
chicken<00:03:29.340> loop<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.700> land<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.269> but<00:03:30.600> I'm<00:03:30.660> going

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
chicken loop and land it but I'm going

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.259 
chicken loop and land it but I'm going
to<00:03:30.930> show<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:31.140> one<00:03:31.650> way<00:03:31.890> of<00:03:32.130> landing<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.910> kite<00:03:33.120> if

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
to show you one way of landing a kite if

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.090 
to show you one way of landing a kite if
you<00:03:33.360> don't<00:03:33.540> have<00:03:33.720> this<00:03:34.170> system<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:34.950> can

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
you don't have this system you can

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.580 
you don't have this system you can
always<00:03:35.280> be<00:03:35.610> land<00:03:36.090> your<00:03:36.450> very<00:03:36.900> safe<00:03:37.170> the

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
always be land your very safe the
