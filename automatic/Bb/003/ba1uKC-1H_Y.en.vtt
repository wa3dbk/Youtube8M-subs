00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 it was wished more often now that 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.730
 I also salad recipes 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.610
 maybe also publish with 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.740
 Dressings and therefore there are 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.769
 today a spring salad with green 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:20.730
 asparagus and a balsam balsamico 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:22.980
 mustard dressing so asparagus you can 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.410
 definitely not just hot dishes 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.930
 so eat in the future 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.000
 whether the recipe or potatoes 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.690
 or something like that but just green spinach 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.640
 It is also great to eat salad 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.170
 I'm not 100% sure 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.579
 whether you can eat it raw, probably 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.800
 but I'm not a christian and 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.950
 that's why he'll be something for me too 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.469
 sautÃ©ed in the pan and for that 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.800
 I've been a little bit since 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:54.800
 coconut fat rhine given or coconut oil and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.969
 I'll heat up now 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.109
 jan in spa so the green asparagus 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.820
 he actually would not have to peel 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.520
 either down here is cut off or 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.110
 what you can stop is that you do that 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.020
 report and then only reports that 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.610
 woody pieces and so see this 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.790
 I never really the bottom piece 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:19.110
 but with white asparagus and make 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:21.119
 I always find delicious it now 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.159
 I lose about 100 grams 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.790
 I've only shared for now 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:33.930
 me the salad and cut the pieces 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:38.420
 small in the spartopf and give them 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.420
 even start 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.810
 which I like asparagus 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.979
 tastes than once rock holders have 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.270
 I'm just a little bit the only one here 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.390
 reste and then I find radish too 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.520
 that's really nice 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:57.210
 fresh spring salad becomes and the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.040
 I'll do a little bit of you a little bit 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:05.729
 I just cut myself in thin 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.930
 slices a few little cherry 20 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.789
 come in 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.140
 I do not always like my taste 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.140
 the tastiest of these tomatoes 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:23.639
 century pipe around a bit of money 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.349
 asked 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:37.510
 I'm only here on the cost 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:39.280
 taste come to the asparagus 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.090
 I would also like to turn over 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.980
 it makes him back and forth that he does not 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.430
 somehow approached from one side only 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.159
 will be for mainz rettinger you 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:58.599
 already such a tablespoon 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:03:01.469
 lemon juice or another teaspoon 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.469
 Mustard 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:14.260
 something and some dark balsamic vinegar 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.550
 I always think it's great if you can 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.560
 because there is a bit of facebook on it 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.810
 or in my fists in the fresh 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.069
 This is just the run 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.069
 with olive oil 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.610
 I'll give you a little pepper 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:43.870
 not missing in it 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.700
 if i'm the fanatic yes and then 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:51.220
 I have a really nice one here 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:53.110
 meet after a few minutes so on 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.510
 small to medium heat is the 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.210
 asparagus then finish the test 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.580
 through that he has to bridge himself like that 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.200
 yes so easily press that you 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.760
 the outside brings then he is with me 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.980
 he was done in his show 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.990
 crisp but of course you can do that 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:18.820
 making long as you so wish from the 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:21.489
 Consistency was even worse for me 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.670
 come are very fresh self-drawn 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.620
 seedlings 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.630
 they also taste really great fresh 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.980
 So I taste earthy and at the same time 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.840
 somehow fresh and are too 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:40.120
 incredibly healthy and increased too 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:57.700
 detoxifying because then the dressing 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:05:00.370
 Over there yes and there you have then completely 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.820

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:07.419

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.750
