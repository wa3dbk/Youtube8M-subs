00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.210
 Hello, My name is Ken Withers, I am the Director of Admissions at York University 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.439
 Located in Toronto 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.840
 York is the third largest university in Canada 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.829
 We have many programs 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.329
 More than 100 bachelor's degree programs and more than 50 master's and doctorate programs 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:36.720
 Giving students the opportunity 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.640
 To choose the specialty they like 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.830
 From the arts, applied arts or engineering 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.340
 Management and other programs 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.660
 Language requests at York University vary 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.449
 Lowest for TOEFL 83 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.750
 And up to 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.680
 100 online TOEFL test (Internet Based Toefl) 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.850
 The IELTS test starts at 6.5 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.210
 And up to 7.5 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.500
 This depends on the sections and programs affiliated to it 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.740
 Students are required to check the applications of each program 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.180
 We also have an English Language Institute 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.780
 In York 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.520
 York University English language Institute 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.290
 In short, yueli 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.820
 I encourage students to visit the site to find out 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.400
 Options available to them at the Language Institute 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.770
 According to their level of language 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.329
 To complete a series of courses and programs 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:36.850
 Which entitles them to enter 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.340
 Direct to the university 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.580
 Yes to undergraduate students 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.400
 York University offers conditional admission 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.050
 Which can be traversed 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.540
 In language institutes 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.430
 Either by passing language tests 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.290
 Or by joining the University Institute without any tests 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.620
 The student is considered eligible for university study 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.010
 If he passes all levels of language at the Institute 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.970
 Graduate students must thoroughly check 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.610
 Of applications for applications to be submitted where there is a possibility for applications such as 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.999
 GRE 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:17.059
 GMAT for management and economy 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:19.499
 LSAT code 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:23.180
 All these tests and applications 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.539
 Located on the university's website for students 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.239
 Submission dates and closing dates 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.329
 If the applicant is a BA student 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.469
 We recommend you apply 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.999
 Before the beginning of the year in the month of Ganiori so that we could have time 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:41.529
 To issue a conditional admission 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:45.090
 And after obtaining the acceptance of the author of the language study 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.449
 And apply for a Canadian study visa 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:48.449
 To obtain them before the beginning of the study 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.370
 For postgraduate students 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.399
 Each program has special requests 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:54.470
 And different dates for submission 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.199
 So we recommend students 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.650
 With a lot of research and investigation 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.169
 To make sure they are 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:02.589
 Ready for all students 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:04.709
 Before applying for the program 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.950
 One of the most common mistakes is not following instructions 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.249
 When submitting 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:16.680
 All applications are clearly defined and on the website 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.479
 We therefore advise students to make sure that all applications are submitted to the university 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:22.470
 And follow all 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.579
 Requests and needs 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:26.360
 Especially for postgraduate studies 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.229
 Such as the request for sponsorship from the student's teachers or any other applications 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:36.609
 Which distinguishes York University for students 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:37.419
 University size 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.139
 And diversity of options 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:43.199
 York University is known for its many programs 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.660
 Yurt University is a modern university 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.790
 Where it was founded about 50 years ago 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.559
 Therefore, all programs adopt new curricula and ideas that keep pace with development 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:52.650
 In many areas 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.339
 And we show things from different quarters 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:57.129
 And I think the most important features 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.859
 York University is multicultural where 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.230
 It is taught by students from 155 countries around the world 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.659
 They study and learn 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:09.140
 This is why York University is considered 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.049
 Multicultural environment and cultures to study 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.229
 And just living in the city of Toronto gives students the opportunity to learn many cultures 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.789
 From the city outside the university 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.019
 Also our slice 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.740
 A large number of Saudis 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:27.789
 In Toronto 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.330
 Which makes it a home away from home 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.659
 Studying in Toronto can be rich 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:36.969
 Experience with Saudi students where they work with 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:39.409
 Students from all over the world 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:43.870
 This is the reality of the world we are now living in "globalization" 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.320
 Students will study and live in 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.330
 everything 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.250
 To be prepared 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.679
 For practical life 

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:54.219
 This is excellent as they break up these experiments at York University 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:57.769
 And because Saudi students come from a place far from Canada 

00:04:57.769 --> 00:05:00.750
 It is good to know that Toronto has a Saudi community 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.280
 All over Toronto
