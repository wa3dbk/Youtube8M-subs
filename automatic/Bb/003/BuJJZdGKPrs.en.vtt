00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:09.220 
okay I have the motor reattached to the

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.800 
okay I have the motor reattached to the
featherweight<00:00:10.220> this<00:00:10.580> is<00:00:11.059> the<00:00:11.240> one<00:00:11.389> that<00:00:11.599> I'm

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:11.810 
featherweight this is the one that I'm

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.700 
featherweight this is the one that I'm
cleaning<00:00:12.820> this<00:00:13.820> is<00:00:13.970> a<00:00:15.309> 1941<00:00:16.309> Singer

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
cleaning this is a 1941 Singer

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.899 
cleaning this is a 1941 Singer
featherweight<00:00:18.710> that<00:00:19.310> came<00:00:21.609> really<00:00:22.609> really

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:22.909 
featherweight that came really really

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:25.089 
featherweight that came really really
dirty<00:00:23.210> and<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:24.109> motor<00:00:24.320> didn't<00:00:24.829> even<00:00:24.919> turn

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
dirty and the motor didn't even turn

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.509 
dirty and the motor didn't even turn
over

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.830 

I've<00:00:28.519> taken<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.210> motor<00:00:29.390> apart<00:00:30.249> and<00:00:31.840> we've

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
I've taken the motor apart and we've

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.400 
I've taken the motor apart and we've
been<00:00:32.989> cleaning<00:00:33.290> it<00:00:33.590> and<00:00:34.149> it<00:00:35.149> just<00:00:35.480> is<00:00:35.720> it<00:00:36.050> has

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
been cleaning it and it just is it has

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.020 
been cleaning it and it just is it has
so<00:00:36.680> much<00:00:36.980> I<00:00:37.460> don't<00:00:38.059> know<00:00:38.210> if<00:00:38.390> they<00:00:38.570> put<00:00:38.870> oil

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
so much I don't know if they put oil

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.610 
so much I don't know if they put oil
inside<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:41.180> motor<00:00:41.390> or<00:00:42.370> grease<00:00:44.559> inside<00:00:45.559> the

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
inside the motor or grease inside the

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.829 
inside the motor or grease inside the
motor<00:00:45.890> it's<00:00:46.879> really<00:00:49.210> hard<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:50.329> say<00:00:50.600> exactly

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
motor it's really hard to say exactly

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.180 
motor it's really hard to say exactly
what<00:00:51.199> they<00:00:51.320> did<00:00:51.559> but<00:00:52.989> one<00:00:53.989> thing<00:00:54.230> I<00:00:54.379> do<00:00:54.440> know<00:00:54.800> is

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
what they did but one thing I do know is

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.770 
what they did but one thing I do know is
they<00:00:56.079> my<00:00:57.079> guess<00:00:57.410> is<00:00:57.800> they<00:00:58.460> I<00:01:01.629> don't<00:01:02.629> know<00:01:02.719> if

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
they my guess is they I don't know if

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.970 
they my guess is they I don't know if
you<00:01:02.870> can<00:01:03.050> see<00:01:03.260> that<00:01:03.440> but<00:01:03.649> that<00:01:05.560> there's<00:01:06.560> a

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
you can see that but that there's a

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.170 
you can see that but that there's a
screw<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:08.150> that<00:01:08.330> is<00:01:08.570> a<00:01:08.840> a<00:01:09.560> brush<00:01:10.070> tube<00:01:10.760> one<00:01:11.150> of

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
screw and that is a a brush tube one of

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.860 
screw and that is a a brush tube one of
the<00:01:11.300> brushes<00:01:13.210> goes<00:01:14.210> in<00:01:14.420> there<00:01:14.630> it's<00:01:14.810> a<00:01:14.840> little

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
the brushes goes in there it's a little

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.670 
the brushes goes in there it's a little
carbon<00:01:15.380> brush<00:01:16.150> attached<00:01:17.150> to<00:01:17.360> a<00:01:17.390> spring<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.110> on

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
carbon brush attached to a spring and on

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.580 
carbon brush attached to a spring and on
both<00:01:19.190> sides<00:01:19.850> of<00:01:20.300> this<00:01:20.450> motor<00:01:20.690> this<00:01:21.020> screw<00:01:21.320> is

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
both sides of this motor this screw is

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.350 
both sides of this motor this screw is
is<00:01:22.070> broken<00:01:22.460> so<00:01:23.110> they've<00:01:24.110> either<00:01:26.110> my<00:01:27.110> theory<00:01:27.920> is

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
is broken so they've either my theory is

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.940 
is broken so they've either my theory is
the<00:01:29.360> previous<00:01:29.720> owners<00:01:30.020> actually<00:01:30.200> put<00:01:30.620> grease

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
the previous owners actually put grease

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.720 
the previous owners actually put grease
down<00:01:31.460> these<00:01:31.730> tubes<00:01:32.090> I<00:01:32.800> call<00:01:33.800> me<00:01:33.920> crazy<00:01:34.160> but<00:01:34.310> I

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
down these tubes I call me crazy but I

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.880 
down these tubes I call me crazy but I
actually<00:01:35.330> think<00:01:35.720> that<00:01:35.840> that's<00:01:36.050> possibly<00:01:36.710> what

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
actually think that that's possibly what

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.670 
actually think that that's possibly what
they<00:01:37.010> did<00:01:37.420> but<00:01:39.430> so<00:01:40.430> far<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:42.170> motor<00:01:42.350> dust

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
they did but so far the motor dust

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.450 
they did but so far the motor dust
turnover

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
turnover

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.649 
turnover
it<00:01:43.520> doesn't<00:01:43.970> sound

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
it doesn't sound

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.940 
it doesn't sound
that<00:01:46.259> great<00:01:47.810> listen<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.289> does<00:01:49.499> change

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
that great listen to it it does change

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.399 
that great listen to it it does change
pitch<00:01:52.429> I'm<00:01:53.429> probably<00:01:53.759> going<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.179> to<00:01:54.420> take

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
pitch I'm probably going to have to take

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.559 
pitch I'm probably going to have to take
it<00:01:55.469> apart<00:01:55.799> again<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.130> try<00:01:56.759> cleaning<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.270> and

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
it apart again and try cleaning it and

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.599 
it apart again and try cleaning it and
continue<00:02:00.569> on<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:01.319> that's<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.130> far<00:02:02.159> that's

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
continue on but that's it so far that's

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:09.949 
continue on but that's it so far that's
that's<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.179> Leica<00:02:06.409> okay<00:02:07.409> by<00:02:07.740> comparison<00:02:08.959> this

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
that's a Leica okay by comparison this

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.710 
that's a Leica okay by comparison this
is<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:11.060> 1951<00:02:12.349> senior<00:02:13.349> featherweight<00:02:14.420> also<00:02:15.420> a

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
is a 1951 senior featherweight also a

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.509 
is a 1951 senior featherweight also a
recent<00:02:16.349> purchase<00:02:16.709> that<00:02:17.129> I<00:02:17.160> bought<00:02:19.129> so<00:02:20.129> let's

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
recent purchase that I bought so let's

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.569 
recent purchase that I bought so let's
let's<00:02:20.700> listen<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.180> motor<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.579> just

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
let's listen to this motor and just

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:28.699 
let's listen to this motor and just
compare<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.090> two<00:02:24.269> sounds<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.959> can<00:02:28.140> hear<00:02:28.200> that

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
compare the two sounds you can hear that

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.699 
compare the two sounds you can hear that
it<00:02:28.890> it's<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.640> starts<00:02:30.629> out<00:02:30.720> pretty<00:02:31.019> quiet

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
it it's a it starts out pretty quiet

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.550 
it it's a it starts out pretty quiet
I<00:02:35.269> cranked<00:02:36.269> it<00:02:36.360> up<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.599> bit<00:02:36.629> it<00:02:36.989> does<00:02:37.200> give<00:02:37.530> a

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
I cranked it up a bit it does give a

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.089 
I cranked it up a bit it does give a
little<00:02:38.150> here<00:02:39.150> somebody<00:02:39.799> vibrations<00:02:40.799> in<00:02:40.980> it

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
little here somebody vibrations in it

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.220 
little here somebody vibrations in it
but<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.579> think<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.480> vibrations<00:02:43.049> are<00:02:43.200> coming

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
but I think the vibrations are coming

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:52.509 
but I think the vibrations are coming
either<00:02:43.680> off<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.160> belt<00:02:47.720> maybe<00:02:48.720> possibly

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.849 

motor<00:02:53.519> touching<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.260> body<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:56.389> machine

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
motor touching the body of the machine

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.970 
motor touching the body of the machine
but<00:02:59.480> other<00:03:00.480> than<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:01.049> sounds<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.919> sounds

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
but other than that it sounds it sounds

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.879 
but other than that it sounds it sounds
really<00:03:02.579> great<00:03:02.910> sounds<00:03:03.359> really<00:03:03.599> quiet<00:03:03.870> so

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.409 

that's<00:03:07.889> what<00:03:08.099> we're<00:03:08.220> after<00:03:08.340> that's<00:03:08.760> that's

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:09.419 
that's what we're after that's that's

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:13.009 
that's what we're after that's that's
the<00:03:09.599> sound<00:03:09.900> we're<00:03:10.560> after<00:03:11.630> for<00:03:12.630> that<00:03:12.750> first

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
the sound we're after for that first

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.070 
the sound we're after for that first
motor

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
motor

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:42.220 
motor
it's<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.590> nice<00:03:15.830> quiet

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.380 

you

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.040
