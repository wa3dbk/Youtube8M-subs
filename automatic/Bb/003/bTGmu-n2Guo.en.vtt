00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.820
 I would like to make dragonfly with origami 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:12.100
 First of all 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.100
 Fold in half to become mountainous 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.779
 Furthermore 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:27.260
 Well halfway Fold it also in half 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:30.400
 It is almost same as how to fold that crane . 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:34.960
 A dragonfly I'm trying to make now 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:39.180
 It is for people who say, so I'll break Well Tsuruga You know anymore 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.500
 Well, it's broken quite easily from now on 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.500
 I wonder if here is fine 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.260
 Yes , I'll spread it out here 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.460
 8 Well, besides this, I also introduce how to fold similar dragonflies . 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.060
 But Well 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.159
 Well yes this is well arranged 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:10.810
 It feels like it's a little different 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:13.479
 Well also tentatively Well how folding of a dragonfly It is like that of 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.890
 I will put the bank 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:22.430
 Please try to make it by all means 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.430
 We cage in the same way as to turn over Well to in 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:41.500
 It is If you break we were their to look like now 8 this 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:46.830
 The left and right are in line with the middle fold 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.830
 I'll wear a little bit and this will make a crease 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.710
 From above this it is is after in 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.710
 Also above 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.630
 Put a crease folded in this manner 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.450
 It is spread out 8 this on 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.450
 Spread out 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:29.060
 It is such a feeling Innovation e 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.060
 I will follow the same way back side too 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.030
 Entered was 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:41.650
 Is Toka guess that autumn colors of say cat of autumn 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.970
 I 'll make it with origami later, but it's still the same red 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.120
 Because 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.120
 You consume a lot of copper 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:58.830
 I think Toka origami that are sold in that set 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:03.080
 There are only 22 and 23 only. 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:07.090
 It looks like I'm not thrilled with any set 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.090
 It falls into such a thing 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.090
 I feel like this 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.640
 It is now is now Te Well Omoteura 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.480
 I just fell into the same way 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.750
 Desolation Once you It is this Stan part 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.750
 Also 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.720
 At the center of 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.080
 To fit well 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.080
 Follow 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.210
 This is also the same I'm the same as here till here 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:50.220
 Ah 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:50.220
 I will fall into a strange feeling, so I turn it over and do the same. 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.760
 In winter 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.760
 Next time I will spread this 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:14.220
 In the case of that string, it is from here 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.890
 I'm going this slightly diagonally 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.630
 Part of the neck 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.709
 What to make 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.190
 In the case of dragonfly , this is fine 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:27.760
 Here or rather horizontal 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.229
 It sounds like it's almost horizontal 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.969
 I have radish 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.969
 In the other side as well 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.490
 Not diagonally 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:41.509
 Something like this 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.509
 I will dig in 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:49.599
 Well, let's make a face part first 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.599
 Hot fight 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:59.970
 I don't care either way 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.970
 I have a little like this 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:15.589
 I thought 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.589
 Please catch it later in the year 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:32.449
 Hey Well it is with him on a part that was placed in the now little 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.749
 Give it up, isn't it 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.749
 this 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.130
 Always torn this seed 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.150
 Something like this 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.150
 Well a little 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:58.580
 I have broken it like this, but originally 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:06:02.470
 It would be good in this I'd parts wanted a little Kohli key 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.470
 Well this looks like the main thing 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:12.289
 It's 8 wings, it's wings Hanehane 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.289
 The wings are down like this 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.349
 On the other side 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.349
 4 I will lower 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:26.050
 Lower it 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:27.750
 Here it's there is a portion that remains in Hana circular saw me it is it 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.120
 This time 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.010
 Iro' in 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.210
 It is in this 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.210
 I want to put in 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.889
 Please push in for 5 years and put in 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:46.860
 It's like this, and it's like this if you spread the wings 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.860
 It sounds like 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:57.510
 So the last one is the last part of this feather with two scissors . 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:01.310
 Maybe you will divide 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:08.600
 If you think like this 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:10.190
 Well, this is the completion of the dragonfly A little part of the face and part of the girl's face will be broken 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.820
 But it is actually 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:17.940
 Just before the line 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:20.340
 Well, it looks like this is when you put a cut and get down 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:23.950
 I'm right now 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:26.940
 What if you feel like jumping out 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.940
 See you again 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.460
 In the form to be put in and 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.769
 Something like this 

00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:37.769
 I think it is a weapon 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:44.409
 Then there are also 8 other ways to fold other dragons, so try digging there too 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.909
 Please give me 

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:47.909
 Thank you for watching
