00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.180 
and then we're going to add two dots in
the<00:03:57.250> wet<00:03:57.460> icing<00:03:57.730> and<00:03:58.240> drag<00:03:58.540> them<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:59.890> create

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
the wet icing and drag them to create

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.820 
the wet icing and drag them to create
like<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:01.300> pleats<00:04:01.660> kind<00:04:02.110> of<00:04:02.320> ish<00:04:04.020> dot<00:04:05.020> here<00:04:05.650> and

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
like the pleats kind of ish dot here and

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.090 
like the pleats kind of ish dot here and
a<00:04:06.070> dot<00:04:06.100> here<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:07.660> then<00:04:08.230> we<00:04:08.410> can<00:04:08.530> just<00:04:08.770> pull

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
a dot here and then we can just pull

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.920 
a dot here and then we can just pull
them

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.450 

like<00:04:14.470> that

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:17.460 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.980 

we<00:04:18.460> can<00:04:18.640> immediately<00:04:18.880> do<00:04:19.360> the<00:04:19.510> other<00:04:19.660> side

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:19.990 
we can immediately do the other side

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:38.920 
we can immediately do the other side
because<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.680> center<00:04:21.160> is<00:04:21.340> already<00:04:21.550> crusted

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:05:01.820 

you<00:04:39.860> are<00:04:40.009> two<00:04:40.280> dots

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.110 

the<00:05:02.830> last<00:05:03.099> touch<00:05:03.490> I'm<00:05:04.300> going<00:05:04.569> to<00:05:04.629> outline<00:05:06.120> the

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
the last touch I'm going to outline the

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.420 
the last touch I'm going to outline the
heart<00:05:07.419> and<00:05:07.689> kind<00:05:08.439> of<00:05:08.499> hide<00:05:08.680> that<00:05:08.979> seeing

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
heart and kind of hide that seeing

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.579 
heart and kind of hide that seeing
whether<00:05:09.699> two<00:05:09.939> colors<00:05:10.330> meet<00:05:12.449> and<00:05:13.449> now<00:05:14.169> I'm<00:05:14.379> just
