00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
under wrap we're going to put our blade

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.869 
under wrap we're going to put our blade
on<00:00:39.899> there<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.980> we're<00:00:41.160> going<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.340> pry<00:00:41.640> up<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
old thread and it should come off in a

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.870 
old thread and it should come off in a
piece<00:00:44.610> one<00:00:44.969> solid<00:00:45.450> piece

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
piece one solid piece

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.000 
piece one solid piece
we're<00:00:47.420> going<00:00:47.540> to<00:00:47.600> keep<00:00:47.750> picking<00:00:47.930> at<00:00:48.200> it<00:00:48.260> until

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
we're going to keep picking at it until

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.540 
we're going to keep picking at it until
we<00:00:49.100> can<00:00:49.280> try<00:00:50.060> to<00:00:50.090> get<00:00:50.329> one<00:00:50.750> string<00:00:51.309> well<00:00:52.309> more

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
we can try to get one string well more

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.460 
we can try to get one string well more
than<00:00:52.579> one<00:00:52.850> string<00:00:53.300> and<00:00:53.570> continue<00:00:54.020> to<00:00:54.110> remove

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
than one string and continue to remove

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.240 
than one string and continue to remove
the<00:00:54.730> entire<00:00:55.730> thread<00:00:56.720> wrap<00:00:57.020> this<00:00:57.590> one's<00:00:57.890> double

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
the entire thread wrap this one's double

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.930 
the entire thread wrap this one's double
overact

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
overact

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.660 
overact
so<00:00:59.809> there's<00:00:59.989> two<00:01:00.230> layers<00:01:00.379> of<00:01:00.590> thread

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
we're going to warm up the other side

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.740 
we're going to warm up the other side
now<00:01:06.620> that<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.010> front<00:01:07.910> guide<00:01:08.440> foot<00:01:09.440> is<00:01:09.680> removed

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
now that the front guide foot is removed

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.390 
now that the front guide foot is removed
again<00:01:11.750> we're<00:01:11.900> going<00:01:11.990> to<00:01:12.050> filet<00:01:12.470> right<00:01:12.740> across

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
again we're going to filet right across

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.340 
again we're going to filet right across
the<00:01:13.640> top

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
the top

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.680

making<00:01:16.100> sure<00:01:16.130> that<00:01:16.340> we<00:01:16.730> keep<00:01:16.940> the<00:01:17.120> razor<00:01:17.330> blade

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
making sure that we keep the razor blade

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.190 
making sure that we keep the razor blade
on<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.560> guide<00:01:18.770> so<00:01:19.430> we<00:01:19.550> don't<00:01:19.760> ruin<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:20.930> blank

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200

I'm going to cut the thread place it
through<00:03:21.310> loop<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:23.580> then<00:03:24.580> pull<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:25.000> throat

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.650 
through loop and then pull the throat
bring<00:03:26.710> it<00:03:26.830> back<00:03:26.980> this<00:03:27.190> way<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.970> cut<00:03:28.360> off<00:03:28.480> our

bring it back this way and cut off our
tag<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.140> now<00:03:29.560> we<00:03:29.620> can<00:03:29.890> take<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.070> fingernail<00:03:30.670> or

the back edge of the razor and we can

the back edge of the razor and we can
just<00:03:33.850> burnish<00:03:34.240> the<00:03:34.390> threads<00:03:34.630> together<00:03:34.810> and

just burnish the threads together and

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.780 
just burnish the threads together and
remove<00:03:35.710> any<00:03:36.090> small<00:03:37.710> spaces<00:03:38.710> that<00:03:38.860> we<00:03:39.010> see<00:03:39.250> and

remove any small spaces that we see and

remove any small spaces that we see and
we're<00:03:39.910> going<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.120> go<00:03:40.300> to<00:03:40.360> this<00:03:40.540> side<00:03:40.810> and

repeat the process again at this point
the<00:03:44.080> both<00:03:44.230> wraps<00:03:44.530> will<00:03:44.710> be<00:03:44.800> in<00:03:44.920> place<00:03:45.160> we'd<00:03:45.460> be
