00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 
as you can see we've got the pattern up

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.400 
as you can see we've got the pattern up
there<00:00:16.300> and<00:00:17.300> then<00:00:17.420> we<00:00:17.510> have<00:00:17.690> the<00:00:17.840> story<00:00:18.110> pole

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
there and then we have the story pole

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.300 
there and then we have the story pole
and<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:19.730> way<00:00:19.850> this<00:00:20.090> works<00:00:20.390> is<00:00:20.779> that<00:00:21.740> and<00:00:22.160> you

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
and the way this works is that and you

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.240 
and the way this works is that and you
got<00:00:22.550> this<00:00:23.109> setting<00:00:24.109> on<00:00:24.259> the<00:00:24.439> hinge<00:00:24.679> exactly

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
got this setting on the hinge exactly

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.089 
got this setting on the hinge exactly
where<00:00:25.429> it<00:00:25.490> needs<00:00:25.699> to<00:00:25.820> go<00:00:25.910> on<00:00:26.470> the<00:00:27.470> top<00:00:27.769> of<00:00:27.980> this

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
where it needs to go on the top of this

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
will drill a hole on each side so that

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:09.300 
will drill a hole on each side so that
we<00:03:54.209> can<00:03:54.390> set<00:03:54.569> it<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.959> door

okay we're fixing the round out for the
hinges<00:04:26.060> and<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:27.380> first<00:04:27.590> thing<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:28.480> we<00:04:29.480> need

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
hinges and the first thing that we need

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.350 
hinges and the first thing that we need
to<00:04:30.280> discuss<00:04:31.280> is<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.910> router<00:04:32.500> with<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.530> bed

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
to discuss is the router with the bed

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.260 
to discuss is the router with the bed
that's<00:04:35.360> he<00:04:35.540> used<00:04:35.840> to<00:04:36.760> write<00:04:37.760> out<00:04:37.910> the<00:04:38.060> hinge

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
that's he used to write out the hinge

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.170 
that's he used to write out the hinge
and<00:04:38.680> there's<00:04:39.680> a<00:04:39.740> bearing<00:04:40.190> those<00:04:40.550> bearing<00:04:41.090> at
