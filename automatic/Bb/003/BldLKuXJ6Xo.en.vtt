 cell phones usually this is very 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.590
 uncommon to be using an external entity 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.940
 or a secondary lens what are 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.040
 releases of cell phones since 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.510
 lately, companies have been 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.369
 focused a lot on improving what are the 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.430
 cameras in this case what is the camera 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.020

 good product as completely sent 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.290
 free if the below in the description 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.240
 There is the link of what this company is 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.140
 You can get it on the website of 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.660
 them for 69 dollars and 99 cents 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.850
 let's say this 70 dollars let's see how 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:43.009
 we can open this in a quick way 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.080
 and effective and as we see as without 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.060
 break it up really good let's see here 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.490
 what's out came here is what is the 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.690
 we are going to put a lens on the 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.270
 part of the bottom the other in what is a 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.130
 small cast to be able to save 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.679
 our lens since this is an article 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.060
 portable that we are going to have to use in 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.729
 our pockets and bring what they are 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.530
 some small covers of the lenses 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.240
 the most it brings that we are going to put 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.569
 aside a few small cards 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.290
 presentation of social networks of the 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.019
 company only clip on twitter and in 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.540
 just click dotcom and on facebook created and 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.629
 in instagram they are called just click and we 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.220
 can they check if they want to see 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.830
 this photos of 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.320
 users doing this using what 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.700
 are these lenses the good thing here is what 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.830
 which is the product itself as you can see 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.260
 the part of here in a pretty plastic 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.900
 hard as I've seen reviewed I've 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.180
 put to read a bit this attracts what 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.300
 It is approximately two lenses per each 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.710
 piece on what is each side so as 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.900
 you can see look at these lenses are 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.390
 removable to be able to remove them then 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.040
 simply unscrew them moss and what 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.110
 this results in us being able to use what 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.930
 are the secondary lenses this is of 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.570
 down here I do not know if I'm in it 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.830
 correct one comes to be the fis eye and the 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.590
 another I think it comes to be in a way 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.090
 We will remove this lens 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.180
 also and look, we can use what they are 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.800
 these two lenses individually or 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.650
 it works in the following way we have 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.909
 that and we have what they are 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.730
 an option of 15 macro or a zoom of 15 and 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:20.390
 is this is the cool angol if you can 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.390
 see here and it's 10 macros good not 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.970
 specifies what are the options that brings 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.490
 15 macro let's see if the camera we 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.500
 help 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.720
 if it gets faster than what 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.040
 should be 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.810
 ok then this one when installing it 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.000
 well, it's a pretty plastic 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.550
 hard which will allow us to have a 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.110
 little more durability that's very 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.110
 simple we put it this way 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.890
 we'll see 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.450
 we put this part first and then 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.280
 we proceed to put what is the part of 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.010
 down here we already have an option to use what 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.870
 what is this lens and we are going to show you 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.940
 this the different form of the one that took 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.319
 photos although you would see what the lens is 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.409
 what is 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.020
 this cell phone as you can see here 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:12.430
 we have a 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:14.890
 its exceedingly strong the truth that 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.890
 let's see if he manages to focus on something already 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.500
 we have a paper around here you do not see my 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.620
 hand I think the zoom is too much and the 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.470
 camera like it costs a little 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.660
 focus 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.640
 let's see where the camera is fighting 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.010
 no gentlemen i think this is the 15 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.320
 macros and I'm not wrong and we're going to 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.160
 proceed to put him for example a lens 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.160
 to know how it is 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.000
 we already put it and there are also gentlemen 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:44.340
 this is like in fish mode there is no 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.409
 I'm wrong there's no angle anymore 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.599
 Panoramic can see the difference 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:50.800
 what are the photos inclusive and about 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:53.050
 everything I think here looks 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.699
 a friend foot down here but good very 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.740
 very but very good gentlemen gives us 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.539
 a different option when taking 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.870
 photos I consider that this kind of 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:03.280
 covers is for those people who are 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.560
 quite fanatical in which they are this 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.569
 taking pictures and everything else since 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.780
 this one gives us many options that 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:12.340
 general, our cell phone does not bring them 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.930
 good to use what is the other lens 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.629
 we just put it in the part 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.370
 contrary to what our cell phone is and 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:19.659
 as you can see before we did not have to 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.520
 this side now let's use what is 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:23.860
 In contrast lens we will proceed to 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.969
 put what is the other lens that comes 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.600
 to be the white and gold wide angle 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:32.850
 we simply roll it up gentlemen 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.490
 and look there is not a little option 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.620
 less this on the sides a little less 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.270
 I think the other one was the 'pisha' and this 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:44.030
 gives us a simple angle option 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.030
 to this width we will proceed to remove it 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.940
 and what is the option of photos because 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.640
 they notice what is a little more zoom 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.100
 let's see if it manages to focus the 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.650
 phone 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.520
 in something 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.520
 it seems that no 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:02.679
 to see then for some reason gentlemen not 

00:05:59.739 --> 00:06:05.949
 I know if it's because of the camera's proximity 

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:07.779
 he manages to focus that with the lenses out 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:10.419
 in absolutely nothing I have no idea why 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:13.449
 what to expect I do not know if the 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:15.279
 zoom or I have to focus things much more 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.729
 far but the mere and with what are the 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:20.709
 lenses on if it gives us this very 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:23.639
 but that very good photo options 

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:26.169
 like this one that is for example the fis there 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:27.759
 how can you put here here and 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.129
 this other one that we have since that is the 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:33.310
 white and work for some reason I do not know 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:35.830
 why does not the 10 x work? 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.770
 I do not know if it's supposed to work but 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.810
 he just focuses it but well there 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.420
 is gentlemen this brings its covers 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:48.570
 let's put it upside down here so that 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.570
 can you see this let's put this here 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.800
 and the other one in this place can be this 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.509
 the bag of 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.330
 to be able to charge what are the lenses 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:00.620
 you can in the case that we are not 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.789
 what our cell using it 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.500
 we just dismantled it and already 

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:05.870
 we proceed to save what is this 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.629
 place is a bit expensive the product 70 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.879
 dollars to the truth that you have to be 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:12.710
 very, very fanatical what are the 

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:14.840
 photos upload many photos to your networks 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.180
 social or work in the aspect of what 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.370
 what is the photograph to pay 70 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.889
 dollars so this product to the 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.750
 very good quality this option is 

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:25.610
 different from mine at least it worked for me 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.919
 only two options did not work for me or 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:30.020
 the 10 x nor the 15 x only me 

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:32.210
 they worked what are the lenses themselves 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.500
 we are doing something bad to you 

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.699
 but there is the product, gentlemen who 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.110
 is in the description will be the 

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:39.099
 link to visit the website 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.099
 if you are interested in him 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:45.240
 and then I give it a seven it seems to me that 

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:48.300
 this is very limited the group of people 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.330
 that they would use these types of products I think 

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.409
 that I repeat again those that are more 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.870
 focused or addressed to what is 

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:56.759
 this the world or the business of the 

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.770
 photograph me with this step to say goodbye 

00:07:56.759 --> 00:08:02.460
 gentlemen only clip tx we are force ending 

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:03.990
 products for me saw the way yesterday 

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.639

 some answer to why it did not work 

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.729

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.169

00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:18.979
