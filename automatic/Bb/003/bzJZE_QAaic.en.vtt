but I really think we're in the cusp of
something<00:02:56.220> now<00:02:56.670> because<00:02:56.880> I've<00:02:57.810> said<00:02:58.020> it

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
before the Premier League is a very

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.490 
before the Premier League is a very
tough<00:02:59.250> nut<00:02:59.460> to<00:02:59.490> crack<00:02:59.640> but<00:03:00.090> there's<00:03:00.630> no<00:03:00.930> better

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500
