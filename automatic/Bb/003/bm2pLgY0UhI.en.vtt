hey guys how's it going so I just

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.160 
hey guys how's it going so I just
received<00:00:07.810> my<00:00:08.430> Tara<00:00:09.430> Lux<00:00:09.700> LED<00:00:10.570> conversion<00:00:10.990> kit

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.170 
received my Tara Lux LED conversion kit

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.510 
received my Tara Lux LED conversion kit
today<00:00:11.410> in<00:00:11.500> a<00:00:11.559> post<00:00:11.770> and<00:00:12.039> I<00:00:12.070> thought<00:00:12.219> I'd<00:00:12.369> do<00:00:12.490> a

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:12.520 
today in a post and I thought I'd do a

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.570 
today in a post and I thought I'd do a
quick<00:00:12.670> video<00:00:13.389> just<00:00:13.449> to<00:00:13.780> show<00:00:13.840> you<00:00:13.990> guys<00:00:14.580> what

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
quick video just to show you guys what

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.939 
quick video just to show you guys what
it<00:00:15.670> looks<00:00:15.820> like<00:00:15.910> when<00:00:16.059> it<00:00:16.150> comes<00:00:16.180> and<00:00:16.830> what<00:00:17.830> it

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:17.949 
it looks like when it comes and what it

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.450 
it looks like when it comes and what it
looks<00:00:18.070> like<00:00:18.279> when<00:00:18.460> it's<00:00:18.580> in<00:00:18.699> the<00:00:18.789> mag<00:00:18.910> light<00:00:19.119> so

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
looks like when it's in the mag light so

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.390 
looks like when it's in the mag light so
here<00:00:21.460> it<00:00:21.550> is<00:00:21.670> here<00:00:21.700> it's<00:00:22.000> in<00:00:22.150> on<00:00:22.300> some<00:00:22.750> nice

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
here it is here it's in on some nice

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.910 
here it is here it's in on some nice
blister<00:00:24.400> packaging<00:00:24.610> as<00:00:25.030> always<00:00:25.710> there's<00:00:26.710> the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
blister packaging as always there's the

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.450 
blister packaging as always there's the
bulb<00:00:27.130> itself<00:00:28.410> refocus<00:00:31.020> so<00:00:32.020> let's<00:00:32.169> say<00:00:32.460> another

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
bulb itself refocus so let's say another

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.030 
bulb itself refocus so let's say another
very<00:00:33.670> big<00:00:33.789> bowl<00:00:34.030> but<00:00:34.469> right<00:00:35.469> at<00:00:35.650> the<00:00:35.710> top<00:00:36.010> there

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
very big bowl but right at the top there

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.520 
very big bowl but right at the top there
you<00:00:36.250> can<00:00:36.460> see<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:37.180> very<00:00:37.720> small<00:00:38.079> LED<00:00:38.650> light<00:00:38.860> and

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
you can see the very small LED light and

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.130 
you can see the very small LED light and
in<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.649> very<00:00:41.800> bottom<00:00:41.950> of<00:00:42.160> it<00:00:43.140> interesting

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
in the very bottom of it interesting

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.139 
in the very bottom of it interesting
green<00:00:44.500> base<00:00:44.980> to<00:00:45.310> it<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:47.220> apparently<00:00:48.220> this<00:00:48.940> is

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
green base to it so apparently this is

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.459 
green base to it so apparently this is
for<00:00:49.420> a<00:00:49.450> two<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:51.160> free<00:00:52.410> C<00:00:53.410> or<00:00:53.590> D<00:00:53.620> mag<00:00:54.250> light<00:00:54.430> it's

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
for a two to free C or D mag light it's

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:06.929 
for a two to free C or D mag light it's
part<00:00:56.469> number<00:01:04.469> th613<00:01:05.469> of<00:01:05.590> this<00:01:05.770> but<00:01:06.700> I<00:01:06.729> thought

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
part number th613 of this but I thought

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.789 
part number th613 of this but I thought
I'd<00:01:07.090> give<00:01:07.240> it<00:01:07.270> a<00:01:07.360> go<00:01:07.390> it<00:01:07.719> was<00:01:07.840> twenty<00:01:08.530> dollars

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
I'd give it a go it was twenty dollars

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.309 
I'd give it a go it was twenty dollars
including<00:01:09.009> shipping<00:01:09.549> from<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.789> US<00:01:10.060> so<00:01:10.929> why

00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:11.319 
including shipping from the US so why

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:14.399 
including shipping from the US so why
not<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:13.030> apparently<00:01:13.659> this<00:01:13.929> thing<00:01:14.170> is<00:01:14.289> going

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
not so apparently this thing is going

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.969 
not so apparently this thing is going
together<00:01:14.679> up<00:01:14.979> to<00:01:15.329> 140<00:01:16.329> lumens<00:01:16.780> which<00:01:17.679> is

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
together up to 140 lumens which is

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.010 
together up to 140 lumens which is
approximately<00:01:18.609> twenty<00:01:19.299> more<00:01:19.479> than<00:01:19.840> the

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
approximately twenty more than the

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.980 
approximately twenty more than the
standard<00:01:20.619> for<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.189> mag<00:01:22.119> light<00:01:22.299> values<00:01:22.630> in<00:01:22.810> the

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
standard for the mag light values in the

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.980 
standard for the mag light values in the
filament<00:01:23.619> incandescent<00:01:24.009> bulb<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.689> one

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
filament incandescent bulb the one

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.649 
filament incandescent bulb the one
hundred<00:01:26.200> and<00:01:26.259> twenty<00:01:26.560> two<00:01:26.590> point<00:01:27.159> one<00:01:27.659> so

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
hundred and twenty two point one so

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.199 
hundred and twenty two point one so
we'll<00:01:28.810> see<00:01:28.899> how<00:01:28.990> we<00:01:29.020> go<00:01:29.229> I've<00:01:29.499> got<00:01:30.100> some<00:01:30.429> brand

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:31.209 
we'll see how we go I've got some brand

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:33.029 
we'll see how we go I've got some brand
new<00:01:31.270> Duracell<00:01:31.869> batteries<00:01:32.229> here<00:01:32.439> as<00:01:32.529> well<00:01:32.740> just

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
new Duracell batteries here as well just

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.120 
new Duracell batteries here as well just
so<00:01:33.219> we'll<00:01:33.369> see<00:01:33.639> if<00:01:33.789> we<00:01:34.509> get<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.049> best<00:01:35.649> results

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
so we'll see if we get the best results

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.919 
so we'll see if we get the best results
from<00:01:36.219> the<00:01:36.369> test<00:01:36.609> all<00:01:37.179> right<00:01:37.329> so<00:01:37.599> I've<00:01:37.749> removed

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
from the test all right so I've removed

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.080 
from the test all right so I've removed
the<00:01:38.319> bulb<00:01:38.889> out<00:01:39.039> the<00:01:39.189> back<00:01:39.459> and<00:01:40.740> took<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:41.950> old

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the bulb out the back and took the old

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.940 
the bulb out the back and took the old
old<00:01:43.090> LED<00:01:43.569> bulb<00:01:43.810> out<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.319> mag<00:01:44.469> light<00:01:44.649> you<00:01:44.799> can

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
old LED bulb out the mag light you can

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.889 
old LED bulb out the mag light you can
see<00:01:45.069> that<00:01:45.279> they<00:01:45.399> are<00:01:45.689> slightly<00:01:46.689> different

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
see that they are slightly different

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.050 
see that they are slightly different
size<00:01:47.469> but<00:01:47.770> on<00:01:47.859> the<00:01:47.979> right<00:01:48.219> is<00:01:48.459> the<00:01:48.639> old<00:01:48.789> one

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
size but on the right is the old one

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.440 
size but on the right is the old one
which<00:01:49.749> is<00:01:49.929> just<00:01:50.109> a<00:01:50.200> cheapy<00:01:50.849> LED<00:01:51.849> style<00:01:52.209> bulb

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
which is just a cheapy LED style bulb

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.419 
which is just a cheapy LED style bulb
and<00:01:52.630> then<00:01:52.749> on<00:01:52.869> the<00:01:52.959> left<00:01:53.200> is<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.529> new<00:01:53.709> Tara<00:01:54.249> Lux

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
and then on the left is the new Tara Lux

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.879 
and then on the left is the new Tara Lux
bulb<00:01:55.079> I've<00:01:56.079> taken<00:01:56.319> out<00:01:56.469> the<00:01:56.560> Maglite

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:56.889 
bulb I've taken out the Maglite

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:58.980 
bulb I've taken out the Maglite
obviously<00:01:57.279> as<00:01:57.399> well<00:01:57.579> there's<00:01:57.849> the<00:01:58.029> hole<00:01:58.749> there

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
obviously as well there's the hole there

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.620 
obviously as well there's the hole there
and<00:01:59.679> the<00:02:00.279> mega<00:02:00.429> watt<00:02:00.579> which<00:02:00.729> is<00:02:00.849> in<00:02:00.969> a<00:02:01.119> bit<00:02:01.479> of<00:02:01.569> a

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
and the mega watt which is in a bit of a

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.690 
and the mega watt which is in a bit of a
rough<00:02:01.810> state<00:02:02.139> I<00:02:02.499> use<00:02:02.739> it<00:02:02.889> as<00:02:02.979> a<00:02:03.009> hammer<00:02:03.279> as<00:02:03.549> well

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
rough state I use it as a hammer as well

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.539 
rough state I use it as a hammer as well
as<00:02:03.849> a<00:02:03.880> well<00:02:04.599> as<00:02:04.719> a<00:02:04.749> torch<00:02:05.079> all<00:02:05.979> right<00:02:06.099> so<00:02:06.340> let's

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
as a well as a torch all right so let's

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.760 
as a well as a torch all right so let's
pop<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.389> bulb<00:02:07.599> in<00:02:07.749> and<00:02:07.929> see<00:02:08.200> here<00:02:08.289> we<00:02:08.380> go

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
pop the bulb in and see here we go

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.070 
pop the bulb in and see here we go
alrighty<00:02:09.610> so<00:02:09.819> set<00:02:10.090> that<00:02:10.119> side<00:02:10.509> here<00:02:10.720> just<00:02:10.929> to

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
alrighty so set that side here just to

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.070 
alrighty so set that side here just to
show<00:02:11.110> you

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
show you

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.260 
show you
were<00:02:12.170> how<00:02:12.590> bright<00:02:12.950> this<00:02:13.340> thing<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:13.790> really<00:02:14.090> in

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
were how bright this thing is really in

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.760
