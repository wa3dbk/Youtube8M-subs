00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.510
 Yes hi psd 2000 is the introduction of a 20 million and 10 million 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.740
 It is introduction It is often said 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:18.180
 Dotchigao Well current example or recommend is what Nde have struck here 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.020
 Which one disc and 20 million yen are recommended 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.260
 First wonder of this 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:33.360
 That's still an organic el organic el is well color As can be seen on the screen over 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:39.430
 Here the I is But But I beautiful'm clean I guess 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.890
 It's better to use both of these 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:47.850
 here 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:51.989
 Abene- I had something to say on the first day, but it is still light when used for a long time 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:56.250
 I'm absolutely telling you here 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:00.880
 Then when the people of Koch screen refers to a nail to say probably pretty So organic el 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.970
 Here is h like a sound glass plate of a cat 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:08.710
 I think you will like a glass plate Imai This is a very thin 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.150
 Because the surface here is also thin in order to thin that piece vita to have it 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.070
 I wonder what 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:21.010
 I see that there is a part of the liquid crystal in the back in the back. 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:27.680
 Because here and here the glass part is very expensive 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:28.400
 Whether there is really 1 mm in a little bit behind, it might be a story below 12 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.830
 But 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:38.910
 Okui But I image that there is a liquid crystal here is due to be made thinner here 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:43.140
 I wonder if there is a liquid crystal in the amazing Umaji house 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:49.440
 It's a secret to it, but I can say it with this ipad air 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:52.620
 By cutting the surface here, a by- product that looks very beautiful comes out 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.550
 So that night from here 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.080
 Hey I 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:02.720
 I can see it clean as a liquid crystal 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:08.720
 I'm here for the color development and other things 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:12.170
 Thus to it carefully amazing that the back because here is thinned to feel that you say 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:18.050
 It is big to say that you can see in the part close to the eyes 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.620
 If it's over a video camera, what's that? It's an opportunity because it's an opportunity, so I'll say this too 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.920
 right 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.710
 Value is not ginger standing color that would look beautiful 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.190
 Already different 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:30.510
 Hanashi聞 the system to a completely different also Toka Press ease of error Le button push Come overwhelmingly 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:36.570
 This is good 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.710
 Exactly when I told you I became a cheesy by finished hope here after all 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.700
 There was no such a thing 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:47.290
 If you never been only does it Which is good'm my opinion Which bought 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:51.530
 For the people I mean you say you recommend here I am here 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:58.120
 It's already absolute because the portable device of Tteyuu light his thin 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:03.940
 Well this I can not exactly do that when told do not like that and and hide 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:06.650
 It is not really good, but during this day, each day of the Kagaya Kouho Dental Association looks very narrow 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:13.459
 For example 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:17.239
 As you do this effect we have not reflected here anymore and I think kneaded by is reflected here at all 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:21.860
 I think this is just over the video camera 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:24.150
 Because it is over the video camera called 60 frame progressive 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.950
 This viewing angle is 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:38.430
 With this kind of feeling this may come to me and I may not think I can not see it 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:39.180
 But when I looked at it with my own eyes, I wondered if my teeth and jaws would not collapse 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.230
 Speaking of 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.080
 Sea lions have a wide viewing angle, though 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:51.220
 Colepa 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:52.150
 Because there is no one to try it, there is no problem at all in the viewing angle from this side 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:58.060
 Say this 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:59.060
 I will certainly be say'm Sorya likely mon's organic el if the Chinayarikata 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.959
 but 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:06.860
 Janda not Thats not do use 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:12.950
 The minute I'll be that it is mild here is an example Yone' 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:13.550
 After Which Tsu To use it go off you But now I Engineering pitch s such Les beads 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.660
 Beater 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.079
 While I just did the difference between 2000 and the lathe 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.919
 It is different to use 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:25.280
 Here is Which was the moving image such do and have recommended it is 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.280
 Fiber
