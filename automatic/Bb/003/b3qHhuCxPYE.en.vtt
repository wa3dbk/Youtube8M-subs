00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.950
 hello my name is thiago I am 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.170
 owner of the bus company was the 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.900
 Sao Paulo and today, voting for 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.570
 you one more of our rtf machines 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.849
 We have the prompt delivery here on the drug. 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.820
 and it was this model here that you are 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:23.380
 seeing is well known is the microscope 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:26.200
 have this xl it's that big with 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:30.610
 larger engines have a capacity of 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:33.070
 charge up to one pound and two hundred you 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.920
 may be using it since 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.820
 a pro goal even a bet with a 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.859
 canon 7d and the good that I really like is that 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.140
 this type of embu despite being a 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.670
 little obsolete today in the market is a 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.129
 Good that you may be putting 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.829
 any kind of camera practically and 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.530
 also yields that before sony is 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.339
 especially the pj line that you will 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.109
 have a better stabilization of this 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.780
 system is that it works very well 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:04.930
 especially for those who want 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.920
 make photo and the staff wants to make video 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.200
 both for industrial inspection or even 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.909
 even aerial survey videos are 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.030
 machine that is very good 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.700
 is a machine more in mind is compared 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.979
 cuts and the great advantage in my view is 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.719
 because it is smaller than the octa it is 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.630
 easy to transport you can 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:28.329
 buying an aluminum hard case for 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.549
 take it all mounted very easy you 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.590
 find new leroy merlin you 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.369
 find a raid case that she finishes 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:40.780
 of you have liked this one here 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.789
 here is the model mks a xl is something that 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.009
 I forgot to comment on the flight time 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.310
 with a battery of 10,000 and a camera 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:51.100
 small like a sony nex for example 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.000
 you will have here a flight time of 15 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.039
 minutes 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.560
 this machine depending on the configuration 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.640
 of your battery it can do there flight 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.640
 more than 25 minutes
