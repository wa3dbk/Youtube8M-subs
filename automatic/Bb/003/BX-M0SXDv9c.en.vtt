what's beauty without a little effort

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.670 
what's beauty without a little effort
you<00:01:54.330> know

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.890 

first<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:01.190> start<00:02:01.520> I<00:02:01.820> filled<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.360> plastic

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
first to start I filled the plastic

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.200 
first to start I filled the plastic
container<00:02:03.290> with<00:02:03.440> hot<00:02:03.590> water<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:04.400> salt

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
container with hot water and salt

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.360 
container with hot water and salt
according<00:02:05.540> to<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.260> measurements<00:02:06.650> on<00:02:07.010> the<00:02:07.160> rip

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
according to the measurements on the rip

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.780 
according to the measurements on the rip
box<00:02:07.750> then<00:02:08.750> I<00:02:09.080> added<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.650> rig<00:02:09.980> and<00:02:10.190> mixed<00:02:10.670> it

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
box then I added the rig and mixed it

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:28.600 
box then I added the rig and mixed it
all<00:02:10.910> together<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:27.200> yokel<00:02:27.620> on<00:02:27.800> here<00:02:28.100> can<00:02:28.370> only

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
all together so yokel on here can only

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.420 
all together so yokel on here can only
withstand<00:02:28.970> a<00:02:29.570> certain<00:02:29.810> amount<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.320> heat<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:31.400> I

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
withstand a certain amount of heat so I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.640 
withstand a certain amount of heat so I
made<00:02:31.820> sure<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:32.180> submerge<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.140> hair<00:02:33.380> and

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
made sure to submerge the hair and
