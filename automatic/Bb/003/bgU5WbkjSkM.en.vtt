00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
breakfast later but I'll do that at

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.189 
breakfast later but I'll do that at
another<00:05:03.550> time<00:05:03.759> but<00:05:04.509> just<00:05:04.780> want<00:05:04.930> to<00:05:04.960> give<00:05:05.169> a

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
another time but just want to give a

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.950 
another time but just want to give a
real<00:05:05.380> quick<00:05:05.590> overview<00:05:05.710> of<00:05:06.360> how<00:05:07.360> I<00:05:07.389> keep<00:05:07.720> things

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
real quick overview of how I keep things

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.710 
real quick overview of how I keep things
as<00:05:08.289> simple<00:05:08.349> as<00:05:08.800> possible<00:05:09.210> this<00:05:10.210> whole<00:05:10.479> thing

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
as simple as possible this whole thing

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.930 
as simple as possible this whole thing
probably<00:05:11.110> takes<00:05:11.349> hour<00:05:12.130> hour<00:05:12.580> and<00:05:12.669> a<00:05:12.760> half

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
probably takes hour hour and a half

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.089 
probably takes hour hour and a half
maybe<00:05:13.930> two<00:05:14.229> hours<00:05:14.500> depending<00:05:14.590> on<00:05:14.860> what<00:05:15.010> I'm

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
maybe two hours depending on what I'm

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.700 
maybe two hours depending on what I'm
doing<00:05:15.159> I<00:05:15.550> mean<00:05:15.940> and<00:05:16.360> it<00:05:16.539> finally<00:05:16.810> do<00:05:17.050> it<00:05:17.229> maybe

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
doing I mean and it finally do it maybe

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.140 
doing I mean and it finally do it maybe
I<00:05:19.020> once<00:05:20.020> or<00:05:20.139> twice<00:05:20.289> a<00:05:20.349> week<00:05:20.580> twice<00:05:21.580> a<00:05:21.639> week<00:05:21.909> and

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
I once or twice a week twice a week and

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.279 
I once or twice a week twice a week and
then<00:05:22.300> it<00:05:22.389> kind<00:05:22.510> of<00:05:22.539> stretches<00:05:22.750> out<00:05:23.020> for<00:05:23.199> the

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
then it kind of stretches out for the

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.060 
then it kind of stretches out for the
few<00:05:24.010> days<00:05:24.159> after<00:05:24.520> that<00:05:24.669> so<00:05:25.260> it's<00:05:26.260> like<00:05:26.440> once<00:05:26.979> a

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
few days after that so it's like once a

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.450 
few days after that so it's like once a
week<00:05:27.220> once<00:05:27.400> every<00:05:27.669> week<00:05:27.970> and<00:05:28.090> a<00:05:28.180> half<00:05:28.210> and

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
week once every week and a half and

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.010 
week once every week and a half and
definitely<00:05:30.460> will<00:05:31.090> keep<00:05:31.240> you<00:05:31.360> on<00:05:31.389> track<00:05:31.720> and

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
definitely will keep you on track and

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.890 
definitely will keep you on track and
keeps<00:05:32.500> me<00:05:32.650> on<00:05:32.800> track<00:05:32.830> a<00:05:33.220> lot<00:05:33.520> more<00:05:33.789> because<00:05:34.750> I

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
keeps me on track a lot more because I

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.909 
keeps me on track a lot more because I
don't<00:05:35.020> have<00:05:35.080> to<00:05:35.169> think<00:05:35.289> about<00:05:35.380> this<00:05:35.620> stuff<00:05:35.800> I

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
don't have to think about this stuff I

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.249 
don't have to think about this stuff I
get<00:05:36.070> to<00:05:36.159> the<00:05:36.250> office<00:05:36.599> before<00:05:37.599> I<00:05:37.810> got<00:05:38.050> more

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
get to the office before I got more

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:39.689 
get to the office before I got more
willpower<00:05:38.440> now<00:05:38.830> than<00:05:39.039> the<00:05:39.099> beginning<00:05:39.460> if<00:05:39.610> I

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
willpower now than the beginning if I

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.399 
willpower now than the beginning if I
got<00:05:39.849> to<00:05:39.940> the<00:05:40.030> office<00:05:40.150> and<00:05:40.599> I<00:05:41.020> didn't<00:05:41.289> have
