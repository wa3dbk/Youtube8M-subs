my<00:00:14.570> son<00:00:14.840> received<00:00:15.230> this<00:00:15.350> little<00:00:15.679> drone<00:00:15.980> RC

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
my son received this little drone RC

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.179 
my son received this little drone RC
helicopter<00:00:17.240> as<00:00:17.330> a<00:00:17.360> gift<00:00:17.720> it<00:00:18.439> comes<00:00:18.680> in<00:00:18.860> a<00:00:18.950> kit

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
helicopter as a gift it comes in a kit

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.460 
helicopter as a gift it comes in a kit
that's<00:00:19.250> ready<00:00:20.119> to<00:00:20.240> fly<00:00:20.540> so<00:00:20.869> essentially<00:00:21.380> you

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
that's ready to fly so essentially you

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.320 
that's ready to fly so essentially you
just<00:00:21.529> have<00:00:21.860> to<00:00:21.980> read<00:00:22.160> the<00:00:22.310> manual<00:00:22.700> charge<00:00:23.150> up

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
just have to read the manual charge up

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.830 
just have to read the manual charge up
the<00:00:23.480> battery<00:00:23.840> and<00:00:23.960> you're<00:00:24.230> good<00:00:24.529> to<00:00:24.650> go

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
the battery and you're good to go

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.040 
the battery and you're good to go
since<00:00:26.840> we<00:00:26.990> have<00:00:27.140> no<00:00:27.350> reader<00:00:28.160> control<00:00:28.730> aircraft

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
since we have no reader control aircraft

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.150 
since we have no reader control aircraft
experience<00:00:30.050> we're<00:00:30.230> going<00:00:30.410> to<00:00:30.500> take<00:00:30.980> this

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
experience we're going to take this

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.320 
experience we're going to take this
thing<00:00:31.340> across<00:00:31.580> the<00:00:31.820> street<00:00:32.090> to<00:00:32.210> the<00:00:32.300> park

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
thing across the street to the park

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.000 
thing across the street to the park
where<00:00:32.750> we<00:00:32.780> have<00:00:32.989> a<00:00:33.019> little<00:00:33.290> bit<00:00:33.470> more<00:00:33.650> room<00:00:33.980> to

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
where we have a little bit more room to

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.880 
where we have a little bit more room to
to<00:00:34.940> learn<00:00:35.150> and<00:00:35.629> hopefully<00:00:36.199> this<00:00:36.379> won't<00:00:36.739> be<00:00:36.860> a

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
to learn and hopefully this won't be a

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.369 
to learn and hopefully this won't be a
very<00:00:37.100> very<00:00:37.430> short<00:00:37.640> video<00:00:38.120> but<00:00:38.420> we'll<00:00:38.629> see<00:00:39.230> what

and the Santa brought it so we're just

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.140 
and the Santa brought it so we're just
learning<00:00:47.629> how<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:47.900> fly<00:00:48.170> it<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:49.120> here<00:00:50.120> goes

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
learning how to fly it so here goes

00:00:50.150 --> 00:01:21.359 
learning how to fly it so here goes
nothing<00:00:55.720> Wow

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:04:42.860 

oh<00:01:25.170> yeah<00:01:26.170> no<00:01:26.469> let's<00:01:26.679> get<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:26.829> haircut

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.960 

well<00:04:43.870> we<00:04:44.440> got<00:04:44.620> some<00:04:44.860> skills<00:04:45.190> practicing<00:04:45.880> in

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
well we got some skills practicing in

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.130 
well we got some skills practicing in
the<00:04:46.060> park<00:04:46.300> now<00:04:46.480> we're<00:04:46.570> gonna<00:04:46.660> see<00:04:46.840> if<00:04:46.900> we<00:04:46.990> can

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
the park now we're gonna see if we can

00:04:47.140 --> 00:06:17.890 
the park now we're gonna see if we can
fly<00:04:47.350> it<00:04:47.410> in<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.710> house<00:04:47.890> without<00:04:48.130> wrecking

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:24.260 

and<00:06:18.900> nice<00:06:19.320> that<00:06:19.740> was<00:06:20.010> great<00:06:22.370> after<00:06:23.370> flying<00:06:23.880> and

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
and nice that was great after flying and

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.689 
and nice that was great after flying and
crashing<00:06:24.780> the<00:06:24.870> mqx<00:06:25.470> quite<00:06:25.979> a<00:06:26.010> few<00:06:26.220> times<00:06:26.490> we

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 
crashing the mqx quite a few times we

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:29.930 
crashing the mqx quite a few times we
found<00:06:26.880> it<00:06:27.090> to<00:06:27.210> be<00:06:27.240> quite<00:06:27.750> durable<00:06:28.639> plus<00:06:29.639> the

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
found it to be quite durable plus the

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.909 
found it to be quite durable plus the
engineering<00:06:30.479> on<00:06:30.570> this<00:06:30.780> thing<00:06:30.990> is<00:06:31.139> pretty<00:06:31.680> neat

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
engineering on this thing is pretty neat

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.060 
engineering on this thing is pretty neat
because<00:06:32.070> it<00:06:32.340> just<00:06:32.580> actually<00:06:33.650> comes<00:06:34.650> apart

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
because it just actually comes apart

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:42.969 
because it just actually comes apart
quite<00:06:35.639> easily<00:06:35.699> the<00:06:38.449> electronics<00:06:39.449> just<00:06:39.690> unplug

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:42.979 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:47.240 

you<00:06:43.979> can<00:06:44.130> just<00:06:45.229> take<00:06:46.229> the<00:06:46.380> parts<00:06:46.710> off<00:06:46.919> without

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
you can just take the parts off without

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.170 
you can just take the parts off without
any<00:06:47.550> tools<00:06:47.960> snap<00:06:48.960> this<00:06:49.290> out<00:06:49.940> replace<00:06:50.940> the

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
any tools snap this out replace the

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.629 
any tools snap this out replace the
motors<00:06:51.710> and<00:06:54.530> we<00:06:55.530> found<00:06:55.770> that<00:06:55.979> the<00:06:56.130> local<00:06:56.490> hobby

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 
motors and we found that the local hobby

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.690 
motors and we found that the local hobby
store<00:06:56.820> has<00:06:57.800> pretty<00:06:58.800> much<00:06:58.889> all<00:06:59.190> the<00:06:59.310> parts<00:06:59.580> you

00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.700 
store has pretty much all the parts you

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.690 
store has pretty much all the parts you
might<00:06:59.850> need<00:07:00.090> on<00:07:00.330> this<00:07:00.680> mr.<00:07:01.680> mu<00:07:03.200> we<00:07:04.200> get<00:07:04.380> about

might need on this mr. mu we get about
over<00:07:05.700> 10<00:07:05.940> minutes<00:07:06.150> of<00:07:06.389> flight<00:07:06.600> time<00:07:06.630> on<00:07:07.050> these

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.200 
over 10 minutes of flight time on these

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.120 
over 10 minutes of flight time on these
little<00:07:07.440> batteries<00:07:09.530> and<00:07:10.530> we<00:07:10.650> found<00:07:10.950> that

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.130 
little batteries and we found that

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.270 
little batteries and we found that
they're<00:07:11.600> available<00:07:12.600> for<00:07:13.110> under<00:07:13.530> $10<00:07:14.070> at<00:07:14.250> the
