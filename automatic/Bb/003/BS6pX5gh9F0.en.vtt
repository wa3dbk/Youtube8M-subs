individually now this is called the
straw<00:01:43.460> miser<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:45.110> two<00:01:45.320> things<00:01:45.590> you<00:01:45.770> need<00:01:45.920> to

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
straw miser the two things you need to

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.200 
straw miser the two things you need to
look<00:01:46.759> out<00:01:46.940> for<00:01:47.210> time<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:48.110> velocity<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:50.030> main

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
look out for time and velocity the main

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.639 
look out for time and velocity the main
thing<00:01:50.509> is<00:01:50.659> time<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.500> first<00:01:51.800> knob<00:01:56.409> the<00:01:57.409> first

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
thing is time the first knob the first

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.249 
thing is time the first knob the first
knob<00:01:57.860> spreads<00:01:58.250> them<00:01:58.399> apart<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.930> second

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
knob spreads them apart and the second

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.270 
knob spreads them apart and the second
knob<00:02:00.380> also<00:02:00.680> does<00:02:01.009> it<00:02:01.190> but<00:02:01.610> it<00:02:02.149> mainly<00:02:02.570> controls

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
knob also does it but it mainly controls

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:14.229 
knob also does it but it mainly controls
the<00:02:04.280> end<00:02:09.280> no<00:02:11.650> because<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.950> second<00:02:13.730> knob<00:02:13.850> over

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
the end no because the second knob over

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.660 
the end no because the second knob over
here<00:02:14.570> to<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.810> right<00:02:15.019> controls<00:02:15.560> only<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.400> last

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
here to the right controls only the last

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.600 
here to the right controls only the last
one<00:02:17.090> or<00:02:17.269> two<00:02:17.300> notes<00:02:17.920> doesn't<00:02:18.920> make<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.370> much

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
one or two notes doesn't make that much

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:27.250 
one or two notes doesn't make that much
of<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.850> difference<00:02:19.970> where<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.360> is<00:02:23.110> now<00:02:26.260> right

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
of a difference where it is now right

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:35.140 
of a difference where it is now right
about<00:02:30.819> there<00:02:33.489> makes<00:02:34.489> pretty<00:02:34.670> good<00:02:34.790> strum

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
about there makes pretty good strum

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.020 
about there makes pretty good strum
sound<00:02:35.450> now<00:02:36.440> time<00:02:36.739> down<00:02:37.010> here<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:39.470> time<00:02:39.709> at<00:02:40.040> the

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
sound now time down here the time at the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:52.080 
sound now time down here the time at the
end<00:02:41.239> I<00:02:42.220> got<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.310> stop<00:02:43.489> this<00:02:43.670> is<00:02:43.850> annoying

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.390 

there's<00:02:53.090> two<00:02:53.209> parts<00:02:53.510> start<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.170> end<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.739> it

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
there's two parts start and end and it

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.160 
there's two parts start and end and it
doesn't<00:02:55.670> really<00:02:55.820> matter<00:02:56.060> unless<00:02:56.420> you<00:02:56.959> use<00:02:57.140> a

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
doesn't really matter unless you use a

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.699 
doesn't really matter unless you use a
pad<00:02:57.799> noise<00:02:59.650> but<00:03:00.650> start<00:03:00.920> is<00:03:01.040> where<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.310> is

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
pad noise but start is where it is

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.170 
pad noise but start is where it is
velocity<00:03:04.060> strength<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.500> I<00:03:06.500> believe

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
velocity strength and I believe

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.670 
velocity strength and I believe
transition<00:03:08.620> not<00:03:09.620> sure<00:03:11.440> velocity<00:03:12.440> doesn't

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
transition not sure velocity doesn't

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.140 
transition not sure velocity doesn't
really<00:03:12.829> affect<00:03:13.190> anything<00:03:13.340> you<00:03:13.760> can<00:03:13.880> change

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
really affect anything you can change

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.470 
really affect anything you can change
