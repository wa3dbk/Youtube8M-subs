00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.700
 questions and answers are in the 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.250
 put number 4 I think if I do not get confused and 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.170
 basically she does not ask a question 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.320
 answer because I already said it the end of 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.939
 last week on twitter and good 2007 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.950
 for you know that I've gone on a trip 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.570
 end of the year and that's why he has not 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.759
 could bring you the video I wanted to bring 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.529
 on Friday but it's going to happen a 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.880
 problem with the audio by him and others with 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.310
 the video at the end can not upload 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.620
 Friday so there were today is Sunday 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.540
 that if it's Sunday theme 3m taking the 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.770
 account and well maybe we 'll call in 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.810
 questions answers and together in the 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.310
 fourth deep I do not know what I will leave 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.810
 I know what match I will leave will surely be 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.060
 cool and good let's think with the 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.890
 first question that does not say nuclear 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.090
 jose tells us it's worth your time 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.040
 invested in youtube 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.980
 because the nuclear truth have my time 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.970
 youtube true that if it's worth 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.329
 obviously because something what to me 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.100
 like it is worth it 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.470
 time spent on youtube but the bad 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.729
 is when for example it takes you I do not know if 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.380
 will pass some that record and hands 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.390
 You've been two hours or three hours 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.350
 four recording and we sand then 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.050
 you say your goal 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.450
 it takes three hours 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.830
 when in plant but if normally 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.870
 worth because I do what to me 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.580
 I like it so it's well invested in 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.470
 youtube so I hope that I have 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.720
 answer the nuclear question and let's 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.090
 The following is from what areas of Spain 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.610

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.950
 andreu i am from spain is to say 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.300
 concretely from Seville I think that already 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.830
 he answered it but in case he did not 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.620
 because if it has not yet been clear 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.750
 Well, of course I say it, I'm from Sevilla and 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.430
 practice some practical sport stay 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.530
 that he had never said but he continues 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.540
 currently practical next karate 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.810
 question does not say it I had double for how

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.930
 rafa and how did you meet sagres etcetera and 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.560
 I suppose it will refer to all of us 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.269
 for austin giorgio er and kenya say 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.400
 good everything we are always together 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.050
 and so on, basically the first one 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.700
 I knew it was Augustine that I met him more or 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.220
 less at the beginning of summer and already 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.540
 Then he got to know Giorgio and very 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.310
 happy also to greg is that I left 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.720
 inviting I do not know if at the edge of the series 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.940

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.360

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.460
 I also met another live from Greece 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.680
 and we were talking about why are we going 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.510
 knowing everything and that is basically the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.830
 Question I hope that I have answered and 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.510
 let's go to the next next question 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.520

 that he took it because man evidently 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.000
 what would I say to michael condrey 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:42.409
 would it be that please the rest in makeen 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.819
 I do not know if they touched anything because to me 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:45.500
 I still play a game the 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:47.900
 truth is that pretty good people or for 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.599
 at least my level and at least xbox 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.020
 one that I play but what I will tell you in 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:56.150
 serious is that what else is making 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.469
 they would put him employed a little bit 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.699
 ok if you get good people because 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.800
 you get good people who also touch you 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.539
 people so bad new that for you 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.310
 bust that you and you can also 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.110
 burst other people basically that 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.719
 what would you say to them and I do not think 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.520
 I would say more things if that basically 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:12.319
 I told him because the truth is that 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.029
 that I want him to put a making like 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.129
 is in the anterior to the auditory 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:18.259
 physically and for those who do not know what 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.000
 it's more making is what the system of 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:22.009
 search that they look for in 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.240
 flat I think it's random is to say that 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.620
 do not look for you with people of your own 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.539
 level of your same skill because if not 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.219
 it's like you kill the subject you and 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.770
 like you do not have fun but good 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:32.139
 basically what I will tell him to do 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.729
 and it tells us what kind of music you like 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:36.490
 more a salutary machine a salutary 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.500
 mafia basically I do not have a kind of 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.900
 music with specifically that is to say I do not have 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.879
 no music that I like but 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.800
 I like all kinds of songs that you 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:46.150
 I listened in plan I listened to her negotiate 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.099
 I like this song, basically 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.379
 is that I do not have any music 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:52.419
 specifically and basically I do not like 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:54.099
 all kinds of music with my name if I 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.330
 like the song I like it good I hope 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:56.800
 I have answered your question and well 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.090
 is vary we have more questions I hope 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.050
