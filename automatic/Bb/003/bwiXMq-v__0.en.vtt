00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
distance I go really find in a distance

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.670 
distance I go really find in a distance
what<00:01:03.329> they've<00:01:03.449> done<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.780> if<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.019> did<00:01:04.199> fog<00:01:04.409> there

what they've done is if I did fog there
to<00:01:05.339> burn<00:01:05.549> cut<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> render<00:01:06.330> distance<00:01:06.479> because

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
to burn cut the render distance because

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.950 
to burn cut the render distance because
apparently<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.880> quality<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.479> know<00:01:09.689> when

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960

apparently and the quality you know when
you<00:01:10.049> see<00:01:10.200> things<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.619> distance<00:01:11.010> isn't<00:01:11.400> as

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
you see things in the distance isn't as

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.640 
you see things in the distance isn't as
good<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> vaad<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.900> lot<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.229> fog<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
with the rendering or that from distance

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.940 
with the rendering or that from distance
and<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.780> second<00:01:25.140> thing<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.680> lot<00:01:25.920> of
