00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.390
 welcome to a pot of two-wheelers 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.639
 we have a saddle measurement 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.440
 I bale through saddle measurement 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.210
 there take the distance between new 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:19.279
 sit bones essentially changes as you lean forward 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.020
 later now so to pick up the measurement see you 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.070
 two stories the distance between the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.619
 sit bones 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.010
 on a chip 'lead moves back and forth 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.980
 some concrete and so did the distance from the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.559
 can sit bones meters 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.149
 Now their church we can 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.890
 means of the reader 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.730
 exactly the width of your singles 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.129
 area and the center thereof but 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.020
 then fill this in later in the data 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.680
 python 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.980
 these advise which is best for you 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.980
 suits 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.140
 distances are written off so that they 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.140
 later couldn't be easier 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.010
 new the data we can have this 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.270
 introduction in this is not 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.050
 first asked to log 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.050
 children's bicycle is alive 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.860
 then we looked at how the bicycle collects 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.860
 the more you sit, the narrower sho 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.470
 you will also be asked the longer you are 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:33.229
 cycling this is important to know 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:37.840
 where the saddle should go 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.840
 the longer you cycle but that's the venue 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.700
 We can now has a lot of SIM problem in it 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.500
 last i fill the distance 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.590
 the sybian i you are quiet meter 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.590
 to have 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.390
 this distance is very important to the 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.509
 poles dock the best you can 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.509
 use 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.069
 now comes a consultant nine out of the 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.879
 ten times that you see everything here 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.790
 what an evening 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.650
 there is a fitting for each comes together 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.569
 You are free to come along for a free one 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.569
 they all got dirty with two-wheelers
