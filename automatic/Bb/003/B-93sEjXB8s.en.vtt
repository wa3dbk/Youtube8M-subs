 a few months the following happened to me 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.940
 I was in my bedroom with my laptop 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.770
 wandering the internet visiting pages 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.870
 that were related to my series 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.940
 favorite that I mentioned a few ago 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.370
 moments I came across a page that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.600
 I had never seen I think he said or said 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.850
 next Mr. steel surf 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.280
 with a lot of attention since I just 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.460
 knew the typical gentlemen cause a 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.000
 whistle marc mercuri jupiter virus 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.129

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.100
 cowen search engine and antivirus said that 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.290
 that page was dangerous I only knew 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.269
 another person who could get me out of this 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.490
 great question that now arose and that 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.860
 I was spinning around in my head she was 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.840
 a fan of the series decided to 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.549
 enter that page for the warning 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.100
 of my antivirus and because if I did 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.140
 I had my friend to be with me at 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.330
 next day already in school at the time 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.159
 of lunch I went running to tell 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.409
 my friend what happened to me and told me what 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.720
 next I only know at 10 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.399
 original races of the series that should 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.970
 to be an invention of a fanatic 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.319
 I would still like to see him and he smiled at me 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.080
 Now that I think about it, that was the last 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.909
 Once I saw her smile on the night of 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.220
 my house we sit in front of the computer 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.799
 we understood it and already once in the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.720
 desk I opened internet explorer I searched 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.819
 in google the words the northeastern blue 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.310
 I would mark the page again as 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.770
 dangerous mixed desire to go to the bathroom 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.500
 I went in that moment she was left alone and 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.070
 I did not want when I was about to 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.799
 finish 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.020
 she shouted at me and I could get out of the 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.210
 I went to the refrigerator that is 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.609
 in the kitchen she began to read in voice 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.950
 high what the page said there was once 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.140
 in the millenium times silver a 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.450
 Lord Scouts called Saylor Steel Soul 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.790
 what in Spanish means steal souls 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.650
 she lived to terrorize people 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.109
 on a small planet away from the road 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.180
 milky this evil lord was born under the 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:22.730
 sign of a new constellation that 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.859
 discovered this lady absorbed the souls 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.109
 of weak people I remember that my friend 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:29.239
 he was having bad times with his family 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:31.430
 I went back to the room with the prestige 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.250
 she seemed normal and continued reading 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.950
 At first I thought that was false 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.780
 no more than a conforming invention was 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.670
 reading the article I realized that my 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.630
 Room was dark and suddenly 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.850
 I felt it fill up 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.490
 a cold and dense air I thought was normal 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.350
 At the end of the writing came a note 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.600
 clarifying with red letters and in 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.480
 capital letters that said not to read the 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.670
 midnight 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.159
 and then ask me how is it possible 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.330
 that something can happen, turn to see the 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.860
 quarter clock 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:04.470
 11 58 pm I said it's a little late 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.330
 turn off the computer I returned the look 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.340
 towards my friend and I realized that she 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.620
 his eyes were lost as if someone 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.590
 or something would have hypnotized him I started 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.450
 talk about alumni arum and it's already late there 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.239
 to turn off the computer and not 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.549
 I was reacting I started to despair I saw 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.670
 a bright light from the monitor turn to 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.069
 see I thought I observed some letters I reached 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.980
 to read what he said now your soul is mine 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.560
 arum and come to the kingdom of darkness 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.959
 between a horrible panic since a hand 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.640
 He left the monitor his hand was similar to 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.519
 that of the great sage of sailor moon 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.650
 r season I started screaming panic 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.959
 it invaded me I was in shock screaming 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.940
 seeing how my friend was absorbed by 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.519
 my monitor when I could react 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.040
 I tried to turn off the monitor after 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.470
 computer and nothing could not be was like 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.750
 had a life of its own after being 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.569
 absorbed I saw that my friend was not alone 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.489
 I went with a silhouette shaped woman 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.200
 which one was fastened at the waist 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.510
 so that you do not run away suddenly 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.310
 they disappeared they vanished 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.799
 I was watching the monitor in shock but 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.230
 restless I stopped screaming I was still 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.720
 on and on bench when suddenly 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.180
 an image of a woman which now does not 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.880
 I can remember well said white you from 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.850
 here she is already mine and I did not know 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.010
 nothing of my friend I live alone so no 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.440
 there was no one I could tell 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.199
 call the police I told them what happened 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.180
 expert investigations revealed 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.910
 that page was asking for a series of 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.710
 keys name date of birth data 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.080
 very personal and intimate but 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.120
 specific as if they wanted to evaluate themselves 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.099
 to enter only have been 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.990
 registered two cases like this throughout the 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:45.900
 world in of a girl in the east of 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.610
 Europe and another one in Central America now 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.639
 my friend is gone and I owe everything to 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.410
 that damn page that I snatch it from 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.510
 well that's all for today I hope they 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.700
 have liked this story and hopefully 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.560
 think more before entering a page 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.550
 of the internet that says it's not safe 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.550
 regards
