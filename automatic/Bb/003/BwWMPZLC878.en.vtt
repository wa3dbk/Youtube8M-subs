00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.580
 when January arrives at the consumer 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.950
 electronics show there is no city ​​in the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.730
 united states more congested than this 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:22.199
 and in 2015 we are no exception welcome 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.390
 we do the first test in las vegas 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.980
 just immersed in this chaos 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.810
 ok we are about to start our tour 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.150
 aboard this prototype put at 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.730
 point from the bosch a cherokee jeep that 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.230
 has an autonomous driving system that is 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.239
 through a laser system in a 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.800
 camera system and capable of 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.320
 monitor the traffic around you 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.910
 to the car and check the speed 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.300
 without the driver having to intervene 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.579
 to do this it automatically detects 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.289
 the lateral lines and the distance and the 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.129
 speed of the vehicle preceding the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.410
 so-called vehicle target when the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.030
 display will show the green lines and will be 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.980
 the signal that the car can take the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.329
 complete control of the march on 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.690
 our driver will take your hands off the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.610
 flying we will see what happens 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.920
 no we are working on genoa traffic 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.780
 sestese already for a long time and among a few 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.340
 months will be able to offer it to homes 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.420
 that they have not yet put in place 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.970
 own project 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.189
 it should be remembered that very soon in the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.830
 car safety assessments i 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.119
 requirements such as automatic braking 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.220
 Thing lists will be pretty much 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.320
 indicators 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.480
 as you can see we are in the traffic there 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.340
 still moving slowly at around 25 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.720
 miles per hour but the car has 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.850
 took complete control 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.860
 the interesting thing is that it is not there 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.170
 need to have the lines of 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.390
 well-defined demarcation on the road 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.310
 for the front cameras to succeed 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.050
 to define the lane even in absence 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.090
 of white lines taking like 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.830
 refer to the cars that are found 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.160
 right and left of ours 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.160
 motor car 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.670
 now we will see the departure a traffic light that 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.619
 it's the time a little more 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.450
 interesting the car is going into 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.369
 the light is completely autonomous 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.160
 of the traffic light will turn green and 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.780
 the car will start and follow the car 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.180
 which precedes totally 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.429
 autonomous without the intervention of 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.320
 driver and also the steering naturally 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.420
 is under steering brake control e 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.800
 accelerator 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.310
 as you can see is able to follow 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.660
 quite precisely the lane 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.940
 obviously some corrections can be 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.560
 necessary because in this case not 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.510
 we have absolutely no kind of 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.180
 demarcation of horizontal signs 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.459
 only small mushrooms of the small ones 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.200
 white reflectors in a situation 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.630
 instead where the lines of demarcation 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:40.800
 are more visible driving is even more 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:42.900
 he has also specified the houses for some time 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.700
 they realized that customers would like 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.870
 to be able to use safely 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.760
 car phone 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.320
 we are not talking about the speakerphone that 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.660
 by now there is everywhere but of a 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.220
 intelligent interface to manage the 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.930
 functions like music 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.430
 navigation is the message for 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.890
 luck today even small cars 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.380
 incorporate automatic systems that 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.360
 they can warn and brake in case of 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.310
 emergency to avoid the collision 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.440
 of course it's not a good reason to 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.440
 distracting ourselves let's see if they work
