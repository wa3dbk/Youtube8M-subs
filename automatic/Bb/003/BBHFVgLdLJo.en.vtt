00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.559
 do not 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.770
 how 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.420
 good morning shakira 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.640
 see how pretty 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.830
 here we are with a guinea pig 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.350
 know that guinea pigs are also the 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.559
 llama guinea pigs are 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.550
 originating in the highlands of Peru and 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:46.010
 we are going to give the first bathroom x and very 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.230
 well it should not be anything traumatic and 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.690
 moreover it should not be more frequent than a 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.730
 once a month we will be very careful of 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.340
 that we do not get product or in the 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.239
 visit neither in eyes nor in ears therefore 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.980
 we are going to cover it well how we will do 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.470
 it exists for when they are very little 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.900
 a powder product 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.970
 we go there have we have to try 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.490
 that is nothing traumatic for the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.490
 guinea pig we will take and sprinkle 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.590
 by the back and the legs having a lot 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.270
 Be careful that we do not enter as we have 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.270
 said nothing in the face 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.390
 once sprinkled we will take a 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.390
 brush 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.189
 and let's start brushing gently 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.770
 Your first experience with the brush 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.200
 therefore always everything very slowly 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.659
 because if he takes us mania then he's going to 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.090
 traumatize for very likely future occasions 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.340
 all right 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.020
 it's normal to protest a bit you know 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.939
 that the guinea pigs vocalize a lot 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.039
 they make a lot of noise and this noise that 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.039
 is doing now it's protest 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.020
 even notice here this little detail 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.229
 that we are going to try to get rid of 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.010
 which are remains of caritas of the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.030
 mother or litter 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.030
 let's see Gordi 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.180
 let's massage to enter either the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.180
 product 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.150
 this is so much 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.370
 in this way we are going to get it out 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.370
 well clean 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.450
 no need to wet the do not panic 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.940
 for these noises because the guinea pigs 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.940
 they really complain about everything 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.250
 pain we will do both in favor of hair 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.250
 against the grain 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.810
 very well against the grain complains 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.200
 little bit more come let's do the 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.200
 last 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.760
 very good very well 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.769
 the sample that I am leaving 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.769
 gorgeous 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.990
 the guinea pigs are herbivorous rodents and 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.680
 also as we have already told you in 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.750
 Many times they need the 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.670
 intake of vitamin C the same as 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.860
 people do not synthesize vitamin makes 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.480
 the rest of the animals and so there are 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.880
 to give every day 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.100
 fresh fruit and vegetables and as a curiosity 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.600
 We will tell you that the red pepper has a 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.880
 lots of vitamin c 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.620
 when we do it gently, it arrives 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.010
 to please a lot they even get to 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.180
 fall asleep 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.920
 very well 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.590
 Well, I think 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.020
 that we have finished shakira you see what 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.430
 pretty that we've left it to the 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.610
 shakira and you can go to give a 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.610
 concert
