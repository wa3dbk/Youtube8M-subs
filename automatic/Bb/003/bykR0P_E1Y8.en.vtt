00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
in a little bit better to the seeder

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.790 
in a little bit better to the seeder
color<00:00:26.720> and<00:00:27.720> as<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.989> can<00:00:28.079> see<00:00:28.259> as<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.499> approached

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:35.389 
it I blacked out the inside of make such
a<00:00:31.439> difference<00:00:32.600> on<00:00:33.600> how<00:00:34.350> well<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.920> deer<00:00:35.190> can

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
a difference on how well the deer can

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:47.510 
a difference on how well the deer can
see<00:00:36.710> someone<00:00:37.710> inside<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.250> blind<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:47.310> is

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.280 

everything<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.790> blacked<00:00:54.150> out<00:00:54.420> now<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.810> can<00:00:55.200> wear

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
everything is blacked out now I can wear

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.160 
everything is blacked out now I can wear
black<00:00:55.560> clothing<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.160> here<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:57.390> blend<00:00:57.960> in

black clothing in here and blend in
pretty<00:00:58.290> well<00:00:59.270> I've<00:01:00.270> used<00:01:02.780> machine<00:01:03.780> screws<00:01:04.199> I

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
pretty well I've used machine screws I

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.109 
pretty well I've used machine screws I
switch<00:01:04.829> these<00:01:05.040> out<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.610> could<00:01:05.759> put<00:01:05.939> these

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
switch these out so I could put these

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.550 
switch these out so I could put these
anchor<00:01:06.570> nuts<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:07.400> on<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.909> hands<00:01:09.409> because<00:01:10.409> I

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
anchor nuts on on the hands because I

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.530 
anchor nuts on on the hands because I
was<00:01:10.680> having<00:01:10.830> trouble<00:01:10.980> with<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.610> blowing<00:01:11.970> off

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
was having trouble with this blowing off

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.320 
was having trouble with this blowing off
when<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.230> was<00:01:13.320> gone<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:14.520> kind<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.909> just<00:01:15.090> gives

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
when I was gone this kind of just gives

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.219 
when I was gone this kind of just gives

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.719 
enough I put these curtains more or less
that<00:01:30.330> I<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.570> drop<00:01:30.840> down<00:01:31.200> or<00:01:32.780> raise<00:01:33.780> up<00:01:34.729> halfway

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
that I can drop down or raise up halfway

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.890 
that I can drop down or raise up halfway
or<00:01:36.060> all<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.540> way<00:01:36.659> however<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.590> want<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.799> do<00:01:37.979> it

or all the way however I want to do it

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.710 
or all the way however I want to do it
because<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.320> blurring<00:01:40.560> Sun<00:01:41.270> was<00:01:42.270> coming<00:01:42.630> in

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
because the blurring Sun was coming in

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.630 
because the blurring Sun was coming in
here<00:01:42.870> really<00:01:43.020> bright<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.799> got<00:01:44.010> this<00:01:44.130> sitting

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
here really bright so I got this sitting

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.550 
here really bright so I got this sitting
out<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.970> where<00:01:45.229> I<00:01:46.850> can<00:01:47.850> either<00:01:48.229> close<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.440> off

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
out to where I can either close it off

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.170 
out to where I can either close it off
to<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.830> morning<00:01:50.100> set<00:01:50.250> all<00:01:50.400> together<00:01:50.610> or<00:01:51.090> at

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
to the morning set all together or at

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.890 
to the morning set all together or at
least<00:01:52.310> bring<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.460> down<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:54.330> where<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.510> can<00:01:54.720> see

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
least bring it down to where I can see

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.020 
least bring it down to where I can see
under<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.979> sun's<00:01:56.220> not<00:01:56.400> shining<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.970> my

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
under it but the sun's not shining in my

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.060 
under it but the sun's not shining in my
eyes<00:01:57.210> are<00:01:57.270> not<00:01:57.540> locking<00:01:58.350> me<00:01:58.470> up<00:01:59.450> so<00:02:00.710> those<00:02:01.710> are

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
eyes are not locking me up so those are

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.109 
eyes are not locking me up so those are
the<00:02:02.220> changes<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.290> made<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.979> blind<00:02:05.220> also<00:02:05.850> put

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
the changes I made to the blind also put

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.669 
the changes I made to the blind also put
a<00:02:06.890> quickie<00:02:08.689> bracket<00:02:09.689> on<00:02:09.810> there<00:02:09.989> for<00:02:10.200> my<00:02:10.319> quiver

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
a quickie bracket on there for my quiver

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.970 
a quickie bracket on there for my quiver
so<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.340> can<00:02:11.580> take<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.970> quiver<00:02:12.300> off<00:02:12.630> my<00:02:13.620> chair

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
so I can take the quiver off my chair

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.699 
so I can take the quiver off my chair
that<00:02:14.400> would<00:02:14.520> that<00:02:14.700> happen<00:02:14.910> heaven

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
that would that happen heaven

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.559 
that would that happen heaven
because<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.579> fits<00:02:16.700> on<00:02:16.909> the<00:02:17.030> chair<00:02:17.299> and<00:02:17.480> I

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
because it fits on the chair and I

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.270 
because it fits on the chair and I
turned<00:02:17.959> just<00:02:18.230> right<00:02:18.469> why<00:02:18.650> sometimes<00:02:18.920> it<00:02:19.189> hits

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
turned just right why sometimes it hits

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.679 
turned just right why sometimes it hits
knocks<00:02:19.640> against<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.120> side<00:02:20.329> of<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.480> wall

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689 
knocks against the side of the wall

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.630 
knocks against the side of the wall
that's<00:02:21.469> what<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:21.739> have<00:02:21.829> to<00:02:21.859> worry<00:02:22.129> about<00:02:22.189> that

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
that's what I have to worry about that

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.959 
that's what I have to worry about that
keeps<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.299> in<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.689> good<00:02:24.019> spot<00:02:24.079> out<00:02:24.769> of<00:02:24.859> the<00:02:25.760> way

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:25.969 
keeps it in a good spot out of the way

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:33.660 
keeps it in a good spot out of the way
but<00:02:26.659> accessible<00:02:27.230> if<00:02:27.739> I<00:02:27.799> need<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.040> second<00:02:28.519> narrow

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:44.559 

and<00:02:34.670> so<00:02:36.519> that's<00:02:39.040> pretty<00:02:40.040> much<00:02:40.159> it<00:02:43.329> I'm<00:02:44.329> real

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
and so that's pretty much it I'm real

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.849 
and so that's pretty much it I'm real
happy<00:02:44.780> with<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.260> way<00:02:47.049> that<00:02:48.049> it<00:02:48.109> looks<00:02:48.500> from

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
happy with the way that it looks from

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:55.559 
happy with the way that it looks from
the<00:02:49.819> gears<00:02:50.120> point<00:02:50.419> of<00:02:50.599> view<00:02:52.810> I'm<00:02:53.810> standing

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
the gears point of view I'm standing

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.140 
the gears point of view I'm standing
right<00:02:56.569> under<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.959> feeder<00:02:57.290> now<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:58.730> that's

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
right under the feeder now and that's

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.190 
right under the feeder now and that's
basically<00:02:59.659> what<00:02:59.989> a<00:03:00.019> deer<00:03:00.319> would<00:03:00.469> be<00:03:00.530> saying

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
basically what a deer would be saying

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.220 
basically what a deer would be saying
when<00:03:03.200> they're<00:03:03.349> sitting<00:03:03.650> here<00:03:05.139> standing<00:03:06.139> here

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
when they're sitting here standing here

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.409 
when they're sitting here standing here
eating<00:03:06.469> corn<00:03:07.659> so<00:03:08.659> I<00:03:09.669> think<00:03:10.669> this<00:03:11.030> is<00:03:11.209> going<00:03:11.359> to

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:11.419 
eating corn so I think this is going to

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.860 
eating corn so I think this is going to
be<00:03:11.599> a<00:03:11.629> lot<00:03:12.579> better<00:03:13.579> blind<00:03:14.120> now<00:03:14.480> with<00:03:14.689> those

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
be a lot better blind now with those

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.420 
be a lot better blind now with those

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
trouble in the morning being lit up in

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.860
