00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.090
 the brain we know that it is prized for 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.890
 recover in the early stages 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.529
 after a brain damage let's say that 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.779
 a series of mechanisms are developed 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.230
 what we call neuroplasticity is 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.270
 say the brain tends to 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.210
 prom put in place in the mechanisms 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.850
 of recovery that we say have a 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.309
 time limit and that time those 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.010
 mechanisms are greater the closer 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.570
 of brain damage we are so that 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.120
 The sooner the treatment of 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.820
 neurorehabilitation because the 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.650
 expectations for improvement are greater 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.750
 another side we have the intensity of 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.050
 rehabilitation treatment a treatment 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.760
 of three hours daily is the treatment 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.670
 in quotation marks that more evidence 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.449
 scientific has shown and here we go 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.190
 a bit with what is the weekend 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.880
 in the brain does not understand the ends of 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.189
 week 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.490
 there is a current that says that even 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.619
 on Saturdays treatment should be given 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.720
 neuro performer a treatment by 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.610
 part of a multidisciplinary team and 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.340
 dedicated to brain damage that is to say is not 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.880
 the same a physiotherapist a therapist 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.710
 occupational in focus to recover a 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.479
 after knee surgery 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.009
 with a physiotherapist that has to 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.590
 devote himself who is dedicated to brain damage 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.229
 then the multidisciplinary team of 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.270
 physiotherapy occupational therapy 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.829
 neuropsychology speech therapist neurologists 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.159
 rehabilitated psychiatrists good all 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:46.729
 all that multidisciplinary team ensures 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:50.380
 a treatment protocol that has 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:54.250
 more success and on the other hand the treatment 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.170
 individual in certain aspects also 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.479
 provides greater efficiency 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.369
 treatment regarding treatments 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.619
 group and diego in certain aspects 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.450
 because there are indeed moments 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.870
 punctual as cnog or pedja can be 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.650
 or neuropsychology 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.840
 or certain kinds of physiotherapy that is 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.700
 It is not convenient to give them in a 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.700
 form a group treatment
