00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.030

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
now fire is coming out of it now in my

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.490 
now fire is coming out of it now in my
opinion<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.640> last<00:01:53.750> animation<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.990> kind<00:01:55.409> of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
opinion the last animation is kind of

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.639 
opinion the last animation is kind of
weak<00:01:55.740> compared<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:58.170> know<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.409> first

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
weak compared to the you know the first

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.429 
weak compared to the you know the first
one<00:01:58.950> or<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.130> second<00:01:59.640> one<00:01:59.670> this<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.439> sort
