 save under desktop we do that 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.170
 so we can do it again 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.160
 return 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.359
 that is already completed 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.300
 actually pretty much fix so exactly and 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.790
 now you can go to the second one here 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.119
 download donovan jurist 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.100
 motto because you click on it and then 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.100
 you come back on such a page and 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.710
 There's yours back on download that way 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.000
 the whole thing will be displayed again 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.200
 then we go back under store 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.600
 desktop as usual so if you like that 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.270
 you have found this here 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.799
 two files like you have now 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.610
 Now you need one 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.290
 pack program I have to winzip for that 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.369
 you can download for free as a trial 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.040
 I also have the download 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.350
 trial version at chip.de for example 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.570
 that's what you call that and otherwise gives 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.649
 just google one 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.659
 development program for free or 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.729
 something like that and then you use here 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.720
 Of course you want to be the trial version 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.329
 buy it because he could, of course, 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.220
 also like to buy and then you draw 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.220
 these two things in here 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:12.930
 yes, there you go, that's okay 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:14.790
 and now it goes wrong we press 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.180
 when first a file 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.820
 the young man has this file on the spot 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.370
 but let's go to unpack exactly 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.410
 now we have a gripping on 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.690
 desktop now you can find the whole thing too 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.670
 down here so the two things are 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.800
 We'll throw a pact now 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.500
 the whole thing out for it again 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.350
 Finally, the program again do 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.790
 it again and then we take 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.500
 this vinyl is next to us 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.410
 we will go back to detail 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.130
 to unpack after the whole goes again 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.870
 on the desktop that's right 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.570
 so now you have unpacked the whole thing 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.890
 Now you have the two files below 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.480
 this could throw away like now 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.460
 you want 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.810
 and this is what we need now and that 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.220
 we need from the folder too 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.560
 you can then use these two files 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.050
 could still pull out the folder 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.610
 By the way, side seemed so now you have 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.070
 these three files are these three files 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.239
 are important to the pack at all 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.190
 to start 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.950
 so now you are on your own 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.390
 folder and there is the folder documents 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.640
 contain 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.290
 there you go then on top of electronic 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.870
 arts the sims 4 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.730
 and then here on this folder watts 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.410
 here is already one 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.030
 small file in that animals source 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.050
 file that must, however, synonymous in it 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.930
 stay with that must ever 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.580
 that was done by sims 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.560
 Really provided so then take 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.680
 you just these three files and 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.050
 move it to the mods so now 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.630
 the file is the three files 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.220
 in lÃ³dz folder of the sims 4 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.650
 Now you can do it all again 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.870
 close and then it is actually 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.290
 very easily 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.110
 You start your game and then you have to 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.760
 actually, if everything worked out and 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.470
 the game right now to show that 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.790
 I have to be in the game 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.980
 and so does the whole thing with hair 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.260
 So eyeshadow all sims in general 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.659
 their 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.280
 I amok download so goes the whole 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.689
 Actually, it's always unpacking 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.070
 and then pull into the ocean 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:18.940
 that is actually very simple and 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.019
 actually not that hard 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.720
 even if that 's always the case 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.660
 complicated sounds like that and now gets 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.190
 you checked this message mods maxis 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.590
 and does not support mod please 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.190
 Use it with caution and that too 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.780
 right because yes there are quite mods 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.400
 which also destroy you from the game 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.120
 I have not had one yet 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.100
 problems 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.490
 that does not mean that there are none 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.340
 So there can be quite some and 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.840
 it can also be quite waxing and it 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.020
 may well come to crash 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.330
 So think about whether he wants to play 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.220
 because it expresses simply young and 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.699
 then you have the murder already in 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.520
 game 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:01.780
 yes, and now that's really easy 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:04.210
 the pressure on play and then yes I have 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.620
 already a school as you know 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.970
 I already set up but that completely 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.729
 simply there you can just on gallery 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:13.630
 click then he gives this community 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:15.820
 he is simply object names cool one 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.490
 and then you will find each one already 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.110
 schools amount because I think we are there 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.580
 not the only ones who have this courage 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.180
 no i could just do a school 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.849
 choose 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.190
 that brings your game and then you have to 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.479
 her only in the game, if you like 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.250
 the school again placed the 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.160
 could happen where you want then go 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.539
 in the tree mode short because there you have to 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.990
 also something important change 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.520
 otherwise it does not work 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.310
 then you have to go up here 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.680
 plot information and then you can 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.330
 you choose here on his property 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.430
 is general land was or 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.740
 library but of course you have to go in 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.440
 menton school vans is a primary school 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.090
 or just a high school 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.860
 after Werder, on the other hand, should be a teenager 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.700
 or child would have to be here then 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.280
 click 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.440
 so that is saved otherwise 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.140
 function now mixes that is still 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.060
 sometimes quite important step 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.680
 yes and I would say that was it now 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.970
 First of all I hope I could 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.950
 help you a bit now if 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.420
 Anyone else has ever asked for it 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.590
 in the comments or if you 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.510
 want to know something else 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.650
 pull any other tutorial 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.840
 because you maybe want something 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.130
 not exactly know or otherwise 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.420
 Like me, write quietly 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.830
 the comments that no 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.810
 problem I really like to help you 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.880
 and I like to do more 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.200
 otherwise videos wish you much 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.900
 fun with the murder if you go 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.260
 picks up and yes i would say that by 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.260
 next
