effective here yeah and also the water
effects<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:30.509> know<00:00:30.539> if<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.840> impact<00:00:31.529> coats<00:00:32.279> as

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
effects you know if you impact coats as

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.600 
effects you know if you impact coats as
well<00:00:32.669> if<00:00:33.269> I'm<00:00:33.420> breakfast<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.260> big<00:00:34.680> waves<00:00:34.949> that

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
well if I'm breakfast the big waves that

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.460 
well if I'm breakfast the big waves that
flow<00:00:36.180> around<00:00:36.480> through<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.870> island<00:00:37.230> if<00:00:37.320> you're

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
flow around through the island if you're

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.200 
flow around through the island if you're
trying<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.100> know<00:00:38.129> get<00:00:38.430> good<00:00:38.670> maneuvering

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
trying to you know get good maneuvering

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.490 
trying to you know get good maneuvering
if<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.510> have<00:00:39.629> these<00:00:39.780> big<00:00:40.019> waves<00:00:40.230> coming

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
if you have these big waves coming

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.530 
if you have these big waves coming
through<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.190> impacts<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.760> map<00:00:41.970> you

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
through it so it impacts the map you

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.819 
through it so it impacts the map you
know<00:00:42.659> in<00:00:42.780> more<00:00:42.989> ways<00:00:43.170> than<00:00:43.199> one<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.739> know

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
know in more ways than one you know

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.470 
know in more ways than one you know
besides<00:00:43.949> just<00:00:44.339> is<00:00:44.430> really<00:00:44.670> cool<00:00:44.820> evolution<00:00:45.420> of

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
besides just is really cool evolution of

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.200 
besides just is really cool evolution of
fact<00:00:45.659> that<00:00:45.809> goes<00:00:45.989> out<00:00:46.230> also<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.309> using<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
fact that goes out also just using the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.639 
fact that goes out also just using the
map<00:00:48.360> itself<00:00:48.540> but<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.839> want<00:00:49.019> to<00:00:49.110> jet<00:00:49.290> ski<00:00:49.530> your

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
map itself but you want to jet ski your

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.079 
map itself but you want to jet ski your
way<00:00:49.739> out<00:00:49.949> of<00:00:50.070> there<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.640> might<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:50.940> to

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
way out of there you might have to

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:52.430 
way out of there you might have to
wrestle<00:00:51.269> some<00:00:51.570> pretty<00:00:51.750> aggressive<00:00:51.870> waters

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
wrestle some pretty aggressive waters

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.290 
wrestle some pretty aggressive waters
because<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.859> the<00:00:52.920> rain<00:00:53.070> storm<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.640> lots<00:00:54.149> of

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
because of the rain storm so lots of

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.180 
because of the rain storm so lots of
cool<00:00:54.390> things<00:00:54.629> there<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.230> soak<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:55.949> sure

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
cool things there to soak in for sure

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.250 
cool things there to soak in for sure
and<00:00:56.699> there<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.149> see<00:00:57.269> actually<00:00:57.510> II<00:00:57.780> which

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
and there you can see actually II which

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.080 
and there you can see actually II which
is<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> shipwreck<00:00:58.920> that's<00:00:59.460> staying<00:00:59.850> right

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
is a shipwreck that's staying right

there that's not going to move it's the
boat<00:01:02.340> that's<00:01:02.550> right<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.329> front<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.870> that's

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
boat that's right in front of you that's

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.010 
boat that's right in front of you that's
the<00:01:04.830> one<00:01:05.009> that<00:01:05.190> as<00:01:05.670> soon<00:01:05.910> as<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.570> windmill

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the one that as soon as this windmill

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.290 
the one that as soon as this windmill
let's<00:01:07.860> go<00:01:08.009> down<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.460> actually<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.970> should<00:01:09.000> be

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
let's go down and actually it should be

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.760 
let's go down and actually it should be
happening<00:01:09.509> any<00:01:09.810> second<00:01:10.200> there<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.470> see<00:01:10.649> it

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
happening any second there you see it

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.460 
happening any second there you see it
right<00:01:10.800> there<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:12.600> now<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.780> boat<00:01:13.050> makes<00:01:13.320> its

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
right there and now the boat makes its

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.550 
right there and now the boat makes its
way<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.800> just<00:01:14.720> there<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.840> go<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.259> gotta<00:01:16.440> get

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
take a look exactly where it's going to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.160 
take a look exactly where it's going to
go<00:01:20.670> will<00:01:20.909> turn<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.179> just<00:01:21.450> for<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> moment<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.020> you

go will turn on just for a moment so you

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.690 
go will turn on just for a moment so you
can<00:01:22.289> know<00:01:22.500> exactly<00:01:22.710> where<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.399> going<00:01:23.550> to<00:01:23.580> end

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
was playing on see on a firebase island

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.779 
was playing on see on a firebase island
when<00:01:36.899> the<00:01:37.229> boat<00:01:37.440> crash<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.069> a<00:01:38.099> day<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> see<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
when the boat crash in a day to see the

bow down move it
look<00:01:41.460> see<00:01:41.700> imagine<00:01:42.450> being<00:01:42.660> right<00:01:42.990> there<00:01:43.260> is

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
look see imagine being right there is

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.170 
look see imagine being right there is
the<00:01:43.530> code<00:01:43.740> makes<00:01:44.010> its<00:01:44.220> way<00:01:44.370> in<00:01:44.580> like<00:01:44.820> being

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the code makes its way in like being

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.610 
the code makes its way in like being
towards<00:01:45.480> the<00:01:45.540> side<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.110> really<00:01:46.320> does

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
towards the side of it it really does

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.040 
towards the side of it it really does
change<00:01:46.650> a<00:01:47.100> lot<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:48.180> see<00:01:48.390> how<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.510> building

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
change a lot and see how the building

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.220 
change a lot and see how the building
just<00:01:49.080> comes<00:01:49.440> crumbling<00:01:50.070> down<00:01:50.960> after<00:01:51.960> getting

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
just comes crumbling down after getting

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.500 
just comes crumbling down after getting
hit<00:01:52.380> by<00:01:52.410> a<00:01:52.560> ship<00:01:52.890> through<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.730> funk<00:01:54.000> who'da

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
hit by a ship through the funk who'da

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.810 
hit by a ship through the funk who'da
thunk<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.170> know<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.800> now<00:01:56.010> this<00:01:56.280> changes

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
thunk it you know so now this changes

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.280 
thunk it you know so now this changes
the<00:01:56.850> map<00:01:57.090> right<00:01:57.270> it's<00:01:57.450> one<00:01:57.630> guy<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.870> like<00:01:58.080> holy

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the map right it's one guy is like holy

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.200 
the map right it's one guy is like holy

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
looked like it was a part of the

the<00:02:36.150> game<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.600> just<00:02:36.630> makes<00:02:36.960> it<00:02:37.050> look<00:02:37.110> prettier

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
the game it just makes it look prettier

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.430 
the game it just makes it look prettier
but<00:02:37.770> in<00:02:37.950> all<00:02:38.070> I<00:02:38.100> would<00:02:38.970> at<00:02:39.210> all<00:02:39.360> just<00:02:40.170> looking

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
but in all I would at all just looking

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.380 
but in all I would at all just looking
at<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.590> now<00:02:40.800> it's<00:02:41.490> actually<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.880> part<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.270> the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
at it now it's actually a part of the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.940 
at it now it's actually a part of the
game<00:02:42.570> as<00:02:42.750> part<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.170> LEvolution<00:02:43.770> here

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
game as part of the LEvolution here

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.760 
game as part of the LEvolution here
that's<00:02:44.580> right<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.209> also<00:02:45.510> gain<00:02:45.959> access<00:02:46.200> to

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
that's right and you also gain access to

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.880 
that's right and you also gain access to
an<00:02:47.220> anti<00:02:47.610> air<00:02:47.850> gun<00:02:48.120> as<00:02:48.300> well<00:02:48.660> through<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.650> boat
