00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
really look at from a performance

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.970 
really look at from a performance
standpoint<00:00:11.690> what<00:00:12.170> were<00:00:12.320> the<00:00:12.470> things<00:00:12.650> that<00:00:12.830> are

standpoint what were the things that are

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.310 
standpoint what were the things that are
represented<00:00:13.580> in<00:00:13.670> 82<00:00:13.970> but<00:00:14.720> then<00:00:14.870> at<00:00:14.990> the<00:00:15.110> same

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
represented in 82 but then at the same

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.680 
represented in 82 but then at the same
time<00:00:15.560> look<00:00:15.830> at<00:00:15.980> the<00:00:16.279> Air<00:00:16.400> Force<00:00:16.670> One<00:00:16.910> is<00:00:17.120> the<00:00:17.150> as

an<00:00:18.140> icon<00:00:18.950> of<00:00:18.980> design<00:00:19.550> and<00:00:20.240> what<00:00:20.480> were<00:00:20.630> some<00:00:20.780> of

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
an icon of design and what were some of

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.029 
an icon of design and what were some of
the<00:00:20.990> things<00:00:21.230> that<00:00:21.350> we<00:00:21.440> could<00:00:21.620> pull<00:00:21.860> out<00:00:22.010> of

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
the things that we could pull out of

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.100 
the things that we could pull out of
that<00:00:22.220> like<00:00:22.789> the<00:00:22.910> strong<00:00:23.210> horizontal<00:00:23.930> line

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
that like the strong horizontal line

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.620 
that like the strong horizontal line
that<00:00:24.289> the<00:00:24.410> cup<00:00:24.619> sold<00:00:24.890> represented<00:00:25.760> in<00:00:25.880> 1982

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
that the cup sold represented in 1982

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.450 
that the cup sold represented in 1982
and<00:00:27.140> what<00:00:27.289> would<00:00:27.410> a<00:00:27.440> modern<00:00:27.830> cups<00:00:28.100> will<00:00:28.310> be

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
and what would a modern cups will be

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.040 
and what would a modern cups will be
that's<00:00:28.789> why<00:00:29.030> we've<00:00:29.240> kind<00:00:29.420> of<00:00:29.480> constructed

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
that's why we've kind of constructed

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.829 
that's why we've kind of constructed
this<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:30.800> overall<00:00:31.160> look<00:00:31.400> we<00:00:32.149> from<00:00:32.809> a

this the overall look we from a

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:34.509 
this the overall look we from a
cushioning<00:00:33.319> standpoint<00:00:33.829> what<00:00:34.069> we've<00:00:34.219> done<00:00:34.370> in

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:34.519 
cushioning standpoint what we've done in

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.180 
cushioning standpoint what we've done in
this<00:00:34.670> product<00:00:34.940> is<00:00:35.210> actually<00:00:35.690> again<00:00:36.289> taken<00:00:36.679> 25

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
this product is actually again taken 25

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.860 
this product is actually again taken 25
years<00:00:37.489> of<00:00:37.579> learnings<00:00:38.030> and<00:00:38.179> roll<00:00:38.390> that<00:00:38.569> into

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
years of learnings and roll that into

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.930 
years of learnings and roll that into
one<00:00:39.079> so<00:00:39.260> we've<00:00:39.409> combined<00:00:39.859> two<00:00:40.069> of<00:00:40.190> our<00:00:40.489> our

so<00:01:35.960> from<00:01:36.200> a<00:01:36.290> performance<00:01:36.500> standpoint<00:01:37.010> not

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
so from a performance standpoint not

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.640 
so from a performance standpoint not
only<00:01:37.790> does<00:01:37.910> it<00:01:37.940> give<00:01:38.210> a<00:01:38.240> very<00:01:38.570> highly<00:01:39.140> crafted

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
only does it give a very highly crafted

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.410 
only does it give a very highly crafted
look<00:01:40.220> and<00:01:40.460> we<00:01:40.520> can<00:01:40.550> really<00:01:41.000> pay<00:01:41.210> about

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
look and we can really pay about

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.450 
look and we can really pay about
attention<00:01:41.750> to<00:01:41.930> it<00:01:42.170> to<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.770> detailing<00:01:43.190> of<00:01:43.400> the

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460
