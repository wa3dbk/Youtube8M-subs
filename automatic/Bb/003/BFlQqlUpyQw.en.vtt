gasket<00:00:13.380> issues<00:00:13.860> with<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.969> car<00:00:15.320> if<00:00:16.320> there<00:00:16.650> was

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
gasket issues with the car if there was

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.290 
gasket issues with the car if there was
all<00:00:17.010> your<00:00:17.190> getting<00:00:17.520> into<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.910> coolant<00:00:18.270> system

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
all your getting into the coolant system

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.990 
all your getting into the coolant system
this<00:00:19.230> current<00:00:19.710> wouldn't<00:00:19.980> be<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.310> clean

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
this current wouldn't be so clean

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.509 
this current wouldn't be so clean
it<00:00:21.900> looks<00:00:22.050> like<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:22.350> nice<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.010> fresh<00:00:23.250> so

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
it looks like it's nice and fresh so

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.060 
it looks like it's nice and fresh so
that's<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.820> good<00:00:23.939> sign<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.710> once<00:00:25.710> that's<00:00:25.920> out

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
that's a good sign and once that's out

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.240 
that's a good sign and once that's out
of<00:00:26.310> course<00:00:28.609> radiator<00:00:29.609> will<00:00:29.880> come<00:00:30.090> out

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
of course radiator will come out

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.650 
of course radiator will come out
actually<00:00:32.250> before<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.640> take<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.149> radio<00:00:33.420> out

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.280 
leaks here in terms of like a head
gasket<00:03:33.409> leak<00:03:33.860> so<00:03:34.159> that's<00:03:34.400> good<00:03:34.670> sign<00:03:34.970> I<00:03:35.290> think

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
gasket leak so that's good sign I think

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.809 
gasket leak so that's good sign I think
next<00:03:36.409> up<00:03:36.560> I'm<00:03:36.680> gonna<00:03:36.769> go<00:03:36.980> in

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
next up I'm gonna go in

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.729 
next up I'm gonna go in
rear<00:03:38.239> of<00:03:38.569> the<00:03:38.719> car<00:03:38.980> back<00:03:39.980> here<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:41.409> get<00:03:42.409> the

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
rear of the car back here and get the

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:57.640 
rear of the car back here and get the
intake<00:03:43.639> manifold<00:03:44.389> off<00:03:55.659> all<00:03:56.659> right<00:03:56.840> so<00:03:57.079> it<00:03:57.500> took

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
intake manifold off all right so it took

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.399 
intake manifold off all right so it took
me<00:03:57.799> a<00:03:57.829> while<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.219> get<00:03:58.310> these<00:03:58.489> bolts<00:03:58.849> out<00:03:58.989> but<00:03:59.989> it

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 
me a while to get these bolts out but it

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.589 
me a while to get these bolts out but it
is<00:04:00.590> out<00:04:00.829> so<00:04:01.310> now<00:04:01.489> we<00:04:01.549> can<00:04:01.790> pour<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.239> intake

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
is out so now we can pour the intake

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:21.279 
is out so now we can pour the intake
manifold<00:04:03.079> off<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:04.340> head<00:04:19.449> okay<00:04:20.449> so<00:04:20.509> oil

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
manifold off the head okay so oil

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:26.920 
manifold off the head okay so oil
dipstick<00:04:21.620> also<00:04:22.430> needs<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.699> come<00:04:22.849> out<00:04:23.620> okay<00:04:25.930> now

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
dipstick also needs to come out okay now

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:40.480 
dipstick also needs to come out okay now
I<00:04:27.199> think<00:04:28.060> is<00:04:29.060> a<00:04:29.449> 12<00:04:30.199> millimeters<00:04:39.160> take<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.310> guy

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
I think is a 12 millimeters take the guy

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.060 
I think is a 12 millimeters take the guy
out<00:04:42.639> dipstick<00:04:43.639> should<00:04:43.880> just<00:04:44.150> pop<00:04:44.360> right<00:04:44.419> up<00:04:45.070> if

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
out dipstick should just pop right up if

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:53.890 
out dipstick should just pop right up if
you<00:04:46.250> pull<00:04:46.580> it<00:04:46.610> up<00:04:48.639> like<00:04:49.639> so<00:04:52.060> all<00:04:53.060> right<00:04:53.210> so<00:04:53.479> now

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
you pull it up like so all right so now

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:09.909 
you pull it up like so all right so now
do<00:04:53.960> you<00:04:54.139> think<00:04:54.320> manifold<00:04:54.680> should<00:04:54.889> come<00:04:55.130> out<00:05:08.919> up

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
do you think manifold should come out up

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:16.719 
do you think manifold should come out up
here<00:05:13.240> all<00:05:14.240> right<00:05:14.770> now<00:05:15.770> recover<00:05:16.159> the<00:05:16.280> clearance

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
here all right now recover the clearance

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:22.260 
here all right now recover the clearance
back<00:05:16.970> there<00:05:18.909> now<00:05:19.909> next<00:05:20.180> thing<00:05:20.300> holding<00:05:20.780> up<00:05:20.990> the

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
back there now next thing holding up the

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.490 
back there now next thing holding up the
the<00:05:23.270> head<00:05:23.599> to<00:05:24.349> the<00:05:24.740> intake<00:05:25.430> system<00:05:25.699> is<00:05:26.500> exhaust

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
the head to the intake system is exhaust

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.740 
the head to the intake system is exhaust
manifold<00:05:28.039> think<00:05:28.219> this<00:05:28.370> is<00:05:28.550> the<00:05:28.759> worst<00:05:29.030> part

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
manifold think this is the worst part

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:38.520 
manifold think this is the worst part
about<00:05:30.020> doing<00:05:30.680> Dee

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:44.220 

doing<00:05:39.530> that<00:05:41.530> head<00:05:42.610> replacement<00:05:43.610> because

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
doing that head replacement because

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.730 
doing that head replacement because
these<00:05:45.230> boats<00:05:45.560> will<00:05:45.770> just<00:05:46.010> simply<00:05:46.520> the<00:05:47.330> most

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
these boats will just simply the most

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.070 
these boats will just simply the most
pain<00:05:48.740> in<00:05:48.950> the<00:05:49.070> ass<00:05:49.220> boats<00:05:49.970> on<00:05:50.330> the<00:05:50.390> whole<00:05:50.750> car

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
pain in the ass boats on the whole car

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.640 
pain in the ass boats on the whole car
to<00:05:51.500> remove<00:05:51.650> and<00:05:52.370> so<00:05:52.520> this<00:05:52.700> is<00:05:52.850> where<00:05:53.000> my<00:05:53.030> unique

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
to remove and so this is where my unique

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.160 
to remove and so this is where my unique
little<00:05:54.650> s-shaped<00:05:55.550> toe<00:05:55.760> comes<00:05:56.030> in<00:05:56.300> because

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
little s-shaped toe comes in because

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.810 
little s-shaped toe comes in because
there's<00:05:57.530> another<00:05:57.770> boat<00:05:58.070> back<00:05:58.310> here<00:05:58.580> on<00:05:58.730> the
