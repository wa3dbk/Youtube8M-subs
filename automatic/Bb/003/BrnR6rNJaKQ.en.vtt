00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.500
 one 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.660
 il jupiter 5 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.920
 suzuki engine same 250 gamma 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.560
 carburetors from Minsk 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.320
 and as far as understanding Chinese 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.450
 but the air on the drum through what 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.170
 rulers across chinese indian or 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.229
 Belarusian so it seems to me they 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.940
 will work fine this motor 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.180
 lady you a little run-in oil poured 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.940
 the more than you cant until 2 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.229
 the resonator should be his 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.590
 reinforcements combine without a second 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.450
 resonator well, I'm so clean on trial 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.420
 tried to make an interesting moment 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.119
 switch well, go snot still 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.130
 so clean try how to start like 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.920
 rides 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.930
 Switch honda dio Well let's see how he 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.740
 will with limiter will work for 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.509
 the border will see something if what 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.160
 principle i can either solder my 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:58.360
 ignition here either 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.310
 I can put the original somehow 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.840
 now probably it will be necessary 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.420
 disassemble remove engine weld 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.729
 finally mount while tacking 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.709
 hiding trail finally well 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.239
 after that, paint it all this garbage 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:19.540
 all away from here spend all schools 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:24.180
 clean up the places so in front of me already 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:27.750
 The fork came from Orion and it lies 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:33.070
 wheel disc brake at the same Soriano 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.660
 Spitz on the back I think it turns out 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.269
 big problem with the brakes so 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.680
 moved to this side here that is 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.480
 the area is strongly bent duma for 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.930
 write off the planet sport ovsky 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.340
 he has a drum right now this country in 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.810
 In this case there will be a brake and 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.130
 achieve even the side then everything will be 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.170
 fine back will be more likely all 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.350
 drums anyway for now see 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.620
 will there be enough before the disk like that 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.620
 So
