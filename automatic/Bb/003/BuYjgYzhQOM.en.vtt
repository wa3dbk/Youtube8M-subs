 a rat beer 33 centilitre 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:22.470
 oil in my case olive an onion 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.240
 four cloves of garlic 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.970
 2 carrots 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.890

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.760
 peppers and optional one pill 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.829
 Chicken broth concentrate first 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.480
 what we are going to do is put oil in a 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.460
 We will put it on a high heat 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.809
 We'll wait for it to be hot 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.150
 once the oil is hot 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.150
 let's move on to seal the chicken 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.780
 we give that is now way 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.780
 of the woman the both 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.990
 we change his face 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.130
 invent 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.149
 but this is what the truth is that the 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.149
 embassy 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.630
 and now also 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.680
 the leaf of the air 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.680
 and the onion 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.640
 and move it to try to put the onion 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.640
 to the chicken glass 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.430
 and we 'll wait for the onion and the garlic 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.000
 they suffered by moving it a little so that 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.000
 do not burn 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.689
 once the onion is fried this 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:01.359
 it's time to put the fire to 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.340
 medium-high and if you want to throw 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.740

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.019
 I'll throw it out later because 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.940
 at home we like al dente now we 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.090
 we will put the broth concentrate of 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.090
 chicken 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.830
 and the beer can 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.160
 we will move it 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.140
 and we'll leave it like that on medium-high heat 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.950
 after 5 minutes we will give you the 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.950

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.810
 and we will put the carrot 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.370

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.110

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.410

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.410

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.280

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.870
 there is a thick sauce with a 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.630
 look delicious so we turned off the 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.310
 fire and we set it apart with the quantities 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.500

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.170
