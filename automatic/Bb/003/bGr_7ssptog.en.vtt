00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
also such a high powered blender that

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.729 
also such a high powered blender that
it'll<00:03:25.020> really<00:03:25.170> do<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.560> job<00:03:25.590> well<00:03:29.660> okay

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
it'll really do the job well okay

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.630 
it'll really do the job well okay
because<00:03:31.739> we<00:03:31.890> were<00:03:32.010> able<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.459> use<00:03:32.610> a

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
because we were able to use a

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.360 
because we were able to use a
high-powered<00:03:33.420> blender<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.709> plunger<00:03:35.160> we

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
high-powered blender and the plunger we

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.050 
high-powered blender and the plunger we
were<00:03:35.520> able<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:36.180> create<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:36.780> very<00:03:37.590> rich<00:03:38.160> creamy

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
were able to create a very rich creamy

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.400 
were able to create a very rich creamy
cheese<00:03:39.570> like<00:03:39.900> sauce<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:41.660> by<00:03:42.660> only<00:03:42.959> adding<00:03:43.320> a

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
cheese like sauce and by only adding a

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.710 
cheese like sauce and by only adding a
third<00:03:43.709> cup<00:03:44.160> of<00:03:44.370> water<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:44.970> remains<00:03:45.300> really

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
third cup of water it remains really

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.340 
third cup of water it remains really
thick<00:03:46.280> okay<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:47.340> let's<00:03:47.610> put<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.910> kelp<00:03:48.150> noodles

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
thick okay so let's put the kelp noodles

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.640 
thick okay so let's put the kelp noodles
aside<00:03:49.350> for<00:03:49.770> a<00:03:49.800> moment<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:50.459> chop<00:03:51.209> our<00:03:51.510> kale<00:03:52.260> I

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
aside for a moment and chop our kale I

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.580 
aside for a moment and chop our kale I
like<00:03:53.520> to<00:03:53.700> hold<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.120> kale<00:03:54.420> together<00:03:54.870> pretty

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
like to hold the kale together pretty

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.670 
like to hold the kale together pretty
tightly<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.340> cut<00:03:56.610> it<00:03:56.700> in<00:03:56.820> half<00:03:56.850> and<00:03:57.540> then<00:03:58.350> put

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
tightly and cut it in half and then put

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.340 
tightly and cut it in half and then put
it<00:03:58.799> all<00:03:58.920> together<00:03:59.160> in<00:03:59.549> one<00:03:59.580> mound<00:04:00.239> and<00:04:00.690> it

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
it all together in one mound and it

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.979 
it all together in one mound and it
makes<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.739> much<00:04:01.920> easier<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.610> cut<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.360> then<00:04:03.870> you

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
makes it much easier to cut and then you

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:11.390 
makes it much easier to cut and then you
can<00:04:04.140> just<00:04:04.290> cut<00:04:04.680> in<00:04:04.980> little<00:04:05.930> portions<00:04:10.190> you<00:04:11.190> want

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
can just cut in little portions you want

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.190 
can just cut in little portions you want
it<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.640> be<00:04:11.730> pretty<00:04:12.060> small<00:04:12.510> but<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:12.930> doesn't

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
it to be pretty small but it doesn't

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.070 
it to be pretty small but it doesn't
have<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.530> be<00:04:13.560> real<00:04:14.549> tiny<00:04:15.169> just<00:04:16.169> basically

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
have to be real tiny just basically

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.800 
have to be real tiny just basically
bite-sized<00:04:19.669> and<00:04:20.669> then<00:04:21.030> we<00:04:21.120> want<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.359> grab<00:04:21.570> our

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
bite-sized and then we want to grab our

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.510 
bite-sized and then we want to grab our
kelp<00:04:22.140> noodles<00:04:23.060> and<00:04:24.680> grab<00:04:25.680> our<00:04:25.919> tomatoes<00:04:26.490> that

whole mixture together and you'll have

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.260

to<00:04:49.020> mix<00:04:49.260> it<00:04:49.500> for<00:04:49.530> about<00:04:49.860> I<00:04:50.460> don't<00:04:51.060> know<00:04:51.210> a

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
to mix it for about I don't know a

to mix it for about I don't know a
minute<00:04:51.690> and<00:04:51.810> a<00:04:51.870> half<00:04:51.900> or<00:04:52.410> so<00:04:52.440> just<00:04:52.919> to<00:04:53.070> really

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
minute and a half or so just to really

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.180

and<00:04:56.460> completely<00:04:57.450> covering<00:04:57.990> all<00:04:58.530> the

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
and completely covering all the

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.089 
and completely covering all the
vegetables<00:04:59.780> now<00:05:00.780> I<00:05:01.200> don't<00:05:01.320> know<00:05:01.530> about<00:05:01.680> you

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
vegetables now I don't know about you

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.279 
vegetables now I don't know about you
but<00:05:02.340> when<00:05:02.940> I<00:05:03.120> was<00:05:03.419> a<00:05:03.450> kid

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
but when I was a kid

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.579 
but when I was a kid
I<00:05:04.460> used<00:05:05.460> to<00:05:05.639> love<00:05:05.909> to<00:05:06.360> put<00:05:06.599> broccoli<00:05:07.080> and

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:07.589 
I used to love to put broccoli and

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:11.149 
I used to love to put broccoli and
tomatoes<00:05:07.770> on<00:05:08.369> my<00:05:09.050> macaroni<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.199> cheese<00:05:10.439> so<00:05:11.129> a

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
tomatoes on my macaroni and cheese so a

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.670 
tomatoes on my macaroni and cheese so a
little<00:05:11.520> bit<00:05:11.699> healthier<00:05:11.969> I<00:05:12.509> know<00:05:12.809> most<00:05:13.169> people

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
little bit healthier I know most people

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.029 
little bit healthier I know most people
probably<00:05:14.069> don't<00:05:14.839> do<00:05:15.839> that<00:05:16.110> but<00:05:16.559> this<00:05:16.830> is

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
probably don't do that but this is

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:20.209 
probably don't do that but this is
basically<00:05:17.490> a<00:05:17.819> similar<00:05:18.719> version<00:05:19.039> to<00:05:20.039> what<00:05:20.189> I

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:20.219 
basically a similar version to what I

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:22.869 
basically a similar version to what I
used<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.699> do<00:05:20.909> because<00:05:21.180> it's<00:05:21.509> got<00:05:21.689> the<00:05:22.020> cheese

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:22.879 
used to do because it's got the cheese
