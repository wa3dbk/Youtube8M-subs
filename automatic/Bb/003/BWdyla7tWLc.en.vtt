12-gauge shotgun it's a sidearm that's

available for all classes in the game of
battlefield<00:00:10.749> 4<00:00:10.809> and<00:00:11.289> I<00:00:11.740> believe<00:00:12.039> the<00:00:12.190> weapon

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
battlefield 4 and I believe the weapon

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.600 
battlefield 4 and I believe the weapon
itself<00:00:12.639> is<00:00:13.030> designed<00:00:13.570> around<00:00:13.929> specific<00:00:14.610> CQB

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
itself is designed around specific CQB

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.029 
itself is designed around specific CQB
and<00:00:15.879> defensive<00:00:16.449> gameplay<00:00:16.689> and<00:00:17.320> it's<00:00:17.529> probably

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
and defensive gameplay and it's probably

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.130 
and defensive gameplay and it's probably
one<00:00:18.580> of<00:00:18.609> the<00:00:18.760> best<00:00:19.060> firearms<00:00:19.539> that<00:00:19.660> ever<00:00:19.840> come

to the franchise of Battlefield 4 this
is<00:00:22.480> a<00:00:22.779> review<00:00:23.259> of<00:00:23.289> this<00:00:23.650> ball<00:00:23.859> game<00:00:24.070> shot

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.930 

the<00:00:50.170> cerebral<00:00:50.560> super<00:00:50.890> shorty<00:00:51.280> in<00:00:51.489> real<00:00:51.760> life

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
the cerebral super shorty in real life

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.799 
the cerebral super shorty in real life
was<00:00:52.150> introduced<00:00:52.660> in<00:00:52.900> 96<00:00:53.680> as<00:00:54.280> an<00:00:54.489> a<00:00:54.760> Oh<00:00:55.090> w<00:00:55.540> other

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
words than any other weapon to be in

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.920 
words than any other weapon to be in
compliance<00:00:57.970> with<00:00:58.150> the<00:00:58.330> National<00:00:58.480> Firearms

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
compliance with the National Firearms

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.260 
compliance with the National Firearms
Act<00:00:59.320> and<00:00:59.590> it's<00:01:00.160> a<00:01:00.250> weapon<00:01:00.580> that<00:01:00.610> is<00:01:00.850> originally

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
Act and it's a weapon that is originally

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.180 
Act and it's a weapon that is originally
manufactured<00:01:01.870> without<00:01:02.470> a<00:01:02.500> shoulder<00:01:02.950> stock

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
manufactured without a shoulder stock

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.680 
manufactured without a shoulder stock
therefore<00:01:03.670> considered<00:01:04.180> a<00:01:04.269> smoothbore

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
therefore considered a smoothbore

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.350 
therefore considered a smoothbore
Harrington<00:01:05.490> rather<00:01:06.490> than<00:01:06.700> a<00:01:06.790> short<00:01:07.000> barreled

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
Harrington rather than a short barreled

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.870 
Harrington rather than a short barreled
shotgun<00:01:07.420> and<00:01:07.990> so<00:01:08.140> in<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.380> game<00:01:08.560> and<00:01:09.520> video

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
shotgun and so in the game and video

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.109 
shotgun and so in the game and video
games<00:01:10.119> itself<00:01:10.660> it's<00:01:10.930> considered<00:01:11.500> a<00:01:11.619> sidearm

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
games itself it's considered a sidearm

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.210 
games itself it's considered a sidearm
as<00:01:13.119> opposed<00:01:13.510> to<00:01:13.630> a<00:01:13.750> primary<00:01:14.229> weapon<00:01:14.440> that<00:01:14.770> you

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
as opposed to a primary weapon that you

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.219 
as opposed to a primary weapon that you
would<00:01:15.369> normally<00:01:15.490> see<00:01:15.880> a<00:01:15.910> shotgun<00:01:16.210> B<00:01:16.509> and<00:01:16.750> so

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
would normally see a shotgun B and so

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:18.930 
would normally see a shotgun B and so
we've<00:01:17.560> seen<00:01:17.830> it<00:01:17.950> in<00:01:18.070> games<00:01:18.340> such<00:01:18.580> as<00:01:18.610> combat

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
we've seen it in games such as combat

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.670 
we've seen it in games such as combat
arms<00:01:19.360> there<00:01:19.600> was<00:01:19.720> also<00:01:19.930> a<00:01:19.960> game<00:01:20.140> called<00:01:20.350> zombie

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
arms there was also a game called zombie

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.040 
arms there was also a game called zombie
panic<00:01:21.009> that<00:01:21.100> had<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.369> weapon<00:01:21.670> itself<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.930> it

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
panic that had the weapon itself but it

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.770 
panic that had the weapon itself but it
wasn't<00:01:23.410> actually<00:01:23.590> really<00:01:24.399> introduced<00:01:24.940> into

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
wasn't actually really introduced into

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.840 
wasn't actually really introduced into
the<00:01:25.869> franchise<00:01:26.050> until<00:01:26.680> now<00:01:26.950> in<00:01:27.280> battlefield

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
the franchise until now in battlefield

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.969 
the franchise until now in battlefield
until<00:01:28.300> we<00:01:28.539> see<00:01:28.690> it<00:01:28.810> in<00:01:28.899> battlefield<00:01:29.289> 4<00:01:29.320> so<00:01:29.830> it's

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
until we see it in battlefield 4 so it's

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.650 
until we see it in battlefield 4 so it's
great<00:01:30.280> to<00:01:30.310> see<00:01:30.640> that<00:01:30.670> this<00:01:30.940> weapon<00:01:31.300> has<00:01:31.390> made

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
the size of the magazine so we'll see

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.869 
the size of the magazine so we'll see
the<00:02:46.780> sarahbooth<00:02:47.110> shorty<00:02:47.500> has<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:48.550> maximum

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
damage at 18 points per pellet which is

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:51.839 
damage at 18 points per pellet which is
8<00:02:51.310> pellets

8 pellets

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.790 
8 pellets
when<00:02:52.209> it<00:02:52.300> comes<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.569> each<00:02:52.690> shot<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:53.140> then<00:02:53.680> it

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
when it comes to each shot and then it

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.400 
when it comes to each shot and then it
drops<00:02:54.010> off<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.370> 6<00:02:54.580> points<00:02:54.940> at<00:02:55.209> 30<00:02:55.480> meters<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:55.989> 18

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
drops off to 6 points at 30 meters so 18

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.340 
drops off to 6 points at 30 meters so 18
points<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.520> going<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.120> be<00:02:58.240> at<00:02:58.330> 16<00:02:58.750> meters<00:02:58.870> and

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
points is going to be at 16 meters and

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.140 
points is going to be at 16 meters and
then<00:02:59.470> 6

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
then 6

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.729 
then 6
that's<00:03:00.390> gonna<00:03:00.480> be<00:03:00.659> a<00:03:00.689> 30<00:03:00.930> meters<00:03:01.260> meaning<00:03:01.620> that

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
that's gonna be a 30 meters meaning that

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.319 
that's gonna be a 30 meters meaning that
the<00:03:01.950> weapon<00:03:02.370> itself<00:03:02.640> is<00:03:02.819> more<00:03:03.030> designed

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
the weapon itself is more designed

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.420 
the weapon itself is more designed
between<00:03:03.959> what's<00:03:04.379> in<00:03:04.500> front<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.799> you<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.159> up<00:03:05.280> to

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
between what's in front of you and up to

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.399 
between what's in front of you and up to
about<00:03:05.549> 20<00:03:05.849> meters<00:03:06.120> so<00:03:06.390> connecting<00:03:07.110> all<00:03:07.260> those

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
about 20 meters so connecting all those

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.259 
about 20 meters so connecting all those
pellets<00:03:07.620> will<00:03:07.950> guarantee<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.400> one<00:03:08.790> shot<00:03:09.090> one

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
pellets will guarantee that one shot one

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.390 
pellets will guarantee that one shot one
kill<00:03:09.299> at<00:03:09.989> close<00:03:10.049> ranges<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:10.829> so<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:10.950> like<00:03:11.220> this

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
kill at close ranges and so I like this

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.649 
kill at close ranges and so I like this
weapon<00:03:11.730> if<00:03:11.849> I'm<00:03:11.970> playing<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.299> aggressive

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
weapon if I'm playing the aggressive

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.830 
weapon if I'm playing the aggressive
recon<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:13.650> allows<00:03:14.610> me<00:03:14.939> to<00:03:15.120> be<00:03:15.239> able<00:03:15.329> to<00:03:15.450> go<00:03:15.629> in

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
recon it allows me to be able to go in

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.690 
recon it allows me to be able to go in
and<00:03:16.079> if<00:03:16.170> I'm<00:03:16.319> not<00:03:16.349> guaranteed<00:03:17.129> that<00:03:17.310> kill<00:03:17.519> with

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
and if I'm not guaranteed that kill with

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.220 
and if I'm not guaranteed that kill with
that<00:03:17.849> bold<00:03:18.030> action<00:03:18.390> it's<00:03:18.659> going<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.959> finish

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
that bold action it's going to finish

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.259 
that bold action it's going to finish
off<00:03:19.470> its<00:03:19.680> target<00:03:20.069> because<00:03:20.310> of<00:03:20.459> such<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.120> the

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
off its target because of such of the

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.670 
off its target because of such of the
wide<00:03:21.420> range<00:03:21.810> that<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.109> brings<00:03:22.319> to<00:03:22.590> the

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
wide range that it brings to the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.679 
wide range that it brings to the
gameplay<00:03:23.159> of<00:03:23.189> Battlefield<00:03:23.790> you're<00:03:24.269> going<00:03:24.540> to

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:24.689 
gameplay of Battlefield you're going to

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:26.119 
gameplay of Battlefield you're going to
connect<00:03:25.079> just<00:03:25.439> like<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:25.739> would<00:03:25.890> any<00:03:26.040> other

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
connect just like you would any other

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.199 
connect just like you would any other
shotgun<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:27.359> only<00:03:27.540> counter<00:03:28.019> are<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.680> only<00:03:28.859> a

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
shotgun the only counter are the only a

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.309 
shotgun the only counter are the only a
bad<00:03:30.209> thing<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.510> guess<00:03:30.689> I<00:03:30.780> should<00:03:30.959> say<00:03:31.109> is<00:03:31.290> the

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
bad thing I guess I should say is the

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.750 
bad thing I guess I should say is the
fact<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:31.859> only<00:03:31.950> has<00:03:32.129> three<00:03:32.340> rounds<00:03:32.639> per

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
fact that it only has three rounds per

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.490 
fact that it only has three rounds per
magazine<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:33.720> you're<00:03:33.870> gonna<00:03:33.989> have<00:03:34.139> to<00:03:34.170> really

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
magazine so you're gonna have to really

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.830 
magazine so you're gonna have to really

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
certain situations in the game and so I

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.030 
certain situations in the game and so I
would<00:03:42.150> I<00:03:42.930> would<00:03:43.200> recommend<00:03:43.560> this<00:03:43.650> weapon<00:03:43.920> for

barrels<00:05:01.169> or<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.470> barrels<00:05:01.740> in<00:05:01.860> general<00:05:02.280> it

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
barrels or the barrels in general it

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.860 
barrels or the barrels in general it
just<00:05:02.490> depends<00:05:02.940> on<00:05:03.000> your<00:05:03.120> certain<00:05:03.419> play<00:05:03.570> style

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
just depends on your certain play style

I<00:05:04.050> don't<00:05:04.320> like<00:05:04.440> to<00:05:04.560> mess<00:05:04.770> with<00:05:04.919> any<00:05:05.099> of<00:05:05.190> the

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
I don't like to mess with any of the

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.339 
I don't like to mess with any of the
stats<00:05:05.520> that<00:05:05.699> are<00:05:05.849> already<00:05:06.030> there<00:05:06.479> with<00:05:07.260> the

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
stats that are already there with the

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.980 
stats that are already there with the
weapon<00:05:07.680> so<00:05:07.889> I<00:05:08.250> just<00:05:08.669> keep<00:05:08.849> it<00:05:09.000> as<00:05:09.210> basic<00:05:09.779> as<00:05:09.900> I

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
weapon so I just keep it as basic as I

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.629 
weapon so I just keep it as basic as I
can<00:05:10.200> with<00:05:10.380> the<00:05:10.469> standard<00:05:10.800> barrel<00:05:11.039> but<00:05:11.430> if<00:05:11.550> you

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
can with the standard barrel but if you

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.159 
can with the standard barrel but if you
like<00:05:11.760> to<00:05:11.880> go<00:05:12.000> for<00:05:12.180> more<00:05:12.479> of<00:05:12.659> a<00:05:12.719> medium<00:05:13.050> range

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
like to go for more of a medium range

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:13.940 
like to go for more of a medium range

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
you might want to go

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.440 
you might want to go
the<00:05:14.070> compensator<00:05:14.580> or<00:05:14.700> maybe<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.120> duckbill

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450

which<00:05:15.660> is<00:05:15.780> a<00:05:15.810> very<00:05:16.050> interesting<00:05:16.110> way<00:05:16.770> of

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
which is a very interesting way of

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.280 
which is a very interesting way of
spreading<00:05:17.640> the<00:05:17.910> pallets<00:05:18.240> with<00:05:18.420> a<00:05:18.450> shotgun<00:05:18.750> or

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
if you want to go for the longer range

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.940
