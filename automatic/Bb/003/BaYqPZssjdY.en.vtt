00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:13.119
 eat 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:16.670
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.980
 drew our video today 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.499
 it's about another important spirit change 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.339
 It used to be known is power 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:27.660
 but it is today 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.829
 not anymore 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.589
 has all the knowledge 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.460
 provided to all humanity 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.950
 I just have to enter a term and already that is allowed to know 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.160
 who are really successful 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.109
 they are the 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.220
 the strategic weaknesses 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.370
 on the walls 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.340
 and today I want to introduce you to such a tool 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.470
 with the 7th 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.600
 critical 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.579
 Approach can be to find out what are the top ten 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.620
 to this key term 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.850
 different 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.060
 or better than everyone else 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.499
 and how can you 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:08.630
 benefit from it now let's just assume our term would be such a very 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.420
 great term like stickers 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.510
 then this is such a high result that we therefore see as planned for 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.250
 20 million certain 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.250
 Nevertheless, the sticker has made it 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.180
 to reach the very top 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.070
 just like Kleykamp Trend 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.070
 Stickler stickers on stickers etc 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.360
 I would be nice if we could find out with a mouse click 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.360
 what have they done? 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.610
 what features does your website have? 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.510
 from which we can learn 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.490
 and just as a tool I imagine it today because with this tool they are 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.590
 in a position 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.729
 at each 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.870
 search result 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.960
 Get details I'll show you 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.789
 how tight 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.560
 surf the internet when it comes to the term sticker for example 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.259
 mentally activate menthol 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.519
 then I get here 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.519
 the same search results we just saw 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:19.509
 Indeed 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:24.319
 I get a lot more information vocally I get the example 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.639
 PageRank get the information 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:32.579
 why that in other search engines i war the age with them that i see 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.289
 can scroll here 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:35.519
 and get 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.629
 the age with van der Sar is findable 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:39.790
 I get so 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.229
 very many details 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:43.219
 to it 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.099
 single page 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.639
 and of course that is totally comfortable because now I can show it here 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:53.370
 an aside galvanizing October 2002 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:58.089
 but that's just the basic themes, so to speak, first of all 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:59.779
 he also stays hard 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:04.999
 yes or no and the fpÃ¶ can then provide this information in detail 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.239
 recall 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.099
 of course, that makes the whole thing extremely exciting 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.209
 because I will get information here 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.340
 I already 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.429
 a very good reason in formation 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:23.539
 Nevertheless, of course, the question arises why 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.490
 Sticker dealer so far up 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.879
 and it very often has to do with the text 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.169
 also Google after the 4 on the continent 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.629
 and of course it would be interesting to find out 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.309
 which content Hagen 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:42.519
 these 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.750
 corresponding Rapstar 1 and the tool 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:47.870
 following 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.809
 we'll just go now 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:55.549
 on our sticker online we are now on his website 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.799
 At the moment we like it visually or not 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.319
 that is something 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.489
 "That never really interested me because that's one 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.219
 taste story 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.739
 which is very much more interesting how he built his lyrics 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:14.149
 that's exactly what I'm interested in 

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:16.219
 because what I am doing now is 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:18.759
 I am describing more 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:19.889
 his 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.210
 Content is and that's what makes this tool for us 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.999
 it analyzes 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:30.909
 Text the wildlife analysis and show us how the text is structured 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:32.580
 that looks in this case 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.770
 Soost 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.389
 now we see here 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.840
 I get Titlis a metro-aktie Jurist the meters of the war 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.419
 Internet links and other parameters to see 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.419
 Although the age or the IFPI address plays 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.599
 but I still get something very important, namely I wars with 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.479
 is a text built 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:57.830
 his hit movie 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.919
 the silence 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.909
 here you can see stickers 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:04.809
 appears in the title Kilo etc and in the critical 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.360
 53 times in total and has a density of 3com has 3 5 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.979
 and sticker board seven times 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.210
 and you see here 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.089
 as Dr has built his complete text 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:21.480
 and if they write a text now 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.740
 then it would be sensational 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.240
 if you are here 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.569
 at the top 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:28.539
 Malabo can orient 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.719
 and lets say let's not build any page 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.159
 which is optimized for this key concept 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:37.259
 that is exactly 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.900
 I also have this information from my working hours 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.090
 because with this tool you can of course also your own website 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.430
 check 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.379
 and so they can be quasi 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:48.850
 on the hunt 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.830
 go to the top-ten 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.939
 to get ahead in their concept because 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:56.249
 Content, content 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:57.479
 is still 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.099
 a very valuable criterion 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:02.219
 to get ahead 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:05.680
 and this keyword density is the keyword density 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.749
 decide with it 

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:12.569
 whether their website is using the keywords in their search engines 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.089
 comes in front 

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:16.569
 from Dietzel the rails 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:17.490
 the tool 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.490
 imagine 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.469
 with it 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:24.680
 can use up to 30 and also gives them some tips they can use 

00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:26.439
 work optimally
