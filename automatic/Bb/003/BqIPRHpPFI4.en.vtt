 hi everyone knows mx3 and we get 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.500
 found on minecraft for the video of 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.230
 famous project I told you about 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.560
 some time ago and it is 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.420
 today finished so he will be at 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.660
 from now on at your disposal 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.340
 in the description of this video 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.680
 then at the level of the easter texture 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.099
 I advise you to take the one that 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.160
 I am currently using on the video 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.010
 who is I believe the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.290
 the jiangxi riham to craft a trick of the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.580
 kind finally it's very complicated the link 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.380
 would be in the description also 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.370
 do not worry it will not be very 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:49.220
 complicated so she found the map 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:51.989
 I do them all alone except at the end 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.120
 it was really complicated 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.199
 had planted a whole forest around the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.570
 castle and it seemed really very 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.530
 very very very long so but at 38 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.629
 gave me a little help 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.899
 plant all these weapons and do some 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.890
 resto systems did not end so he got me 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.410
 gave a little helping hand I 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.039
 thank you it was nice of him so 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.170
 the map 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:17.700
 go big enough it's a castle so 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.009
 a castle quietly a small 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.240
 garden a building in the middle to 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.310
 turn one wonders why but you 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.060
 will see that when you do my part 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.000
 it's just to add puzzles and 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.440
 structures all that from time to time 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.840
 map the map to finish it is necessary 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.430
 almost 30 minutes so counted for 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.190
 fastest of you the strongest 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.860
 in course in terms of jumping 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.509
 have fallen all for the most 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.899
 fast of you count 20 to 25 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.240
 minutes 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.140
 and for the longest around 45 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.300
 minutes we will say so there is some course 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.380
 basically and then small 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.209
 riddles stuff to recover it takes 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.140

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:02.130
