could have spent a lot more money to get
a<00:00:28.730> 2.8<00:00:30.109> which<00:00:31.109> would<00:00:31.320> have<00:00:31.439> been<00:00:31.560> good<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:31.980> low

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
a 2.8 which would have been good in low

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.310 
a 2.8 which would have been good in low
light<00:00:32.340> situations<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.210> things<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.540> but

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
light situations and things of that but

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.740 
light situations and things of that but
then<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.829> started<00:00:35.280> thinking<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.730> myself<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.540> lot

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
then I started thinking to myself a lot

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.389 
then I started thinking to myself a lot
of<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:36.989> photography<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:37.950> do<00:00:38.070> with

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
of the photography that I do with

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.160 
of the photography that I do with
landscapes<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.390> long<00:00:40.290> exposure<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.750> so<00:00:42.750> I'm

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
landscapes is long exposure and so I'm

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.450 
landscapes is long exposure and so I'm
not<00:00:43.800> really<00:00:44.160> worried<00:00:44.610> about<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.270> 2.8<00:00:46.399> so<00:00:47.399> I

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
not really worried about the 2.8 so I

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.690 
not really worried about the 2.8 so I
went<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:47.820> for<00:00:48.090> 1<00:00:48.300> or<00:00:48.510> f/4<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
went with this for 1 or f/4 and so the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.090 
went with this for 1 or f/4 and so the
price<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.180> paid<00:00:51.539> was<00:00:53.420> around<00:00:54.420> 375<00:00:55.020> now<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
price that I paid was around 375 now the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.430 
price that I paid was around 375 now the
quality<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.149> lens<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:59.149> spectacular<00:01:00.149> I

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
quality of this lens is spectacular I

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.270 
quality of this lens is spectacular I
think<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:02.030> one<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.270> one<00:01:03.890> that<00:01:04.890> compares

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
think it's one it's one that compares

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.800 
think it's one it's one that compares
with<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:06.030> Nikon's<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:08.100> canons<00:01:08.810> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
with the Nikon's and the canons the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.020 
with the Nikon's and the canons the
quality<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.380> good<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.130> one<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.850> their

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
quality is good this is one of their

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.800

their<00:01:12.630> pro<00:01:12.930> lenses<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.560> clean<00:01:13.740> its<00:01:13.860> pro<00:01:14.010> lenses

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
the only thing there's a couple things

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.800 
the only thing there's a couple things
that<00:02:18.299> are<00:02:18.480> bad<00:02:18.629> about<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:18.870> lens<00:02:20.599> first<00:02:21.599> of

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
that are bad about this lens first of

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.800 
that are bad about this lens first of
all<00:02:21.870> if<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:22.109> got<00:02:22.260> auto<00:02:23.189> auto<00:02:24.060> focus<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:24.659> main

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
all if you got auto auto focus and main

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.800 
all if you got auto auto focus and main
focus<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:26.030> this<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.209> not<00:02:27.359> one<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.719> bad

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
focus and this is not one of the bad

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.479 
focus and this is not one of the bad
things<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.349> we'll<00:02:28.590> just<00:02:28.709> switch<00:02:29.159> from<00:02:29.340> auto

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
things so we'll just switch from auto

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.819 
things so we'll just switch from auto
focus<00:02:29.879> to<00:02:30.000> manual<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.599> push<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.439> ring<00:02:31.620> down

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
focus to manual you push the ring down

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.959 
focus to manual you push the ring down
like<00:02:32.579> that<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:34.530> push<00:02:34.889> it<00:02:35.010> back<00:02:35.129> up<00:02:35.280> so

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:35.969 
like that and you push it back up so

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:37.849 
like that and you push it back up so
that's<00:02:36.719> not<00:02:36.989> too<00:02:37.260> bad

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
that's not too bad

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.069 
that's not too bad
the<00:02:38.219> I've<00:02:38.760> seen<00:02:38.819> lenses<00:02:39.389> that<00:02:39.510> do<00:02:39.689> that<00:02:39.840> and

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
the I've seen lenses that do that and

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.330 
the I've seen lenses that do that and
that<00:02:40.290> doesn't<00:02:40.560> bother<00:02:40.680> me<00:02:40.829> because<00:02:41.069> when

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
that doesn't bother me because when

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.459 
that doesn't bother me because when
you're<00:02:41.459> switching<00:02:41.670> from<00:02:41.790> manual<00:02:42.359> to<00:02:42.469> focus

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:43.469 
you're switching from manual to focus

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.599 
you're switching from manual to focus
its<00:02:43.620> auto<00:02:43.799> focus<00:02:44.389> this<00:02:45.389> is<00:02:45.720> not<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.769> much<00:02:46.829> of

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
its auto focus this is not that much of

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.789 
its auto focus this is not that much of
a<00:02:47.760> hassle<00:02:47.939> compared<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.599> a<00:02:48.629> switch<00:02:48.930> anything

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
a hassle compared to a switch anything

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.490 
a hassle compared to a switch anything
unless<00:02:50.220> you're<00:02:50.519> just<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:51.269> know<00:02:51.599> you're<00:02:52.109> so

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
unless you're just you know you're so

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.409 
unless you're just you know you're so
worried<00:02:52.829> about<00:02:52.889> that<00:02:53.159> but<00:02:53.489> it's<00:02:54.150> something

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:54.419 
worried about that but it's something

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.509 
worried about that but it's something
small<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.409> only<00:02:55.590> thing<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:55.859> I<00:02:55.889> don't<00:02:56.010> like

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
small the only thing that I don't like

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.920 
small the only thing that I don't like
is<00:02:56.819> this<00:02:57.599> doesn't<00:02:58.049> have<00:02:58.969> manual<00:02:59.969> override<00:03:00.389> so

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
is this doesn't have manual override so

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.220 
is this doesn't have manual override so
if<00:03:01.019> I'm<00:03:01.139> an<00:03:01.260> auto<00:03:01.439> focus<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.419> I<00:03:03.419> want<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.989> kind

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
if I'm an auto focus and I want to kind

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.649 
if I'm an auto focus and I want to kind
of<00:03:04.349> focus<00:03:05.069> it<00:03:05.459> in<00:03:06.500> manual<00:03:07.500> mode<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:08.700> doesn't<00:03:09.359> it

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
of focus it in manual mode it doesn't it

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:10.849 
of focus it in manual mode it doesn't it
doesn't<00:03:09.959> do<00:03:10.049> that<00:03:10.079> you<00:03:10.319> have<00:03:10.409> to<00:03:10.500> switch<00:03:10.829> to

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
doesn't do that you have to switch to

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.259 
doesn't do that you have to switch to
manual<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.790> do<00:03:11.909> that<00:03:12.090> some<00:03:13.049> lenses<00:03:13.379> like<00:03:14.269> like

my<00:03:15.419> 50<00:03:15.719> millimeter<00:03:16.139> if<00:03:16.819> I'm<00:03:17.819> in<00:03:18.269> Auto<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:19.549> can

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
my 50 millimeter if I'm in Auto I can

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.949 
my 50 millimeter if I'm in Auto I can
manually<00:03:21.120> focus<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:22.229> lens<00:03:22.549> see<00:03:23.690> so<00:03:24.690> that's

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
manually focus the lens see so that's

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.099 
manually focus the lens see so that's
one<00:03:25.109> thing<00:03:25.260> that's<00:03:25.379> bad<00:03:25.620> also<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.690> I<00:03:27.690> did

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
one thing that's bad also I I did

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.789 
one thing that's bad also I I did
realize<00:03:28.470> this<00:03:28.769> when<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.069> bought<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.989> but<00:03:30.989> it<00:03:31.319> is

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
realize this when I bought it but it is

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.289 
realize this when I bought it but it is
a<00:03:31.829> bit<00:03:32.159> something<00:03:32.549> that's<00:03:32.699> kind<00:03:32.970> of<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.090> bummer

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
a bit something that's kind of a bummer

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.689 
a bit something that's kind of a bummer
but<00:03:33.479> this<00:03:33.840> is<00:03:34.109> only<00:03:34.439> for<00:03:34.979> crop<00:03:35.189> sensor<00:03:35.609> lenses

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:37.699 
but this is only for crop sensor lenses

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:44.899 
but this is only for crop sensor lenses
not<00:03:38.699> sure<00:03:38.970> if<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.239> can<00:03:39.329> can<00:03:39.900> tell<00:03:41.659> but<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:44.430> does

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
not sure if you can can tell but it does

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:51.999 
not sure if you can can tell but it does
look<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.629> lot<00:03:46.379> smaller<00:03:47.599> compared<00:03:48.599> to<00:03:49.879> this<00:03:50.879> oh

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:52.009 
look a lot smaller compared to this oh

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:57.439 
look a lot smaller compared to this oh
come<00:03:53.009> on<00:03:53.129> to<00:03:54.120> this<00:03:54.739> that's<00:03:55.739> because<00:03:56.159> my<00:03:57.090> 50

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
come on to this that's because my 50

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:01.490 
come on to this that's because my 50
millimeter<00:03:57.870> can<00:03:58.739> fit<00:03:59.069> on<00:03:59.930> crop<00:04:00.930> sensor<00:04:01.290> and

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
millimeter can fit on crop sensor and

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.280 
millimeter can fit on crop sensor and
full-frame<00:04:01.859> but<00:04:02.639> this<00:04:03.000> only<00:04:03.659> fits<00:04:03.930> on<00:04:04.049> crop

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
full-frame but this only fits on crop

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.719 
full-frame but this only fits on crop
sensor<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:05.299> I<00:04:06.299> thought<00:04:06.540> about<00:04:06.659> it<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.729> it

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:08.729 
sensor and I thought about it and it

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.360 
sensor and I thought about it and it
does<00:04:08.970> stink<00:04:09.299> but<00:04:09.659> for<00:04:10.590> right<00:04:10.739> now<00:04:10.949> where<00:04:11.220> I'm

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
and it comes blended and I was looking

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.940 
and it comes blended and I was looking
at<00:04:57.020> the<00:04:57.140> other<00:04:57.170> lenses<00:04:57.620> and<00:04:57.740> I<00:04:57.800> actually

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
at the other lenses and I actually

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.040 
at the other lenses and I actually
purchased<00:04:58.280> before<00:04:58.760> this<00:04:58.910> I<00:04:59.120> purchased<00:04:59.750> the

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
purchased before this I purchased the

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.250 
purchased before this I purchased the
the<00:05:00.860> Rokinon<00:05:01.340> 40<00:05:01.820> millimeter<00:05:02.240> 2.8<00:05:02.720> and<00:05:02.840> I<00:05:03.080> was

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
the Rokinon 40 millimeter 2.8 and I was

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.980 
the Rokinon 40 millimeter 2.8 and I was
I<00:05:03.820> thought<00:05:04.820> that<00:05:05.060> it<00:05:05.270> would<00:05:05.360> be<00:05:05.510> a<00:05:05.540> good<00:05:05.750> fit

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
I thought that it would be a good fit

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.040 
I thought that it would be a good fit
for<00:05:06.020> me<00:05:06.200> this<00:05:06.560> is<00:05:06.770> 14<00:05:07.280> I<00:05:07.669> kind<00:05:08.630> of<00:05:08.660> like<00:05:08.810> prime

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
for me this is 14 I kind of like prime

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.340 
for me this is 14 I kind of like prime
lenses<00:05:09.440> and<00:05:09.740> it's<00:05:10.280> a<00:05:10.340> 2.8<00:05:10.850> and<00:05:11.030> I<00:05:11.990> thought<00:05:12.230> to

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
lenses and it's a 2.8 and I thought to

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.470 
lenses and it's a 2.8 and I thought to
myself<00:05:12.470> maybe<00:05:12.890> I<00:05:13.040> can<00:05:13.250> get<00:05:13.370> past<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:13.820> fact

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
myself maybe I can get past the fact

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.540 
myself maybe I can get past the fact
that<00:05:14.540> it's<00:05:14.750> just<00:05:14.960> manual<00:05:15.440> and<00:05:15.740> I<00:05:16.130> figure<00:05:16.460> it

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
that it's just manual and I figure it

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.610 
that it's just manual and I figure it
out<00:05:16.640> but<00:05:17.210> in<00:05:17.840> the<00:05:17.900> end<00:05:18.640> you<00:05:19.640> know<00:05:20.140> I'm<00:05:21.140> not<00:05:21.560> a

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
out but in the end you know I'm not a

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.950 
out but in the end you know I'm not a
pro<00:05:21.980> I'm<00:05:22.310> not<00:05:22.730> gonna<00:05:22.880> be<00:05:23.090> doing<00:05:23.419> manual

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
pro I'm not gonna be doing manual

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.360 
pro I'm not gonna be doing manual
focusing<00:05:24.530> all<00:05:24.740> the<00:05:24.830> time

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
focusing all the time

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.030 
focusing all the time
I<00:05:25.400> barely<00:05:26.270> do<00:05:26.510> many<00:05:26.690> focusing<00:05:27.260> now<00:05:27.440> and<00:05:27.800> I<00:05:27.860> have

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
I barely do many focusing now and I have

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.760 
I barely do many focusing now and I have
the<00:05:28.220> option<00:05:28.340> to<00:05:28.640> switch<00:05:28.790> from<00:05:28.940> manual<00:05:29.360> to<00:05:29.480> auto

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
the option to switch from manual to auto

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.280 
the option to switch from manual to auto
I'm<00:05:30.770> not<00:05:31.010> I<00:05:31.040> don't<00:05:31.750> right<00:05:32.750> now<00:05:32.780> I<00:05:32.900> don't<00:05:33.080> see

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
I'm not I don't right now I don't see

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.040 
I'm not I don't right now I don't see
the<00:05:33.410> point<00:05:33.830> of<00:05:33.979> it<00:05:34.130> unless<00:05:34.310> I'm<00:05:34.520> trying<00:05:34.700> to<00:05:35.050> you

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
the point of it unless I'm trying to you

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.600 
the point of it unless I'm trying to you
know<00:05:36.169> focus<00:05:37.160> where<00:05:37.850> it's<00:05:38.000> not<00:05:38.290> anyways

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
know focus where it's not anyways

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.110 
know focus where it's not anyways
so<00:05:40.610> needless<00:05:41.419> to<00:05:41.450> say<00:05:42.160> this<00:05:43.160> this<00:05:43.490> was<00:05:43.760> I<00:05:43.880> paid

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
so needless to say this this was I paid

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.270 
so needless to say this this was I paid
around<00:05:44.240> the<00:05:44.419> same<00:05:44.570> price<00:05:44.690> -<00:05:44.990> it<00:05:45.380> was<00:05:45.560> 350<00:05:46.100> for

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
around the same price - it was 350 for

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.969 
around the same price - it was 350 for
the<00:05:46.340> Rokinon<00:05:46.820> I<00:05:47.060> paid<00:05:47.300> 375<00:05:47.540> I<00:05:48.050> got<00:05:48.169> to<00:05:48.290> use<00:05:48.470> good

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
the Rokinon I paid 375 I got to use good

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:52.150 
the Rokinon I paid 375 I got to use good
deal<00:05:49.300> right<00:05:50.300> now<00:05:50.479> it's<00:05:50.720> around<00:05:50.810> 375<00:05:51.470> on<00:05:51.740> Amazon

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
deal right now it's around 375 on Amazon

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.219 
deal right now it's around 375 on Amazon
give<00:05:52.520> or<00:05:52.610> take<00:05:52.760> I<00:05:53.030> was<00:05:53.630> also<00:05:53.810> looking<00:05:53.960> at<00:05:54.140> the

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
give or take I was also looking at the

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.650 
give or take I was also looking at the
Sigma<00:05:54.500> but<00:05:55.310> that<00:05:55.460> was<00:05:55.550> there's<00:05:56.090> one<00:05:56.360> there's

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
Sigma but that was there's one there's

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.250 
Sigma but that was there's one there's
two<00:05:56.720> Sigma's<00:05:57.229> there's<00:05:57.440> one<00:05:57.590> that's<00:05:58.000> a<00:05:59.260> three

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
two Sigma's there's one that's a three

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.380 
two Sigma's there's one that's a three
point<00:06:00.500> F<00:06:00.860> three<00:06:01.100> point<00:06:01.310> five<00:06:01.460> so<00:06:02.240> it's

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.390 
point F three point five so it's

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.600 
point F three point five so it's
constant<00:06:02.960> at<00:06:03.110> F<00:06:03.620> three<00:06:03.890> point<00:06:04.070> five<00:06:04.220> which<00:06:04.460> is

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
constant at F three point five which is

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.000 
constant at F three point five which is
better<00:06:04.880> than<00:06:05.090> a<00:06:05.180> four<00:06:05.419> obviously<00:06:05.960> but<00:06:06.770> that

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
better than a four obviously but that

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.150 
better than a four obviously but that
was<00:06:07.190> like<00:06:07.310> $5.99<00:06:08.120> and<00:06:08.560> you're<00:06:09.560> missing<00:06:09.919> some

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
was like $5.99 and you're missing some

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.790 
was like $5.99 and you're missing some
of<00:06:10.190> the<00:06:10.400> focal<00:06:10.760> lengths<00:06:10.910> for<00:06:11.060> ten<00:06:11.300> to<00:06:11.419> twenty

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
of the focal lengths for ten to twenty

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.100 
of the focal lengths for ten to twenty
and<00:06:12.800> I<00:06:13.160> didn't<00:06:13.370> like<00:06:13.490> it<00:06:13.780> then<00:06:14.780> there's<00:06:14.960> the

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
and I didn't like it then there's the

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.390 
and I didn't like it then there's the
Tamron<00:06:15.560> 10<00:06:15.919> to<00:06:16.040> 24<00:06:16.490> but<00:06:17.090> that<00:06:17.270> was<00:06:17.479> a<00:06:17.510> 3.5<00:06:18.130> to<00:06:19.130> 4

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
Tamron 10 to 24 but that was a 3.5 to 4

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.020 
Tamron 10 to 24 but that was a 3.5 to 4
point<00:06:20.000> 5<00:06:20.180> that<00:06:21.140> was<00:06:21.260> around<00:06:21.470> 380<00:06:21.740> to<00:06:22.040> 499

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
point 5 that was around 380 to 499

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.900 
point 5 that was around 380 to 499
depending<00:06:23.600> if<00:06:23.900> you<00:06:23.990> bought<00:06:24.140> user<00:06:24.380> new<00:06:24.910> but

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
depending if you bought user new but

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.520 
depending if you bought user new but
that<00:06:25.940> wasn't<00:06:26.390> a<00:06:26.419> constant<00:06:26.870> aperture<00:06:27.050> which<00:06:27.410> is

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
that wasn't a constant aperture which is

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.530 
that wasn't a constant aperture which is
what<00:06:27.650> I<00:06:27.680> was<00:06:27.830> looking<00:06:28.040> for<00:06:28.070> in<00:06:28.370> this<00:06:28.540> then

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
what I was looking for in this then

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.420 
what I was looking for in this then
there's<00:06:29.750> a<00:06:29.810> Canon<00:06:30.169> 10<00:06:30.350> to<00:06:30.440> 22<00:06:30.830> that's<00:06:31.160> the<00:06:31.250> same

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
there's a Canon 10 to 22 that's the same

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:37.080 
there's a Canon 10 to 22 that's the same
thing<00:06:31.700> it's<00:06:32.060> F<00:06:32.360> 3.5<00:06:33.200> to<00:06:33.530> 4.5<00:06:34.130> and<00:06:35.320> so<00:06:36.320> you<00:06:36.740> know

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
thing it's F 3.5 to 4.5 and so you know

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.730 
thing it's F 3.5 to 4.5 and so you know
this<00:06:38.090> is<00:06:38.240> what<00:06:38.360> I<00:06:38.390> wanted<00:06:38.750> I<00:06:38.870> wanna<00:06:39.110> constant

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
this is what I wanted I wanna constant

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.130 
this is what I wanted I wanna constant
sure<00:06:39.920> I<00:06:39.980> wanted<00:06:40.220> to<00:06:40.280> switch<00:06:40.700> from<00:06:41.150> 24<00:06:41.690> to<00:06:41.900> 12

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
sure I wanted to switch from 24 to 12

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.190 
sure I wanted to switch from 24 to 12
and<00:06:42.440> still<00:06:42.740> be<00:06:42.890> an<00:06:42.980> f4<00:06:43.340> if<00:06:43.430> I<00:06:43.520> need<00:06:43.700> to<00:06:44.080> like<00:06:45.080> I

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.200 
and still be an f4 if I need to like I
