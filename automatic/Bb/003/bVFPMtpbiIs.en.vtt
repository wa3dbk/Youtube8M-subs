so we started a little bit there in the

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.640

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
was the key please you know we just

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.460 
was the key please you know we just
played<00:03:24.760> our<00:03:24.910> hockey<00:03:25.300> and<00:03:25.630> especially<00:03:26.230> after

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
played our hockey and especially after

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.080 
played our hockey and especially after
we<00:03:26.950> came<00:03:27.130> in<00:03:27.280> here<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.490> first<00:03:27.700> game<00:03:27.880> and<00:03:28.000> they

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
we came in here the first game and they

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.760 
we came in here the first game and they
beat<00:03:28.120> us<00:03:28.270> we<00:03:28.540> responded<00:03:29.050> really<00:03:29.170> well<00:03:29.320> and<00:03:29.650> I

beat us we responded really well and I

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.170 
beat us we responded really well and I
think<00:03:29.800> that<00:03:30.070> was<00:03:30.250> one<00:03:30.580> of<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.730> big<00:03:30.880> turning

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180

part<00:04:56.580> we<00:04:56.760> played<00:04:57.030> what<00:04:57.630> I'd<00:04:57.780> say<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.110> right

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
part we played what I'd say the right

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.710 
part we played what I'd say the right
way<00:04:58.560> got<00:04:59.310> out<00:04:59.430> of<00:04:59.550> our<00:04:59.640> input<00:05:00.030> box<00:05:00.270> in<00:05:00.420> behind

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
way got out of our input box in behind

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.210 
way got out of our input box in behind
him<00:05:00.840> and<00:05:00.990> tried<00:05:01.380> to<00:05:01.470> make<00:05:01.530> them<00:05:01.770> defend

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
him and tried to make them defend

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.710 
him and tried to make them defend
obviously<00:05:02.910> got<00:05:03.090> a<00:05:03.120> little<00:05:03.210> hairy<00:05:03.420> there<00:05:03.510> in

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
obviously got a little hairy there in

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.600 
obviously got a little hairy there in
the<00:05:03.810> third<00:05:04.080> but<00:05:04.890> I<00:05:04.920> think<00:05:05.100> that's<00:05:05.280> you<00:05:05.580> know

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610

the third but I think that's you know
when<00:05:05.820> you're<00:05:05.940> closing<00:05:06.210> out<00:05:06.480> a<00:05:06.510> team<00:05:06.810> that<00:05:07.050> has

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
as much pride as this team does it's

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.220 
as much pride as this team does it's
hard<00:05:08.850> to<00:05:08.970> do<00:05:09.150> and<00:05:09.330> they<00:05:09.510> made<00:05:09.690> it<00:05:09.840> hard<00:05:09.990> on<00:05:10.080> us

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
hard to do and they made it hard on us

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.140 
hard to do and they made it hard on us

need depth the scoring throughout the
playoffs<00:05:25.710> you<00:05:25.980> can't<00:05:26.190> just<00:05:26.400> rely<00:05:26.640> on<00:05:26.670> one<00:05:26.880> or

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
playoffs you can't just rely on one or

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.550 
playoffs you can't just rely on one or
two<00:05:27.030> guys<00:05:27.330> obviously<00:05:27.600> Paul<00:05:28.020> cannons<00:05:28.320> been<00:05:28.470> on

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
two guys obviously Paul cannons been on

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.990

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
fire and scored again tonight but I

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.250 
fire and scored again tonight but I
thought<00:05:30.360> you<00:05:30.600> know<00:05:30.660> when<00:05:30.780> you're<00:05:30.870> four<00:05:31.050> fine

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
thought you know when you're four fine

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.810 
thought you know when you're four fine
go<00:05:31.470> out<00:05:31.590> there<00:05:31.740> and<00:05:31.800> win<00:05:31.950> ships<00:05:32.310> which<00:05:32.550> is<00:05:32.670> what

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
go out there and win ships which is what

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.340 
go out there and win ships which is what
they<00:05:32.940> did<00:05:33.150> they<00:05:33.300> want<00:05:33.540> shifts<00:05:33.930> and<00:05:34.080> then<00:05:34.200> they

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
they did they want shifts and then they

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.380 
they did they want shifts and then they
ended<00:05:34.860> up<00:05:34.980> getting<00:05:35.280> rewarded<00:05:35.700> with<00:05:35.820> a<00:05:35.880> goal<00:05:36.120> so

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
ended up getting rewarded with a goal so

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.300 
ended up getting rewarded with a goal so
you<00:05:37.140> need<00:05:37.320> that<00:05:37.500> as<00:05:37.650> you<00:05:37.740> move<00:05:37.770> throughout<00:05:38.160> the

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
you need that as you move throughout the

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:48.170 
you need that as you move throughout the
play<00:05:38.490> I<00:05:45.620> think<00:05:46.620> if<00:05:46.740> you<00:05:46.830> look<00:05:47.070> at<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:47.550> actual

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
play I think if you look at the actual

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.320 
play I think if you look at the actual
games<00:05:48.660> you<00:05:49.590> know<00:05:49.710> Game<00:05:49.950> one<00:05:50.250> we<00:05:50.790> scored<00:05:51.090> about

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
games you know Game one we scored about

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.960 
games you know Game one we scored about
three<00:05:51.600> minutes<00:05:51.780> to<00:05:51.930> play<00:05:52.020> to<00:05:52.260> win<00:05:53.070> it<00:05:53.190> game<00:05:53.940> for

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
three minutes to play to win it game for

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.450 
three minutes to play to win it game for
we<00:05:54.420> score<00:05:54.660> in<00:05:54.750> overtime<00:05:55.040> game<00:05:56.040> two<00:05:56.220> I<00:05:56.250> thought

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
we score in overtime game two I thought

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.340 
we score in overtime game two I thought
we<00:05:56.610> carried<00:05:57.180> the<00:05:57.240> play<00:05:57.420> game<00:05:57.660> throughout<00:05:58.170> the

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
we carried the play game throughout the

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.630 
we carried the play game throughout the
day<00:05:58.470> carry<00:05:58.740> the<00:05:58.860> play<00:05:59.010> so<00:05:59.190> the<00:05:59.310> two<00:05:59.460> of<00:05:59.550> those

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
day carry the play so the two of those

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.520 
day carry the play so the two of those
games<00:05:59.850> were<00:06:00.120> really<00:06:00.480> a<00:06:00.630> little<00:06:01.050> bit<00:06:01.170> of<00:06:01.260> flip<00:06:01.440> a

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
games were really a little bit of flip a

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.320 
games were really a little bit of flip a
coin<00:06:01.710> and<00:06:01.770> we<00:06:02.040> found<00:06:02.250> a<00:06:02.370> way<00:06:02.460> to<00:06:02.520> win<00:06:02.640> them<00:06:02.910> put
