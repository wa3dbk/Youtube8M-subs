here<00:00:33.140> that<00:00:35.360> this<00:00:36.360> had<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> same<00:00:36.930> problems<00:00:37.640> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
here that this had the same problems the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.630 
here that this had the same problems the
outer<00:00:38.879> pins<00:00:39.269> on<00:00:39.480> here<00:00:39.780> were<00:00:40.470> just<00:00:40.890> block<00:00:41.280> and

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
outer pins on here were just block and

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.330 
outer pins on here were just block and
tarnished<00:00:42.239> inside<00:00:42.930> ones<00:00:43.170> pretty<00:00:43.800> dirty<00:00:44.039> but

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
tarnished inside ones pretty dirty but

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.420 
tarnished inside ones pretty dirty but
how<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.059> cleaned<00:00:45.420> it

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
how I cleaned it

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.229 
how I cleaned it
I<00:00:47.460> got<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> shish<00:00:48.300> kebab<00:00:48.690> stick<00:00:49.879> with<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> sharp

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
I got a shish kebab stick with a sharp

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.830 
I got a shish kebab stick with a sharp
point<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.340> just<00:00:53.340> wound<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:54.030> little<00:00:54.600> bit<00:00:54.719> of

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
point and just wound a little bit of

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.819 
point and just wound a little bit of
cotton<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.559> it

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
cotton on to it

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.849 
cotton on to it
not<00:00:56.430> very<00:00:56.640> much<00:00:56.850> cotton<00:00:57.320> just<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.469> little<00:00:58.710> bit

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
not very much cotton just a little bit

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.880 
not very much cotton just a little bit
and<00:00:59.160> then<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.820> used<00:01:00.090> silver<00:01:00.750> polish<00:01:01.320> because<00:01:01.590> it

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
and then I used silver polish because it

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.979 
and then I used silver polish because it
removes<00:01:02.219> tarnish<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.910> well<00:01:03.090> shook<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.899> up

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
removes tarnish so well shook it up

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.990 
removes tarnish so well shook it up
really<00:01:04.289> well<00:01:04.410> just<00:01:04.470> just<00:01:05.399> swap<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.940> around

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
really well just just swap that around

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.980 
really well just just swap that around
the<00:01:06.360> top<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.649> went<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.420> MagSafe

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
the top and I went in on the MagSafe

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.070 
the top and I went in on the MagSafe
connector<00:01:10.380> with<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.340> actually<00:01:12.300> got<00:01:12.899> it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
connector with this and actually got it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.450 
connector with this and actually got it
into<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.860> outer<00:01:14.090> two<00:01:15.090> terminals<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.310> spun<00:01:17.310> it

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
into the outer two terminals and spun it

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.810 
into the outer two terminals and spun it
around<00:01:17.610> lots<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.720> times<00:01:19.020> actually<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.340> rubbed

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
around lots of times actually I rubbed

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.609 
around lots of times actually I rubbed
the<00:01:21.060> silver<00:01:21.479> polish<00:01:21.900> all<00:01:22.080> over<00:01:22.259> their<00:01:22.409> course

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the silver polish all over their course

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.300 
the silver polish all over their course
the<00:01:22.680> computer<00:01:22.979> was<00:01:23.100> off<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:24.119> then<00:01:24.509> after<00:01:24.840> that

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
the computer was off and then after that

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.030 
the computer was off and then after that
same<00:01:26.310> type<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.520> thing<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:26.850> kept<00:01:28.040> replacing

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
same type of thing I just kept replacing

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.899 
same type of thing I just kept replacing
the<00:01:29.159> cotton<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:30.119> thing<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.630> going<00:01:31.320> in

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
the cotton on this thing and going in

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.929 
the cotton on this thing and going in
around<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.450> whole<00:01:33.630> area<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.280> here<00:01:35.280> cleaning

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
around the whole area in here cleaning

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.440 
around the whole area in here cleaning
it<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:38.689> then<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:40.049> got<00:01:40.380> my<00:01:40.680> trusty<00:01:41.220> skill<00:01:42.000> drill

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
it up then I got my trusty skill drill

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.870 
it up then I got my trusty skill drill
and<00:01:43.610> spun<00:01:44.610> some<00:01:44.790> cotton<00:01:45.180> onto<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.460> I<00:01:47.460> did

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
and spun some cotton onto it and I did

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.389 
and spun some cotton onto it and I did
this<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.090> number<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.540> times<00:01:48.750> as<00:01:48.930> well<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.409> I

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
this a number of times as well and I

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.240 
this a number of times as well and I
basically<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.119> spun<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.720> up<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.110> went<00:01:53.009> all

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
basically just spun it up and went all

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.179 
basically just spun it up and went all
around<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.759> MagSafe<00:01:53.970> connector<00:01:54.920> quite<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> few

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
around the MagSafe connector quite a few

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.429 
around the MagSafe connector quite a few
times<00:01:56.369> like<00:01:56.640> over<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.210> over<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.450> over<00:01:57.659> I

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
times like over and over and over I

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.160 
times like over and over and over I
might<00:01:59.040> have<00:01:59.159> done<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.460> ten<00:02:00.270> times<00:02:00.479> taking<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
might have done it ten times taking the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.630 
might have done it ten times taking the
old<00:02:01.290> cotton<00:02:01.680> off<00:02:01.770> putting<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.159> fresh<00:02:02.369> cotton

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
old cotton off putting on fresh cotton

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.730 
old cotton off putting on fresh cotton
each<00:02:03.360> time<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.750> was<00:02:03.930> doing<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.350> was<00:02:04.439> coming

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
each time I was doing and it was coming

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.069 
each time I was doing and it was coming
out<00:02:04.829> blacker<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.630> finally<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.719> started<00:02:06.990> to

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
out blacker and finally it started to

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.720 
out blacker and finally it started to
get<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.229> little<00:02:07.350> bit<00:02:07.530> cleaner

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.180 

and<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.690> fact<00:02:12.870> right<00:02:13.050> now<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.410> can<00:02:13.709> even<00:02:13.830> see

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
and in fact right now you can even see

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.640 
and in fact right now you can even see
that<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:14.580> even<00:02:15.480> still<00:02:15.720> picking<00:02:16.080> up<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.319> little

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
that it's even still picking up a little

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.920 
that it's even still picking up a little
bit<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.040> tarnish<00:02:17.370> off<00:02:17.610> some<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.569> corners

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
bit of tarnish off some of the corners

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.839 
bit of tarnish off some of the corners
and<00:02:18.959> stuff<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:19.709> did<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:20.010> quite<00:02:20.489> a<00:02:20.519> few<00:02:20.670> times

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
and stuff so did that quite a few times

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.690 
and stuff so did that quite a few times
and<00:02:21.150> lo<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.110> behold<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.590> works<00:02:23.040> just<00:02:23.459> like<00:02:23.580> a

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
and lo and behold it works just like a

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.930 
and lo and behold it works just like a
hot<00:02:23.879> damn<00:02:24.090> now<00:02:27.410> so<00:02:28.410> if<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.800> plug<00:02:29.130> in<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.340> new

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
hot damn now so if I plug in the new

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.339 
hot damn now so if I plug in the new
MagSafe<00:02:30.480> adapter<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:32.880> works<00:02:33.180> quite<00:02:33.480> well<00:02:33.569> just

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
MagSafe adapter it works quite well just

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.710 
MagSafe adapter it works quite well just
turns<00:02:34.800> green<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:35.400> in<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:35.910> few<00:02:36.090> seconds<00:02:36.480> it'll

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.830 
but turns out it wasn't it was those
dirty<00:02:59.400> pins<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.819> are<00:02:59.880> in<00:03:00.030> there<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:00.390> hope

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
dirty pins that are in there so hope

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.210 
dirty pins that are in there so hope
that<00:03:00.930> helps<00:03:01.319> anybody<00:03:01.530> who's<00:03:01.769> trying<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.069> get
