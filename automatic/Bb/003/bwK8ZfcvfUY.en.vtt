periscope<00:00:31.050> which<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.830> why<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:33.180> portrait

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
periscope which is why it is in portrait

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.959 
periscope which is why it is in portrait
mode<00:00:33.870> instead<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.710> landscape<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.760> if<00:00:35.850> you're

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
mode instead of landscape so if you're

portrait<00:00:38.129> instead<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.430> landscape<00:00:38.910> it's

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
portrait instead of landscape it's

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.080 
portrait instead of landscape it's
because<00:00:39.960> periscope<00:00:40.739> right<00:00:40.920> now<00:00:41.160> doesn't

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
because periscope right now doesn't

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.299

so<00:04:53.060> we're<00:04:53.660> still<00:04:53.870> inside<00:04:54.230> the<00:04:54.440> store<00:04:54.740> because

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
so we're still inside the store because

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.730 
so we're still inside the store because
we<00:04:55.460> had<00:04:55.640> store<00:04:55.910> access<00:04:56.150> but<00:04:57.080> I<00:04:57.110> think<00:04:57.440> it<00:04:57.590> might

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
we had store access but I think it might

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.880 
we had store access but I think it might
make<00:04:57.890> more<00:04:58.130> sense<00:04:58.400> to<00:04:59.050> to<00:05:00.050> go<00:05:00.230> out<00:05:00.260> onto<00:05:00.740> the

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
make more sense to to go out onto the
