word 66 the maps are huge but other than

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.950 
word 66 the maps are huge but other than
that<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.090> game<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.360> actually<00:01:21.479> pretty<00:01:21.750> good

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
that the game is actually pretty good

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.660 
that the game is actually pretty good
compared<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> lot<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.040> other<00:01:23.250> games<00:01:23.400> it's

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
compared to a lot of other games it's

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.399 
compared to a lot of other games it's
just<00:01:23.790> like<00:01:23.880> black<00:01:24.270> ops<00:01:24.450> 2<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> very<00:01:24.960> bad<00:01:25.140> game

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
just like black ops 2 is a very bad game

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.590 
just like black ops 2 is a very bad game
but<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.610> lot<00:01:26.729> more<00:01:26.790> exciting<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.450> more

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
but it's a lot more exciting it's more

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.120 
but it's a lot more exciting it's more
fun<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:27.960> more<00:01:28.110> call<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.500> duty<00:01:28.740> arcade

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
fun it's more call of duty arcade

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.830 
fun it's more call of duty arcade
running<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:29.880> style<00:01:30.180> that's<00:01:30.450> what<00:01:30.570> call<00:01:30.689> duty

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
running on style that's what call duty

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.780 
running on style that's what call duty
is<00:01:30.960> known<00:01:31.079> for<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.770> game<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.189> changing<00:01:32.400> too

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
is known for this game is changing too

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.609 
is known for this game is changing too
much<00:01:32.970> trying<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.659> be<00:01:33.810> more<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.170> battlefield

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
much trying to be more like battlefield

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.710 
much trying to be more like battlefield
and<00:01:34.860> kind<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.400> copying<00:01:35.759> some<00:01:35.939> other<00:01:36.060> aspects

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
and kind of copying some other aspects

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.030 
and kind of copying some other aspects
of<00:01:36.840> first-person<00:01:37.380> shooters<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.799> they

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
of first-person shooters that they

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.679 
of first-person shooters that they
haven't<00:01:38.310> done<00:01:38.340> before<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.880> they're<00:01:39.329> doing<00:01:39.570> up

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
haven't done before and they're doing up

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.359 
haven't done before and they're doing up
while<00:01:39.960> also<00:01:40.170> making<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.680> maps<00:01:40.829> bigger<00:01:41.100> and

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
while also making the maps bigger and

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.310 
while also making the maps bigger and
changing<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.180> little<00:01:42.270> bit<00:01:42.390> too<00:01:42.600> much<00:01:42.750> that's

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
changing a little bit too much that's

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.389 
changing a little bit too much that's
why<00:01:43.500> i<00:01:43.530> think<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.890> people<00:01:44.070> aren't<00:01:44.280> enjoying

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
why i think that people aren't enjoying

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.770 
why i think that people aren't enjoying
this<00:01:44.670> game<00:01:44.820> too<00:01:44.939> much<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.270> not<00:01:45.420> it's<00:01:45.600> not<00:01:45.689> a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
this game too much it's not it's not a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.569 
this game too much it's not it's not a
bad<00:01:45.960> game<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.320> really<00:01:46.350> isn't<00:01:46.799> something<00:01:47.369> could

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
bad game it really isn't something could

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.039 
bad game it really isn't something could
be<00:01:47.610> changed<00:01:47.970> if<00:01:48.090> they<00:01:48.420> really<00:01:48.689> just<00:01:48.720> changed

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
be changed if they really just changed

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.870 
be changed if they really just changed
something<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.590> little<00:01:49.920> bit<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.579> game<00:01:50.759> could

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
something a little bit this game could

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.760 
something a little bit this game could
be<00:01:51.000> much<00:01:51.149> better<00:01:51.299> as<00:01:51.600> an<00:01:52.350> example<00:01:52.619> they

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
be much better as an example they

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.319 
be much better as an example they
actually<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.220> been<00:01:53.340> listening<00:01:53.729> they<00:01:54.060> added

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
actually have been listening they added

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.670 
actually have been listening they added
heavy<00:01:54.479> duty<00:01:54.840> because<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.200> health<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.500> way<00:01:55.619> too

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
heavy duty because the health is way too

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.920 
heavy duty because the health is way too
low<00:01:55.770> they<00:01:56.700> added<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.030> but<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.719> wii<00:01:57.810> u

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
low they added that but on the wii u

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.060 
low they added that but on the wii u
they<00:01:58.049> didn't<00:01:58.259> add<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:58.860> mean<00:01:59.040> I

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
they didn't add that so that I mean I

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.170 
they didn't add that so that I mean I
can't<00:01:59.280> really<00:01:59.369> talk<00:01:59.520> about<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.880> too<00:02:00.030> much

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
can't really talk about that too much

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.270 
can't really talk about that too much
but<00:02:00.390> they<00:02:00.479> are<00:02:00.630> listening<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.860> think<00:02:02.100> we

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
but they are listening so I think we

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.109 
but they are listening so I think we
just<00:02:02.310> need<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.579> give<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.759> game<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.939> little

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
just need to give this game a little

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.330 
just need to give this game a little
more<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> chance<00:02:03.630> myself<00:02:04.590> I'm<00:02:04.770> not<00:02:04.890> enjoying

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
more of a chance myself I'm not enjoying

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.859 
more of a chance myself I'm not enjoying
it<00:02:05.490> too<00:02:05.579> much<00:02:05.759> i<00:02:05.969> enjoy<00:02:06.180> black<00:02:06.420> ops<00:02:06.570> 2<00:02:06.689> more

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
it too much i enjoy black ops 2 more

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:07.969 
it too much i enjoy black ops 2 more
even<00:02:07.170> though<00:02:07.229> i<00:02:07.259> know<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.799> worst

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
even though i know that it's a worst

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.580 
even though i know that it's a worst
game<00:02:08.160> but<00:02:09.090> people<00:02:09.629> are<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:10.110> they're<00:02:10.349> giving

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
game but people are just they're giving

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.580 
game but people are just they're giving
up<00:02:10.679> quickly<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.430> can<00:02:12.060> understand<00:02:12.450> that

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
up quickly I can understand that

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.110 
up quickly I can understand that
I'm<00:02:13.650> wondering<00:02:14.069> if<00:02:14.160> DLC<00:02:14.580> can<00:02:14.760> really<00:02:14.940> save

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
I'm wondering if DLC can really save

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.970 
I'm wondering if DLC can really save
ghosts<00:02:15.450> if<00:02:15.569> they<00:02:15.690> add<00:02:15.840> DLC<00:02:16.290> with<00:02:16.440> smaller<00:02:16.709> maps

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
ghosts if they add DLC with smaller maps

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.770 
ghosts if they add DLC with smaller maps
they<00:02:17.940> add<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.120> with<00:02:18.180> different<00:02:18.480> game<00:02:18.750> modes

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
they add it with different game modes

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.140 
they add it with different game modes
with<00:02:19.500> maybe<00:02:19.950> more<00:02:20.190> guns<00:02:20.400> like<00:02:20.640> then<00:02:20.790> black<00:02:21.000> ops

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
with maybe more guns like then black ops

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.699 
with maybe more guns like then black ops
who<00:02:21.269> they<00:02:21.360> had<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.599> Peacekeeper<00:02:22.110> if<00:02:22.440> they

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
who they had the Peacekeeper if they

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.900 
who they had the Peacekeeper if they
added<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.950> different<00:02:23.250> gun<00:02:23.370> maybe<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:23.700> could

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
added a different gun maybe I could

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.130 
added a different gun maybe I could
spice<00:02:24.150> things<00:02:24.180> up<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.690> think<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:24.989> really

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
spice things up I think that really

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.949 
spice things up I think that really
adding<00:02:25.500> different<00:02:25.680> maps<00:02:26.010> would<00:02:26.580> be<00:02:26.730> better<00:02:26.959> on

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
adding different maps would be better on

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.690 
adding different maps would be better on
the<00:02:28.170> wii<00:02:28.260> for<00:02:28.500> example<00:02:28.830> they<00:02:28.890> never<00:02:29.069> had<00:02:29.280> dlc

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
the wii for example they never had dlc

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.160 
the wii for example they never had dlc
on<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:29.970> way<00:02:30.090> they<00:02:30.269> never<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.510> dlc<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:30.989> i'm<00:02:31.080> not

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
on the way they never a dlc so i'm not

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.080 
on the way they never a dlc so i'm not
really<00:02:31.230> looking<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.160> play<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.549> i<00:02:32.580> have<00:02:32.819> a<00:02:32.849> i

playstation<00:02:39.180> 4<00:02:39.690> in<00:02:39.750> ps3<00:02:40.310> dlc<00:02:41.310> could<00:02:41.489> be<00:02:41.640> it

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
playstation 4 in ps3 dlc could be it

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.670 
playstation 4 in ps3 dlc could be it
could<00:02:41.940> be<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.239> game<00:02:42.420> changer<00:02:42.450> i<00:02:42.780> think<00:02:43.049> that<00:02:43.200> if

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
could be a game changer i think that if

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.470 
could be a game changer i think that if
people<00:02:43.860> try<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.250> out<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.610> they<00:02:44.670> really<00:02:44.940> this

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
people try it out and they really this

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.569 
people try it out and they really this
is<00:02:45.660> this<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.410> what<00:02:46.500> they<00:02:46.590> need<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.769> do<00:02:46.980> because

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
is this is what they need to do because

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:48.740 
is this is what they need to do because
right<00:02:47.700> now<00:02:47.760> they're<00:02:48.000> losing<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.420> lot<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.569> their

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.089 
right now they're losing a lot of their
players<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.230> it's<00:02:49.319> obvious<00:02:49.440> people<00:02:49.890> are

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
players and it's obvious people are

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.440 
players and it's obvious people are
already<00:02:50.280> switching<00:02:50.760> over<00:02:50.819> to<00:02:50.940> people<00:02:51.360> are

already switching over to people are
giving<00:02:51.569> up<00:02:51.810> i<00:02:51.989> don't<00:02:52.709> see<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.099> if<00:02:53.310> they

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
giving up i don't see that if they

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.770 
giving up i don't see that if they
continue<00:02:53.819> like<00:02:53.970> this<00:02:54.000> i<00:02:54.299> see<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.569> call<00:02:54.690> of

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
duty franchise dying out in two years

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.030 
duty franchise dying out in two years
because<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.900> yearly<00:02:58.620> games<00:02:58.739> are<00:02:58.950> really

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
because the yearly games are really

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.319 
because the yearly games are really

we've seen from titanfall already larder

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.770 
we've seen from titanfall already larder
much<00:03:08.400> higher<00:03:08.670> level<00:03:08.700> than<00:03:09.030> call<00:03:09.360> of<00:03:09.390> duty<00:03:09.660> is

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
much higher level than call of duty is

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.930 
much higher level than call of duty is
and<00:03:10.019> it's<00:03:10.709> not<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.920> next-gen<00:03:11.340> game<00:03:11.519> this<00:03:11.760> game

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
and it's not a next-gen game this game

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.250 
and it's not a next-gen game this game
you<00:03:12.209> look<00:03:12.329> at<00:03:12.450> this<00:03:12.540> game<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:13.019> don't<00:03:13.200> think

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
you look at this game you don't think

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.750 
you look at this game you don't think
next-gen<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:14.010> doesn't<00:03:14.280> have<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:14.400> feeling

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
next-gen it doesn't have that feeling

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.670 
next-gen it doesn't have that feeling
yet<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.209> it's<00:03:16.019> something<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.379> they<00:03:16.530> really

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
yet and it's something that they really

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.960 
yet and it's something that they really
needed<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.069> accomplish<00:03:17.340> they<00:03:17.549> had<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.760> chance

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
needed to accomplish they had the chance

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.430 
needed to accomplish they had the chance
to<00:03:18.150> do<00:03:18.269> they<00:03:18.389> had<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.630> chance<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.109> save<00:03:19.319> this

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
to do they had the chance to save this

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.259 
to do they had the chance to save this
franchise<00:03:19.889> and<00:03:20.100> they<00:03:20.519> weren't<00:03:20.700> able<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:21.030> push

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
franchise and they weren't able to push

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.699 
franchise and they weren't able to push
it<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.630> they<00:03:21.900> weren't<00:03:22.019> able<00:03:22.139> to<00:03:22.260> do<00:03:22.410> that<00:03:22.530> so<00:03:22.680> I

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
it and they weren't able to do that so I

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.309 
it and they weren't able to do that so I
think<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:23.190> dlc<00:03:23.609> is<00:03:23.819> they<00:03:24.389> need<00:03:24.569> to<00:03:25.049> really

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
think the dlc is they need to really

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.690 
think the dlc is they need to really
they<00:03:25.500> don't<00:03:25.530> need<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:25.859> have<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.069> half-assed<00:03:26.519> do

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
they don't need to have a half-assed do

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.400 
they don't need to have a half-assed do
