everything<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:24.490> then<00:02:25.490> I<00:02:25.820> also<00:02:25.940> got<00:02:26.540> this<00:02:26.870> one

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
everything and then I also got this one

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.680 
everything and then I also got this one
which<00:02:27.800> is<00:02:28.010> like<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.520> think<00:02:28.970> this'll<00:02:29.270> ends<00:02:29.540> my

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
which is like I think this'll ends my

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.140 
which is like I think this'll ends my
favorite<00:02:30.110> of<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.350> two<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:31.130> sheet<00:02:31.670> her<00:02:31.940> head's

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
favorite of the two and sheet her head's

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.510 
favorite of the two and sheet her head's
just<00:02:32.390> like<00:02:32.570> super<00:02:32.930> sparkly<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:34.100> I<00:02:34.190> think<00:02:34.430> this

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
just like super sparkly and I think this

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.760 
just like super sparkly and I think this
one<00:02:34.700> retail<00:02:35.030> for<00:02:35.270> 1299<00:02:35.750> too<00:02:36.110> but<00:02:36.350> this<00:02:36.500> one<00:02:36.710> I

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
one retail for 1299 too but this one I

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.580 
one retail for 1299 too but this one I
paid<00:02:36.920> for<00:02:36.980> 99<00:02:37.640> for<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.330> I<00:02:38.810> actually<00:02:39.020> might<00:02:39.380> use

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
paid for 99 for and I actually might use

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.490 
paid for 99 for and I actually might use
this<00:02:39.770> as<00:02:40.010> like<00:02:40.160> a<00:02:40.540> travel<00:02:41.540> makeup<00:02:41.780> bag<00:02:42.170> even

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
this as like a travel makeup bag even

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.830 
this as like a travel makeup bag even
though<00:02:42.650> it's<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:42.950> lunch<00:02:43.190> bag<00:02:43.400> because<00:02:43.790> it's<00:02:44.690> a

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
though it's a lunch bag because it's a

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.770 
though it's a lunch bag because it's a
good<00:02:45.080> shape<00:02:45.800> and<00:02:46.130> size<00:02:46.460> for<00:02:47.000> traveling<00:02:47.600> and

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
good shape and size for traveling and

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.080 
good shape and size for traveling and
also<00:02:48.410> I<00:02:48.560> think<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:48.950> makes<00:02:49.100> sense<00:02:49.400> that<00:02:49.610> you

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
also I think it makes sense that you

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.940 
also I think it makes sense that you
should<00:02:50.780> have<00:02:50.990> your<00:02:51.140> makeup<00:02:51.440> in<00:02:51.590> something

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
should have your makeup in something

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.890 
should have your makeup in something
that's<00:02:52.130> temperature<00:02:52.820> control<00:02:53.360> because<00:02:53.750> I've

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
that's temperature control because I've

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.450 
that's temperature control because I've
definitely<00:02:54.080> had<00:02:54.500> makeup<00:02:54.800> melt<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.370> know

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
definitely had makeup melt and I know

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.640 
definitely had makeup melt and I know
it's<00:02:55.670> not<00:02:55.790> good<00:02:56.030> for<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.330> so<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:56.930> think<00:02:57.260> this<00:02:57.380> is

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
it's not good for it so I think this is

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.260 
it's not good for it so I think this is
actually<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:58.100> really<00:02:58.250> good<00:02:58.370> idea<00:02:58.520> to<00:02:58.910> put<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.180> in

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
actually a really good idea to put it in

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.850 
actually a really good idea to put it in
a<00:02:59.390> lunch<00:02:59.630> box<00:02:59.690> so<00:03:00.110> I<00:03:00.140> think<00:03:00.260> that's<00:03:00.500> what<00:03:00.770> I'm

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
a lunch box so I think that's what I'm

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.510 
a lunch box so I think that's what I'm
going<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.070> do<00:03:03.070> then<00:03:04.070> i<00:03:04.100> also<00:03:04.160> picked<00:03:04.700> up<00:03:05.380> some

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
going to do then i also picked up some

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.940 
going to do then i also picked up some

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
like this silver I think that it it's

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.790 
like this silver I think that it it's
supposed<00:05:13.010> to<00:05:13.720> look<00:05:14.720> more<00:05:14.960> antique<00:05:15.500> because

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
supposed to look more antique because

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.500 
supposed to look more antique because
the<00:05:16.010> shape<00:05:16.250> that<00:05:16.280> I<00:05:16.550> don't<00:05:16.730> think<00:05:16.970> the<00:05:17.120> silver

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
the shape that I don't think the silver

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.380 
the shape that I don't think the silver
is<00:05:17.540> a<00:05:17.630> good<00:05:17.870> color<00:05:18.110> for<00:05:18.230> it<00:05:18.560> um<00:05:18.740> so<00:05:19.490> what<00:05:20.060> I<00:05:20.090> want
