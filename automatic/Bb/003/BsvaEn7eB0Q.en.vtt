 Japan, the concept rather than the flower decoration is the main let a lot of unconditional

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:10.840
 I can seem to share enough friendly conversations. 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:16.579
 Oh, it 's been so much fun today . 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:22.070

 How much would it cost to have a virtual wedding? 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:40.030
 300 million of the bride and groom dressed

 But it does not adapt.
