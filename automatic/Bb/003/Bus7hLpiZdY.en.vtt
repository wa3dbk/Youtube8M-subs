 invited to try these for free 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.620
 remarkable vehicles 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.500
 today we will see in action the fiat idea 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.690
 adventure locker a little shorter than 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.480

 differential electronics 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:14.149
 It has a direction and a cushion 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.250
 of excellent characteristics as 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.920
 warns when raffling all these dice 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.869
 one of its main characteristics 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.060
 It is his off the ground so it 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.429
 It benefits a lot to not be hung 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.130
 in huellones both snow and 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.750
 mud taking advantage of these beautiful images 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.300

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.980
 watching him maneuver in the circuit 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.569
 our driver that if he tried it we 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.090
 account that one of its greatest virtues 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.760
 It's your takeoff from the ground and its amazing

 cushioning qualities that grant 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.400
 to the fiat idea adventure locker a

 never skidding that feature it 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.040
 it owes much to its traction 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.040
 lead 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.910
 good henry now it's the turn of fiade 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.440
 idea adventure locker is let's 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.940
 take advantage of the short wheelbase 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.790
 that has the vehicle to show a 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.620
 little the clearance and height or using 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.280
 the issue of blocking control 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.340
 differential 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.410
 now with the participation of veto let's 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.260
 to climb this hill and we will show a 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.820
 little grip and grip that loosens 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.460
 and distributes us the blockade of 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.650
 differentiate 50% on each wheel both 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.990
 on the left wheel as the right 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.230
 they are in continuous movement and that is going 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.800
 to purify a greater henri grip 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.800
 full step 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.170
 this is the moment where the block acts 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:44.450
 difference of war and you will see 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.430
 and when the vehicle loses power in 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.970
 the right wheel and pass it to the wheel 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.030
 left with differential lock 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.580
 and the fiat idea adventure locker us 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.040
 demonstrated in this difficult circuit that is 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.660
 a great vehicle with a very good walk 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.520
 wide inside 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.520
 ideal to enjoy with the family 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.050
 we're back with the second block of the
