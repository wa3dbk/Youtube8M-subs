in short it is big and loud but it is

very action-packed yeah a lot of action

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.939 
very action-packed yeah a lot of action
you<00:01:00.329> know<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.660> kind<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> first<00:01:01.530> half

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
you know I like kind of the first half

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:02.990 
you know I like kind of the first half
of<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.129> movie<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.609> thought<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
of the movie and that I thought the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.119 
of the movie and that I thought the
ending<00:01:03.210> went<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.480> too<00:01:03.660> long<00:01:03.890> but<00:01:04.890> there<00:01:05.040> are

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
ending went on too long but there are

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.420 
ending went on too long but there are
some<00:01:05.250> nice<00:01:05.430> bits<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.880> beginning<00:01:06.270> so

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
some nice bits in the beginning so

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.560 
some nice bits in the beginning so
probably<00:01:08.430> better<00:01:08.729> than<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.000> second<00:01:09.330> one<00:01:09.420> if

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
probably better than the second one if

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.170 
probably better than the second one if
but<00:01:10.350> maybe<00:01:10.650> not<00:01:10.799> as<00:01:10.920> good<00:01:11.070> as<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> person<00:01:11.460> coolin

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
but maybe not as good as a person coolin

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.250 
but maybe not as good as a person coolin
