I am going to bronze the face a little

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.190 
I am going to bronze the face a little
bit<00:05:04.900> and<00:05:05.350> I'm<00:05:05.860> just<00:05:05.890> using<00:05:06.250> this<00:05:06.580> yal<00:05:07.480> bronzer

and<00:05:08.410> it<00:05:08.800> just<00:05:08.980> really<00:05:09.340> adds<00:05:09.580> the<00:05:09.910> natural

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
and it just really adds the natural

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.480 
and it just really adds the natural
shadows<00:05:10.840> back<00:05:11.170> to<00:05:11.350> the<00:05:11.470> face<00:05:11.710> and<00:05:11.920> it<00:05:12.340> just

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
adds a little bit of extra color in case

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.500 
adds a little bit of extra color in case
you<00:05:14.890> lost<00:05:15.130> it<00:05:15.400> with<00:05:15.520> your<00:05:15.670> foundation<00:05:15.850> and

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
you lost it with your foundation and

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.900 
you lost it with your foundation and
highlighter<00:05:16.990> so<00:05:17.470> I<00:05:17.500> love<00:05:17.830> doing<00:05:18.190> this<00:05:18.370> just<00:05:18.820> to

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
highlighter so I love doing this just to

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.850 
highlighter so I love doing this just to
bring<00:05:19.150> a<00:05:19.270> little<00:05:19.420> bit<00:05:19.630> of<00:05:19.690> color<00:05:20.080> back<00:05:20.350> but<00:05:20.830> I

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
bring a little bit of color back but I

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.280 
bring a little bit of color back but I
am<00:05:21.130> going<00:05:21.460> to<00:05:21.580> contour<00:05:22.060> my<00:05:22.210> nose<00:05:22.240> and<00:05:22.870> I'm<00:05:23.050> just

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
am going to contour my nose and I'm just

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.680 
am going to contour my nose and I'm just
using<00:05:23.500> a<00:05:23.860> darker<00:05:24.370> concealer<00:05:24.580> to<00:05:25.210> do<00:05:25.390> so

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
using a darker concealer to do so

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.200 
using a darker concealer to do so
because<00:05:26.110> contouring<00:05:26.800> the<00:05:26.920> nose<00:05:26.950> is<00:05:27.460> a<00:05:27.760> must

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
because contouring the nose is a must

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.660 
because contouring the nose is a must
for<00:05:28.510> me<00:05:28.570> and<00:05:29.080> once<00:05:29.500> I<00:05:29.620> do<00:05:29.680> that<00:05:29.860> I<00:05:30.220> like<00:05:30.400> to<00:05:30.430> go
