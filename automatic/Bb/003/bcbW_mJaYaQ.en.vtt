00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 the uncomfortable if I tell you already went to record 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.150
 the repeated issues and despite trying 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.809
 wrong to write at the time and 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.809
 it took a lot 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.119
 this is a very clear example 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.369
 super classic when you're talking 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.920
 more than someone is behind tyc another 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.840
 classic moment of discomfort is how 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.390
 you're with a party at the meeting very 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.650
 enjoy with your boyfriend and once he enters 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.449
 your ex 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.160
 you have to present it but you have to 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:49.600
 know how to take nadal or people 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.989
 Just look, I'll introduce you to Barbara my 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.989
 ex girlfriend 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.400
 well that was a super uncomfortable moment 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.050
 well as I tell you and I did not know 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.660
 even where to stop you have to decide 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.239
 how to greet the beard of the other 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.040
 tremendous another super uncomfortable moment that 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.360
 I think it has happened to all of us 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.360
 you fall in public 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.070
 Yes Yes Yes yes Yes 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.960
 ah 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:25.210
 another super uncomfortable thing is when you're 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.969
 talking to someone and you get the 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:33.159
 You drool and spit on you and there's here or 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:34.539
 here is this one that was in the store and 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.069
 I remembered you because there were two 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.450
 igualitos chavos to you who were 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:41.140
 playing also that is raining 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.569
 although I did not tell them, a disc came out 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.289
 well good of such an axel muÃ±iz that is 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:46.289
 very sings very well 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:55.060
 and tell me how you have been not 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.450
 I know if I tell him how to tell him that you're 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.939
 seeing that a deluge of his 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.030
 mouth another very typical case that comes 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.709
 related is bad breath there are people 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.720
 to which the metal and smells really bad 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.640
 mouth either because if they ate tacos with 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.959
 a lot of onion or because simply 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.959
 they do not wash their teeth 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.140
 and what do you do here to the person who 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.580
 even more mouth 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.700
 it smells bad but it seems that it is 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.060
 doing so 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.060
 I said 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.470
 he said yes but before he told me that 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.320
 I told 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.850
 and then it's so much the smell that comes out 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.700
 his mouth that seems to be made to you 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.250
 purpose but good leaving things 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.080
 disgusting from one side other very moment 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.390
 uncomfortable is when you're talking about 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.240
 something serious with someone and the soul goes 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.060
 it makes you laugh but it is badly accessible 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.360
 another day I saw you with someone 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:59.670
 what is being unfaithful yes you laugh 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.660
 I do not do anything funny to him 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.660
 and here we leave it
