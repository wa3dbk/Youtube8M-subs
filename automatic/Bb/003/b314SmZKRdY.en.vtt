00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.250
Wow.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.880
I almost forgot to do a video on optimising
this map until I loaded up an early version

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.319
of it filled with barrels everywhere.

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.800
Since optimisation is totally like, the most
fun thing you can spend your time watching

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.360
on YouTube, I've decided to do two parts on
the topic.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.760
This one focuses on optimising the map the
proper way, and the second will be more interesting

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.910
and will show me battling against all sorts
of problems that arose because of THIS view

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.359
and from me being stubborn.

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.890
Oh and I've just watched the Hobbit.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.960
Before adding detail, I spent a fair bit of
time optimising the map.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.290
In the past I've preferred a more open map
design because A) computers are capable of

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.570
handling the Source engine pretty well in
this day and age, B)

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.920
optimisation throws up all sorts of problems,
as well as limiting how you can detail your

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.350
level and C) Grenades can no longer be chucked
across the whole level because they SHALL

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.480
NOT PASS the skybox and you can't take screenshots
of the map from interesting, high-up or far-off

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.020
angles.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.149
Optimisation is one of those things that I've
heard so many horror stories about, and have

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.219
had so many difficulties with in the past
(with both my maps and maps that I've tried

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.650
to fix) that I have built up a sixth sense
knowing when problems will arise and advise

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.020
people to use an open skybox unless I feel
they're skilled and patient enough to benefit

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.880
from the enclosed method.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.009
If that sounds mean, see how you feel after
these two videos.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.590
Despite all this, I settled on an enclosed,
super-optimised method for this map, both

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.369
for the challenge and for the fps benefits
it would give me.

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.830
It would also help me to walk away from the
project, knowing that I had learned a thing

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.619
or two from having tried something different.

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.799
To check my optimisation I did the BARREL
CHALLENGE.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.240
By placing barrels all over my level, then
by turning on wireframe, I can see which barrels

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.509
are being rendered.

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.130
This simulate items within the level and is
a good indicator of where further optimisation

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.130
is needed.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.210
I compiled my map at this stage twice, once
with VIS set to FAST and once with NORMAL.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.720
VIS calculates what can be seen and where
from within a split second, but does a terrible

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.870
job.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.079
NORMAL takes much, much longer but delivers
a better result.

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.410
I wasn't happy with either, so added hints
and areaportals all over my map, which suggest

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.049
to the computer good places to optimise from.

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.179
I also normalised the heights of the walls
for the next stage.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.510
It is very hard to get around optimisation
without trying it yourself.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.510
And I mean that.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.620
All I can do is to give you examples and demonstrations
of the differences, but without you trying

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.599
yourself, you won't know what is causing them.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.069
Anyway, these hint blocks are a nightmare
to work with- they get in the way of you selecting

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.380
things and also slow down Hammer greatly,
which is somewhat ironic, so I ended up grouping

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.680
them together and saving them to another file.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.010
At the end when I'm to compile my map for
the last time I'll paste it back into my map

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.570
and line them up again.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.660
In short, at this stage I'm optimising my
map, then forgetting about it until the end

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.690
when I'm to compile a version that people
will ultimately end up seeing.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.470
So why not wait until the end to do this optimisation?

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.239
Well, before there's detail to your map you
can more easily change things.

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.810
In some areas I lowered the ceilings and adjusted
doorways to improve the optimisation.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.290
Also, by adding hints all over the map, it
helps familiarise you with the optimisation

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.070
for your own map, so you don't do something
stupid later on when detailing it.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.470
For instance, this wall is important for hiding
all of the detail in the bombsite behind.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.360
If I was to replace it with an open window,
it would render the entire bombsite right

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.690
up to CT spawn, something I don't want to
have happening, since there is already a fair

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.160
bit visible from CT spawn, giving counter
terrorists a low framerate when they really

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.349
don't want or need it.

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.200
The next stage was to make the map a series
of rooms with sky textures on the ceiling,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.819
instead of a large open area.

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.500
I didn't close the skybox up until later on.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.080
While things are still changing and moving
about, I don't see the point in wasting time

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.430
adding skyboxes around each part of your map,
only to have to remake them every time it

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.430
changes.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.400
This is one of the reasons that I recommend
just making a hollow box around your level.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.440
It's not too hard to close it up provided
you make the map tidily and place solid blocks

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.959
under your displacements.

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.340
I used a large open skybox in this level then
waited until I had added the tower, large

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.799
brushes and buildings around my map, before
closing the map up and focusing on the smaller

00:03:58.799 --> 00:03:59.799
things.

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.610
You could say that I should have waited for
this stage before adding the hints and stuff

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.530
in, but the layout of my map didn't change
after I added those- only the vertical height

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.040
of some of the things, and the items that
were above wall-height within the level any

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.040
way.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.269
Closing the skybox up reduces the time VIS
takes to compile on normal.

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.940
Despite all this, when testing my map for
graphical purposes I would still just set

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.940
it to FAST.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.090
It would save about 3 minutes every time I
compiled- doesn't sound like much, but over

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.660
the course of days and weeks it would save
hours.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.120
Imagine what you could do with an extra couple
of hours before a deadline.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.490
And that concludes part 1.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.410
Sounds simple, doesn't it?
