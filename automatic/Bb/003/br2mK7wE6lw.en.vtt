00:00:48.334 --> 00:00:51.982
 I am already a fan of my twelfth. 

00:00:52.672 --> 00:00:56.558
 I have had pigeons for over 30 years now. 

00:00:57.771 --> 00:00:59.438
 I'm Marcel Sangers. 

00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:02.947
 We are now on the Oude IJsselbrug in Zutphen 

00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:05.715
 and there is a beautiful story attached to this bridge. 

00:01:08.226 --> 00:01:11.922
 When I was young, my first two pigeons came from here. 

00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:14.985
 If you look at the orange part of the bridge 

00:01:15.372 --> 00:01:16.464
 then you can see openings. 

00:01:16.854 --> 00:01:19.409
 Pigeons made their nest therein. 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:24.523
 Some older friends regularly looked in those openings 

00:01:24.742 --> 00:01:26.620
 to see if there were young pigeons or eggs. 

00:01:27.177 --> 00:01:30.857
 If there were young, they waited until they were 23 days old. 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.011
 They then climbed the bridge and took those young pigeons with them. 

00:01:34.717 --> 00:01:38.036
 Those young pigeons were my first two pigeons ever. 

00:01:38.427 --> 00:01:39.875
 They were two colorful pigeons. 

00:01:47.978 --> 00:01:49.944
 When I was eleven years old 

00:01:50.155 --> 00:01:53.376
 I lived on the first floor with my mother, brother and sister. 

00:01:53.857 --> 00:01:56.771
 I had two pigeons on the balcony there. 

00:01:57.237 --> 00:01:59.910
 I had placed three nest boxes on top of each other. 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.198
 There were a couple of pigeons in the top box. 

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:05.868
 It was there, on that balcony, that my passion started. 

00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:10.704
 For me it is always very special to be here ... 

00:02:13.295 --> 00:02:15.688
 Two or a half years later 

00:02:15.688 --> 00:02:19.004
 I started participating in flights for the first time. 

00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:25.074
 By working hard day and night for years 

00:02:25.074 --> 00:02:27.229
 Marcel could invest in pigeons 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:32.410
 from the very best enthusiast at that time: Bertie Camphuis. 

00:02:32.798 --> 00:02:38.494
 The old 'Super Breeder' from 1995 became a stock cock 

00:02:38.728 --> 00:02:40.725
 and in a few years time 

00:02:40.725 --> 00:02:44.340
 his pigeons brought him to the top, 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.180
 thanks to Marcel's dedication. 

00:02:47.276 --> 00:02:51.254
 After he won everything that could be won in the middle and middle distance 

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:55.452
 Marcel wanted to shine in the NPO one-day classics 

00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:59.162
 from 500 to 700 km. 

00:02:59.768 --> 00:03:03.349
 He purchased original Gerard Koopman pigeons. 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.165
 Especially the direct boy from 'Kleine Dirk' and 'Golden Lady' 

00:03:08.165 --> 00:03:11.331
 had a major influence on the Sangers pigeon of today. 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.687
 The results were amazing. 

00:03:13.918 --> 00:03:15.560
 Highlights such as 

00:03:15.774 --> 00:03:24.406
 1st NPO OrlÃ©ans 18,127 pigeons with six pigeons in the top 10 NPO 

00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:33.876
 and 1st NPO Bourges 10,767 pigeons with six pigeons in the top 10 

00:03:33.876 --> 00:03:35.793
 were just the beginning. 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.834
 In the following years, top results and NPO victories confirmed 

00:03:40.834 --> 00:03:46.787
 the status of Marcel Sangers as the number one in the fund 

00:03:46.787 --> 00:03:48.238
 in the Netherlands. 

00:03:48.631 --> 00:03:56.692
