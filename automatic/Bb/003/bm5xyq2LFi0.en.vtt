00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
course but why would you if you have

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.220 
course but why would you if you have
everything<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.340> need<00:00:26.519> right<00:00:26.550> here<00:00:27.140> now<00:00:28.140> the

procedure for washing the convertible
top<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.679> identical<00:00:32.340> whether<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.669> have<00:00:32.880> a

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
top is identical whether you have a

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.049 
top is identical whether you have a
fabric<00:00:33.570> top<00:00:34.320> which<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.620> what<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.370> or<00:00:35.610> you

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
fabric top which is what this is or you

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.209 
fabric top which is what this is or you
have<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> vinyl<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.290> only<00:00:37.590> difference<00:00:38.040> between

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
have a vinyl the only difference between

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.229 
have a vinyl the only difference between
those<00:00:38.670> two<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.500> very<00:00:40.890> last<00:00:41.219> step<00:00:41.670> so

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
those two is in the very last step so

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.979 
those two is in the very last step so
I'll<00:00:42.540> show<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.040> how<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.309> will<00:00:44.550> go<00:00:44.930> now<00:00:45.930> the

the surface off and get any obvious dirt
that<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.870> surface<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.859> have<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.190> use<00:00:59.399> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
that is on the surface you have to use a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.250 
that is on the surface you have to use a
soft<00:01:00.149> brush<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.840> I'll<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.980> using<00:01:02.420> a<00:01:03.420> couple<00:01:04.170> of

brushes for this the first thing is just

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.990 
brushes for this the first thing is just
to<00:01:07.020> make<00:01:07.590> sure<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.950> get<00:01:08.130> all<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.460> obvious

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
to make sure you get all the obvious

to make sure you get all the obvious
dirt<00:01:09.330> off<00:01:12.049> now<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.229> time<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.530> vacuum<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:15.540> top

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.960 

the<00:01:37.940> step<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.540> this<00:01:38.780> procedure<00:01:39.320> here<00:01:39.980> is<00:01:40.130> that

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
the step to this procedure here is that

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.500 
the step to this procedure here is that
you<00:01:41.270> first<00:01:41.630> want<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.230> apply<00:01:42.910> water<00:01:43.910> onto<00:01:44.360> the

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
for this and maybe they work fine but

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.600 
for this and maybe they work fine but
really<00:01:57.590> all<00:01:57.800> it<00:01:58.160> is<00:01:58.340> is<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:59.240> good<00:01:59.660> mild

is a power sprayer you can do this in
the<00:03:14.740> garden<00:03:15.160> hose<00:03:15.370> but<00:03:15.760> keep<00:03:16.390> away<00:03:16.720> from<00:03:16.750> a

high-pressure power

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.330 
high-pressure power
this<00:03:19.900> is<00:03:20.050> not<00:03:20.260> particularly<00:03:20.740> high<00:03:20.980> pressure

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
this is not particularly high pressure

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
in order for this to dry you can let it

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.390 
in order for this to dry you can let it
sit<00:03:47.030> out<00:03:47.510> overnight<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.349> it<00:03:48.859> will<00:03:48.889> do<00:03:49.159> a<00:03:49.189> good

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
sit out overnight and it will do a good

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.339 
sit out overnight and it will do a good
job<00:03:49.459> of<00:03:49.700> that<00:03:49.849> but<00:03:50.749> if<00:03:50.840> you<00:03:50.930> want<00:03:51.019> to<00:03:51.139> dry<00:03:51.319> it

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
job of that but if you want to dry it

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:52.800 
job of that but if you want to dry it
right<00:03:51.590> now<00:03:51.769> you<00:03:51.829> take<00:03:52.129> a<00:03:52.159> lint-free

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
right now you take a lint-free

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.429 
right now you take a lint-free
microfiber<00:03:53.810> cloth<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:55.329> you<00:03:56.329> place<00:03:56.749> it<00:03:56.780> on<00:03:57.109> to

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 
microfiber cloth and you place it on to

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:02.259 
microfiber cloth and you place it on to
the<00:03:58.510> fabric<00:03:59.510> top<00:03:59.980> and<00:04:00.980> you<00:04:01.250> press<00:04:01.639> down<00:04:01.969> and

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
the fabric top and you press down and

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.589 
the fabric top and you press down and
you<00:04:02.450> let<00:04:02.659> it<00:04:02.780> wick<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:04.430> moisture<00:04:04.459> away<00:04:05.150> and

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
you let it wick the moisture away and

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.699 
you let it wick the moisture away and
you<00:04:05.719> can<00:04:05.870> see<00:04:06.049> exactly<00:04:06.409> how<00:04:06.709> that<00:04:06.739> works<00:04:07.189> now

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
you can see exactly how that works now

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.199 
you can see exactly how that works now
wicking<00:04:09.709> is<00:04:09.859> a<00:04:09.889> better<00:04:10.299> method<00:04:11.299> than<00:04:13.209> going

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
wicking is a better method than going

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.949 
wicking is a better method than going
back<00:04:14.480> and<00:04:14.540> forth<00:04:15.079> like<00:04:15.139> that<00:04:15.349> that<00:04:16.039> would<00:04:16.250> be

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
back and forth like that that would be

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.870 
back and forth like that that would be
not<00:04:17.959> an<00:04:18.169> ideal<00:04:18.470> way<00:04:18.680> to<00:04:18.709> do<00:04:18.979> this<00:04:19.160> the<00:04:19.519> final

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
not an ideal way to do this the final

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.570 
not an ideal way to do this the final
step<00:04:20.150> to<00:04:20.180> this<00:04:20.389> procedure<00:04:20.840> is<00:04:21.259> after<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.370> top

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.360 

now<00:05:36.240> I<00:05:36.270> tend<00:05:36.659> to<00:05:36.750> put<00:05:36.960> a<00:05:36.990> little<00:05:37.259> extra<00:05:37.830> on<00:05:38.069> the

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
now I tend to put a little extra on the

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.390 
now I tend to put a little extra on the
seam<00:05:38.729> so<00:05:39.030> I'll<00:05:39.150> run<00:05:39.389> this<00:05:39.599> down<00:05:39.919> one<00:05:40.919> more<00:05:41.129> time

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
seam so I'll run this down one more time

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.800 
seam so I'll run this down one more time
just<00:05:42.270> on<00:05:42.419> that<00:05:42.599> scene<00:05:44.479> and<00:05:45.479> you're<00:05:45.629> going<00:05:45.750> to

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
just on that scene and you're going to

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.159 
just on that scene and you're going to
do<00:05:45.990> that<00:05:46.169> for<00:05:46.439> the<00:05:46.590> entire<00:05:46.710> top<00:05:48.050> that's<00:05:49.050> going

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
do that for the entire top that's going

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:51.409 
do that for the entire top that's going
to<00:05:49.439> need<00:05:49.590> six<00:05:49.979> to<00:05:50.159> twelve<00:05:50.460> hours<00:05:50.729> of<00:05:50.969> drying

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
to need six to twelve hours of drying

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.510 
to need six to twelve hours of drying
time<00:05:51.779> and<00:05:52.080> in<00:05:52.469> that<00:05:52.620> time<00:05:52.889> you<00:05:53.069> have<00:05:53.219> to<00:05:53.250> make

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
time and in that time you have to make

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.429 
time and in that time you have to make
sure<00:05:53.550> that<00:05:54.060> there's<00:05:54.389> no<00:05:54.659> moisture<00:05:54.930> that's

00:05:55.429 --> 00:05:55.439 
sure that there's no moisture that's

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:57.080 
sure that there's no moisture that's
possible<00:05:55.949> that's<00:05:56.069> going<00:05:56.279> to<00:05:56.340> get<00:05:56.580> on<00:05:56.789> that

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
possible that's going to get on that

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.830 
possible that's going to get on that
surface<00:05:57.740> so<00:05:58.740> I<00:05:58.770> apply<00:05:59.189> this<00:05:59.250> every<00:06:00.090> six<00:06:00.389> months

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
surface so I apply this every six months

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.070 
surface so I apply this every six months
and<00:06:01.159> it<00:06:02.159> seems<00:06:02.639> to<00:06:02.849> do<00:06:03.000> a<00:06:03.029> great<00:06:03.449> job<00:06:03.750> on

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
and it seems to do a great job on

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.640 
and it seems to do a great job on
keeping<00:06:04.830> the<00:06:05.250> top<00:06:05.490> protected<00:06:06.360> and<00:06:06.509> very<00:06:07.289> water

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
keeping the top protected and very water

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.129 
keeping the top protected and very water
