00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
and bass and that changed some of the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.670 
and bass and that changed some of the
chords<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.840> little<00:02:19.080> bit<00:02:19.230> because<00:02:19.380> if<00:02:19.590> you

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
chords a little bit because if you

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.820 
chords a little bit because if you
listen<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.220> final<00:02:20.550> concert<00:02:21.180> album<00:02:21.830> we
