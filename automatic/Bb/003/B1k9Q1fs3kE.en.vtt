00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.299 
ammunition is 30 round to the magazine
with<00:00:50.420> 210<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.750> reserve<00:00:52.170> which<00:00:52.860> means<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.190> will

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
with 210 in reserve which means you will

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.299 
with 210 in reserve which means you will
have<00:00:53.340> plenty<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:54.570> ammunition<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.949> gun<00:00:56.100> down

have plenty of ammunition to gun down

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.319 
have plenty of ammunition to gun down
people<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.270> still<00:00:57.719> roll<00:00:58.020> with<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
people but I still roll with the

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.240 
people but I still roll with the
munitions<00:01:00.329> belts<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:01.140> because<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.410> need<00:01:01.710> all

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
munitions belts just because I need all

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.650 
munitions belts just because I need all
the<00:01:02.460> extra<00:01:02.550> ammo<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.210> when<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.420> go<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.629> my

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the extra ammo for when I go on my

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.080 
the extra ammo for when I go on my
insane<00:01:04.350> kill<00:01:04.830> streaks<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:07.159> the<00:01:08.159> carnage<00:01:08.520> AR<00:01:08.820> is

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
insane kill streaks so the carnage AR is

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.560 
insane kill streaks so the carnage AR is
special<00:01:09.570> because<00:01:09.890> it's<00:01:10.890> fires<00:01:11.670> quite<00:01:12.240> fast

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
special because it's fires quite fast

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.640 
special because it's fires quite fast
almost<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> TR<00:01:13.590> weapon<00:01:13.979> for<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> NC<00:01:14.670> and

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
almost like a TR weapon for the NC and

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.920 
almost like a TR weapon for the NC and
one<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.830> main<00:01:17.009> drawbacks<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.909> its<00:01:18.299> recoil

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
one of the main drawbacks is its recoil

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.039 
one of the main drawbacks is its recoil
now<00:01:19.770> most<00:01:20.220> wreak<00:01:20.400> most<00:01:20.970> guns<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> recoil

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
now most wreak most guns have a recoil

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.780 
now most wreak most guns have a recoil
of<00:01:22.290> her<00:01:22.470> either<00:01:22.770> vertical<00:01:23.990> vertically<00:01:24.990> up

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
of her either vertical vertically up

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.080 
of her either vertical vertically up
vertically<00:01:26.790> up<00:01:27.030> into<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> right<00:01:27.689> air<00:01:28.080> or

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
vertically up into the right air or

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.810 
vertically up into the right air or
vertically<00:01:30.090> up<00:01:30.450> into<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> left<00:01:31.790> but<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
vertically up into the left but the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.359 
vertically up into the left but the
carnage<00:01:33.150> they<00:01:33.299> are<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:34.290> shakes<00:01:34.770> back<00:01:35.159> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
carnage they are it just shakes back and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.880 
carnage they are it just shakes back and
forth<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.240> doesn't<00:01:36.900> really<00:01:36.990> settle<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.770> if

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
forth and it doesn't really settle on if

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.490 
forth and it doesn't really settle on if
it's<00:01:38.040> going<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.189> go<00:01:38.310> up<00:01:38.549> down<00:01:38.970> left<00:01:39.329> or<00:01:40.049> right

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
it's going to go up down left or right

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.429 
it's going to go up down left or right
so<00:01:41.390> it<00:01:42.390> makes<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.689> kind<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.930> difficult<00:01:43.049> to

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
so it makes it kind of difficult to

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.920 
so it makes it kind of difficult to
control<00:01:43.799> but<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:45.000> your<00:01:45.210> experience<00:01:45.720> that

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
control but if your experience that

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.719 
control but if your experience that
controlling<00:01:46.290> recoil<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.460> do<00:01:47.579> it

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
controlling recoil and you can do it

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.810 
controlling recoil and you can do it
very<00:01:48.299> well<00:01:48.479> then<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.710> weapon<00:01:50.220> will<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.490> no

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
very well then this weapon will be no

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.640 
very well then this weapon will be no
problem<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.810> at<00:01:52.049> all

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
problem to you at all

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.270 
problem to you at all
when<00:01:54.220> playing<00:01:54.400> with<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.570> carnage<00:01:55.960> AR<00:01:56.260> I<00:01:56.560> was

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
when playing with the carnage AR I was

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.280 
when playing with the carnage AR I was
doing<00:01:57.580> really<00:01:57.790> well<00:01:58.000> in<00:01:58.060> close<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:59.020> medium

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
doing really well in close to medium

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.230 
doing really well in close to medium
ranges<00:01:59.650> and<00:01:59.950> at<00:02:00.040> long<00:02:00.220> ranges<00:02:00.760> I<00:02:00.880> could<00:02:01.030> still

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
ranges and at long ranges I could still

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.820 
ranges and at long ranges I could still
pick<00:02:01.450> off<00:02:01.600> targets<00:02:02.050> if<00:02:02.230> I<00:02:02.320> can<00:02:02.470> get<00:02:02.560> enough

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
pick off targets if I can get enough

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.120 
pick off targets if I can get enough
shots<00:02:03.160> on<00:02:03.430> them<00:02:03.670> but<00:02:04.660> main<00:02:05.500> important<00:02:05.980> thing

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
shots on them but main important thing

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.850 
shots on them but main important thing
is<00:02:06.310> that<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.750> wasn't<00:02:07.750> necessarily<00:02:08.320> going<00:02:08.619> for

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
is that I wasn't necessarily going for

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.710 
is that I wasn't necessarily going for
all<00:02:09.009> head<00:02:09.310> shots<00:02:09.340> I<00:02:09.940> was<00:02:10.090> mostly<00:02:10.360> going<00:02:10.540> for

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
all head shots I was mostly going for

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.550 
all head shots I was mostly going for
center<00:02:10.960> of<00:02:11.110> mass<00:02:11.350> and<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:13.180> think<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.320> one<00:02:14.530> of

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
center of mass and I think that one of

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.860 
center of mass and I think that one of
my<00:02:14.680> main<00:02:14.920> things<00:02:15.220> is<00:02:15.460> i<00:02:15.580> reloaded<00:02:16.150> too<00:02:16.660> much

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
my main things is i reloaded too much

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.620 
my main things is i reloaded too much
after<00:02:17.320> shooting<00:02:17.800> I<00:02:18.010> killed<00:02:18.940> one<00:02:19.150> person<00:02:19.300> then

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
after shooting I killed one person then

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.070 
after shooting I killed one person then
reloaded<00:02:20.140> instead<00:02:20.470> of<00:02:20.620> not<00:02:21.540> not<00:02:22.540> reloading

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
reloaded instead of not not reloading

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.720 
reloaded instead of not not reloading
and<00:02:23.260> going<00:02:23.590> after<00:02:23.800> another<00:02:24.010> person<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:24.640> I

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
and going after another person and I

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.699 
and going after another person and I
think<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.060> was<00:02:25.180> one<00:02:25.330> of<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.540> main<00:02:25.900> drawbacks

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
think that was one of the main drawbacks

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.580 
think that was one of the main drawbacks
to<00:02:27.550> me<00:02:28.060> using<00:02:28.270> this<00:02:28.510> weapon<00:02:28.720> is<00:02:28.990> that<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.230> just

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
to me using this weapon is that I just

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.280 
to me using this weapon is that I just
could<00:02:29.890> not<00:02:30.070> settle<00:02:30.520> them<00:02:30.730> when<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.630> reload<00:02:32.020> my

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
could not settle them when to reload my

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.520 
could not settle them when to reload my
reloads<00:02:32.680> were<00:02:32.860> just<00:02:33.040> horribly<00:02:33.910> off<00:02:34.200> but<00:02:35.200> other

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
reloads were just horribly off but other

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.860 
reloads were just horribly off but other
than<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.830> it's<00:02:36.520> a<00:02:36.580> solid<00:02:36.970> weapon<00:02:37.420> I<00:02:37.510> use<00:02:37.690> it

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
than that it's a solid weapon I use it

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.680 
than that it's a solid weapon I use it
all<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.110> time<00:02:38.970> I'm<00:02:39.970> almost<00:02:40.300> that<00:02:40.600> are

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
all the time I'm almost that are

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.240 
all the time I'm almost that are
actually<00:02:40.840> my<00:02:41.080> need<00:02:41.200> like<00:02:41.380> three<00:02:41.800> hundred<00:02:41.920> more

kills until I'm iraq's and with the the
carnage<00:02:44.800> which<00:02:45.610> i<00:02:45.970> think<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.270> pretty<00:02:46.540> good<00:02:46.750> i

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780

and<00:04:00.670> he<00:04:01.209> just<00:04:01.390> wrecks<00:04:01.750> me

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
and he just wrecks me

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.390 
and he just wrecks me
and<00:04:02.610> if<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:03.240> shot<00:04:03.540> him<00:04:03.690> about<00:04:03.930> like<00:04:04.110> 10<00:04:04.740> times<00:04:05.070> as

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
and if I shot him about like 10 times as

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.160 
and if I shot him about like 10 times as
you<00:04:05.520> can<00:04:05.640> see<00:04:05.820> he<00:04:06.270> was<00:04:06.300> health<00:04:06.570> was<00:04:06.720> in<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.930> red

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
you can see he was health was in the red

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.830 
you can see he was health was in the red
he<00:04:07.620> probably<00:04:08.070> would<00:04:08.310> have<00:04:08.370> died<00:04:08.580> that<00:04:09.570> was<00:04:09.690> my

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
he probably would have died that was my

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.220 
he probably would have died that was my
fault<00:04:10.260> but<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:11.090> guess<00:04:12.090> that's<00:04:12.210> wraps<00:04:12.810> things<00:04:13.020> up

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
fault but I guess that's wraps things up
