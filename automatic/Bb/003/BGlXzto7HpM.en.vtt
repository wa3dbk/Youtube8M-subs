00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.910
 we had third win third 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.379
 on the sheet of paper looks the whole 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.450
 now pretty good with nine points 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.240
 but how hard was it? 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.250
 today it was extremely difficult than oliver 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.629
 classen or super great but I think 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.250
 right now family is betrayed 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.470
 it is reminiscent of pictures of the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.600
 training games a time in pink 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.730
 schmidt and in front of them and goes and 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.230
 always on the second belt is largely the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.580
 this is the case we will have 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.820
 us set on a fighting dog 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.320
 we accepted it and link it 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.680
 time to give some changes in 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.180
 the team how difficult it was there 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.410
 for you now, so to speak, to the new 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.300
 to adjust the player 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.090
 or do you plan to do that now? 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.490
 already practiced afterwards player faith 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.430
 everyone knows what he has to do so where it is 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.800
 but then whether it does or not 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.590
 Game has to be fantastic and that can be 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.640
 also take along for Wednesday allegations 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.380
 Worth nothing is we look it is 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.330
 and because of the rotation of a trainer 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.190
 decision i believe everyone in one 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.010
 blog something he has to do and 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.500
 is natural qualities of Campanian leaves 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.930
 makes the or fresh momentum brought 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.270
 second half and in the end 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.700
 what every player is water and just something 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.240
 to that the wednesday already very briefly 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.800
 addressed how difficult it has been since 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.540
 this change from wednesday now 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.220
 Champions League continues Bundesliga in 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.080
 ried wednesday again champions league 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.410
 and especially tenants very very important 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.900
 game 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.520
 Yes, I believe that person's like 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.590
 Wednesday you do not know it was 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.680
 a great game we fought and 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.930
 it would also take on Wednesday we 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.030
 he knows that he no longer 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.590
 Extend and must be the climb 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.909
 but they were safe 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.340
 not similar, we play through below 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.159
 the two failures is it think 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.450
 maybe they'll be a behind 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.159
 a nice one to finish with later 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.180
 five rockets and let's have a look 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.830
 have to make an early goal then is 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.300
 climb in all cases in it and we 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.690
 we hope for full support from 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.720
 our fans as banker martin 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.720
 O
