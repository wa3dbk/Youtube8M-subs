00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello all guys are andros all'esp 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.410
 she does www.lexbook.it in the kitchen 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.080
 facebook discretion and are things that the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.240
 rai 2 I say that man of the match 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.769
 the outside we say the outside playmaker 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.260
 outside right of the day of the meeting 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.760
 by simeone that yesterday beat for 1 to 0 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.010
 a kiss thus gaining access 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.990
 at the Champions League semifinals 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.609
 thanks precisely to a goal from his head 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.130
 after 5 minutes 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.000
 this card shows 83 of 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:35.370
 demerol 77 of 1 gig 77 for shooting plus 5 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.850
 not fit 89 passages plus 6 85 rb 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.480
 in addition 4 63 defense plus 366 I say then 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.399
 it remains 4 more for us to take a look at 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.920
 game statistics we have immediately what kind 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.590
 this is a player 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.840
 player with excellent feet a director 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.960
 that however like speed maybe spikes one 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.610
 bit if we're going to see rains have 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.879
 moment to see some post destined 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.579
 specific 92 of 88 ball control of 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.339
 longshot 92 the long passages 91 of 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.240
 short passes 90 of shooting power also 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:14.189
 a nice cross 86 shot around 95 reactions 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.920
 88 book balancing 82 agility 86 e 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.400
 excellent characteristic 85 division and then 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.140
 66 of physical strength starting the list of 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.140
 top and flop the top top the top most 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.820
 the passage is undoubtedly great 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.119
 pass this player is share that 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.380
 both long and large are things 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.750
 exceptional with the big being alive 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.329
 diego really costs sending her a wedding and 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.759
 with the passages I managed to get away with 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.560
 make there 12 to launch someone who 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.829
 then he went to the door 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.049
 passages intended both as long passages 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.549
 let the goth passers be their own 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.100
 great this player is the reason 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.000
 that if you like these two players 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.829
 pushes me to buy what they love too 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.649
 the 3 list of tops in addition to the already mentioned ones 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.600
 cross there is also dripping sales 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.659
 in short, he would see in pure why the 92 of 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.820
 check dribble 84 dribbling or 80 blacks 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.370
 agility but unfortunately three written stars 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.700
 they will be the only one 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.220
 because ham remains these three 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.680
 stars melted salt 4 as maybe yes 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.480
 it also deserves in the real that is not 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.340
 just one that does so many tricks though 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.050
 in short we say that there are people who a 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.780
 four star skill and who doesn't know 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.390
 don't even do a lower one anyway 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.430
 we said the olympus constraint and excellent 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.770
 but left right thanks to agility 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.870
 with l 23 in volleyball under the foot 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.160
 thanks to the 81 ball encounter do so many 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.590
 other beautiful things 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.660
 thanks precisely to the understanding it would be in itself 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.040
 so this player's dribbles is 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.020
 great and useful as you just have 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.110
 seen to stand out and then pass it 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.670
 even then they do not even have land 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.280
 in which top there is also the shot 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.900
 the throw as acted without doubt 95 of 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.300
 read I made two goals per lap a lot 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.790
 these others are also beautiful and long shots 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.930
 88 field of the seventh 90 then from outside 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.440
 area this game where it really is 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.570
 great 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.380
 from inside the area will not change you much 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.720
 often having to conclude with which 277 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.360
 it is neither a fantastic value in that 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.250
 of the bass so it is neither a top flop 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.770
 I don't know if you've seen this launch 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.780
 I conclude the list of the tops 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.270
 excellent punishments are bullying 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.260
 century positions both for effect but 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.600
 under the weak foot 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.820
 I believe this guys g8 of 6 5 st 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.739
 he must be weak and initially I was convinced 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.080
 if he were left-handed he was right- handed instead 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.700
 I'm on the footer and I said to myself 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.680
 I thought at the beginning I know coca and 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.050
 right however he played so well of 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.850
 left that saves on theft to get me 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.010
 check this wrong 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.540
 boy is left-handed no now and 4 if you 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.209
 sees blue but these four if the rules 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.010
 if juan absolutely 5 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.810
 so in conclusion guys I from him 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.160
 I was expecting a lot and received a lot 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.110
 because his knicks on one of the cards 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.420
 strongest economic game suites 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.250
 it costs 5,000 bing and is worth it 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.150
 absolutely which will be among is not that 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.800
 it costs 200 thousand 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.080
 but as it will probably subside 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.000
 on the 80 90 thousand if it should do so invitation 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.670
 all those who like exteriors 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.230
 technical but not very fast to try 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.489
 this player then said this 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.489
 we greet each other as a greeting
