00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.100
 Hi guys. Here is Hollie from Access PlayStation. 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.100
 I was really lucky because I could get my hands on a PS4. 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.600
 That's why we'll take a look at the console today. 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.500
 Of course on the DualShock®4 and the PlayStation camera. 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.700
 Here it is: PlayStation®4! 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.900
 The device here is a prototype, so unfortunately I will not be able to turn it on. 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.300
 But this will soon be in your hands ... 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.000
 ... when PlayStation®4 finally appears in late November. 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.700
 If you want more information about the fantastic technology in this box, ... 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.700
 ... you can watch our video about the technical data. Everything is explained there. 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.400
 Even what Teraflops are. I'm still not sure if I understood that. 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.700
 The PlayStation®4 of course appears in this beautiful, asymmetrical design. 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.200
 Here we see the two-part surface structure. 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.700
 The color is called "Jet Black". 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.300
 If you think of the PlayStation®3 now, it was "Piano Black" - a completely different color. 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.700
 You see this line running across the middle. 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.700
 She will shine in this "PlayStation Blue" that you know so well. 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.700
 Here you will find the power button, underneath the eject button. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.600
 Here you will be able to push the disc into your PlayStation®4. 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600
 There are two USB ports on this page. 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.600
 For example, you can put in your Micro USB cable to charge your DualShock®4 controller. 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.400
 You can even do that when the PlayStation®4 is in stand-by mode. 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.700
 Let's take a look at the back of the console. 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.700
 Here we see a digital optical connector and the HDMI output, ... 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.600
 ... also the LAN connection, an auxiliary connection and of course the slot for the power cable. 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.800
 Of course, the PlayStation®4 would not be complete without the DualShock®4. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.400
 This is the great new controller that you can soon hold in your hands. 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.800
 The DualShock®4 is not just a new edition of the DualShock®3 controller. 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.900
 He brings along many new features. 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.100
 He not only offers a new surface, .... 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.900
 ... it also offers longer handles, a new, clickable touchpad, ... 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.800
 ... revised analog sticks and of course the Share and Option buttons. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.700
 On the back of the controller, you get an even better view of the new surface of the DualShock®4. 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.500
 The shoulder buttons are longer, thinner and now bent outward. 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.500
 Here we see, of course, where the USB charging cable will belong. 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.100
 As I said earlier, you can now charge the controller even when the console is in stand-by mode. 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.100
 Of course, there is also the lightbar. 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.500
 The light bar can change its color depending on which player you are in local multiplayer ... 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.900
 ... or depending on what happens in the game. For example, if you die, it can glow red. 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.500
 In a game like Hohokum, for example, the color also changes depending on the color of the snake. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.200
 Here we have the PlayStation®4 camera. 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.800
 A great little piece of technology. 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.000
 It helps to improve the gaming experience on PlayStation®4. 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.400
 The PlayStation®4 camera can record in 3D. 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.200
 It has four microphones for improved noise detection and location. 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.600
 It can also be used for AR content, which we've already seen on PlayRoom. 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.600
 She is pretty easy. Actually, very easy. 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.600
 It is very small and compact. 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.200
 You can turn it to show it up or down, depending on where you want to place it. 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.700
 With me she will come under the TV, because I have space for it. 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.100
 Here you can see again the two cameras that are needed for the 3D shots. 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.500
 And of course the four microphones. 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.400
 So, that was our look at the PlayStation®4, the DualShock®4 and the PlayStation camera.
