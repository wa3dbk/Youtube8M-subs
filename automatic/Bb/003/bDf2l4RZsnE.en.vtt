00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:34.539 
think the best place to start off is

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:40.619 
think the best place to start off is
mgs4<00:00:35.440> which<00:00:35.800> is<00:00:36.039> like<00:00:36.749> year<00:00:37.749> ago<00:00:38.079> now<00:00:38.379> yeah<00:00:39.629> do

mgs4 which is like year ago now yeah do
you<00:00:40.719> think<00:00:40.929> it's<00:00:41.109> probably<00:00:41.499> one<00:00:41.769> of<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:41.980> best

yeah what was your opinion on that um I

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.810

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
thought that was kind of kind of cool

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.470 
thought that was kind of kind of cool
you<00:01:37.240> know<00:01:37.270> see<00:01:37.930> how<00:01:38.260> she<00:01:38.320> grew<00:01:39.190> up<00:01:39.430> from<00:01:40.090> I

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
you know see how she grew up from I

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.800 
you know see how she grew up from I
think<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:41.050> first<00:01:41.380> game<00:01:41.590> she<00:01:41.770> was<00:01:41.920> like<00:01:42.040> 18<00:01:42.810> but

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
think the first game she was like 18 but

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.020 
think the first game she was like 18 but
she<00:01:43.930> was<00:01:44.050> pretty<00:01:44.230> young<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:44.890> innocence<00:01:45.760> and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
she was pretty young and innocence and

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.990 
she was pretty young and innocence and
probably<00:01:46.810> like<00:01:47.230> on<00:01:47.380> our<00:01:47.500> first<00:01:47.740> mission<00:01:48.040> with

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
probably like on our first mission with

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.710 
probably like on our first mission with
solid<00:01:49.420> snake<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:51.460> so<00:01:51.670> that<00:01:51.910> just<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.540> be<00:01:52.660> able

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
solid snake and so that just to be able

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.380 
solid snake and so that just to be able
to<00:01:52.900> see<00:01:53.140> her<00:01:53.200> as<00:01:53.650> she<00:01:54.010> had<00:01:54.580> developed<00:01:54.970> and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
to see her as she had developed and

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.270 
to see her as she had developed and
matured<00:01:55.510> and<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:56.440> it<00:01:56.890> was<00:01:57.010> kind<00:01:57.190> of

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
matured and and it was kind of

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.070 
matured and and it was kind of
interesting<00:01:57.580> to<00:01:58.060> kind<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.540> we<00:01:58.630> talked<00:01:58.900> about

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
character having had you know all these

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.369 
character having had you know all these
years<00:02:04.960> to<00:02:05.380> develop<00:02:05.680> and<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.570> some<00:02:08.140> people

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
years to develop and and some people

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.199 
years to develop and and some people
have<00:02:08.500> asked<00:02:08.800> me<00:02:08.860> like<00:02:09.159> you<00:02:09.489> know<00:02:09.550> where<00:02:09.879> did

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
have asked me like you know where did

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.010 
have asked me like you know where did
her<00:02:10.360> accent<00:02:10.990> go<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:12.310> actually<00:02:13.270> I<00:02:13.540> had

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
her accent go and and actually I had

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.390 
her accent go and and actually I had
thought<00:02:14.200> about<00:02:14.260> this<00:02:14.590> when<00:02:14.770> we<00:02:14.800> first<00:02:15.100> did

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
thought about this when we first did

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.910 
thought about this when we first did
Metal<00:02:15.670> Gear<00:02:15.700> Solid<00:02:16.000> she<00:02:16.569> supposedly<00:02:17.260> grew<00:02:17.739> up

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
Metal Gear Solid she supposedly grew up

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.220 
Metal Gear Solid she supposedly grew up
in<00:02:18.129> the<00:02:18.220> US<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:18.939> technically<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.629> wouldn't<00:02:20.140> have

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
in the US so technically I wouldn't have

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.690 
in the US so technically I wouldn't have
thought<00:02:20.349> she'd<00:02:20.620> have<00:02:20.799> an<00:02:20.950> accent<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.459> first

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
thought she'd have an accent the first

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.720 
thought she'd have an accent the first
place<00:02:21.939> so<00:02:22.840> we<00:02:22.989> decided<00:02:23.349> when<00:02:23.769> actually<00:02:24.579> when

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
place so we decided when actually when

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.990 
place so we decided when actually when
we<00:02:24.760> redid<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.599> voicing<00:02:26.079> for<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.920> Gamecube<00:02:27.670> we

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
we redid the voicing for the Gamecube we

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.089 
we redid the voicing for the Gamecube we
took<00:02:28.209> her<00:02:28.360> accent<00:02:28.750> out<00:02:28.870> for<00:02:29.079> that<00:02:29.170> as<00:02:29.439> well<00:02:29.470> so

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
took her accent out for that as well so

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.619 
took her accent out for that as well so
that's<00:02:30.370> why<00:02:30.610> when<00:02:30.849> we<00:02:30.939> did<00:02:31.150> metal<00:02:31.450> gear<00:02:31.599> four

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
that's why when we did metal gear four

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.080 
that's why when we did metal gear four
we<00:02:32.290> didn't<00:02:32.739> have<00:02:32.859> an<00:02:33.010> accident<00:02:33.159> at<00:02:33.459> all<00:02:33.609> but

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
we didn't have an accident at all but

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.559 
we didn't have an accident at all but
personally<00:02:34.689> I<00:02:34.720> like<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.200> accent<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:36.569> thought

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
personally I like the accent I thought

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.449 
personally I like the accent I thought
it<00:02:37.689> was<00:02:37.780> really<00:02:37.840> fun<00:02:38.409> and<00:02:38.439> just<00:02:38.769> kind<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.310> gave

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
it was really fun and just kind of gave

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.199 
it was really fun and just kind of gave
her<00:02:39.609> some<00:02:39.939> fun<00:02:40.810> character<00:02:41.379> but<00:02:41.859> but<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:42.939> like

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
her some fun character but but I like

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.210 
her some fun character but but I like
her<00:02:43.420> as<00:02:43.629> the<00:02:43.840> mature<00:02:44.109> person<00:02:44.500> too<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:45.129> was

her as the mature person too and it was

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.190

an<00:02:45.370> interesting<00:02:45.670> fine<00:02:46.359> line<00:02:46.569> to<00:02:46.720> walk<00:02:46.750> to

I<00:05:19.920> just<00:05:20.700> dropped<00:05:20.880> the<00:05:20.970> phone<00:05:21.120> I<00:05:21.390> think<00:05:21.900> that

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
I just dropped the phone I think that

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.890 
I just dropped the phone I think that
well<00:05:22.920> first<00:05:23.130> of<00:05:23.310> all<00:05:23.400> it<00:05:23.610> when<00:05:24.360> it<00:05:24.480> first<00:05:24.600> came

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
well first of all it when it first came

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.510 
well first of all it when it first came
out<00:05:25.050> I<00:05:25.110> think<00:05:25.320> it<00:05:25.620> was<00:05:25.680> pretty<00:05:25.980> groundbreaking

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
out I think it was pretty groundbreaking

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.600 
out I think it was pretty groundbreaking
as<00:05:27.090> far<00:05:27.450> as<00:05:27.630> what<00:05:28.320> was<00:05:28.650> out<00:05:28.890> there<00:05:28.950> at<00:05:29.310> the<00:05:29.400> time

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
as far as what was out there at the time

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.820 
as far as what was out there at the time
so<00:05:30.090> it<00:05:30.240> was<00:05:30.360> something<00:05:30.510> completely<00:05:30.780> new<00:05:31.260> and<00:05:31.500> I

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
so it was something completely new and I

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.980 
so it was something completely new and I
think<00:05:32.040> it<00:05:32.130> kind<00:05:32.250> of<00:05:32.370> took<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.669> game<00:05:33.030> world<00:05:33.330> by

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
think it kind of took the game world by

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.580 
think it kind of took the game world by
storm<00:05:34.050> at<00:05:34.560> that<00:05:34.710> point<00:05:35.070> and<00:05:35.630> the<00:05:36.630> way<00:05:36.870> that<00:05:37.320> I

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
storm at that point and the way that I

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.650 
storm at that point and the way that I
think<00:05:37.950> was<00:05:38.160> able<00:05:38.430> to<00:05:38.520> integrate<00:05:38.820> the<00:05:39.240> gaming

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
think was able to integrate the gaming

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.570 
think was able to integrate the gaming
experience<00:05:40.260> with<00:05:40.590> say<00:05:40.860> like<00:05:41.100> a<00:05:41.130> movie

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
experience with say like a movie

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.600 
experience with say like a movie
experience<00:05:42.060> and<00:05:42.480> the<00:05:43.200> storytelling<00:05:43.950> I<00:05:44.340> think

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
experience and the storytelling I think

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.430 
experience and the storytelling I think
was<00:05:44.850> really<00:05:46.340> innovative<00:05:47.340> and<00:05:47.490> intricate<00:05:48.060> and

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
was really innovative and intricate and

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.510 
was really innovative and intricate and
had<00:05:49.440> a<00:05:50.040> really<00:05:50.550> interesting<00:05:51.000> theme<00:05:51.510> that<00:05:52.520> that

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
had a really interesting theme that that

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.580 
had a really interesting theme that that
you<00:05:53.640> really<00:05:54.030> would<00:05:54.150> find<00:05:54.540> in<00:05:54.960> games<00:05:55.320> at<00:05:55.560> the

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
you really would find in games at the

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.590 
you really would find in games at the
time<00:05:55.860> or<00:05:56.190> even<00:05:56.430> now<00:05:56.730> I<00:05:56.760> mean<00:05:57.090> not<00:05:57.270> a<00:05:57.300> lot<00:05:57.450> of

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
time or even now I mean not a lot of

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.490 
time or even now I mean not a lot of
games<00:05:57.900> have<00:05:58.169> all<00:05:58.440> those<00:05:58.800> elements<00:05:59.100> i<00:05:59.520> think

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
games have all those elements i think

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.810 
games have all those elements i think
but<00:06:01.500> the<00:06:01.800> characters<00:06:02.280> and<00:06:02.310> the<00:06:02.580> way<00:06:02.700> they

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
but the characters and the way they

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.260 
but the characters and the way they
interacted<00:06:03.510> i<00:06:03.720> think<00:06:03.990> was<00:06:04.200> just<00:06:04.500> really

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
interacted i think was just really

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.730 
interacted i think was just really
appealing<00:06:06.270> you<00:06:06.660> know<00:06:06.780> i<00:06:06.810> did<00:06:07.320> try<00:06:07.470> and<00:06:07.620> play

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
appealing you know i did try and play

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.350 
appealing you know i did try and play
the<00:06:07.860> first<00:06:08.070> game<00:06:08.160> actually<00:06:08.490> to<00:06:08.880> i<00:06:08.940> got<00:06:09.210> as<00:06:09.330> far

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
the first game actually to i got as far

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.550 
the first game actually to i got as far
as<00:06:09.750> awful<00:06:10.290> it<00:06:10.410> which<00:06:11.250> is<00:06:11.400> a<00:06:11.430> very<00:06:11.669> parvin<00:06:12.560> but

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
as awful it which is a very parvin but

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.980 
as awful it which is a very parvin but
of<00:06:13.830> but<00:06:14.520> i<00:06:14.550> mean<00:06:14.820> i<00:06:14.970> really<00:06:15.090> liked<00:06:15.419> it<00:06:15.570> if<00:06:15.690> i<00:06:15.810> was

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
of but i mean i really liked it if i was

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.960 
of but i mean i really liked it if i was
better<00:06:16.230> with<00:06:16.710> like<00:06:17.010> you<00:06:17.280> know<00:06:17.310> the<00:06:17.640> finger

better with like you know the finger
mashing<00:06:18.750> i<00:06:18.870> think<00:06:19.080> i've<00:06:19.200> gotten<00:06:19.800> further<00:06:20.419> I'm

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
mashing i think i've gotten further I'm

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:23.450 
mashing i think i've gotten further I'm
not<00:06:21.660> so<00:06:21.870> good<00:06:22.020> with<00:06:22.080> that<00:06:22.320> but<00:06:23.039> yeah<00:06:23.280> I<00:06:23.310> think

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
not so good with that but yeah I think

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.820 
not so good with that but yeah I think
that<00:06:23.940> it<00:06:24.510> just<00:06:24.780> it<00:06:24.990> had<00:06:25.200> I<00:06:25.350> think<00:06:25.560> there's<00:06:25.740> like

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
that it just it had I think there's like

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:26.610 
that it just it had I think there's like
the<00:06:26.130> movie

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
the movie

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.890 
the movie

about it what really draws me to those

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:33.659 
about it what really draws me to those
