sb-700<00:00:13.059> i'm<00:00:13.480> going<00:00:13.630> to<00:00:13.690> teach<00:00:13.840> you<00:00:13.870> how<00:00:14.349> to

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
sb-700 i'm going to teach you how to

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.660 
sb-700 i'm going to teach you how to
turn<00:00:15.580> that<00:00:15.790> into<00:00:16.059> a<00:00:16.920> master<00:00:17.920> transmitter<00:00:18.460> on

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
turn that into a master transmitter on

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.179 
turn that into a master transmitter on
the<00:00:18.939> camera<00:00:19.329> so<00:00:19.539> that<00:00:19.689> it'll<00:00:19.839> broadcast<00:00:20.439> to

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
the camera so that it'll broadcast to

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.419 
the camera so that it'll broadcast to
other<00:00:21.310> slave<00:00:21.699> units<00:00:22.169> in<00:00:23.169> the<00:00:23.439> system<00:00:23.829> and<00:00:24.009> then

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:24.429 
other slave units in the system and then

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.300 
other slave units in the system and then
also<00:00:24.759> as<00:00:25.210> a<00:00:25.239> slave<00:00:25.659> unit<00:00:26.019> so<00:00:26.529> that<00:00:26.560> the<00:00:26.829> master

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
also as a slave unit so that the master

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.829 
also as a slave unit so that the master
can<00:00:27.579> broadcast<00:00:28.060> to<00:00:28.239> the<00:00:28.269> slave<00:00:28.599> the<00:00:28.630> slave

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:28.839 
can broadcast to the slave the slave

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:30.989 
can broadcast to the slave the slave
will<00:00:29.229> listen<00:00:29.409> to<00:00:29.649> the<00:00:29.769> directions<00:00:30.249> so<00:00:30.519> in

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:30.999 
will listen to the directions so in

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:32.729 
will listen to the directions so in
multiple<00:00:31.449> flash<00:00:31.689> we<00:00:31.960> need<00:00:32.140> to<00:00:32.230> have<00:00:32.439> the

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
multiple flash we need to have the

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.040 
multiple flash we need to have the
transmitter<00:00:33.489> which<00:00:34.120> is<00:00:34.270> called<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:34.600> master

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
transmitter which is called the master

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.050 
transmitter which is called the master
and<00:00:35.290> the<00:00:35.440> remote<00:00:35.800> which<00:00:36.010> is<00:00:36.160> also<00:00:36.520> called<00:00:36.880> the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.060 
and the remote which is also called the

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.270 
and the remote which is also called the
slave<00:00:37.300> and<00:00:38.230> they<00:00:38.410> all<00:00:38.530> need<00:00:38.770> to<00:00:38.860> signal<00:00:39.040> each

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
slave and they all need to signal each

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.760 
slave and they all need to signal each
other<00:00:39.520> so<00:00:39.910> the<00:00:40.450> trickiest<00:00:40.900> part<00:00:41.230> of<00:00:41.410> it<00:00:41.560> all<00:00:41.740> is

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
other so the trickiest part of it all is

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.860 
other so the trickiest part of it all is
figuring<00:00:42.430> out<00:00:42.490> which<00:00:42.610> button<00:00:42.670> to<00:00:43.210> push<00:00:43.570> and

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
figuring out which button to push and

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.390 
figuring out which button to push and
once<00:00:44.050> you<00:00:44.170> got<00:00:44.320> that<00:00:44.440> figured<00:00:44.620> out<00:00:44.920> it's<00:00:45.190> real

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
once you got that figured out it's real

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.030 
once you got that figured out it's real
easy<00:00:45.610> to<00:00:45.700> do<00:00:45.910> and<00:00:46.120> I<00:00:46.530> that's<00:00:47.530> why<00:00:47.710> I<00:00:47.740> made<00:00:47.920> this

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
easy to do and I that's why I made this

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.780 
easy to do and I that's why I made this
video<00:00:48.160> for<00:00:48.370> you

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
video for you

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.250 
video for you
so<00:00:49.060> let's<00:00:49.720> go<00:00:49.840> to<00:00:49.900> the<00:00:50.140> let's<00:00:50.470> go<00:00:50.650> to<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:50.920> flash

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
so let's go to the let's go to the flash

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.319 
so let's go to the let's go to the flash
okay<00:00:53.260> this<00:00:53.410> is<00:00:53.560> a<00:00:53.590> nikon<00:00:53.980> sb-700<00:00:54.700> and<00:00:55.150> i'm

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
okay this is a nikon sb-700 and i'm

okay this is a nikon sb-700 and i'm
going<00:00:55.450> to<00:00:55.510> quickly<00:00:55.720> show<00:00:55.900> you<00:00:56.110> how<00:00:56.320> to<00:00:56.500> turn<00:00:56.829> it

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
going to quickly show you how to turn it

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.069 
going to quickly show you how to turn it
into<00:00:57.220> a<00:00:57.600> master<00:00:58.600> transmitter<00:00:59.590> or<00:00:59.860> a<00:00:59.920> slave

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
into a master transmitter or a slave

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.330 
into a master transmitter or a slave
whichever<00:01:02.079> one<00:01:03.010> you<00:01:03.100> want

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
whichever one you want

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.390 
whichever one you want
on<00:01:03.430> the<00:01:03.579> sb-700<00:01:04.210> so<00:01:04.570> here<00:01:04.780> are<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:04.960> controls

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
on the sb-700 so here are the controls

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.830 
on the sb-700 so here are the controls
first<00:01:06.400> of<00:01:06.640> all<00:01:06.790> you'll<00:01:06.970> see<00:01:07.060> there's<00:01:07.600> a<00:01:07.659> very

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
first of all you'll see there's a very

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.469 
first of all you'll see there's a very
conveniently<00:01:08.560> located<00:01:08.829> remote<00:01:09.579> and<00:01:09.819> master

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
conveniently located remote and master

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.410 
conveniently located remote and master
button<00:01:10.840> right<00:01:11.140> here<00:01:11.170> and<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.939> way<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:13.119> get

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
button right here and so the way to get

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.749 
button right here and so the way to get
access<00:01:13.990> it<00:01:14.200> is<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:14.499> push<00:01:14.679> the<00:01:14.859> center<00:01:15.100> indent

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
access it is to push the center indent

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.899 
access it is to push the center indent
until<00:01:16.509> we<00:01:16.689> can<00:01:16.960> unlock<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.770> lever<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.399> then

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
until we can unlock the lever and then

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.999 
until we can unlock the lever and then
this<00:01:19.149> is<00:01:19.299> the<00:01:19.450> traditional<00:01:20.020> TTL<00:01:20.530> mode<00:01:20.740> which

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
this is the traditional TTL mode which

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.399 
this is the traditional TTL mode which
is<00:01:21.159> on<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:21.609> camera<00:01:22.030> we're<00:01:22.689> going<00:01:22.960> to<00:01:23.079> put<00:01:23.289> it

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
is on the camera we're going to put it

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.770 
is on the camera we're going to put it
on<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.009> master<00:01:24.789> mode<00:01:24.969> which<00:01:25.210> means<00:01:25.509> it

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
on to the master mode which means it

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.980 
on to the master mode which means it
sits<00:01:26.049> on<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.350> camera<00:01:27.090> but<00:01:28.090> I<00:01:28.359> want<00:01:28.689> to<00:01:28.780> have

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
sits on the camera but I want to have

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.730 
sits on the camera but I want to have
the<00:01:29.530> flash<00:01:29.829> off<00:01:30.189> so<00:01:30.639> there's<00:01:30.939> different<00:01:31.780> right

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
the flash off so there's different right

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.349 
the flash off so there's different right
here<00:01:33.009> let<00:01:33.219> me<00:01:33.249> explain<00:01:33.340> what<00:01:33.789> I<00:01:33.819> have<00:01:34.090> here

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
here let me explain what I have here

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.599 
here let me explain what I have here
this<00:01:34.600> is<00:01:34.659> m4<00:01:35.439> the<00:01:35.530> master<00:01:35.889> unit<00:01:36.130> that's<00:01:36.340> this

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
this is m4 the master unit that's this

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:39.569 
this is m4 the master unit that's this
guy<00:01:36.850> i<00:01:37.090> right<00:01:37.929> now<00:01:38.109> have<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.590> flash<00:01:38.829> off<00:01:39.100> I

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
guy i right now have the flash off I

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.789 
guy i right now have the flash off I
also<00:01:40.209> have<00:01:40.600> group<00:01:41.200> a<00:01:41.939> which<00:01:42.939> is<00:01:43.450> at<00:01:43.799> regular

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
also have group a which is at regular

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.649 
also have group a which is at regular
TTL<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.729> group<00:01:46.090> B<00:01:46.329> which<00:01:47.109> is<00:01:47.319> on<00:01:47.560> -<00:01:48.219> -<00:01:48.659> under

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
TTL and group B which is on - - under

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.709 
TTL and group B which is on - - under
exposure<00:01:50.200> so<00:01:50.709> what<00:01:51.490> I<00:01:51.520> would<00:01:51.729> do<00:01:51.880> is<00:01:52.029> turn<00:01:52.299> one

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
exposure so what I would do is turn one

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.609 
exposure so what I would do is turn one
of<00:01:52.779> these<00:01:53.100> 700<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.279> 900<00:01:54.539> call<00:01:55.539> it<00:01:55.719> group<00:01:56.049> a<00:01:56.259> and

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
of these 700 and 900 call it group a and

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.699 
of these 700 and 900 call it group a and
then<00:01:57.100> that<00:01:57.310> would<00:01:57.520> be<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.909> regular<00:01:58.709> exposure

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
then that would be the regular exposure

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.699 
then that would be the regular exposure
and<00:02:00.099> then<00:02:00.609> the<00:02:00.759> group<00:02:00.969> B<00:02:01.179> would<00:02:01.539> be<00:02:01.689> -<00:02:02.200> exposure

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
and then the group B would be - exposure

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:04.709 
and then the group B would be - exposure
now<00:02:03.099> what's<00:02:03.429> neat<00:02:03.639> about<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.969> Nikon<00:02:04.329> creative

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
now what's neat about the Nikon creative

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.550 
now what's neat about the Nikon creative
system<00:02:05.079> is<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.319> entire<00:02:05.909> chain<00:02:06.909> of<00:02:07.229> all<00:02:08.229> of<00:02:08.470> the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
system is the entire chain of all of the

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.290 
system is the entire chain of all of the
flashes<00:02:09.069> are<00:02:09.280> controlled<00:02:09.849> here<00:02:10.119> at<00:02:10.209> the

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
flashes are controlled here at the

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.610 
flashes are controlled here at the
master<00:02:10.690> unit<00:02:10.929> you<00:02:11.050> don't<00:02:11.200> have<00:02:11.320> to<00:02:11.440> worry

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
master unit you don't have to worry

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.560 
master unit you don't have to worry
about<00:02:11.740> it<00:02:11.980> at<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.160> remote<00:02:12.430> so<00:02:13.180> let's<00:02:13.390> go

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
about it at the remote so let's go

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.790 
about it at the remote so let's go
through<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:13.930> I'll<00:02:13.990> show<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.230> how<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.500> just

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
through and I'll show you how to just

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.490 
through and I'll show you how to just
change<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.340> powers<00:02:15.760> well<00:02:16.300> the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
change the powers well the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.290 
change the powers well the
is<00:02:16.620> how<00:02:17.130> we<00:02:17.190> change<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.700> channels<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.180> the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
is how we change the channels and the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.970 
is how we change the channels and the
channels<00:02:18.720> that's<00:02:19.050> completely<00:02:19.500> up<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.740> you<00:02:19.950> you

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
channels that's completely up to you you

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.440 
channels that's completely up to you you
don't<00:02:20.280> need<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.550> change<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:21.000> if<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.270> don't

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
don't need to change it if you don't

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.500 
don't need to change it if you don't
want<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.780> arm<00:02:22.550> can<00:02:23.550> leave<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.850> on<00:02:23.910> channel<00:02:24.300> one

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
want to arm can leave it on channel one

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.820 
want to arm can leave it on channel one
unless<00:02:24.960> there's<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.230> whole<00:02:25.410> bunch<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.680> other

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
unless there's a whole bunch of other

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.890 
unless there's a whole bunch of other
people<00:02:26.100> around<00:02:26.850> that<00:02:27.300> are<00:02:27.390> shooting<00:02:27.780> on

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
people around that are shooting on

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.360 
people around that are shooting on
channel<00:02:28.260> one<00:02:28.410> that's<00:02:28.710> when<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.040> want<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.280> go

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
channel one that's when you want to go

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.200 
channel one that's when you want to go
to<00:02:29.430> channel<00:02:29.670> two

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
to channel two

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.660 
to channel two
we'll<00:02:30.540> hit<00:02:30.660> select<00:02:30.900> again<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.590> then<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.430> is

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
we'll hit select again and then this is

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.490 
we'll hit select again and then this is
the<00:02:32.850> master<00:02:33.240> unit<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:34.320> can<00:02:34.590> change<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.670> to

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
the master unit and I can change it to

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.070 
the master unit and I can change it to
regular<00:02:37.500> TTL<00:02:38.190> like<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.820> so<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.720> means<00:02:39.900> that

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
regular TTL like that so that means that

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.500 
regular TTL like that so that means that
this<00:02:40.260> guy<00:02:40.410> would<00:02:40.560> actually<00:02:41.130> be<00:02:41.280> on<00:02:41.520> or<00:02:41.940> in

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
this guy would actually be on or in

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.680 
this guy would actually be on or in
manual<00:02:43.050> mode<00:02:43.110> it's<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.800> same<00:02:44.010> thing<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.520> can<00:02:45.030> go

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
manual mode it's the same thing I can go

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.800 
manual mode it's the same thing I can go
to<00:02:45.750> select<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.770> can<00:02:47.010> turn<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.610> off<00:02:47.820> or<00:02:48.150> down

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
to select and I can turn it off or down

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.979 
to select and I can turn it off or down
one<00:02:49.290> twenty<00:02:49.680> eighth<00:02:49.830> of<00:02:50.130> an<00:02:50.250> exposure<00:02:50.700> uh<00:02:51.030> etc

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
one twenty eighth of an exposure uh etc

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.740 
one twenty eighth of an exposure uh etc
but<00:02:52.770> on<00:02:53.010> let's<00:02:53.550> put<00:02:53.760> just<00:02:54.150> for<00:02:54.300> now<00:02:54.420> let's<00:02:54.600> put

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
but on let's put just for now let's put

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.770 
but on let's put just for now let's put
it<00:02:54.870> on<00:02:54.989> TTL<00:02:55.440> so<00:02:56.070> this<00:02:56.310> guy<00:02:56.520> I<00:02:56.820> want<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.300> turn<00:02:57.450> off

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
it on TTL so this guy I want to turn off

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.540 
it on TTL so this guy I want to turn off
so<00:02:58.110> let's<00:02:58.290> review<00:02:58.440> hit<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.890> select<00:02:59.220> the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
so let's review hit the select the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.190 
so let's review hit the select the
select<00:02:59.880> will<00:03:00.120> cycle<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.750> through<00:03:01.020> the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
select will cycle you through the

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.380 
select will cycle you through the
different<00:03:01.530> menu<00:03:01.770> options<00:03:02.090> we're<00:03:03.090> going<00:03:03.300> to

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
different menu options we're going to

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.330 
different menu options we're going to
just<00:03:03.630> instead<00:03:04.080> hit<00:03:04.350> okay<00:03:04.650> we're<00:03:04.890> just<00:03:05.160> going

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
just instead hit okay we're just going

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.100 
just instead hit okay we're just going
to<00:03:05.370> turn<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.760> dial<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.239> we're<00:03:06.660> going<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.870> just

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
to turn the dial and we're going to just

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.000 
to turn the dial and we're going to just
keep<00:03:07.320> going<00:03:07.739> down<00:03:08.010> until<00:03:08.450> it's<00:03:09.450> off<00:03:09.690> okay<00:03:10.350> now

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
keep going down until it's off okay now

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.949 
keep going down until it's off okay now
we'll<00:03:11.370> hit<00:03:11.520> select<00:03:11.760> again<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.570> take<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.870> to

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
we'll hit select again to take it to

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.750 
we'll hit select again to take it to
channel<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.650> that's<00:03:14.130> going<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.400> be<00:03:14.550> at

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
channel a and that's going to be at

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.900 
channel a and that's going to be at
regular<00:03:15.300> TTL<00:03:16.140> exposure<00:03:16.590> channel<00:03:17.130> B<00:03:17.340> we<00:03:17.730> want

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
regular TTL exposure channel B we want

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:18.620 
regular TTL exposure channel B we want
to<00:03:18.030> uh<00:03:18.180> know

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
to uh know

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.630 
to uh know
so<00:03:19.080> we'll<00:03:19.410> just<00:03:19.560> go<00:03:19.709> like<00:03:19.890> that<00:03:21.590> okay<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:22.769> like

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
so we'll just go like that okay so like

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.039 
so we'll just go like that okay so like
that<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.030> then<00:03:24.239> we'll<00:03:24.330> hit<00:03:24.450> select<00:03:24.690> again

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
that and then we'll hit select again

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.860 
that and then we'll hit select again
channel<00:03:25.440> B<00:03:25.760> again<00:03:26.760> we<00:03:26.790> can<00:03:27.120> take<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.540> we<00:03:27.720> can

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
channel B again we can take it we can

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.330 
channel B again we can take it we can
turn<00:03:28.049> channel<00:03:28.620> be<00:03:28.709> off<00:03:28.860> that<00:03:28.890> doesn't<00:03:29.160> make

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
turn channel be off that doesn't make

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.170 
turn channel be off that doesn't make
any<00:03:29.489> sense<00:03:29.580> so<00:03:29.940> we<00:03:30.060> can<00:03:30.180> take<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:30.540> -<00:03:30.750> -<00:03:31.140> or

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
any sense so we can take it - - or

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
any sense so we can take it - - or
overexpose<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:33.420> if<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.600> want<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.840> have<00:03:33.959> say<00:03:34.170> a

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
overexpose so if you want to have say a

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.990 
overexpose so if you want to have say a
hot<00:03:34.470> light<00:03:34.739> that<00:03:34.980> blows<00:03:35.190> out<00:03:35.400> one<00:03:35.610> side<00:03:35.820> you

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
hot light that blows out one side you

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.360 
hot light that blows out one side you
can<00:03:36.030> do<00:03:36.299> that<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.660> then<00:03:37.110> christen<00:03:37.650> that<00:03:37.950> flash

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
can do that and then christen that flash

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.030 
can do that and then christen that flash
as<00:03:38.700> channel<00:03:39.150> B<00:03:39.299> so<00:03:39.989> let's<00:03:40.350> say<00:03:40.470> for<00:03:40.500> example

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
as channel B so let's say for example

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.380 
as channel B so let's say for example
now<00:03:41.250> um<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:42.650> just<00:03:43.650> take<00:03:43.769> it<00:03:43.799> down<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.610> this<00:03:45.269> is

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
now um I just take it down to this is

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.850 
now um I just take it down to this is
sometimes<00:03:45.570> what<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:45.989> do<00:03:46.110> when<00:03:46.290> I'm<00:03:46.410> doing<00:03:46.680> a

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
sometimes what I do when I'm doing a

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.100 
sometimes what I do when I'm doing a
colorful<00:03:47.489> background<00:03:48.209> I'll<00:03:48.630> put<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.810> gel<00:03:49.079> and

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
colorful background I'll put a gel and

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.979 
colorful background I'll put a gel and
give<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.620> -<00:03:49.829> to<00:03:50.100> exposure<00:03:50.459> for<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.820> rear<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:51.690> on

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
give it - to exposure for the rear so on

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.949 
give it - to exposure for the rear so on
your<00:03:52.709> TTL<00:03:53.130> system<00:03:53.700> here<00:03:54.209> I'm<00:03:54.360> going<00:03:54.900> to

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
your TTL system here I'm going to

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.720 
your TTL system here I'm going to
basically<00:03:55.170> take<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:56.130> we're<00:03:56.549> going<00:03:56.700> to

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
basically take it and we're going to

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.670 
basically take it and we're going to
turn<00:03:56.880> in<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.209> into<00:03:57.420> a<00:03:57.450> remote<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:58.380> let's

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
turn in and into a remote so let's

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.199 
turn in and into a remote so let's
pretend<00:03:58.950> that<00:03:59.250> we're<00:03:59.430> going<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.640> turn<00:03:59.820> it<00:03:59.880> into

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
pretend that we're going to turn it into

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.310 
pretend that we're going to turn it into
this<00:04:00.600> flash<00:04:00.959> a<00:04:01.200> at<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:02.420> regular<00:04:03.420> aperture<00:04:04.049> so

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
this flash a at a regular aperture so

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.500 
this flash a at a regular aperture so
I'm<00:04:04.709> going<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:04.920> press<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.280> center<00:04:05.579> indent

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
I'm going to press the center indent

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.750 
I'm going to press the center indent
like<00:04:06.930> that<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.380> I'm<00:04:07.650> which<00:04:08.040> will<00:04:08.250> unlock<00:04:08.400> it

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
like that and I'm which will unlock it

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.180 
like that and I'm which will unlock it
and<00:04:08.910> now<00:04:09.269> it'll<00:04:09.510> turn<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:09.870> into<00:04:10.019> remote<00:04:10.920> mode

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
and now it'll turn it into remote mode

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.850 
and now it'll turn it into remote mode
the<00:04:11.850> only<00:04:12.120> controls<00:04:12.570> on<00:04:12.780> remote<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:13.500> doesn't

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
the only controls on remote it doesn't

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.150 
the only controls on remote it doesn't
matter<00:04:14.010> what<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.370> do<00:04:14.549> a<00:04:14.850> manual<00:04:15.450> TTL<00:04:16.079> +<00:04:16.350> -<00:04:16.799> none

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
matter what you do a manual TTL + - none

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.800 
matter what you do a manual TTL + - none
of<00:04:17.190> this<00:04:17.400> matters<00:04:17.850> on<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.090> remote<00:04:18.450> because

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
of this matters on the remote because

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.780 
of this matters on the remote because
it's<00:04:18.959> all<00:04:19.109> controlled<00:04:19.410> by<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.790> transmitter

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
it's all controlled by the transmitter

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.420 
it's all controlled by the transmitter
the<00:04:21.030> master<00:04:21.419> so<00:04:22.169> we'll<00:04:22.950> hit<00:04:23.040> the<00:04:23.160> select

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
the master so we'll hit the select

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.580 
the master so we'll hit the select
button<00:04:23.580> again<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.270> only<00:04:24.990> thing<00:04:25.169> I<00:04:25.260> can<00:04:25.470> do

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
button again and the only thing I can do

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.610 
button again and the only thing I can do
on<00:04:25.830> remote<00:04:26.400> is<00:04:26.580> to<00:04:27.390> choose<00:04:27.960> between<00:04:28.140> groups

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
on remote is to choose between groups

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.020 
on remote is to choose between groups
now<00:04:28.860> remember<00:04:29.220> that<00:04:29.460> was<00:04:29.669> GRU

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
now remember that was GRU

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.660 
now remember that was GRU
a-and<00:04:30.570> where<00:04:31.440> we<00:04:31.710> were<00:04:31.860> on<00:04:31.950> channel<00:04:32.370> one<00:04:32.520> you

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
a-and where we were on channel one you

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.250 
a-and where we were on channel one you
got<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:32.940> make<00:04:33.060> sure<00:04:33.210> that<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.510> channels<00:04:33.930> match

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
got to make sure that the channels match

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.950 
got to make sure that the channels match
and<00:04:34.620> then<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.730> groups<00:04:36.000> are<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.660> ones<00:04:36.810> that

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
and then the groups are the ones that

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.600 
and then the groups are the ones that
you<00:04:37.020> want<00:04:37.230> if<00:04:37.410> I<00:04:37.620> wanted<00:04:37.860> to<00:04:37.920> do<00:04:38.100> though<00:04:38.250> if<00:04:38.490> I

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
you want if I wanted to do though if I

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.000 
you want if I wanted to do though if I
wanted<00:04:38.940> this<00:04:39.150> flash<00:04:39.420> to<00:04:39.690> be<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:39.960> -2<00:04:40.500> exposure

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
wanted this flash to be the -2 exposure

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.280 
wanted this flash to be the -2 exposure
just<00:04:41.700> simply<00:04:42.000> go<00:04:42.120> like<00:04:42.270> that<00:04:42.480> and<00:04:42.720> put<00:04:43.080> it<00:04:43.110> on

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
just simply go like that and put it on

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.860 
just simply go like that and put it on
channel<00:04:43.680> B<00:04:43.830> hit<00:04:44.430> okay<00:04:44.790> and<00:04:44.970> now<00:04:45.060> this<00:04:45.630> one

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
channel B hit okay and now this one

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.900 
channel B hit okay and now this one
would<00:04:46.020> be<00:04:46.050> -2<00:04:46.620> exposure<00:04:47.250> you<00:04:47.460> know<00:04:47.610> you<00:04:47.670> would

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
would be -2 exposure you know you would

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.210 
would be -2 exposure you know you would
never<00:04:48.150> know<00:04:48.450> it<00:04:48.630> what<00:04:49.560> this<00:04:49.710> one's<00:04:49.920> going<00:04:50.130> to

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
never know it what this one's going to

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.830 
never know it what this one's going to
do<00:04:50.430> from<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.510> unit<00:04:52.440> itself<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:52.920> have<00:04:53.070> to<00:04:53.400> go

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
do from the unit itself you have to go

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.360 
do from the unit itself you have to go
consult<00:04:54.840> the<00:04:55.050> master<00:04:55.590> transmitting<00:04:56.250> unit

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
consult the master transmitting unit

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.580 
consult the master transmitting unit
because<00:04:57.180> that's<00:04:57.360> going<00:04:57.570> to<00:04:57.660> take<00:04:58.290> control

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
because that's going to take control

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.250 
because that's going to take control
over<00:04:58.980> all<00:04:59.220> of<00:04:59.400> these<00:04:59.520> now<00:04:59.730> again<00:05:00.000> this<00:05:00.810> system

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
over all of these now again this system

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.280 
over all of these now again this system
here<00:05:01.860> that<00:05:01.890> you're<00:05:02.190> seeing<00:05:02.550> is<00:05:02.820> used<00:05:03.690> only<00:05:03.930> for

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
here that you're seeing is used only for

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.550 
here that you're seeing is used only for
the<00:05:05.330> line<00:05:06.330> of<00:05:06.360> sight<00:05:06.750> which<00:05:07.020> means<00:05:07.320> that<00:05:07.470> the

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
the line of sight which means that the

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.430 
the line of sight which means that the
red<00:05:07.740> panels<00:05:08.160> all<00:05:08.400> have<00:05:08.640> to<00:05:08.760> see<00:05:08.940> each<00:05:08.970> other

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
red panels all have to see each other

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.220 
red panels all have to see each other
and<00:05:10.440> that's<00:05:10.710> typically<00:05:11.190> used<00:05:11.220> indoors<00:05:11.940> or<00:05:12.240> on

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
and that's typically used indoors or on

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.510 
and that's typically used indoors or on
the<00:05:13.440> radio<00:05:13.560> popper<00:05:14.160> or<00:05:16.160> because<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.280> radio

the radio popper or because the radio
popper<00:05:17.730> will<00:05:17.940> take<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.300> infrared<00:05:18.840> system<00:05:19.650> and

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
popper will take the infrared system and

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.070 
popper will take the infrared system and
turned<00:05:20.010> it<00:05:20.130> into<00:05:20.220> radio<00:05:20.790> this<00:05:21.510> type<00:05:21.810> of<00:05:21.840> a

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
system here is not needed if you're

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.050 
system here is not needed if you're
using<00:05:24.600> something<00:05:25.020> like<00:05:25.169> the<00:05:25.500> phottix<00:05:25.950> ah<00:05:26.190> a

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
using something like the phottix ah a

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.690 
using something like the phottix ah a
tripper<00:05:27.840> which<00:05:28.200> is<00:05:28.350> a<00:05:28.380> bit<00:05:29.070> simpler<00:05:29.460> but

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
tripper which is a bit simpler but
