00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.950
 our program is neighbor how are you 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.250
 I'm already happy because when people 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.020
 not an answer from you when 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.750
 they write stirrups that they want to know 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.130
 where can you study with you 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.869
 there is a mention of good cheer you know 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.760
 I say it for the camera as I say before 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.710
 the camera our goal really that 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.529
 Valuable people are known as 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.090
 you guys kind of wrote us a lot 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.379
 because your techniques are multiple and today 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.140
 they surprise us with this that we are 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:40.050
 looking at the recycled table a small table 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.150
 recycled a teapot sports cover 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.690
 up here all this and a picture all 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.089
 that 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.070
 all this with margaritas a is your thing 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.769
 the good months that we have worked in 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.229
 tub of plants thank you good today we're going 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.420
 to use a round brush unlike 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:57.030
 what we used to deal with their 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.159
 arredondo is not necessary also as 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.360
 in the fatto brush that has been good and 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.850
 good bounce 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.560
 the daisy that I 'm going to teach you 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.720
 it's the traditional daisy the daisy 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.670
 they teach everywhere because the 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.830
 daisy as we say is done with a 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.410
 I'm going to make one today with 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.390
 triple charge because I love how 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.940
 they give the colors as they melt 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.330
 the colors and how easily with this 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.240
 brush the face is this way clear 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.810
 on one side a light color on the other side 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.060
 the other color and at the tip I will load 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.550
 the third color well charged does not 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.420
 matter that it is as if enchastrado I am going to 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:40.660
 make the petals first and from the side 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.470
 and the way it is so I support the brush what 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.470
 I'm going to press 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.040
 and I will go lift that is the first 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.530
 petal all the petals of the 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:57.620
 Daisies are following the same way 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:01.160
 I bet trouble and I raise 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:05.170
 then I'll be in the petal of bass 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:08.740
 I support squeeze and I raise I'm going to renew 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.620
 only the color of the tip 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.290
 they will see that the petal above is more 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.400
 short than the other three so that it is 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.460
 the daisy in perspective support 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.600
 I squeeze and I lift having these go to 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.800
 be the guide petals 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.530
 I'm going to put between each one of these 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.910
 to go adding 2 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.910
 1 and 2 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.740
 1 and those always renewing only the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.840
 color of light the color that I have in the 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.510
 tip of the brush 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:50.530
 I have to facilitate that of the daisy 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.530
 for the center I will be dots 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.040
 the little dots 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.770
 and to give it a little shade 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.640
 petal and that is not flat I will 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.650
 shade with the darkest color good 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.209
 the image well I sell cute that is founded 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.489
 in the three colors with the triple charge 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.530
 I also want you to compare the daisy 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.330
 in the teapot and the box to see 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.450
 as from the different colors 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.819
 that we use, we give different styles 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.430
 in the decoration good took advantage also 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.050

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.180
