it was really low too if so i put a

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.460 
it was really low too if so i put a
cinder<00:04:05.930> blocks<00:04:06.230> but<00:04:07.190> ice<00:04:07.489> I<00:04:07.970> up<00:04:08.570> into<00:04:09.049> this

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
cinder blocks but ice I up into this

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.850 
cinder blocks but ice I up into this
it's<00:04:10.190> a<00:04:11.560> right<00:04:12.560> here

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
it's a right here

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.479 
it's a right here
it's<00:04:14.860> a<00:04:15.070> CF<00:04:15.580> 500<00:04:16.570> from<00:04:16.720> Odyssey<00:04:17.140> it's<00:04:18.070> really

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
it's a CF 500 from Odyssey it's really

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.870 
it's a CF 500 from Odyssey it's really
strong<00:04:18.970> it's<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.799> 500<00:04:20.799> gallons<00:04:21.190> per<00:04:21.400> hour<00:04:21.489> I

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
strong it's a 500 gallons per hour I

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.190 
strong it's a 500 gallons per hour I
mean<00:04:22.120> I<00:04:22.240> don't<00:04:22.420> know<00:04:22.480> how<00:04:22.600> accurate<00:04:23.050> that<00:04:23.080> is

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
mean I don't know how accurate that is

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.410 
mean I don't know how accurate that is
but<00:04:23.560> if<00:04:23.800> this<00:04:24.040> thing<00:04:24.250> is<00:04:24.370> seriously<00:04:24.670> I<00:04:25.000> just

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
but if this thing is seriously I just

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.140 
but if this thing is seriously I just
look<00:04:26.380> at<00:04:26.500> it<00:04:26.530> blow<00:04:26.860> though<00:04:27.100> that<00:04:27.490> grass<00:04:27.760> around

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
look at it blow though that grass around

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.320 
look at it blow though that grass around
just<00:04:28.450> and<00:04:28.860> I<00:04:29.860> use<00:04:30.070> that<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.490> have<00:04:30.850> the<00:04:31.000> bubbles

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
just and I use that to have the bubbles

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.410 
just and I use that to have the bubbles
just<00:04:31.660> flow<00:04:32.880> throughout<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:33.940> tank<00:04:34.240> so<00:04:34.330> that

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
just flow throughout the tank so that

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.600 
just flow throughout the tank so that
way<00:04:34.630> you<00:04:34.690> can<00:04:34.950> absorb<00:04:35.950> into<00:04:36.100> the<00:04:36.190> water<00:04:36.430> as

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
way you can absorb into the water as

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.490 
way you can absorb into the water as
much<00:04:36.790> as<00:04:36.910> possible<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:39.480> yeah<00:04:40.480> I<00:04:40.510> got<00:04:40.870> betas

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
much as possible and yeah I got betas
