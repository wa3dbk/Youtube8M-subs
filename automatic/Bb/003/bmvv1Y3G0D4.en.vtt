rocket<00:00:08.780> science<00:00:08.960> is<00:00:09.290> simple<00:00:09.679> it<00:00:10.550> starts<00:00:11.000> off

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
rocket science is simple it starts off

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.540 
rocket science is simple it starts off
with<00:00:11.179> recognition<00:00:11.840> that<00:00:12.290> in<00:00:12.710> the<00:00:13.010> universe

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:13.550 
with recognition that in the universe

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.900 
with recognition that in the universe
there<00:00:14.150> are<00:00:14.300> some<00:00:14.600> things<00:00:14.900> that<00:00:15.320> never<00:00:15.530> change

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
there are some things that never change

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.179 
there are some things that never change
once<00:00:16.910> this<00:00:17.060> thing<00:00:17.330> is<00:00:17.359> momentum<00:00:18.050> the<00:00:18.679> product

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
once this thing is momentum the product

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.660 
once this thing is momentum the product
of<00:00:19.310> mass<00:00:19.670> and<00:00:19.699> velocity<00:00:20.210> of<00:00:20.690> an<00:00:20.900> object

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
of mass and velocity of an object

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.109 
of mass and velocity of an object
consider<00:00:22.670> this

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
consider this

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.750 
consider this
imagine<00:00:23.900> you<00:00:24.050> are<00:00:24.080> a<00:00:24.199> cart<00:00:24.619> on<00:00:24.770> wheels<00:00:24.800> you

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
imagine you are a cart on wheels you

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.880 
imagine you are a cart on wheels you
have<00:00:25.789> lots<00:00:26.060> of<00:00:26.210> bricks<00:00:26.510> in<00:00:26.690> your<00:00:26.810> cart<00:00:27.080> then

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
have lots of bricks in your cart then

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.500 
have lots of bricks in your cart then
you<00:00:28.010> start<00:00:28.250> throwing<00:00:28.460> bricks<00:00:28.880> out<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:29.240> cart

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
you start throwing bricks out the cart

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.720 
you start throwing bricks out the cart
one<00:00:29.930> brick<00:00:30.170> at<00:00:30.260> a<00:00:30.320> time<00:00:30.410> you<00:00:31.100> can<00:00:31.130> throw<00:00:31.430> big

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
one brick at a time you can throw big

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.160 
one brick at a time you can throw big
breaks<00:00:32.059> you<00:00:32.149> can<00:00:32.270> throw<00:00:32.419> a<00:00:32.449> small<00:00:32.719> bricks<00:00:33.050> you

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
breaks you can throw a small bricks you

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.720 
breaks you can throw a small bricks you
can<00:00:33.289> throw<00:00:33.410> them<00:00:33.530> fast<00:00:33.859> and<00:00:34.160> throw<00:00:34.280> them<00:00:34.430> slow

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
can throw them fast and throw them slow

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.420 
can throw them fast and throw them slow
but<00:00:35.539> here's<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:35.809> thing<00:00:35.920> you<00:00:36.920> are<00:00:37.070> gonna<00:00:37.250> give

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
but here's the thing you are gonna give

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.100 
but here's the thing you are gonna give
momentum<00:00:37.640> to<00:00:38.059> the<00:00:38.149> bricks<00:00:38.450> going<00:00:38.720> this<00:00:38.899> way

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
momentum to the bricks going this way

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.840 
momentum to the bricks going this way
and<00:00:39.380> that<00:00:39.829> means<00:00:40.100> that<00:00:40.250> you're<00:00:40.430> gonna<00:00:40.489> get<00:00:40.700> the

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
and that means that you're gonna get the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.180 
and that means that you're gonna get the
exact<00:00:41.329> opposite<00:00:42.140> momentum<00:00:42.620> in<00:00:42.739> the<00:00:42.829> other<00:00:42.950> way

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
exact opposite momentum in the other way

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.209 
exact opposite momentum in the other way
because<00:00:43.430> one<00:00:44.390> time<00:00:44.570> never<00:00:44.750> changes<00:00:45.260> a<00:00:45.440> rocket

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
because one time never changes a rocket

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:47.440 
because one time never changes a rocket
like<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:46.579> one<00:00:46.730> that<00:00:46.880> took<00:00:47.059> people<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:47.360> the

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
like the one that took people to the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.869 
like the one that took people to the
moon<00:00:47.660> or<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:48.530> Space<00:00:48.739> Shuttle<00:00:48.770> it's<00:00:49.399> just<00:00:49.700> like

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
moon or the Space Shuttle it's just like

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.080 
moon or the Space Shuttle it's just like
that<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:51.230> only<00:00:51.559> question<00:00:51.980> is<00:00:52.129> what<00:00:52.820> are<00:00:53.000> you

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
that the only question is what are you

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.209 
that the only question is what are you
gonna<00:00:53.300> throw<00:00:53.390> out<00:00:53.780> and<00:00:53.989> how<00:00:54.559> do<00:00:54.620> you<00:00:54.829> have<00:00:55.100> the

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
gonna throw out and how do you have the

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.220 
gonna throw out and how do you have the
energy<00:00:55.370> to<00:00:55.610> throw<00:00:55.879> it<00:00:56.000> out<00:00:56.120> in<00:00:56.750> a<00:00:56.870> chemical

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
energy to throw it out in a chemical

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.740 
energy to throw it out in a chemical
rocket<00:00:57.379> what<00:00:58.160> you<00:00:58.309> throw<00:00:58.550> out<00:00:58.820> is<00:00:59.120> a<00:00:59.329> burnt

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
rocket what you throw out is a burnt

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.700 
rocket what you throw out is a burnt
mixture<00:01:00.350> of<00:01:00.559> fuel<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:01.640> oxygen<00:01:02.090> and<00:01:02.420> how<00:01:03.079> you

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
mixture of fuel and oxygen and how you

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.679 
mixture of fuel and oxygen and how you
get<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.009> energy<00:01:04.159> to<00:01:04.369> throw<00:01:04.640> it<00:01:04.759> out<00:01:04.909> comes

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
get the energy to throw it out comes

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.279 
get the energy to throw it out comes
from<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:07.039> chemical<00:01:07.490> bonds<00:01:07.880> think<00:01:08.630> of<00:01:08.749> atoms

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
from the chemical bonds think of atoms

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.559 
from the chemical bonds think of atoms
as<00:01:09.499> being<00:01:10.100> balls<00:01:10.459> that<00:01:10.700> are<00:01:10.819> kind<00:01:11.090> of<00:01:11.119> a<00:01:11.240> 3d

00:01:11.559 --> 00:01:11.569 
as being balls that are kind of a 3d

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:14.139 
as being balls that are kind of a 3d
thought<00:01:12.020> elastic<00:01:12.529> Springs<00:01:12.889> when<00:01:13.759> you<00:01:13.880> cut

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
thought elastic Springs when you cut

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.239 
thought elastic Springs when you cut
that<00:01:14.359> elastic<00:01:14.899> these<00:01:15.289> balls<00:01:15.619> are<00:01:15.799> gonna<00:01:15.889> fly

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:16.249 
that elastic these balls are gonna fly

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:18.039 
that elastic these balls are gonna fly
around<00:01:16.399> all<00:01:16.789> over<00:01:16.819> the<00:01:17.119> place<00:01:17.149> and<00:01:17.630> that's

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
around all over the place and that's

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.529 
around all over the place and that's
what<00:01:18.200> we<00:01:18.319> call<00:01:18.499> this<00:01:18.649> temperature<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:20.270> when

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
what we call this temperature so when

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.599 
what we call this temperature so when
you<00:01:20.630> cut<00:01:20.840> those<00:01:21.049> bonds<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.649> whole<00:01:21.859> gas<00:01:22.189> heats

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:22.609 
you cut those bonds the whole gas heats

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:26.379 
you cut those bonds the whole gas heats
up<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.359> the<00:01:24.079> heated<00:01:24.409> gas<00:01:24.649> expands<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:26.119> this<00:01:26.270> is

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:26.389 
up and the heated gas expands so this is

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:28.449 
up and the heated gas expands so this is
what<00:01:26.630> you<00:01:26.749> see<00:01:26.990> in<00:01:27.109> your<00:01:27.229> car<00:01:27.499> engine<00:01:27.920> disease

00:01:28.449 --> 00:01:28.459 
what you see in your car engine disease

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:30.129 
what you see in your car engine disease
is<00:01:28.579> heinous<00:01:28.909> -<00:01:29.149> and<00:01:29.359> that's<00:01:29.719> what<00:01:29.869> you<00:01:29.990> see<00:01:30.109> in

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:30.139 
is heinous - and that's what you see in

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:32.589 
is heinous - and that's what you see in
a<00:01:30.289> bomb<00:01:30.499> a<00:01:30.770> rocket<00:01:31.369> is<00:01:31.459> just<00:01:31.700> like<00:01:31.819> a<00:01:31.849> bomb<00:01:32.119> but

00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:32.599 
a bomb a rocket is just like a bomb but

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:35.199 
a bomb a rocket is just like a bomb but
with<00:01:32.749> a<00:01:32.779> hole<00:01:33.020> in<00:01:33.139> the<00:01:33.229> back<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:34.189> only<00:01:34.369> job<00:01:34.880> of

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:35.209 
with a hole in the back the only job of

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:37.989 
with a hole in the back the only job of
a<00:01:35.479> rocket<00:01:35.689> designer<00:01:36.229> is<00:01:36.679> to<00:01:36.979> design<00:01:37.609> the<00:01:37.789> right

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:37.999 
a rocket designer is to design the right

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:41.260 
a rocket designer is to design the right
hole<00:01:38.479> so<00:01:39.380> how<00:01:39.770> are<00:01:40.099> you<00:01:40.219> gonna<00:01:40.369> design<00:01:40.819> a<00:01:40.880> hole

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
hole so how are you gonna design a hole

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.690 
hole so how are you gonna design a hole
for<00:01:41.599> this<00:01:41.689> expanding<00:01:42.289> gas<00:01:42.499> the<00:01:42.889> expanding<00:01:43.490> gas

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
for this expanding gas the expanding gas

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.749 
for this expanding gas the expanding gas
shoots<00:01:44.359> out<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:44.599> back<00:01:44.779> like<00:01:45.469> a<00:01:45.499> jet<00:01:45.859> now<00:01:46.429> this

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
shoots out the back like a jet now this

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.059 
shoots out the back like a jet now this
jet<00:01:47.119> for<00:01:47.569> a<00:01:47.599> rocket<00:01:48.020> engine<00:01:48.289> can<00:01:48.469> be<00:01:48.499> as<00:01:48.770> fast

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
jet for a rocket engine can be as fast

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:50.739 
jet for a rocket engine can be as fast
as<00:01:49.219> two<00:01:49.429> or<00:01:49.520> three<00:01:49.549> months<00:01:50.090> per<00:01:50.239> second<00:01:50.659> or

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
as two or three months per second or

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:53.379 
as two or three months per second or
10,000<00:01:51.319> miles<00:01:51.499> an<00:01:51.679> hour<00:01:51.859> that's<00:01:52.429> fast<00:01:52.999> but

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:53.389 
10,000 miles an hour that's fast but

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:56.169 
10,000 miles an hour that's fast but
that's<00:01:54.229> not<00:01:54.439> fast<00:01:54.770> enough<00:01:54.889> if<00:01:55.579> we<00:01:55.789> want<00:01:55.969> to<00:01:56.060> go

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
that's not fast enough if we want to go

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.239 
that's not fast enough if we want to go
to<00:01:56.239> destinations<00:01:56.929> like<00:01:57.020> Mars<00:01:57.200> we<00:01:58.069> need

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:58.249 
to destinations like Mars we need

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:59.830 
to destinations like Mars we need
rockets<00:01:58.789> that<00:01:58.849> shoot<00:01:59.149> things<00:01:59.389> out<00:01:59.539> the<00:01:59.689> back

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
rockets that shoot things out the back

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.510 
rockets that shoot things out the back
much<00:02:00.409> much<00:02:01.039> faster<00:02:01.399> and<00:02:02.259> that<00:02:03.259> brings<00:02:03.919> us<00:02:04.159> to

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
much much faster and that brings us to

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.469 
much much faster and that brings us to
the<00:02:04.639> need<00:02:04.880> for<00:02:05.149> plasma<00:02:05.809> rockets
