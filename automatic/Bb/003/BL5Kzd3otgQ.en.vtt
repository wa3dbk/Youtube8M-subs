right<00:02:02.680> so<00:02:02.950> when<00:02:03.159> I<00:02:03.190> pull<00:02:03.430> it<00:02:03.490> out<00:02:03.640> this<00:02:04.180> is<00:02:04.330> how

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
right so when I pull it out this is how

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.660 
right so when I pull it out this is how
you<00:02:04.510> see<00:02:04.750> it's<00:02:04.960> like<00:02:05.080> a<00:02:05.159> little<00:02:06.159> house<00:02:06.369> where

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
you see it's like a little house where

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.460 
you see it's like a little house where
the<00:02:06.790> blow-off<00:02:07.000> valve<00:02:07.300> this<00:02:08.050> is<00:02:08.229> what<00:02:08.350> they

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
the blow-off valve this is what they

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.290 
the blow-off valve this is what they
package<00:02:08.800> it<00:02:08.890> in<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.340> then<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.729> course<00:02:09.970> it's<00:02:10.209> a

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
package it in and then of course it's a

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.790 
package it in and then of course it's a
box<00:02:10.509> you<00:02:10.660> still<00:02:10.869> have<00:02:11.020> your<00:02:11.170> bottom<00:02:11.650> layer

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
box you still have your bottom layer

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.650 
box you still have your bottom layer
foam<00:02:12.100> so<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.310> mean<00:02:12.459> this<00:02:12.550> has<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.819> lot<00:02:13.270> of<00:02:13.300> foam

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
foam so I mean this has a lot of foam

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.000 
foam so I mean this has a lot of foam
surrounding<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.650> one<00:02:14.800> thing<00:02:14.920> I

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
surrounding it and this is one thing I

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.460 
surrounding it and this is one thing I
really<00:02:15.280> like<00:02:15.430> about<00:02:15.459> it<00:02:15.880> is<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:16.870> know<00:02:17.290> that

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
really like about it is you know that

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.570 
really like about it is you know that
it's<00:02:17.620> not<00:02:17.680> going<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.010> get<00:02:18.130> damaged<00:02:18.459> in

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
it's not going to get damaged in

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.190 
it's not going to get damaged in
shipping<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:19.030> know<00:02:19.180> when<00:02:19.510> how<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.020> leaves

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
shipping you know when how it leaves

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.540 
shipping you know when how it leaves
from<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.440> factory<00:02:20.770> is<00:02:20.830> exactly<00:02:21.220> how<00:02:21.400> you're

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
from the factory is exactly how you're

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.040 
from the factory is exactly how you're
going<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.730> get<00:02:21.880> it<00:02:22.030> at<00:02:22.180> home<00:02:22.330> because<00:02:22.540> it's<00:02:22.870> not

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
going to get it at home because it's not

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.570 
going to get it at home because it's not
it's<00:02:23.470> not<00:02:23.590> able<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:23.890> move<00:02:24.010> around<00:02:24.250> or<00:02:24.430> anything

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
it's not able to move around or anything

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.250 
it's not able to move around or anything
like<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:25.390> other<00:02:25.510> parts<00:02:25.840> are<00:02:25.959> bumping

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
like that and other parts are bumping

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.110 
like that and other parts are bumping
into<00:02:26.380> each<00:02:26.470> other<00:02:26.709> so<00:02:27.640> let's<00:02:27.790> go<00:02:27.880> ahead<00:02:28.030> and

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
into each other so let's go ahead and

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.650 
into each other so let's go ahead and
take<00:02:28.239> this<00:02:28.330> out<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.690> foam<00:02:30.000> all<00:02:31.000> right<00:02:31.269> so

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
take this out of the foam all right so

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.900 
take this out of the foam all right so
this<00:02:32.230> is<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.560> right<00:02:32.590> here<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.160> can<00:02:33.640> see<00:02:33.670> the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
this is it right here you can see the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.630 
this is it right here you can see the
blues<00:02:34.090> blue<00:02:34.600> anodized<00:02:34.989> head<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.980> then<00:02:36.519> it

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
blues blue anodized head and then it

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.920 
blues blue anodized head and then it
does<00:02:36.760> have<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.970> nice<00:02:37.959> shine<00:02:39.120> or<00:02:40.120> polish<00:02:40.570> on<00:02:40.780> it

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
does have a nice shine or polish on it

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.440 
does have a nice shine or polish on it
on<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.440> body<00:02:41.650> itself<00:02:42.040> all<00:02:42.940> right<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.269> I<00:02:43.300> want

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
on the body itself all right and I want

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.350 
on the body itself all right and I want
to<00:02:43.570> show<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.720> guys<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:44.200> nice<00:02:45.060> close-up<00:02:46.060> view<00:02:46.330> of

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
to show you guys a nice close-up view of

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:55.280 
to show you guys a nice close-up view of
this<00:02:46.630> see<00:02:47.230> if<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.350> can<00:02:47.500> get<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.670> 360-degree<00:02:48.670> view

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.880 

all<00:02:56.290> right<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:57.040> some<00:02:57.910> features<00:02:58.239> on<00:02:58.390> this

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
all right so some features on this

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.690 
all right so some features on this
something<00:02:59.890> you<00:02:59.950> don't<00:03:00.100> want<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.280> notice<00:03:00.549> are

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
something you don't want to notice are

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.300 
something you don't want to notice are
the<00:03:01.120> dual<00:03:02.049> ports<00:03:02.410> man<00:03:02.829> that's<00:03:03.010> why<00:03:03.070> they<00:03:03.190> call

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
the dual ports man that's why they call

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.130 
the dual ports man that's why they call
this<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.489> dual<00:03:03.700> port<00:03:03.850> blow-off<00:03:04.120> out<00:03:04.360> this<00:03:04.959> one

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
this the dual port blow-off out this one

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.870 
this the dual port blow-off out this one
is<00:03:05.260> going<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.500> recirculate<00:03:06.220> back<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.760> your

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
is going to recirculate back to your

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.660 
is going to recirculate back to your
intake<00:03:07.660> this<00:03:08.440> one's<00:03:08.650> going<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:08.920> vent<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.400> the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
intake this one's going to vent to the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.670 
intake this one's going to vent to the
atmosphere<00:03:10.120> it's<00:03:10.840> kind<00:03:11.049> of<00:03:11.140> hard<00:03:11.350> to<00:03:11.410> see

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
atmosphere it's kind of hard to see

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.100 
atmosphere it's kind of hard to see
without<00:03:11.890> actually<00:03:12.370> looking<00:03:12.670> at<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:12.940> but<00:03:13.930> the

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
without actually looking at it but the

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.170 
without actually looking at it but the
port<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:15.160> vents<00:03:15.489> back<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.910> intake

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
port that vents back to the intake

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.550 
port that vents back to the intake
actually<00:03:16.630> sits<00:03:16.900> lower<00:03:17.200> so<00:03:17.920> we'll<00:03:18.100> open<00:03:18.280> first

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
actually sits lower so we'll open first

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.199 
actually sits lower so we'll open first
compared<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.890> atmospheric<00:03:21.820> ports<00:03:22.090> which

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
compared to the atmospheric ports which

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.430 
compared to the atmospheric ports which
sits<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.540> little<00:03:22.660> bit<00:03:22.810> higher<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.380> that's

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
sits a little bit higher and that's

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.319 
sits a little bit higher and that's
going<00:03:23.739> to<00:03:23.799> open<00:03:23.890> second<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:24.549> what<00:03:24.970> that<00:03:25.090> means

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
going to open second so what that means

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.080 
going to open second so what that means
is<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:25.630> lower<00:03:25.840> boost<00:03:26.230> pretty<00:03:27.220> much<00:03:27.370> 100%<00:03:27.760> of

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
is that lower boost pretty much 100% of

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.340 
is that lower boost pretty much 100% of
its<00:03:28.239> going<00:03:28.420> to<00:03:28.480> be<00:03:28.570> researched<00:03:29.019> it's<00:03:29.140> going<00:03:29.260> to

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
its going to be researched it's going to

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.580 
its going to be researched it's going to
go<00:03:29.440> back<00:03:30.329> go<00:03:31.329> back<00:03:31.360> into<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.810> intake<00:03:32.049> but<00:03:32.530> a

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
go back go back into the intake but a

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.350 
go back go back into the intake but a
higher<00:03:32.829> boost<00:03:33.070> I<00:03:33.280> should<00:03:33.430> say<00:03:33.519> like<00:03:33.549> max<00:03:33.910> stock

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
higher boost I should say like max stock

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.630 
higher boost I should say like max stock
boost<00:03:34.630> levels<00:03:34.930> that<00:03:35.019> say<00:03:35.230> above<00:03:35.470> 10<00:03:35.769> you'll

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
boost levels that say above 10 you'll

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.009 
boost levels that say above 10 you'll
actually<00:03:36.820> be<00:03:37.000> able<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.239> open<00:03:37.570> up<00:03:37.690> this

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
actually be able to open up this

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.690 
actually be able to open up this
atmospheric<00:03:38.560> port<00:03:38.799> so<00:03:38.859> you're<00:03:38.980> gonna<00:03:39.070> hear<00:03:39.519> a

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
atmospheric port so you're gonna hear a

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.580 
atmospheric port so you're gonna hear a
lot<00:03:39.790> more<00:03:40.209> of<00:03:40.299> the<00:03:40.420> valve<00:03:40.600> and<00:03:41.320> that's<00:03:41.440> what

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
lot more of the valve and that's what

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.050 
lot more of the valve and that's what
makes<00:03:41.739> these<00:03:41.920> valves<00:03:42.220> so<00:03:42.340> great<00:03:42.670> is<00:03:42.880> that<00:03:42.910> you

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
makes these valves so great is that you

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.810 
makes these valves so great is that you
get<00:03:43.420> your<00:03:44.170> air<00:03:44.859> returning<00:03:45.370> back<00:03:45.519> to<00:03:45.549> the

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
times atmospheric valves we see stalling

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.680 
times atmospheric valves we see stalling
issues<00:03:51.549> idling<00:03:51.940> issues<00:03:52.180> that<00:03:52.299> kind<00:03:52.480> of<00:03:52.570> thing

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
issues idling issues that kind of thing

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
then of course with the atmospheric side

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.620 
then of course with the atmospheric side
you<00:03:57.160> get<00:03:57.280> also<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:57.850> added<00:03:58.000> benefit<00:03:58.420> of<00:03:58.510> the
