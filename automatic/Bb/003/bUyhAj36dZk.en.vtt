00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.040
 I had a tutorial last time 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.300
 on the bicarbonate cleaning 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.150
 Sodium I said I would do a tutorial 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.489
 today on oil cleaning 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.340
 on sounds so old parts 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:43.180
 so these are the useful things we need 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:47.980
 it 's old pieces a brush to 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:50.380
 teeth a sopalin to inspire luynes of 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.390
 the moon or less something beneath 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.230
 you know an apron for for easter 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.890
 and then pour it all over a glass of 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.910
 olive oil so olive oil 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.079
 listen I did in real time so me 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.270
 I took the commercial olive oil 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.800
 of fairly good quality a when when 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.960
 same but so here is a good 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.180
 quality and then there then olive oil 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.750
 1 try an extra olive oil you have 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.690
 cold what's it so we'll try I 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.560
 do not know a piece this one I do not know 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.100
 I do not like what it is 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.220
 is a little bit 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:31.500
 So here is a piece 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.540
 bronze it's a felt put 110 and me 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.020
 felt 6 me that's it so it's 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.490
 bronze 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.900
 so I have to go slowly I took 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.390
 a soft toothbrush okay 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.400
 for seven years or more and more brands 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.189
 oulala I did not show any brand 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.360
 but well so very well we go there so we 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.360
 put a little bit in the oil 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:04.490
 little bubbles that goes up that's 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:05.270
 I took a fork in 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.830
 plastic 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.479
 so why this to recover the 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.479
 money here are the two teeth 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.020
 here we are going to rub 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.990
 must go slowly otherwise it's yeah 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.880
 otherwise it mocks the patina yeah 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.160
 watch out you'll have to go 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.510
 slowly 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:46.970
 go slow on the other hand 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.170
 interesting that it works in his 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.170
 disappears it's very interesting 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.310
 I advise you to go there you know 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.900
 really a toothbrush not with 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.840
 walking but really flat you 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.920
 know flat and then do it all 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:14.900
 really flat what the 2nd borsa the 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.420
 tooth map lavaud there and it's really the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.620
 better 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.510
 well it's not bad I stopped 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.970
 the anxiety is nice so I took the 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.610
 sopalin I put a foot on the 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.110
 heating price of choplin the sopalin 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.880
 salty think you have one in general 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.850
 that can it scratch the room so 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.610
 just I hold it I just hold it for 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.840
 quickly remove oil and then I made 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.850
 take my famous microfiber cloth 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.080
 here I remember I had not a 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:47.290
