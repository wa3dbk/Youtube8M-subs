00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.899
 out of the core 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.510
 toyota made courageous choices in 1996 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.340
 put the first car on sale 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.679
 hybrid driven by an electric motor 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.570
 coupled with a petrol one that is 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.180
 become a status symbol of the rich 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.730
 Londoners and Hollywood stars 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.740
 today it uses the same technology but 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.189
 even more innovative than savings 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.859
 evolved for the prius plus a family member 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.060
 a 7- seater is a machine that does not pass 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.619
 unnoticed 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.230
 simply because it sports a look 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.690
 very original not only designed 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.899
 for pleasure but to be a winner 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.610
 in terms of aerodynamics, the cx 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.800
 ie the penetration coefficient 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.079
 equal to 0.28 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.140
 is a result that pays in terms of 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.050
 very low consumption consumptions we speak 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.350
 themes combined cycle around 24 km 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.360
 liter 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.180
 and we are talking about an extra car already 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.949
 generous dimensions and all this with 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.370
 a comfort a quieter ride 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.530
 really a show the space inside 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.310
 it is so if we consider that the seven 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.330
 seats are set in a long car 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.520
 461 cm with 278 of pace to live 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.130
 the passenger compartment was best chosen 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.770
 the modularity of the seats of the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.360
 third row they are foldable and disappear 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.250
 with ease 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.280
 likewise happens for those of the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.670
 second that if they are knocked down they transform the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.180
 prius plus in a kind of tir in 7 yes 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.079
 has 232 liters of load in two 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.020
 stowage increases to 1,750 on four 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.049
 petrol cylinders delivers 99 horses 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.270
 the electric motor 82 and the pair comes 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.909
 transferred to the front wheels by a 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.680
 automatic transmission with continuous variation 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.960
 a solution that invites those who are at 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.540
 steering wheel to seek the satisfactions that 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.290
 derive from a fluid anti-stress guide 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.670
 the maximum speed is 165 then and lo 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.950
 shooting from 0 to 100 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.149
 it is done in 11.3 seconds on prius there is everything 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.910
 touch screen navigator and roof 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.810
 panoramic hi fi system and head up 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.180
 display 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.310
 optimized suspension and a sensitive 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.680
 electric power steering a great silence 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.420
 of march and pitschen bounce control 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.940
 of pitching to increase pleasure 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.430
 driving and safety for the first 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.310
 time the battery is lithium ion e 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.510
 located between the two front seats 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.840
 inserted in place of the glove compartment 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.180
 under armrest it weighs 8 kg less 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.670
 than that of the prius sedan and is more 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.010
 powerful because another of the goals scored 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.500
 by toyota engineers is just 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.660
 attention to the weight of special steels e 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.560
 Aluminum parts have limited the 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.890
 mass at 1,530 kg the price 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.060
 in the entrance of the world a prius class 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.819
 of 30,400 euros and is about 13 per 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.380
 one hundred higher than the first 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.099
 traditional version that we render a 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.099
 that art
