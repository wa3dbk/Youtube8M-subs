00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.060 
Libous the thought you know because
there<00:02:31.510> is<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:31.870> just<00:02:31.900> break<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:32.620> down<00:02:32.650> at<00:02:32.950> all

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
there is you just break it down at all

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.979 
there is you just break it down at all

think a lot of the freedom in the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.699 
think a lot of the freedom in the
physicality<00:02:37.090> comes<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.019> also<00:02:38.410> to

this<00:05:55.620> is<00:05:55.740> one<00:05:55.889> that<00:05:56.159> what<00:05:56.340> I<00:05:56.370> use<00:05:56.580> it<00:05:56.699> for

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
this is one that what I use it for

nothing everyone necessary plays like
this<00:05:58.409> but<00:05:58.860> it<00:05:59.009> can<00:05:59.219> be<00:05:59.370> very<00:05:59.580> valuable<00:05:59.759> in<00:06:00.240> that

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
this but it can be very valuable in that

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.690 
this but it can be very valuable in that
sense
