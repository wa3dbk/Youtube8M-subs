00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:08.780

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.910
 and I'm here today to tell you 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.680
 you as this story but me and 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.020
 How did I start making all of them? 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.030
 Hat Baquinho fats of these 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.640
 and all others that appear on the 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:23.539
 story of the book but for this I go 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:27.349
 start his story at the beginning all 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.330
 started on a Saturday that rained heavily and 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.060
 the whole family was gathered in a room 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.460
 not doing something the students 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.540
 they tried to read and the children would not stop 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.280
 play 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.160
 he chose one side or the other 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.190
 passed over the sofa and the adults there 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.800
 concentrating to try to read 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.990
 I suddenly looked away and saw my 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.310
 younger son playing pirate 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.060
 Light 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:56.540
 there I thought this pirate needs 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.310
 mud and then I went to a corner and 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.400
 I found a newspaper has also 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:04.100
 had read had cock thinks i got 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.280
 the newspaper and started building a bar 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:12.470
 The first thing I did was fold the 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.990
 open this I folded and played well here 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:21.110
 Then I took the other end and did the same 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:24.290
 thing tight the newspaper there 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:29.030
 to be a little house but now button 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:32.900
 even so I keep is the part that 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:37.479
 I left here underneath and folded up and 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.479
 I did the same thing on the other side. 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.790
 when I picked up the newspaper 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:49.330
 I realized that if you remembered this 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:53.380
 fuzzies come this way 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.380
 I had a good game until 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.550
 so I get a hat 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.450
 pirates but this is not what I 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.710
 I wanted 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:10.490
 I wanted to kill, I still took my 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:14.860
 hat and joined both the continhas 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.860
 hat in the middle 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.580
 he stayed like this 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.570
 looking like a June party balloon but 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.670
 it was not a boat yet so I caught the 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.300
 low point and do not have with the tip 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.770
 from top of Brazil that way 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.209
 in February another side to make the 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.850
 same thing 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.850
 the bottom from the top to the top 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:46.670
 when the newspaper I found good standing 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:54.230
 less than the first one I 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:57.230
 had built continues hat open 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.010
 opening hat to the bottoms 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:05.420
 you will find down here and I find out 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:17.989
 Above here is a page and 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:20.060
 pulling one hand to the right was that 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.720
 build a boat and from there my 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:27.200
 pirates know pirate until joke save the 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.140
 pirate hat has sword and then I had 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.510
 another idea went back to that pile 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.510
 never used and I took another sheet 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.510
 I got the leaf on the ground and started 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.510
 to roll up 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:48.710
 coiling tightly to pre-fabricate 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.430
 daughter because sword principality has to 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:56.230
 be a child 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.230
 if it did not win and I wrapped the datafolha 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.070
 and when the end comes 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.070
 she stayed like this but she did not need 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:12.640
 a place wanted to ensure would need 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.640
 much was I bent the bottom 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:32.110
 and colleague deserves so ready 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.080
 that's how I built a sword one 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.330
 bar and a hat and it's all mine 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.880
 pirates who have been browsing in other more 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.270
 and let the adults move on 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.270
 with reading
