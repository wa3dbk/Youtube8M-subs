is pretty awesome yeah alright so today

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.510 
is pretty awesome yeah alright so today
would<00:00:58.320> probably<00:00:58.350> be<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> little<00:00:59.579> short<00:00:59.940> video

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
would probably be a little short video

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.070 
would probably be a little short video
because<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.940> know<00:01:03.000> finals<00:01:03.539> time<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
because it's you know finals time and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.890 
because it's you know finals time and
stuff<00:01:04.500> has<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.769> get<00:01:04.890> done<00:01:05.330> but<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.540> thought<00:01:06.750> I'd

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
stuff has to get done but I thought I'd

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.570 
stuff has to get done but I thought I'd
expand<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.680> little<00:01:07.710> bit<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.570> some<00:01:09.570> more<00:01:10.580> sewing

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
expand a little bit on some more sewing

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.270 
expand a little bit on some more sewing
techniques<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.750> things<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.250> so<00:01:14.250> I

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
techniques and things like that so I

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.560 
techniques and things like that so I
thought<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.580> go<00:01:14.729> over<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> little<00:01:15.119> bit<00:01:15.390> of

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
thought to go over a little bit of

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.620 
thought to go over a little bit of
legato<00:01:16.200> sweep<00:01:17.159> picking<00:01:17.460> stuff<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.479> I've

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
legato sweep picking stuff that I've

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.899 
legato sweep picking stuff that I've
been<00:01:18.930> messing<00:01:19.110> around<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.979> share<00:01:20.670> my

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
been messing around with and share my

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.990 
been messing around with and share my
information<00:01:21.090> I've<00:01:21.689> learned<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.729> you<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
information I've learned to you the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.350 
information I've learned to you the
audience<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:25.700> I'm<00:01:26.700> going<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> get<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> guitar

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360

audience so I'm going to get the guitar
over<00:01:27.659> here<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.299> when<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:30.930> went<00:01:31.320> over<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.829> was

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
over here and so when we went over I was

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.069 
over here and so when we went over I was
a<00:01:32.430> long<00:01:32.610> time<00:01:32.759> ago<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.360> we<00:01:33.570> did<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> like<00:01:34.049> a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
a long time ago but we did a like a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.230 
a long time ago but we did a like a
little<00:01:34.500> intro<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.220> soloing<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.030> sweet

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
little intro to soloing and sweet

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.020 
little intro to soloing and sweet
picking<00:01:36.570> thing<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.799> we<00:01:37.890> did<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.280> i<00:01:38.880> showed

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
picking thing that we did and i showed

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.660 
picking thing that we did and i showed
you<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> three<00:01:39.780> string<00:01:40.229> sweet<00:01:41.189> pattern

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
you like a three string sweet pattern

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.639 
you like a three string sweet pattern
and<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.899> haven't<00:01:43.229> seen<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.380> will

only<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.649> left<00:01:52.829> hand<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.130> don't<00:01:53.220> even<00:01:53.340> need

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
only the left hand you don't even need

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.660 
only the left hand you don't even need
to<00:01:53.610> pick<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.770> so<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.280> technically

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
to pick for this so this is technically

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.420 
to pick for this so this is technically
called<00:01:56.880> legato<00:01:57.570> picking<00:01:58.049> it's<00:01:58.860> not<00:01:58.979> actually

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
called legato picking it's not actually

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.980 
called legato picking it's not actually
picking<00:01:59.759> it's<00:01:59.909> just<00:02:00.149> hammer-ons<00:02:00.899> and

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
picking it's just hammer-ons and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.920 
picking it's just hammer-ons and
pull-offs<00:02:01.850> so<00:02:02.850> what<00:02:03.240> you're<00:02:03.329> going<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.479> do<00:02:03.630> is

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
pull-offs so what you're going to do is

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.990 
pull-offs so what you're going to do is
is<00:02:04.110> basically<00:02:04.680> start<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.549> three<00:02:05.759> string

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
is basically start in the three string

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.779 
is basically start in the three string
sweet<00:02:06.270> pattern<00:02:06.630> as<00:02:06.950> I<00:02:07.950> said<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.640> last

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
sweet pattern as I said in the last

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.580 
sweet pattern as I said in the last
video<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.619> instead<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.830> doing

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
video and instead of doing

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.610 
video and instead of doing
a<00:02:11.620> sweep<00:02:12.519> you're<00:02:13.180> going<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.599> be<00:02:13.720> doing<00:02:13.930> the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
a sweep you're going to be doing the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.990 
a sweep you're going to be doing the
exact<00:02:14.950> same<00:02:14.980> pattern<00:02:15.310> with<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.640> left<00:02:15.819> hand

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
exact same pattern with the left hand

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.390 
exact same pattern with the left hand
and<00:02:16.239> only<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.720> left<00:02:16.900> hand<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:17.410> slowly<00:02:18.010> it

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
and only the left hand so slowly it

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.280 
and only the left hand so slowly it
would<00:02:18.519> sound<00:02:18.730> something<00:02:18.970> like<00:02:19.410> this<00:02:20.410> also

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
would sound something like this also

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.199 
would sound something like this also
instead<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.500> using<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.830> meeting<00:02:23.980> pad<00:02:24.310> for

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
instead of using the meeting pad for

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.520 
instead of using the meeting pad for
this<00:02:25.360> since<00:02:25.599> you<00:02:25.690> have<00:02:25.810> your<00:02:25.930> right<00:02:26.050> hand<00:02:26.260> free

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
this since you have your right hand free

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.160 
this since you have your right hand free
meet<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.519> with<00:02:27.879> your<00:02:28.090> right<00:02:28.390> hand<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:29.080> know

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
meet it with your right hand you know

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.930 
meet it with your right hand you know
Joe<00:02:29.980> Satriani<00:02:30.220> style<00:02:30.879> um<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:32.730> here<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.819> is<00:02:33.879> a

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
Joe Satriani style um so here it is a

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.270 
Joe Satriani style um so here it is a
little<00:02:34.150> bit<00:02:34.269> slower<00:02:34.680> just<00:02:35.680> as<00:02:35.799> three<00:02:36.040> string

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
little bit slower just as three string

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.949 
little bit slower just as three string
sweet<00:02:36.549> pattern<00:02:36.849> completely<00:02:37.150> with<00:02:37.629> the<00:02:37.750> left

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
sweet pattern completely with the left

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.830 
sweet pattern completely with the left
hand<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.819> so<00:02:39.819> you<00:02:39.910> can<00:02:40.000> hear<00:02:40.120> kind<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.480> how

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
hand and so you can hear kind of how

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.809 
hand and so you can hear kind of how
smooth<00:02:41.230> you<00:02:41.410> can<00:02:41.440> get<00:02:41.709> with<00:02:42.250> just<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.640> left

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
smooth you can get with just the left

00:02:42.819 --> 00:03:17.390 
smooth you can get with just the left
hand

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.320 

so<00:03:18.400> as<00:03:18.520> you<00:03:18.580> can<00:03:18.700> see<00:03:18.880> that<00:03:19.060> was<00:03:19.150> completely

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
so as you can see that was completely

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.850 
so as you can see that was completely
with<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.750> left<00:03:19.930> hand<00:03:20.110> no<00:03:20.740> picking<00:03:21.520> needed<00:03:22.860> if

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
with the left hand no picking needed if

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.770 
with the left hand no picking needed if
you<00:03:24.070> don't<00:03:24.250> if<00:03:24.400> my<00:03:24.670> hands<00:03:24.880> not<00:03:25.090> incredibly

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
you don't if my hands not incredibly

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.990 
you don't if my hands not incredibly
strong<00:03:26.230> at<00:03:26.710> doing<00:03:27.040> this<00:03:27.190> at<00:03:27.490> the<00:03:27.610> moment<00:03:27.940> so

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
strong at doing this at the moment so

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.780 
strong at doing this at the moment so
we've<00:03:28.480> got<00:03:28.660> quite<00:03:28.840> a<00:03:28.930> bit<00:03:29.140> of<00:03:29.230> gain<00:03:29.790> flowing

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
we've got quite a bit of gain flowing

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.900 
we've got quite a bit of gain flowing
through<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.300> hamp<00:03:31.570> right<00:03:31.870> now<00:03:32.080> yeah<00:03:32.910> we've

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
through the hamp right now yeah we've

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.450 
through the hamp right now yeah we've
got<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.090> tube<00:03:34.630> screamer<00:03:34.870> in<00:03:35.260> front<00:03:35.530> of<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:36.040> a

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
got a tube screamer in front of and a

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.080 
got a tube screamer in front of and a
noise<00:03:36.670> suppressor<00:03:37.210> and<00:03:37.420> then<00:03:38.230> into<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:39.090> single

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
noise suppressor and then into a single

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:47.520 
noise suppressor and then into a single
regular<00:03:40.480> fire<00:03:40.840> with<00:03:42.030> gobs<00:03:43.030> gain<00:03:43.480> um<00:03:44.200> so<00:03:46.530> once

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
regular fire with gobs gain um so once

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.810 
regular fire with gobs gain um so once
you<00:03:47.620> get<00:03:47.680> that<00:03:47.800> up<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:47.950> speed<00:03:48.280> you<00:03:48.490> can<00:03:48.610> get<00:03:48.790> a

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
you get that up to speed you can get a

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.470 
you get that up to speed you can get a
pretty<00:03:49.150> smooth<00:03:49.480> sounds<00:03:50.050> to<00:03:50.200> having<00:03:50.560> that

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
pretty smooth sounds to having that

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.700 
pretty smooth sounds to having that
tricked<00:03:52.480> from<00:03:52.900> a<00:03:52.960> sweet<00:03:53.170> picking<00:03:53.500> that<00:03:53.590> you

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
tricked from a sweet picking that you

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.000 
tricked from a sweet picking that you
can<00:03:53.830> get<00:03:53.920> sometimes<00:03:55.800> right<00:03:56.800> there

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
can get sometimes right there

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.860 
can get sometimes right there
accidentally<00:03:57.550> had<00:03:57.700> that<00:03:57.850> aunty<00:03:58.300> trouble<00:03:58.720> pick

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
accidentally had that aunty trouble pick

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.410 
accidentally had that aunty trouble pick
up<00:03:59.020> but<00:03:59.200> usually<00:03:59.590> you<00:03:59.680> want<00:03:59.860> to<00:03:59.920> do<00:04:00.010> it<00:04:00.130> on<00:04:00.220> your

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
up but usually you want to do it on your

up but usually you want to do it on your
on<00:04:01.420> your<00:04:01.450> neck<00:04:02.440> pickup<00:04:02.830> which<00:04:03.010> is<00:04:03.160> usually

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
on your neck pickup which is usually

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.150 
on your neck pickup which is usually
like<00:04:03.640> me<00:04:03.670> this<00:04:04.120> is<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.300> mg<00:04:04.570> 85<00:04:04.960> right<00:04:05.740> now<00:04:05.920> and

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
like me this is the mg 85 right now and

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.090 
like me this is the mg 85 right now and
get<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.400> smoothest<00:04:06.790> sounds<00:04:07.120> of<00:04:07.210> it<00:04:07.360> also

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
get the smoothest sounds of it also

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.120 
get the smoothest sounds of it also
person<00:04:09.100> decent<00:04:09.400> tones<00:04:09.550> out<00:04:09.730> of<00:04:09.820> a<00:04:09.880> mg<00:04:10.180> 60<00:04:11.130> but

person decent tones out of a mg 60 but

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.740 
person decent tones out of a mg 60 but
it's<00:04:12.250> not<00:04:12.310> as<00:04:12.460> smooth<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:13.120> smoothest<00:04:13.510> telling

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
it's not as smooth the smoothest telling

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.210 
it's not as smooth the smoothest telling
I've<00:04:13.810> heard<00:04:13.960> for<00:04:14.200> solos<00:04:14.560> as<00:04:14.740> an<00:04:14.860> emt<00:04:16.950> 8560<00:04:17.950> gets

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
I've heard for solos as an emt 8560 gets

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.849 
I've heard for solos as an emt 8560 gets
you<00:04:18.370> it<00:04:19.120> gets<00:04:19.330> the<00:04:19.540> low<00:04:19.870> end<00:04:20.080> but<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:20.530> also<00:04:20.620> has

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
you it gets the low end but it also has

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.360 
you it gets the low end but it also has
some<00:04:21.070> high<00:04:21.250> end<00:04:22.230> which<00:04:23.230> for<00:04:23.650> solos<00:04:24.070> I<00:04:24.220> actually

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
some high end which for solos I actually

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.630 
some high end which for solos I actually
like<00:04:24.670> the<00:04:24.820> really<00:04:25.030> smooth<00:04:25.330> low<00:04:25.600> end<00:04:25.840> so<00:04:26.800> up<00:04:27.400> to

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
like the really smooth low end so up to

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
speed a little bit faster in that same

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.910 
speed a little bit faster in that same
lick<00:04:29.850> it<00:04:30.850> would<00:04:31.000> sound<00:04:31.180> something<00:04:31.540> like<00:04:31.920> along

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920

the<00:04:33.070> lines<00:04:33.280> of<00:04:33.490> this

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:05:06.090

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
so you can take that and move it around

things<00:05:36.920> and<00:05:37.190> instead<00:05:37.880> of<00:05:38.030> you<00:05:38.390> know<00:05:38.420> it<00:05:39.170> would

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
things and instead of you know it would

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.200 
things and instead of you know it would
be<00:05:39.320> a<00:05:39.710> real<00:05:39.950> cutting<00:05:40.340> solo<00:05:40.610> if<00:05:40.850> you're<00:05:41.000> using

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
be a real cutting solo if you're using

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.090 
be a real cutting solo if you're using
sweet<00:05:41.540> picking<00:05:41.870> you<00:05:42.410> can<00:05:42.560> kind<00:05:42.740> of<00:05:42.830> lay<00:05:42.980> it

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
sweet picking you can kind of lay it

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.130 
sweet picking you can kind of lay it
back<00:05:43.280> more<00:05:43.760> when<00:05:44.390> you're<00:05:44.540> using<00:05:44.720> just<00:05:45.080> your

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
back more when you're using just your

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.580 
back more when you're using just your
left<00:05:45.440> hand<00:05:45.710> then<00:05:45.860> you<00:05:45.950> get<00:05:46.070> a<00:05:46.100> smooth<00:05:46.430> or<00:05:46.610> tone

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
left hand then you get a smooth or tone

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.780 
left hand then you get a smooth or tone
so<00:05:48.590> you<00:05:48.680> can<00:05:48.860> also<00:05:48.980> do<00:05:49.160> this<00:05:49.280> with<00:05:49.340> any<00:05:49.580> other

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
so you can also do this with any other

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.000 
so you can also do this with any other
sweep<00:05:50.150> right<00:05:50.960> now<00:05:51.140> it's<00:05:51.290> the<00:05:51.350> only<00:05:51.530> real<00:05:51.710> sweep

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
sweep right now it's the only real sweep

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.520 
sweep right now it's the only real sweep
that<00:05:52.160> I'm<00:05:52.280> decent<00:05:52.700> at<00:05:53.080> you<00:05:54.080> can<00:05:54.200> also<00:05:54.320> do<00:05:54.500> it

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
that I'm decent at you can also do it

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.710 
that I'm decent at you can also do it
with<00:05:54.650> five<00:05:54.950> string<00:05:55.310> stuff<00:05:55.580> but<00:05:55.910> then<00:05:56.480> you<00:05:56.570> got

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
with five string stuff but then you got

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.750 
with five string stuff but then you got
to<00:05:56.750> really<00:05:56.930> have<00:05:57.170> a<00:05:57.200> nice<00:05:57.740> strong<00:05:58.160> left<00:05:58.490> hand

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
to really have a nice strong left hand

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.170 
to really have a nice strong left hand
in<00:05:58.880> order<00:05:59.090> to<00:05:59.210> do<00:05:59.330> that<00:05:59.770> and<00:06:00.770> the<00:06:01.700> less<00:06:01.880> gain

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
in order to do that and the less gain

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.870 
in order to do that and the less gain
that<00:06:02.810> you<00:06:03.110> that<00:06:03.890> you're<00:06:04.160> comfortable<00:06:04.610> with

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
that you that you're comfortable with

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.490 
that you that you're comfortable with
using<00:06:05.240> the<00:06:05.600> better<00:06:05.780> because<00:06:06.080> you<00:06:06.260> can<00:06:06.290> get<00:06:06.470> a

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
using the better because you can get a

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.490 
using the better because you can get a
cleaner<00:06:06.770> sound<00:06:06.980> that<00:06:07.250> way<00:06:07.400> yeah<00:06:07.990> for<00:06:08.990> this<00:06:09.110> my

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
cleaner sound that way yeah for this my

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.920 
cleaner sound that way yeah for this my
left<00:06:09.710> hand<00:06:09.860> still<00:06:10.130> isn't<00:06:10.400> up<00:06:10.550> to<00:06:10.970> the<00:06:11.480> strength

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
left hand still isn't up to the strength

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.930 
left hand still isn't up to the strength
that<00:06:11.990> it<00:06:12.200> should<00:06:12.410> be<00:06:12.560> for<00:06:13.430> a<00:06:13.460> regular<00:06:13.760> sweet

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
that it should be for a regular sweet

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.670 
that it should be for a regular sweet
picking<00:06:14.180> it's<00:06:14.360> okay<00:06:14.690> but<00:06:14.930> when<00:06:15.440> you're<00:06:15.560> only

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
picking it's okay but when you're only

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.350 
picking it's okay but when you're only
using<00:06:15.830> your<00:06:16.070> left<00:06:16.220> hand<00:06:16.340> you've<00:06:16.940> got<00:06:17.090> to<00:06:17.180> push

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
using your left hand you've got to push

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.900 
using your left hand you've got to push
much<00:06:17.780> harder<00:06:18.110> than<00:06:18.290> you<00:06:18.470> do<00:06:18.680> with<00:06:18.890> just<00:06:19.610> when

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
much harder than you do with just when

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.220 
much harder than you do with just when
you're<00:06:20.030> actually<00:06:20.210> using<00:06:20.360> sweet<00:06:20.780> picking<00:06:21.080> so

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.230 
you're actually using sweet picking so

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.260 
you're actually using sweet picking so
make<00:06:22.130> sure<00:06:22.160> you<00:06:22.310> build<00:06:22.460> your<00:06:22.640> strength<00:06:22.820> up<00:06:23.120> in

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
make sure you build your strength up in

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.110 
make sure you build your strength up in
your<00:06:23.390> dexterity<00:06:24.130> it<00:06:25.130> also<00:06:25.400> works<00:06:25.670> as<00:06:25.820> a<00:06:25.850> really

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
your dexterity it also works as a really

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.120 
your dexterity it also works as a really
good<00:06:26.270> warm-up<00:06:26.630> to<00:06:27.470> make<00:06:27.590> sure<00:06:27.710> you<00:06:27.830> get<00:06:27.950> this

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
good warm-up to make sure you get this

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.730 
good warm-up to make sure you get this
clean<00:06:28.570> it'll<00:06:29.570> really<00:06:29.750> start<00:06:30.350> burning<00:06:30.680> your

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
clean it'll really start burning your

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.640 
clean it'll really start burning your
hand<00:06:30.980> even<00:06:31.250> that<00:06:31.520> little<00:06:31.610> bit<00:06:32.260> it'll<00:06:33.260> start

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
hand even that little bit it'll start

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.610 
hand even that little bit it'll start
working<00:06:34.040> out<00:06:34.220> your<00:06:34.490> left<00:06:34.790> hand<00:06:35.030> really<00:06:35.240> well

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
working out your left hand really well

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.410 
working out your left hand really well
so<00:06:36.620> I<00:06:37.100> think<00:06:37.280> it's<00:06:37.430> going<00:06:37.580> to<00:06:37.640> be<00:06:37.790> pretty<00:06:38.180> much

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:38.420 
so I think it's going to be pretty much

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.610 
so I think it's going to be pretty much
it<00:06:38.600> for<00:06:38.630> this<00:06:38.900> little<00:06:39.740> video<00:06:39.950> um<00:06:40.850> so<00:06:41.690> make<00:06:42.590> sure
