yo<00:00:04.049> guys<00:00:04.430> how's<00:00:05.430> it<00:00:05.670> going

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
yo guys how's it going

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.169 
yo guys how's it going
let's<00:00:06.629> talk<00:00:06.899> about<00:00:07.049> Windows<00:00:07.680> 10<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.790> if<00:00:09.000> you're

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
let's talk about Windows 10 so if you're

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.820 
let's talk about Windows 10 so if you're
on<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.510> fence<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:09.960> whether<00:00:10.320> or<00:00:10.469> not<00:00:10.590> you

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
on the fence and whether or not you

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.830 
on the fence and whether or not you
should<00:00:10.860> upgrade<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.580> Windows<00:00:11.790> 10<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:12.330> want<00:00:12.780> to

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
should upgrade to Windows 10 I want to

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.330 
should upgrade to Windows 10 I want to
give<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> few<00:00:13.320> reasons<00:00:13.349> on<00:00:13.830> why<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:14.070> should

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
give you a few reasons on why you should

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:32.330 
give you a few reasons on why you should
consider<00:00:14.580> upgrading<00:00:15.440> first<00:00:16.609> DirectX<00:00:17.609> 12

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.610 

so<00:00:33.340> if<00:00:33.460> you're<00:00:33.700> a<00:00:33.730> gamer<00:00:34.090> this<00:00:34.690> is<00:00:34.750> the<00:00:35.350> most

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
so if you're a gamer this is the most

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.110 
so if you're a gamer this is the most
important<00:00:36.040> reason<00:00:36.190> Hawaii<00:00:36.730> you<00:00:36.940> should

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
important reason Hawaii you should

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.540 
important reason Hawaii you should
upgrade<00:00:37.300> to<00:00:37.629> Windows<00:00:37.840> 10<00:00:38.190> Windows<00:00:39.190> 10

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
upgrade to Windows 10 Windows 10

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.720 
upgrade to Windows 10 Windows 10
introduces<00:00:40.300> an<00:00:40.390> exclusive<00:00:40.960> DirectX<00:00:41.770> 12<00:00:41.980> now

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
introduces an exclusive DirectX 12 now

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.670 
introduces an exclusive DirectX 12 now
this<00:00:43.150> version<00:00:43.420> DirectX<00:00:44.050> is<00:00:44.260> not<00:00:44.440> going<00:00:44.620> to

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
this version DirectX is not going to

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.110 
this version DirectX is not going to
come<00:00:44.829> to<00:00:44.860> any<00:00:45.190> of<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.460> previous<00:00:45.640> version<00:00:46.090> of

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
come to any of the previous version of

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.700 
come to any of the previous version of
Windows<00:00:46.480> so<00:00:47.199> you're<00:00:47.320> going<00:00:47.440> to<00:00:47.470> need<00:00:47.590> the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
Windows so you're going to need the

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.079 
Windows so you're going to need the
upgrade<00:00:48.010> in<00:00:48.100> Windows<00:00:48.280> 10<00:00:48.519> if<00:00:48.820> we're<00:00:48.970> gonna

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
upgrade in Windows 10 if we're gonna

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.720 
upgrade in Windows 10 if we're gonna
want<00:00:49.239> to<00:00:49.360> use<00:00:49.600> it<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.800> what<00:00:50.980> makes<00:00:51.129> DirectX<00:00:51.579> 12

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
want to use it so what makes DirectX 12

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.819 
want to use it so what makes DirectX 12
different<00:00:52.030> is<00:00:52.390> that<00:00:52.690> it<00:00:52.839> offers<00:00:53.110> a<00:00:53.440> capability

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
different is that it offers a capability

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.180 
different is that it offers a capability
to<00:00:54.250> use<00:00:54.370> multiple<00:00:54.879> GPUs<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.500> that<00:00:56.650> means<00:00:56.890> you

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
to use multiple GPUs so that means you

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.189 
to use multiple GPUs so that means you
can<00:00:57.309> use<00:00:57.339> it<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:57.760> create<00:00:57.970> a<00:00:58.000> GPU<00:00:58.420> on<00:00:58.629> your<00:00:58.750> CPU

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
can use it and create a GPU on your CPU

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.319 
can use it and create a GPU on your CPU
or<00:00:59.230> APU<00:00:59.829> a<00:01:00.040> LAN<00:01:00.400> for<00:01:00.550> a<00:01:00.610> dedicated<00:01:00.760> graphics

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
or APU a LAN for a dedicated graphics

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.410 
or APU a LAN for a dedicated graphics
card<00:01:01.920> it's<00:01:02.920> set<00:01:03.100> to<00:01:03.129> provide<00:01:03.460> a<00:01:03.489> huge<00:01:03.970> boost

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
card it's set to provide a huge boost

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.529 
card it's set to provide a huge boost
performance<00:01:05.110> for<00:01:05.379> most<00:01:05.619> games<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.270> nice

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
performance for most games and the nice

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:08.969 
performance for most games and the nice
thing<00:01:07.570> is<00:01:07.810> that<00:01:07.930> you<00:01:08.229> don't<00:01:08.440> even<00:01:08.590> have<00:01:08.860> to

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
thing is that you don't even have to

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.650 
thing is that you don't even have to
switch<00:01:09.190> hardware<00:01:09.700> to<00:01:09.880> make<00:01:09.970> use<00:01:10.180> of<00:01:10.210> this<00:01:10.450> a

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
switch hardware to make use of this a

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.050 
switch hardware to make use of this a
lot<00:01:11.229> of<00:01:11.289> the<00:01:11.380> existing<00:01:11.800> Nvidia<00:01:12.369> and<00:01:12.700> AMD

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
lot of the existing Nvidia and AMD

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.480 
lot of the existing Nvidia and AMD
graphics<00:01:13.420> cards<00:01:13.780> will<00:01:14.380> work<00:01:14.649> with<00:01:14.830> DirectX<00:01:15.280> 12

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
graphics cards will work with DirectX 12

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.150 
graphics cards will work with DirectX 12
and<00:01:16.000> there's<00:01:16.750> even<00:01:17.110> word<00:01:17.320> going<00:01:17.740> around<00:01:17.979> that

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
and there's even word going around that

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.639 
and there's even word going around that
you<00:01:18.250> can<00:01:18.369> use<00:01:18.550> an<00:01:18.850> Nvidia<00:01:19.210> and<00:01:19.509> AMD<00:01:19.869> GPU

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
you can use an Nvidia and AMD GPU

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.950 
you can use an Nvidia and AMD GPU
simultaneously<00:01:21.640> of<00:01:22.179> course<00:01:22.509> I<00:01:22.690> don't<00:01:22.750> know

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
simultaneously of course I don't know

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.100 
simultaneously of course I don't know
how<00:01:23.200> well<00:01:23.470> Nvidia<00:01:24.009> and<00:01:24.340> AMD<00:01:24.670> will<00:01:25.570> actually

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
how well Nvidia and AMD will actually

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.320 
how well Nvidia and AMD will actually
partner<00:01:26.500> up<00:01:26.619> to<00:01:26.740> do<00:01:26.890> this<00:01:27.100> but<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.850> capability

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
partner up to do this but the capability

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330 
partner up to do this but the capability
should<00:01:28.450> still<00:01:28.750> be<00:01:28.899> there<00:01:29.110> so<00:01:29.890> like<00:01:30.070> I<00:01:30.100> said

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
should still be there so like I said

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.580 
should still be there so like I said
overall<00:01:30.940> a<00:01:31.210> good<00:01:31.509> reason<00:01:31.929> to<00:01:32.200> upgrade<00:01:32.380> to

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
overall a good reason to upgrade to

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.230 
overall a good reason to upgrade to
Windows<00:01:32.619> 10<00:01:32.979> is<00:01:33.220> to<00:01:33.369> take<00:01:33.550> advantage<00:01:33.970> of<00:01:34.090> this

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
Windows 10 is to take advantage of this

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.480 
Windows 10 is to take advantage of this
new<00:01:34.450> DirectX<00:01:35.050> 12<00:01:35.229> it's<00:01:35.890> going<00:01:36.070> to<00:01:36.130> be<00:01:36.220> really

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
new DirectX 12 it's going to be really

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
reason to upgrade your product and I

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.200 
reason to upgrade your product and I
know<00:01:53.860> a<00:01:54.009> lot<00:01:54.159> of<00:01:54.310> people<00:01:54.549> are<00:01:54.610> gonna<00:01:54.729> say<00:01:54.970> oh

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
know a lot of people are gonna say oh

know a lot of people are gonna say oh
great<00:01:55.509> now<00:01:55.930> I<00:01:55.960> had<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.259> relearn<00:01:56.649> the<00:01:56.829> whole<00:01:57.100> new

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
great now I had to relearn the whole new

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.149 
great now I had to relearn the whole new
user<00:01:57.549> interface<00:01:58.229> however<00:01:59.229> I<00:01:59.500> think<00:01:59.860> Microsoft

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
user interface however I think Microsoft

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.219 
user interface however I think Microsoft
really<00:02:00.729> has<00:02:01.000> gotten<00:02:01.329> it<00:02:01.420> correct<00:02:01.810> this<00:02:01.960> time

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
really has gotten it correct this time

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.830 
you had this one version of Windows and
like<00:04:12.980> I<00:04:13.100> said<00:04:13.160> if<00:04:13.519> you're<00:04:13.670> running<00:04:13.940> Windows<00:04:14.269> 7

like I said if you're running Windows 7

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.900 
like I said if you're running Windows 7
and<00:04:15.019> Windows<00:04:15.350> 8<00:04:15.440> currently<00:04:15.890> this<00:04:16.459> update<00:04:16.880> is

and Windows 8 currently this update is
free<00:04:17.299> for<00:04:17.510> you<00:04:17.540> so<00:04:17.989> I<00:04:18.019> mean<00:04:18.380> if<00:04:18.620> none<00:04:19.519> of<00:04:19.580> these

free for you so I mean if none of these
other<00:04:19.700> reasons<00:04:20.330> actually<00:04:20.540> appeal<00:04:20.989> to<00:04:21.109> you

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
hopefully this appeals to you that it's

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.750 
hopefully this appeals to you that it's
free<00:04:23.630> software<00:04:23.810> you're<00:04:24.169> getting<00:04:24.530> so<00:04:25.070> I<00:04:25.460> mean

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
free software you're getting so I mean

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.850 
free software you're getting so I mean
hey<00:04:26.060> if<00:04:26.419> it's<00:04:26.660> free<00:04:26.900> it's<00:04:27.260> from<00:04:27.500> me<00:04:27.620> that's

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
hey if it's free it's from me that's

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.710 
hey if it's free it's from me that's
what<00:04:27.979> I<00:04:28.010> do<00:04:28.130> now<00:04:28.700> I<00:04:28.760> do<00:04:29.000> want<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.300> thought<00:04:29.510> it's

someone who you really definitely rely

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.580 
someone who you really definitely rely
on<00:04:34.370> computer<00:04:34.850> a<00:04:34.880> lot<00:04:35.240> you<00:04:36.050> might<00:04:36.169> want<00:04:36.380> to<00:04:36.410> wait

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
on computer a lot you might want to wait

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.380 
on computer a lot you might want to wait
before<00:04:36.770> you<00:04:36.979> update<00:04:37.160> to<00:04:37.520> Windows<00:04:37.610> 10<00:04:37.790> maybe

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
before you update to Windows 10 maybe

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.610 
before you update to Windows 10 maybe
give<00:04:38.630> it<00:04:38.660> a<00:04:38.750> few<00:04:38.930> months<00:04:39.110> because<00:04:39.350> obviously

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
give it a few months because obviously

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.890 
give it a few months because obviously
like<00:04:39.950> any<00:04:40.250> new<00:04:40.610> piece<00:04:40.850> of<00:04:40.880> technology<00:04:41.180> there

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
like any new piece of technology there

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.659 
like any new piece of technology there
are<00:04:41.930> bugs<00:04:42.260> that<00:04:42.590> probably<00:04:43.130> need<00:04:43.310> to<00:04:43.370> be<00:04:43.430> worked

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
are bugs that probably need to be worked

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.120 
are bugs that probably need to be worked
out<00:04:43.880> and<00:04:44.240> I'm<00:04:44.600> sure<00:04:44.660> maybe<00:04:45.260> there<00:04:45.830> might<00:04:45.979> be

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
out and I'm sure maybe there might be

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.680 
out and I'm sure maybe there might be
one<00:04:46.280> of<00:04:46.310> those<00:04:46.430> 10<00:04:46.550> install<00:04:46.880> some<00:04:47.150> glaring

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
one of those 10 install some glaring

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.750 
one of those 10 install some glaring
issue<00:04:47.900> which<00:04:48.380> Microsoft<00:04:48.710> might<00:04:49.130> have<00:04:49.340> to<00:04:49.520> fix

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
issue which Microsoft might have to fix

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.150 
issue which Microsoft might have to fix
immediately<00:04:50.000> so<00:04:50.930> in<00:04:51.169> the<00:04:51.260> event<00:04:51.320> that<00:04:51.560> happens

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
immediately so in the event that happens

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.800 
immediately so in the event that happens
it<00:04:52.340> might<00:04:52.580> be<00:04:52.729> better<00:04:52.880> just<00:04:52.970> to<00:04:53.300> wait<00:04:53.510> a<00:04:53.539> little

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
it might be better just to wait a little
