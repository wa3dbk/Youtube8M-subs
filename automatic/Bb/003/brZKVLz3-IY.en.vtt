00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.930
 now let's see a hand that I know is 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.670
 complicated that you throw it but after 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.680
 of the analysis I hope you see clearly that 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.690
 is the only solution to get the 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.010
 profitability in these situations the 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.010
 forum let's see it 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.650
 yes 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.910
 well let's see this hand the player in 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.720
 position 3 receives even more makes a 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.460
 rise to four bin line 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.840
 player 4 5 and 6 as you see they are thrown and 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.560
 now the voice reaches the box in 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.110
 position 7 has two kings we know that 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.520
 of course we should summarize even more 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.100
 coming the rise of first 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.110
 positions are very likely to have 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.070
 a good hand therefore we must 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:07.730
 immediately test and asia the box in 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:12.650
 position 7 with two red kings sums to 12 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:14.560
 bits now we see that 8 9 10 and small 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.930
 blind are thrown 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.630
 the voice comes to the big blind is our 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.540
 player as short stack strategy this 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.460
 it's a compromised situation I know that a 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.310
 Many of us will find it unlikely 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.960
 answer but I assure you that you have to 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.549
 make this move 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.420
 let's see it reflected in video and 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.420
 then we will analyze it 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.360
 I 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.110
 since everything nothing 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.720
 Well, that's exactly what you have to 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.840
 do 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.580
 throw away let's analyze it but as 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.710
 we see the player in big blind in the 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.070
 When he reaches his life he decides 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.649
 abandon the hand directly then 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.230
 you have to understand what the reason 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.020
 del fol we are short stack players 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.450
 we look for a clear situation to fold 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.330
 with a favorable equity or a 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.300
 long-term favorable expectation that 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.030
 our hand is average better than 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.930
 of our rivals this when we have 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.300
 a scenario like that in a game started 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.970
 we have to leave directly only 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.880
 there is an exception unless the player 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.860
 in position 7 that is receiving is a 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.900
 crazy maniac player that we have him 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.120
 signed that is doing that with 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.010
 any of two cards but you have to 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.370
 know and this is the important thing in the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.190
 when a player preflop summarizes the 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.739
 range of hands hands where you 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.319
 we have to place and put 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.930
 clearly with a negative expectation 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.239
 the king as the king also we have gotten 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.269
 nothing in the boat just the blind 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.900
 great therefore if we place the rival 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:13.670
 of hunting and reid in hands like jacks 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.769
 ladies kings aces will always be 50% of 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.159
 average expectation to showdown or 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.530
 losing clearly against kings or aces 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.419
 therefore as we do not have anything of 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.940
 money in the pot we should wait for a 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:28.160
 better situation to flirt 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.280
 and the problem is that later there 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.010
 a summary a proximity of someone 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.150
 that I already have numbers and it's not the most 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.470
 sure of the world but he's a safe guy 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.990
 then before that position because 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.700
 it is not the hand does not end there the hand I 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.620
 I could have him but still I 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.510
 the one that has gone up is behind 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.330
 my best option is to throw the all pull 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.510
 my letters because it's easy for me not to 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.280
 go ahead of the one who has summarized 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.810
 immediate was the unknown of the other 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.550
 I hope you have been clear with the 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.470
 analysis that you have to throw that hand 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.880
 even if it's a monster hand but not 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.560
 we have ability to shoot the 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.690
 rivals and the average expectation the 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.350
 showdown is doubtful so throw yourself 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.350
 always please
