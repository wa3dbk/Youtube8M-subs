 quickly your psychologist to nails and 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.159
 shorten long pieces without 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.839
 efforts such as closing your 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.909

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:01.539
 the clamping width of the master 700 can 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:04.660
 reach 435 mm and adjust easily 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:10.090
 using a crank it adjusts 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:11.980
 also in height from 780 to 950 mm 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.720
 new z shape with a clearance at 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.420
 leg level also helps to 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.980
 work sitting so you can also 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.980
 focus on a job 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.470
 precision adjustable height shims 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:27.370
 ensures better stability on a 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.900

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.180
 problem the fastening flanges provided 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.630
 hold the piece on the mdf board 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.370
 for a perfect cut result a 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.980
 drilling stand are also shown 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.619
 very easily for precise drilling 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.700
 on the workbench 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.680
 machining parts using 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.310
 clamping elements turns out just as 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.810
 simple you firmly block the pipes 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.590

 protection to get a clean cut 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.460
 or you tighten the piece vertically to 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.399
 using the dead clamping for the purpose of 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.679
 breakthrough stick to the ankles and on the 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.599
 master 700 you can also machine 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.340

 fixation adapts to the shape of the room 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.010
 to be machined for painting work 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.580
 anti-slip mounts guarantee 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.819
 optimal fixation of the room etac 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.930
 is reversible has a sharp phase 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.110
 perfect for laying a room freshly 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.700
 painted without damaging it 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.030
 it is thus possible to paint everything from 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.330
