00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
thing about xbox controller is that the

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.520 
thing about xbox controller is that the

Game<00:03:35.610> my<00:03:35.910> shots<00:03:36.530> hit<00:03:37.530> because<00:03:38.220> I'm<00:03:38.400> snapping

Game my shots hit because I'm snapping

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.280 
Game my shots hit because I'm snapping
on<00:03:39.300> target<00:03:39.690> a<00:03:39.840> lot<00:03:40.230> faster<00:03:40.530> now<00:03:41.269> I<00:03:42.269> happen<00:03:43.260> to

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
on target a lot faster now I happen to

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.870 
on target a lot faster now I happen to
think<00:03:43.380> a<00:03:43.709> lot<00:03:43.860> of<00:03:43.890> that<00:03:44.070> has<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.250> do<00:03:44.489> with<00:03:44.730> the

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
think a lot of that has to do with the

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.670 
think a lot of that has to do with the
with<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.269> fact<00:03:45.600> that<00:03:45.660> i<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.200> ps3

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
with the fact that i like the ps3

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.590 
with the fact that i like the ps3
controller<00:03:47.040> better<00:03:47.340> i<00:03:47.459> think<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:48.000> ps3

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
controller better i think the ps3

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.479 
controller better i think the ps3
controller<00:03:49.140> when<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.500> master<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.130> compared

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
controller when you master it compared

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.130 
controller when you master it compared
to<00:03:50.580> when<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:50.790> master<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.300> xbox<00:03:51.720> controller

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
to when you master the xbox controller

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.110 
to when you master the xbox controller
will<00:03:52.739> give<00:03:52.890> you<00:03:53.010> more<00:03:53.220> control<00:03:53.280> over<00:03:53.910> your

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
will give you more control over your

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.509 
will give you more control over your
character<00:03:54.720> however<00:03:55.320> i<00:03:55.590> think<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.010> xbox

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
character however i think the xbox

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.790 
character however i think the xbox
controller<00:03:57.060> is<00:03:57.390> easier<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:57.900> use<00:03:58.170> when<00:03:58.440> when

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
controller is easier to use when when

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.850 
controller is easier to use when when
you<00:03:58.920> first<00:03:59.130> pick<00:03:59.400> it<00:03:59.550> up<00:04:00.110> anyways<00:04:01.110> let's<00:04:01.739> talk

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
you first pick it up anyways let's talk

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.800 
you first pick it up anyways let's talk
about<00:04:02.010> something<00:04:02.250> else<00:04:02.430> as<00:04:02.670> far<00:04:02.700> as<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.090> the

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
about something else as far as the the

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.390 
about something else as far as the the
consoles<00:04:04.350> go<00:04:04.530> this<00:04:04.830> is<00:04:04.980> really<00:04:05.160> interesting

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
consoles go this is really interesting

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.830 
consoles go this is really interesting
and<00:04:05.850> it's<00:04:06.000> something<00:04:06.150> i<00:04:06.360> noticed<00:04:06.420> when<00:04:06.780> i

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
and it's something i noticed when i

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.430 
and it's something i noticed when i
first<00:04:07.170> switched<00:04:07.380> over<00:04:07.769> to<00:04:07.799> xbox<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:09.090> xbox

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
first switched over to xbox the xbox

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.560 
first switched over to xbox the xbox
gameplay<00:04:10.440> feels<00:04:10.739> a<00:04:11.010> little<00:04:11.280> more<00:04:11.580> smooth<00:04:12.209> and

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
gameplay feels a little more smooth and

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.010 
gameplay feels a little more smooth and
it<00:04:13.170> feels<00:04:13.380> like<00:04:13.680> the

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
it feels like the

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.340 
it feels like the
3<00:04:15.290> has<00:04:15.530> more<00:04:15.830> lag<00:04:16.130> to<00:04:16.489> it<00:04:16.720> I<00:04:17.720> don't<00:04:18.110> know<00:04:18.200> if

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
3 has more lag to it I don't know if

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.630 
3 has more lag to it I don't know if
that's<00:04:18.530> just<00:04:18.739> for<00:04:18.920> the<00:04:18.950> simple<00:04:19.310> fact<00:04:19.340> that

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
that's just for the simple fact that

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.610 
that's just for the simple fact that
there's<00:04:20.090> not<00:04:20.239> maybe<00:04:20.540> not<00:04:20.810> so<00:04:20.959> many<00:04:21.110> players<00:04:21.380> in

Elite levels on xbox are just overall
better<00:06:08.419> than<00:06:08.690> the<00:06:08.780> Elite<00:06:09.350> levels<00:06:09.500> on<00:06:09.770> the<00:06:09.890> ps3

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
which makes it which makes the xbox a

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.580 
which makes it which makes the xbox a
bit<00:06:29.300> harder<00:06:29.630> to<00:06:29.660> play<00:06:29.960> when<00:06:30.169> you<00:06:30.259> have<00:06:30.380> to<00:06:30.500> go
