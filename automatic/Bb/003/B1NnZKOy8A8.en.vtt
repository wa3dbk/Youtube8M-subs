00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
and then the one with a little divot in

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.819 
and then the one with a little divot in
the<00:00:44.040> side<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.899> is<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.079> operating<00:00:46.469> key

so for once we can take this thing out
and<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:50.129> take<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> look<00:00:51.149> at<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> core<00:00:52.100> now<00:00:53.100> all

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
and and take a look at the core now all

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.889 
and and take a look at the core now all
we<00:00:53.340> do<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.610> turn<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.969> about<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> quarter<00:00:54.870> of

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
we do is we turn it about a quarter of

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.110 
we do is we turn it about a quarter of
the<00:00:55.140> way<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.980> from<00:00:56.250> zero<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.670> turn<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.000> to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the way so from zero you turn it to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.580 
the way so from zero you turn it to
court<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.449> way<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.780> then<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.140> core<00:00:58.379> will

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
court of the way and then the core will

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.950 
court of the way and then the core will
come<00:00:58.770> out<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.280> if<00:00:59.940> you're<00:01:00.059> careful<00:01:00.329> none<00:01:00.870> of

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
come out and if you're careful none of

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.139 
come out and if you're careful none of
the<00:01:01.020> pieces<00:01:01.199> fly<00:01:01.620> off<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.820> what<00:01:03.000> you'll

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
the pieces fly off but what you'll

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.870 
the pieces fly off but what you'll
notice<00:01:03.359> about<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.589> lock<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:05.729> have

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
notice about this lock is that we have

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.960 
notice about this lock is that we have
two<00:01:06.180> locks<00:01:06.540> built<00:01:07.020> into<00:01:07.380> one<00:01:07.590> each<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.820> them

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
two locks built into one each of them

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.240 
two locks built into one each of them
has<00:01:09.180> an<00:01:09.330> independent<00:01:09.630> side<00:01:10.229> bar<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.040> side

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
has an independent side bar on the side

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.940 
has an independent side bar on the side
there<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.820> there's<00:01:12.000> one<00:01:12.270> side<00:01:12.540> bar<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.470> then

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
there so there's one side bar and then

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.460 
there so there's one side bar and then
there's<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.310> other<00:01:14.340> side<00:01:14.700> bar<00:01:15.030> now<00:01:15.689> when<00:01:16.320> we

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
there's the other side bar now when we

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.230 
there's the other side bar now when we
put<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.740> back<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.250> key<00:01:17.549> pops<00:01:17.880> out<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.180> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
put it back in this key pops out of the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.090 
put it back in this key pops out of the
bottom<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:19.049> when<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.290> pops<00:01:19.500> out<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.740> little<00:01:19.890> bit

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
bottom so when it pops out a little bit

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.030 
bottom so when it pops out a little bit
there<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:21.570> little<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> side<00:01:22.080> bar<00:01:22.320> cannot<00:01:22.770> be

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
there the little the side bar cannot be

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.350 
there the little the side bar cannot be
depressed<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.520> can't<00:01:23.729> get<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.939> back<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.240> there

depressed you can't get it back in there

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.840 
depressed you can't get it back in there
so<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.750> push<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.350> back<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.950> then

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
it slides right back into the core

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.289 
it slides right back into the core
hopefully<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.619> can<00:01:31.799> remove<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.310> key<00:01:32.520> it

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
and then without really paying attention

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.949

that and I actually raped this open
using<00:02:39.420> one<00:02:39.570> of<00:02:39.600> our<00:02:39.750> mundos<00:02:40.430> new<00:02:41.430> rakes<00:02:41.730> with<00:02:42.270> a

you<00:03:42.600> buy<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.870> thing<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.269> you<00:03:45.540> can<00:03:46.140> tell<00:03:46.320> the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
you buy the thing it is you can tell the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.960 
you buy the thing it is you can tell the
top<00:03:46.650> of<00:03:46.829> the<00:03:46.920> lock<00:03:47.070> it's<00:03:47.310> pretty<00:03:47.730> wide<00:03:47.940> open

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
top of the lock it's pretty wide open

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.870 
top of the lock it's pretty wide open
key<00:03:48.540> way<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.900> is<00:03:49.019> a<00:03:49.049> wafer<00:03:49.380> lock<00:03:49.709> so<00:03:50.400> pretty<00:03:50.670> old

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
key way it is a wafer lock so pretty old

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.550 
key way it is a wafer lock so pretty old
I<00:03:51.030> think<00:03:51.090> there's<00:03:51.420> a<00:03:51.450> little<00:03:51.570> dot<00:03:51.810> at<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.320> top

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
I think there's a little dot at the top

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.890 
I think there's a little dot at the top
to<00:03:52.799> mark<00:03:53.040> where<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.340> wafers<00:03:53.730> are<00:03:53.970> so<00:03:54.660> if<00:03:54.750> you

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
to mark where the wafers are so if you

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.970 
to mark where the wafers are so if you
don't<00:03:55.200> want<00:03:55.320> to<00:03:55.380> have<00:03:55.500> if<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.739> don't<00:03:55.799> have<00:03:55.950> a

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
don't want to have if you don't have a

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.069 
don't want to have if you don't have a
flashlight<00:03:56.220> just<00:03:56.670> look<00:03:56.820> for<00:03:56.940> that<00:03:57.030> little<00:03:57.209> dot

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
flashlight just look for that little dot

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.370 
flashlight just look for that little dot
and<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.440> should<00:03:58.650> get<00:03:58.769> you<00:03:58.950> in<00:03:59.040> there<00:04:00.380> alright

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
and that should get you in there alright

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.780 
and that should get you in there alright
let's<00:04:01.620> see<00:04:01.709> if<00:04:01.769> we<00:04:01.890> can<00:04:02.040> get<00:04:02.190> this<00:04:02.310> one<00:04:02.489> picked

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
let's see if we can get this one picked

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.600 
let's see if we can get this one picked
I<00:04:03.120> will<00:04:03.600> try<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:06.739> so<00:04:07.739> if<00:04:07.799> this<00:04:07.920> is<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.130> fat<00:04:08.459> one

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
I will try a so if this is a fat one

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.000 
I will try a so if this is a fat one
will<00:04:08.760> that<00:04:08.910> work<00:04:09.350> probably<00:04:10.350> not<00:04:10.500> not<00:04:10.739> fat

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
will that work probably not not fat

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.800 
will that work probably not not fat
enough<00:04:13.640> try<00:04:14.640> that<00:04:14.910> see<00:04:15.329> if<00:04:15.390> we<00:04:15.480> can<00:04:15.600> pick<00:04:15.780> a

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
enough try that see if we can pick a

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.729 
enough try that see if we can pick a
wafer<00:04:16.200> a<00:04:16.229> lock<00:04:16.410> today<00:04:16.709> I<00:04:16.979> will<00:04:17.310> try

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
wafer a lock today I will try

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.550 
wafer a lock today I will try
nice<00:04:19.739> fat<00:04:20.039> key<00:04:20.280> way<00:04:20.459> I'll<00:04:20.579> use<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:20.789> nice<00:04:21.090> fat

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
nice fat key way I'll use a nice fat

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.209 
nice fat key way I'll use a nice fat
25,000<00:04:22.560> spick

00:04:25.209 --> 00:04:25.219 

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:28.610 

see<00:04:26.219> if<00:04:26.310> we<00:04:26.460> can<00:04:27.020> get<00:04:28.020> in<00:04:28.139> here<00:04:28.169> without<00:04:28.349> the

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
see if we can get in here without the

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:46.459 
see if we can get in here without the
key<00:04:28.889> so<00:04:29.610> one<00:04:29.819> of<00:04:29.849> Steel<00:04:30.210> is<00:04:30.389> d7

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:46.469 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:50.129 

try<00:04:47.469> that<00:04:47.649> again<00:04:48.360> things<00:04:49.360> must<00:04:49.629> have<00:04:49.719> over<00:04:49.929> set

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
try that again things must have over set

00:04:50.139 --> 00:05:05.730 
try that again things must have over set
one<00:04:50.319> of<00:04:50.439> them

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.520 

there<00:05:06.740> we<00:05:06.860> go<00:05:07.010> so<00:05:07.850> if<00:05:07.910> you<00:05:08.030> have<00:05:08.150> a<00:05:08.180> g7<00:05:08.690> this<00:05:09.350> is

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
there we go so if you have a g7 this is

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.370 
there we go so if you have a g7 this is
probably<00:05:09.950> not<00:05:10.130> the<00:05:10.340> lock<00:05:10.580> you<00:05:10.820> want<00:05:11.000> to<00:05:11.090> use

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
probably not the lock you want to use

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.990 
probably not the lock you want to use
let's<00:05:12.380> let's<00:05:13.130> take<00:05:13.310> another<00:05:13.430> look<00:05:13.700> I<00:05:13.820> don't

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
let's let's take another look I don't

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.640 
let's let's take another look I don't
know<00:05:14.090> if<00:05:14.180> he's<00:05:14.300> repin<00:05:14.720> these<00:05:14.960> or<00:05:15.170> what<00:05:15.410> so

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
know if he's repin these or what so

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.810 
know if he's repin these or what so
we're<00:05:15.770> probably<00:05:15.860> going<00:05:16.130> to<00:05:16.190> really<00:05:16.490> screw

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
we're probably going to really screw

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.820 
we're probably going to really screw
this<00:05:16.990> video<00:05:17.990> up<00:05:18.200> and<00:05:18.380> let's<00:05:18.500> give<00:05:18.650> it<00:05:18.680> a<00:05:18.800> shot

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
this video up and let's give it a shot

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.470 
this video up and let's give it a shot
this<00:05:19.280> is<00:05:19.460> a<00:05:19.490> Yale<00:05:20.800> looks<00:05:21.800> pretty<00:05:22.100> old<00:05:22.160> I<00:05:22.730> get

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
this is a Yale looks pretty old I get

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:29.440 
this is a Yale looks pretty old I get
this<00:05:23.630> clamped<00:05:24.110> in<00:05:24.230> there<00:05:27.190> and<00:05:28.190> that's<00:05:28.910> if<00:05:29.240> we

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
this clamped in there and that's if we

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
this clamped in there and that's if we
can<00:05:29.710> fit<00:05:30.710> that<00:05:30.920> same<00:05:31.220> Pig<00:05:31.550> yeah<00:05:31.970> that'll<00:05:32.210> work

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
can fit that same Pig yeah that'll work

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.380 
can fit that same Pig yeah that'll work
and<00:05:33.470> it's<00:05:33.710> a<00:05:33.740> pretty<00:05:33.890> narrow<00:05:34.160> key<00:05:34.430> way<00:05:34.610> I<00:05:34.910> mean

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
and it's a pretty narrow key way I mean

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.120 
and it's a pretty narrow key way I mean
in<00:05:35.720> terms<00:05:35.930> of<00:05:36.110> profile<00:05:36.500> I'm<00:05:36.620> gonna<00:05:36.740> use<00:05:36.890> again

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
in terms of profile I'm gonna use again

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.770 
in terms of profile I'm gonna use again
a<00:05:37.160> twenty<00:05:37.490> five<00:05:37.640> thousand<00:05:38.120> sis<00:05:38.240> wide<00:05:38.480> it's

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
a twenty five thousand sis wide it's

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.660 
a twenty five thousand sis wide it's
just<00:05:38.930> not<00:05:39.080> very<00:05:39.290> tall<00:05:39.530> so<00:05:39.950> I'll<00:05:40.010> try<00:05:40.220> this<00:05:40.280> a

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.670 
just not very tall so I'll try this a

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.690 
just not very tall so I'll try this a
lot<00:05:41.480> of<00:05:41.570> these<00:05:41.660> Yale's<00:05:41.960> you<00:05:42.620> can<00:05:42.800> bully<00:05:43.190> them<00:05:43.460> I

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
lot of these Yale's you can bully them I

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.980 
lot of these Yale's you can bully them I
don't<00:05:43.850> know<00:05:44.090> if<00:05:44.210> this<00:05:44.330> will<00:05:44.450> be<00:05:44.480> the<00:05:44.570> case<00:05:44.780> he's

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
don't know if this will be the case he's

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.690 
don't know if this will be the case he's
probably<00:05:45.140> got<00:05:45.380> this<00:05:45.500> tricked<00:05:45.830> out<00:05:45.980> with<00:05:46.010> a<00:05:46.400> set

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
probably got this tricked out with a set

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.970 
probably got this tricked out with a set
pins<00:05:46.940> or<00:05:47.120> something<00:05:47.450> but<00:05:47.600> apply<00:05:48.530> pretty<00:05:48.740> good

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
pins or something but apply pretty good

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.350 
pins or something but apply pretty good
tension<00:05:49.370> and<00:05:49.580> then<00:05:49.760> just<00:05:49.940> kind<00:05:50.090> of<00:05:50.150> work<00:05:50.330> your

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
tension and then just kind of work your

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.480 
tension and then just kind of work your
way<00:05:50.510> down<00:05:50.600> the<00:05:50.870> stack<00:05:51.110> kind<00:05:51.500> of<00:05:51.590> bullying

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
way down the stack kind of bullying

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.830 
way down the stack kind of bullying
those<00:05:52.760> pins<00:05:53.090> sometimes<00:05:53.830> sometimes<00:05:54.830> it<00:05:54.950> works

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
those pins sometimes sometimes it works

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.120 
those pins sometimes sometimes it works
unless<00:05:56.840> of<00:05:57.110> course<00:05:57.140> he's<00:05:57.500> got<00:05:57.710> the<00:05:57.830> lock

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
unless of course he's got the lock

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:09.040 
unless of course he's got the lock
tricked<00:05:58.490> out<00:05:58.670> on<00:05:58.880> you

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.270 

and<00:06:10.050> there<00:06:10.230> he<00:06:10.320> hasn't<00:06:10.680> done<00:06:10.830> appear<00:06:11.130> to<00:06:11.220> be

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
and there he hasn't done appear to be

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.220 
and there he hasn't done appear to be
tricked<00:06:11.520> out<00:06:12.860> just<00:06:13.860> standard<00:06:14.700> Yale<00:06:15.120> it's<00:06:15.990> like

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.230 
tricked out just standard Yale it's like
