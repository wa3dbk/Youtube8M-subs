 takes a lack of injuries for the psp 3000 with the psp slim 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.029
 then another one came in that lent 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.659
 but that will be more integrated 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:36.559
 the sliding keyboard the psp go was a very well thought out concept and although not 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.030
 came to convince everyone the truth is that 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.180
 the reduced dimensions and the fact that you will no longer use disks to be able to 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.180
 studying reading videogames will give advantage 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.150
 e on base like this 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.410
 those of santi arisa 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.330
 they bounded 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.420
 this cuban 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.750
 to your new phone 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.350
 so they committed a phone is stronger 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.789
 this console for juanes but before being passed spores mazón one in the area 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.700
 it works with andrés despot operating system December 3 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.970
 has a layer that the eta insists is the one that has all the elements for 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.990
 complicate this time of year 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.729
 also updated the screen its screen is 4-inch touch with 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.579
 a resolution of 480 4,854 pixels 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.170
 It has a thickness of 16 millimeters 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.250
 it's pretty thin to be a console but a little thicker 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.490
 that there are most traffic lights 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.689
 It has a rate of 175 grams 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.840
 here is also a bit above the average of smartphones 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.920
 but of course it has a gigahertz processor 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.780
 that is not bad to be able to give the games enough power to be able to 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.740
 work and also you can play with a lot of speed integrated with processor 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.450
 Qualcomm still gigahertz this is complemented by a classic if 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.520
 independent let's talk a little more closely 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.920
 over here we have the power button on and off 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.220
 here we have the classic buttons the r &amp; b playstation consoles 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.600
 here we have the two volume buttons 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.989
 or now that we have the connection mikel buesa arena to be able to synchronize and 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.290
 to be able to recharge and here we have the connect minileaks to be able 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.489
 connect headphones 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.859
 in the back we find a 5 megapixel camera 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.249
 with a led flash 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.279
 the camera has genetic status 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:29.589
 it also has an image stabilizer and to another focus we also have a camera 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:33.889
 in the front that exists that serves for videoconferences and for what is 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:37.489
 it happens in sales but we go with the big difference at the foot its function as 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.589
 console here we have a small logo what does it mean that it is 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:43.649
 typified by pli extinction 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:48.009
 which means that the experience of those who say moves in the 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.979
 best possible conditions to the mobiles that you are sure that results 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.329
 more familiar 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.139
 these are the buttons of indigestion and these are the death engines 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.080
 also added to reduce the thickness 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.000
 two face optical traps for each of the struts here we have the 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.109
 buttons destatis l 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.209
 and here we have a little button of adjustments it would seem that there are those up to three 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.269
 different ways of playing the first one is with the controls what odes just 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.639
 comment the second is using the touch screen 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.469
 for certain games and the third are used in their motion sensors 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:23.679
 gyroscopes and accelerometers 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:27.229
 how could it be otherwise in the case of sanitat and nancy 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:30.229
 two good speakers these are the outputs 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:34.359
 If we remove the lid we can also find the micro card slot 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:39.749
 sd juan kills cards up to 32 gigs but comes with batteries and bodily 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:45.109
 and you will all be asking good ikea games who is good as you can 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.879
 get in several ways first in android market the typical games that 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.799
 they have android and then also to remake thesis tenacity few that are 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.909
 optimized to be able to use them 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.349
 in this same source and in addition you have a platform of takeoff decision 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.849
 poker 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.489
 where you can find a lot of games including the originals of the 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.059
 3ds console 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:09.999
 that console that the sony ones got out at the beginning because that to me the 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:13.469
 game experience I really like that it has all the games that we 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:15.019
 like for the moment 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.880
 but the economy is very good and it weighs a lot to be able to 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:24.090
 Trouble playing but beware if you play a lot with him bugles to stay soon without 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.270
 battery that case of the defects and by the many there agreements you stay without 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.330
 autonomies as it is more man that is precise poured that has behind 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.300
 android this height of what could be expected as console maybe we throw in 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.999
 lack that has a little more power and finally its price 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:46.009
 Libya are 649 euros a price that is up to the high phones 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:47.440
 range of other brands 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.470
 but that if we consider its orientation to young people it turns out 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.550
 quite elevated 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.080
 so if you want to get a tennis player but it's a contract that 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.180
 surely with it will come out quite cheaper and you know that yes it knows 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.250
 more I am mobile or on any other time the floor that happens the mister and 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.729
 gypsies in which technology is easy and fun until the 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:07.469
 next day wins
