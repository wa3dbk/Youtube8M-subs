00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
flower our work surface and then we're

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.020 
flower our work surface and then we're
going<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:15.260> roll<00:03:15.560> this<00:03:16.310> piece<00:03:16.580> of<00:03:16.730> dough<00:03:16.879> out

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
going to roll this piece of dough out

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.220 
going to roll this piece of dough out
until<00:03:17.420> it's<00:03:17.569> very<00:03:17.659> very<00:03:18.170> nice<00:03:18.409> and<00:03:18.709> thin<00:03:18.860> so<00:03:20.230> I

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
until it's very very nice and thin so I

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.660 
until it's very very nice and thin so I
rolled<00:03:21.530> right<00:03:21.709> now<00:03:21.830> out<00:03:22.010> into<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:22.400> very<00:03:22.580> large

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
rolled right now out into a very large

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.880 
rolled right now out into a very large
rectangle<00:03:23.569> and<00:03:23.659> the<00:03:23.750> dough<00:03:23.900> is<00:03:24.080> fairly<00:03:24.440> thin

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
rectangle and the dough is fairly thin

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.500 
rectangle and the dough is fairly thin
and<00:03:25.159> now<00:03:25.430> we're<00:03:25.579> going<00:03:25.670> to<00:03:25.730> take<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.000> two<00:03:26.269> inch

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
and now we're going to take a two inch

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.270 
and now we're going to take a two inch
circle<00:03:27.049> cookie<00:03:27.470> cutter<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:27.980> we're<00:03:28.099> going<00:03:28.220> to

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
circle cookie cutter and we're going to

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.869 
circle cookie cutter and we're going to
cut<00:03:28.519> out<00:03:28.700> circles<00:03:29.269> all<00:03:29.690> across<00:03:30.049> our<00:03:30.230> dough<00:03:33.879> our

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
cut out circles all across our dough our

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.149 
cut out circles all across our dough our
next<00:03:35.420> step<00:03:35.599> is<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:35.900> place<00:03:36.079> one<00:03:36.470> teaspoon<00:03:37.040> of

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
next step is to place one teaspoon of

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:44.960 
next step is to place one teaspoon of
filling<00:03:37.310> into<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.760> center<00:03:38.239> of<00:03:38.269> each<00:03:38.629> circle
