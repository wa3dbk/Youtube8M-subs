00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
pretty thin so that it's pliable but at

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.200 
pretty thin so that it's pliable but at
the<00:00:49.620> same<00:00:49.770> time<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.250> got<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.489> little<00:00:50.940> bit<00:00:51.059> to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
the same time it's got a little bit to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.750 
the same time it's got a little bit to
it<00:00:51.329> because<00:00:51.480> we're<00:00:51.600> gonna<00:00:51.690> be<00:00:52.579> marking<00:00:53.579> it

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
it because we're gonna be marking it

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.619 
it because we're gonna be marking it
with<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.920> marker<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.910> that's<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.360> that's<00:00:57.480> your

with a marker and that's it that's your

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.200 
with a marker and that's it that's your
three<00:00:57.899> items<00:00:58.370> you<00:00:59.370> could<00:00:59.579> use<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> ruler<00:01:00.030> but

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
three items you could use a ruler but

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.939 
three items you could use a ruler but
we're<00:01:00.359> not<00:01:00.480> even<00:01:00.629> going<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.780> need<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.199> first

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
we're not even going to need one first

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.399 
we're not even going to need one first
things<00:01:02.190> first<00:01:02.280> let's<00:01:03.270> check<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.660> scale<00:01:03.960> of

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
things first let's check the scale of

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.929 
things first let's check the scale of
our<00:01:04.619> map<00:01:05.990> that's<00:01:06.990> important<00:01:07.549> you<00:01:08.549> will<00:01:08.640> find

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
our map that's important you will find

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.800 
our map that's important you will find
it<00:01:09.060> usually<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.659> several<00:01:10.140> locations<00:01:11.630> you<00:01:12.630> see

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
it usually in several locations you see

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.760 
it usually in several locations you see
ours<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:14.490> back<00:01:14.790> here<00:01:15.119> as<00:01:15.330> well<00:01:15.689> as<00:01:15.960> on

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
ours is on the back here as well as on

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.520 
ours is on the back here as well as on
both<00:01:17.369> sides<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.299> actual<00:01:18.720> map<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.290> here's

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
both sides of the actual map and here's

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.810 
both sides of the actual map and here's
one<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> corner<00:01:20.130> there<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.369> let's<00:01:20.670> focus

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
one in the corner there so let's focus

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.660 
one in the corner there so let's focus
in<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:24.860> there<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.220> got<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> scale

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
in on that there it is you got the scale

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.090 
in on that there it is you got the scale
now<00:01:26.850> I'll<00:01:27.030> tell<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.360> straight<00:01:27.689> up<00:01:27.799> all<00:01:28.799> maps

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
now I'll tell you straight up all maps

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.499 
now I'll tell you straight up all maps
are<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> little<00:01:29.460> bit<00:01:29.610> different<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.150> check

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
are a little bit different so you check

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.319 
are a little bit different so you check
that<00:01:30.540> out<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.320> sure<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:32.490> every<00:01:33.119> inch

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
that out for sure on this one every inch

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.420 
that out for sure on this one every inch
is<00:01:33.600> 1.1<00:01:34.530> miles<00:01:34.829> now<00:01:35.189> like<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.640> said<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.909> could

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.270 

you<00:01:40.430> get<00:01:40.610> a<00:01:40.640> roller<00:01:40.939> out<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:41.710> measure<00:01:42.710> with

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
you get a roller out and measure with

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.609 
you get a roller out and measure with
that<00:01:43.490> but<00:01:43.880> everything<00:01:44.869> you<00:01:45.049> need<00:01:45.200> is<00:01:45.409> right

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
that but everything you need is right

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.780 
that but everything you need is right

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
there on the guide now you probably have

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.999 
there on the guide now you probably have
an<00:01:49.940> idea<00:01:50.180> already<00:01:50.360> of<00:01:50.600> how<00:01:50.690> long<00:01:51.140> of<00:01:51.530> a<00:01:51.740> loop

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
an idea already of how long of a loop

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.760 
an idea already of how long of a loop
you<00:01:52.250> want<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:52.520> do<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:53.420> you<00:01:53.479> pick<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.320> total

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
you want to do so you pick the total

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.249 
you want to do so you pick the total
loop<00:01:54.890> length<00:01:55.130> you<00:01:55.280> want<00:01:55.720> in<00:01:56.720> my<00:01:56.869> case<00:01:57.080> it<00:01:57.229> was

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
loop length you want in my case it was

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.230 
loop length you want in my case it was
40<00:01:57.649> miles<00:01:57.860> so<00:01:58.520> you're<00:01:58.670> going<00:01:58.789> to<00:01:58.850> simply

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
40 miles so you're going to simply

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.969 
40 miles so you're going to simply
measure<00:01:59.750> out<00:02:00.049> a<00:02:00.080> piece<00:02:00.320> of<00:02:00.500> string<00:02:00.710> that

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
measure out a piece of string that

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.630 
measure out a piece of string that
equals<00:02:01.399> 40<00:02:02.149> miles<00:02:02.890> we'll<00:02:03.890> do<00:02:04.039> that<00:02:04.220> right<00:02:04.280> now

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
equals 40 miles we'll do that right now

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.910 
equals 40 miles we'll do that right now
now<00:02:04.909> you<00:02:04.940> could<00:02:05.330> just<00:02:05.380> measure<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.710> whole

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
now you could just measure the whole

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.790 
now you could just measure the whole
string<00:02:07.490> out<00:02:07.759> like<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.600> said<00:02:08.810> in<00:02:09.080> one<00:02:09.319> in<00:02:09.770> one

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
string out like I said in one in one

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.199 
string out like I said in one in one
shot<00:02:10.250> but<00:02:10.880> I<00:02:11.410> want<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.739> have<00:02:13.700> some<00:02:13.910> sort<00:02:14.060> of

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
shot but I want to have some sort of

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.500 
shot but I want to have some sort of
incremental<00:02:14.420> system<00:02:15.050> on<00:02:15.200> there<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:17.330> do

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
incremental system on there and to do

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.320 
incremental system on there and to do
that<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:18.110> will<00:02:18.590> mark<00:02:18.830> off<00:02:19.010> little<00:02:19.280> segments<00:02:19.880> you

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
that I will mark off little segments you

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.449 
that I will mark off little segments you
can<00:02:20.360> pick<00:02:20.720> any<00:02:20.930> increments<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.860> want<00:02:22.100> in<00:02:22.310> my

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
can pick any increments you want in my

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.830 
can pick any increments you want in my
case<00:02:22.700> I'm<00:02:22.850> doing<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:23.090> three<00:02:23.269> night<00:02:23.390> trip<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.810> I

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
case I'm doing a three night trip and I

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.650 
case I'm doing a three night trip and I
want<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:24.019> do<00:02:24.080> around<00:02:24.260> 15<00:02:24.709> miles<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.160> day<00:02:25.190> so<00:02:26.000> I

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
want to do around 15 miles a day so I

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.140 
want to do around 15 miles a day so I
think<00:02:26.810> I'm<00:02:27.290> gonna<00:02:27.410> pick<00:02:27.730> increments<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.850> three

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
think I'm gonna pick increments of three

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.670 
think I'm gonna pick increments of three
miles<00:02:29.390> that<00:02:29.690> I'll<00:02:29.810> mark<00:02:30.049> off<00:02:30.200> because<00:02:30.440> that's

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
miles that I'll mark off because that's

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.600 
miles that I'll mark off because that's
divisible<00:02:30.950> by<00:02:31.220> 15<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:32.390> all<00:02:32.750> you're<00:02:32.930> gonna<00:02:33.049> do

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
divisible by 15 so all you're gonna do

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.470 
divisible by 15 so all you're gonna do
is<00:02:34.610> hold<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:34.880> down<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:36.970> I'm<00:02:37.970> just<00:02:38.239> going<00:02:38.390> to

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
is hold that down and I'm just going to

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.759 
is hold that down and I'm just going to
put<00:02:38.600> a<00:02:38.630> little<00:02:38.810> dot<00:02:39.019> on<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.380> string<00:02:39.680> for<00:02:40.489> each

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
put a little dot on the string for each

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.210 
put a little dot on the string for each
three<00:02:42.769> my<00:02:43.220> own<00:02:43.400> section<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.799> I'll<00:02:45.799> just<00:02:46.010> keep

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
three my own section and I'll just keep

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.910 
three my own section and I'll just keep
repeating<00:02:46.400> until<00:02:46.940> I<00:02:47.690> get<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.549> 40<00:02:49.549> miles<00:02:50.920> that's

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
repeating until I get to 40 miles that's

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.490 
repeating until I get to 40 miles that's
it<00:02:52.100> just<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.430> little<00:02:52.549> dab<00:02:52.790> on<00:02:53.060> there<00:02:53.299> and<00:02:53.660> at<00:02:54.380> the

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
it just a little dab on there and at the

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.910 
it just a little dab on there and at the
end<00:02:55.000> you'll<00:02:56.000> get<00:02:56.120> your<00:02:56.299> knife<00:02:56.650> cut<00:02:57.650> your<00:02:57.769> piece

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
end you'll get your knife cut your piece

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.729 
end you'll get your knife cut your piece
of<00:02:57.950> string<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:59.859> there<00:03:00.859> it<00:03:01.010> is<00:03:01.100> in<00:03:01.730> my<00:03:01.970> case<00:03:02.239> a

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
of string and there it is in my case a

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.180 
of string and there it is in my case a
40<00:03:03.739> mile<00:03:04.000> long<00:03:05.000> piece<00:03:05.630> of<00:03:05.900> string<00:03:06.130> okay<00:03:07.130> so

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
40 mile long piece of string okay so

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.699 
40 mile long piece of string okay so
this<00:03:07.700> represents<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.630> entire<00:03:08.900> length<00:03:09.170> of<00:03:09.440> my

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
this represents the entire length of my

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.190 
this represents the entire length of my
trip<00:03:09.980> as<00:03:10.160> per<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:10.820> scale<00:03:11.060> of<00:03:11.180> this<00:03:11.359> map<00:03:11.570> let's

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
trip as per to scale of this map let's

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.110 
trip as per to scale of this map let's
spread<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.560> map<00:03:12.709> out<00:03:12.890> if<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:13.430> look<00:03:13.609> each<00:03:13.880> one

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
spread the map out if you look each one

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.819 
spread the map out if you look each one
of<00:03:14.209> these<00:03:14.299> little<00:03:14.570> dots<00:03:14.780> represents<00:03:15.680> a

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
of these little dots represents a

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.270 
of these little dots represents a
segment<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:16.930> in<00:03:17.930> between<00:03:18.079> them<00:03:18.470> will<00:03:18.859> be<00:03:19.040> a

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
segment and in between them will be a

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.130 
segment and in between them will be a
red<00:03:19.519> number<00:03:19.880> indicating<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.510> mileage<00:03:20.870> so

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
red number indicating the mileage so

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.050 
red number indicating the mileage so
this<00:03:21.410> is<00:03:21.560> a<00:03:21.590> National<00:03:22.040> Geographic<00:03:22.070> map<00:03:22.790> but

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
this is a National Geographic map but

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.190 
this is a National Geographic map but
they're<00:03:23.480> all<00:03:23.570> going<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.750> have<00:03:23.810> a<00:03:23.900> similar

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
they're all going to have a similar

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.650 
they're all going to have a similar
system<00:03:24.620> so<00:03:25.430> first<00:03:25.760> I<00:03:25.910> was<00:03:26.060> going<00:03:26.269> through<00:03:26.420> and

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
system so first I was going through and

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.050 
system so first I was going through and
saying<00:03:26.810> oh<00:03:27.019> this<00:03:27.350> you<00:03:28.160> know<00:03:28.280> loop<00:03:28.579> might<00:03:28.820> look

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
saying oh this you know loop might look

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.020 
saying oh this you know loop might look
good<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:30.650> then<00:03:30.920> go<00:03:31.100> through<00:03:31.370> by<00:03:31.489> hand<00:03:31.519> and<00:03:31.910> add

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
good and then go through by hand and add

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.610 
good and then go through by hand and add
up<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.209> little<00:03:32.450> all<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:33.019> little<00:03:33.230> pieces<00:03:33.440> of

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
up a little all the little pieces of

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.289 
up a little all the little pieces of
segments<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.310> then<00:03:34.400> go<00:03:34.549> oh<00:03:34.579> that<00:03:34.910> works<00:03:35.120> so

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
segments and then go oh that works so

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.670 
segments and then go oh that works so
that<00:03:35.329> doesn't<00:03:35.900> work<00:03:36.079> and<00:03:36.350> it<00:03:36.440> just<00:03:36.590> got

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
that doesn't work and it just got

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.509 
that doesn't work and it just got
tedious<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.340> it<00:03:37.790> didn't<00:03:38.090> really<00:03:38.239> do<00:03:38.480> much<00:03:39.350> for

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
tedious and it didn't really do much for

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.059 
tedious and it didn't really do much for
creativity<00:03:40.519> so<00:03:40.850> with<00:03:41.329> this<00:03:41.540> method<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.140> can

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
creativity so with this method you can

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.330 
creativity so with this method you can
look<00:03:43.250> at<00:03:43.430> routes<00:03:44.680> real<00:03:45.680> quickly<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:46.160> you<00:03:46.220> can

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
look at routes real quickly and you can

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.770 
look at routes real quickly and you can
get<00:03:46.430> as<00:03:46.549> fine<00:03:46.760> as<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:46.970> want<00:03:47.209> now<00:03:47.389> you<00:03:47.419> got<00:03:47.630> to

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
get as fine as you want now you got to

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.780 
get as fine as you want now you got to
keep<00:03:48.049> in<00:03:48.260> mind<00:03:48.470> that<00:03:48.650> all<00:03:48.769> those<00:03:48.979> little<00:03:49.040> nooks

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
keep in mind that all those little nooks

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.320 
keep in mind that all those little nooks
and<00:03:49.970> crannies<00:03:50.359> there<00:03:50.570> they<00:03:50.780> add

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
and crannies there they add

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.590 
and crannies there they add
so<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.570> closer<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:52.140> you<00:03:52.260> follow<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:53.600> trail

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
so the closer that you follow this trail

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.650 
so the closer that you follow this trail
with<00:03:55.590> your<00:03:55.800> string<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.970> more<00:03:57.150> accurate<00:03:57.570> your

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
with your string the more accurate your

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.600 
with your string the more accurate your
mileage<00:03:57.990> is<00:03:58.110> going<00:03:58.320> to<00:03:58.380> be<00:03:58.500> but<00:03:59.070> in<00:03:59.520> the

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
mileage is going to be but in the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.680 
mileage is going to be but in the
beginning<00:04:00.000> you're<00:04:00.150> just<00:04:00.300> looking<00:04:00.510> for<00:04:00.540> a

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
beginning you're just looking for a

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.360 
beginning you're just looking for a
rough<00:04:00.930> idea<00:04:01.140> so<00:04:01.500> you<00:04:01.530> can<00:04:01.710> quickly<00:04:01.950> rule<00:04:02.340> out

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
rough idea so you can quickly rule out

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.210 
rough idea so you can quickly rule out
stuff<00:04:03.330> you<00:04:03.810> know<00:04:03.960> quickly<00:04:04.230> with<00:04:04.530> your<00:04:04.710> loop<00:04:04.920> of

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
stuff you know quickly with your loop of

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.100 
stuff you know quickly with your loop of
string<00:04:05.820> like<00:04:06.150> for<00:04:06.300> instance<00:04:06.600> let's<00:04:06.810> say<00:04:06.930> we're

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
string like for instance let's say we're

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.200 
string like for instance let's say we're
starting<00:04:07.350> down<00:04:07.440> in<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.920> Newfound<00:04:08.790> Gap<00:04:08.880> area

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
starting down in the Newfound Gap area

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.720 
starting down in the Newfound Gap area
and<00:04:09.780> I'm<00:04:10.020> not<00:04:10.230> going<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:10.490> do<00:04:11.490> anything

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
and I'm not going to do anything

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.610 
and I'm not going to do anything
realistic<00:04:12.420> so<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.660> logistics<00:04:13.200> of<00:04:13.290> this<00:04:13.410> might

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
realistic so the logistics of this might

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.020 
realistic so the logistics of this might
be<00:04:13.650> off<00:04:13.860> but<00:04:14.070> let's<00:04:14.160> just<00:04:14.340> say<00:04:14.490> for<00:04:14.520> example

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
be off but let's just say for example

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.100 
be off but let's just say for example
we're<00:04:15.150> starting<00:04:15.480> there<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:15.720> we<00:04:15.780> want<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:15.990> do<00:04:16.080> a

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
we're starting there and we want to do a

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.800 
we're starting there and we want to do a
loop<00:04:16.350> you<00:04:17.190> can<00:04:17.400> tell<00:04:17.640> real<00:04:17.970> quickly<00:04:18.239> that<00:04:18.600> a

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
loop you can tell real quickly that a

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.390 
loop you can tell real quickly that a
loop<00:04:19.049> all<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.380> way<00:04:19.470> up<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:19.739> Waterville<00:04:20.190> and

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
loop all the way up to Waterville and

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.610 
loop all the way up to Waterville and
back<00:04:20.690> is<00:04:21.690> not<00:04:21.959> going<00:04:22.019> to<00:04:22.260> work

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
back is not going to work

back is not going to work
the<00:04:22.920> string<00:04:23.280> doesn't<00:04:23.670> make<00:04:23.760> any<00:04:23.940> more<00:04:24.120> near<00:04:24.330> so

the string doesn't make any more near so

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.540 
the string doesn't make any more near so
you<00:04:24.660> know<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:24.960> have<00:04:25.170> to<00:04:25.290> adjust<00:04:25.410> so<00:04:26.190> it<00:04:26.370> just

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
you know you have to adjust so it just

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.330 
you know you have to adjust so it just
maybe<00:04:26.820> tighten<00:04:27.330> it<00:04:27.510> in<00:04:27.630> a<00:04:27.750> little<00:04:27.990> bit<00:04:28.140> and<00:04:28.830> you

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
maybe tighten it in a little bit and you

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.040 
maybe tighten it in a little bit and you
can<00:04:29.520> quickly<00:04:29.700> tell<00:04:30.120> that<00:04:30.330> you're<00:04:30.540> probably

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
can quickly tell that you're probably

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.020 
can quickly tell that you're probably
going<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:31.530> have<00:04:31.710> to<00:04:31.740> cut<00:04:32.220> over<00:04:32.400> somewhere

for instance and as you start to follow
more<00:04:39.360> closely<00:04:39.660> you'll<00:04:39.960> realize<00:04:40.290> you<00:04:40.410> have<00:04:40.530> to

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
more closely you'll realize you have to

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.680 
more closely you'll realize you have to
tighten<00:04:40.800> it<00:04:40.950> in<00:04:41.040> an<00:04:41.130> even<00:04:41.250> more<00:04:41.700> but<00:04:42.450> you're

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
tighten it in an even more but you're

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.800 
tighten it in an even more but you're
quickly<00:04:43.050> going<00:04:43.200> to<00:04:43.290> be<00:04:43.380> able<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.590> knock<00:04:43.830> out

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
quickly going to be able to knock out

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.260 
quickly going to be able to knock out
just<00:04:45.810> general<00:04:46.290> loop<00:04:46.530> ideas<00:04:47.070> and<00:04:47.400> formations

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
just general loop ideas and formations

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.230 
just general loop ideas and formations
that<00:04:48.690> will<00:04:48.900> or<00:04:49.080> work<00:04:49.260> won't<00:04:49.620> work<00:04:49.980> and<00:04:50.670> the

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
that will or work won't work and the

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.910 
that will or work won't work and the
reason<00:04:51.570> it's<00:04:51.780> good<00:04:51.990> to<00:04:52.110> have<00:04:52.260> all<00:04:52.320> her<00:04:52.740> little

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
reason it's good to have all her little

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.420 
reason it's good to have all her little
dots<00:04:53.850> on<00:04:54.090> there<00:04:54.320> is<00:04:55.320> because<00:04:55.800> when<00:04:56.220> we<00:04:56.310> get

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
dots on there is because when we get

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.680 
dots on there is because when we get
into<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:56.760> fine-tuning

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
into the fine-tuning

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.230 
into the fine-tuning
we'll<00:04:58.590> start<00:04:58.919> following<00:04:59.190> nice<00:04:59.610> and<00:04:59.820> closely

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
we'll start following nice and closely

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.840 
we'll start following nice and closely
you<00:05:00.870> see<00:05:01.110> you<00:05:01.919> can<00:05:02.010> get<00:05:02.190> as<00:05:02.340> detailed<00:05:02.580> as<00:05:02.820> you

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
you see you can get as detailed as you

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.670 
you see you can get as detailed as you
want<00:05:02.940> because<00:05:03.210> once<00:05:03.720> you<00:05:03.900> get<00:05:04.110> a<00:05:04.350> root<00:05:04.650> that

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
want because once you get a root that

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.530 
want because once you get a root that
you<00:05:04.919> know<00:05:05.220> you<00:05:05.820> really<00:05:05.850> want<00:05:06.240> to<00:05:06.300> look<00:05:06.390> into

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
you know you really want to look into

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.420 
you know you really want to look into
then<00:05:07.020> you<00:05:07.290> can<00:05:07.470> break<00:05:07.650> out<00:05:07.830> the<00:05:07.980> calculator

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
then you can break out the calculator

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.130 
then you can break out the calculator
and<00:05:08.580> really<00:05:08.940> add<00:05:09.060> things<00:05:09.360> up<00:05:09.540> and<00:05:09.690> see<00:05:09.870> for

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
and really add things up and see for

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.190 
and really add things up and see for
sure<00:05:10.169> what<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.220> mileage<00:05:11.580> is<00:05:11.760> or<00:05:12.540> your<00:05:12.810> mapping

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
sure what the mileage is or your mapping

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.430 
sure what the mileage is or your mapping
somewhere<00:05:13.830> but<00:05:14.750> you're<00:05:15.750> just<00:05:15.930> gonna<00:05:16.080> kind<00:05:16.380> of

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
somewhere but you're just gonna kind of

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.700 
somewhere but you're just gonna kind of
stick<00:05:16.710> it<00:05:17.120> for<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.210> most<00:05:18.360> part<00:05:18.690> as<00:05:19.200> close<00:05:19.560> as

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
stick it for the most part as close as

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.710 
stick it for the most part as close as
you<00:05:19.950> want<00:05:20.160> and<00:05:20.340> as<00:05:20.550> you<00:05:20.730> go<00:05:20.880> each<00:05:21.180> time<00:05:21.419> you<00:05:21.540> hit

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
you want and as you go each time you hit

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.040 
you want and as you go each time you hit
one<00:05:22.440> of<00:05:22.470> these<00:05:22.800> black<00:05:23.640> dots<00:05:23.970> you're<00:05:24.960> gonna

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
one of these black dots you're gonna

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.159 
one of these black dots you're gonna
know<00:05:25.290> you<00:05:25.350> want<00:05:25.650> another<00:05:25.860> three<00:05:26.160> miles<00:05:26.370> so<00:05:27.210> in

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
know you want another three miles so in

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.890 
know you want another three miles so in
my<00:05:28.380> case<00:05:28.650> you<00:05:29.550> know<00:05:29.669> let's<00:05:30.090> say<00:05:30.390> you<00:05:30.450> keep

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
my case you know let's say you keep

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.750 
my case you know let's say you keep
going<00:05:31.350> and<00:05:32.240> you're<00:05:33.240> following<00:05:33.480> your<00:05:34.250> map<00:05:35.250> here

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.720 
going and you're following your map here
roughly<00:05:36.270> you<00:05:36.930> finally<00:05:37.350> get<00:05:37.500> up<00:05:37.680> to<00:05:37.919> tri-corner

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
roughly you finally get up to tri-corner

roughly you finally get up to tri-corner
Knob<00:05:38.970> you<00:05:39.840> see<00:05:40.050> a<00:05:40.080> dot<00:05:40.380> there<00:05:40.680> and<00:05:41.419> you<00:05:42.419> can<00:05:42.540> let

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
Knob you see a dot there and you can let

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.270 
Knob you see a dot there and you can let
this<00:05:42.810> go<00:05:42.990> loose<00:05:43.200> once<00:05:43.440> you've<00:05:43.590> passed<00:05:43.770> it<00:05:44.040> you

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
this go loose once you've passed it you

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.080 
this go loose once you've passed it you
take<00:05:44.490> a<00:05:44.520> look<00:05:44.760> back<00:05:44.970> and<00:05:45.330> you<00:05:45.450> go<00:05:45.480> one<00:05:46.110> two

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
take a look back and you go one two

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.950 
take a look back and you go one two
three<00:05:48.140> four<00:05:49.610> four<00:05:50.610> three<00:05:50.669> miles<00:05:51.330> segments<00:05:51.810> so

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
three four four three miles segments so

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.540 
three four four three miles segments so
I<00:05:51.990> know<00:05:52.169> that<00:05:52.380> from<00:05:52.890> a<00:05:53.610> newfound<00:05:54.270> gap<00:05:54.450> to

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
I know that from a newfound gap to

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.880 
I know that from a newfound gap to
tri-corner<00:05:56.550> knob<00:05:57.390> is<00:05:57.690> roughly<00:05:58.260> twelve<00:05:58.620> miles

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
tri-corner knob is roughly twelve miles

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.560 
tri-corner knob is roughly twelve miles
and<00:05:59.220> then<00:05:59.550> I<00:05:59.760> could<00:05:59.940> get<00:06:00.060> the<00:06:00.120> calculator<00:06:00.300> out

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
and then I could get the calculator out

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.600 
and then I could get the calculator out
and<00:06:00.720> really<00:06:01.080> find<00:06:01.289> out<00:06:01.410> so<00:06:02.039> that<00:06:02.340> might<00:06:02.580> be

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
and really find out so that might be

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.040 
and really find out so that might be
where<00:06:02.970> I<00:06:03.000> want<00:06:03.150> to<00:06:03.270> stay<00:06:03.390> that<00:06:03.539> night

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
where I want to stay that night

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.680 
where I want to stay that night
and<00:06:04.139> then<00:06:04.500> I'll<00:06:04.650> say<00:06:04.860> I'll<00:06:05.190> cut<00:06:05.460> along<00:06:05.729> this

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
and then I'll say I'll cut along this

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:13.100 
and then I'll say I'll cut along this
awesome<00:06:08.000> trail<00:06:09.000> here<00:06:09.830> and<00:06:11.629> just<00:06:12.629> kind<00:06:12.870> of<00:06:12.930> keep

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
awesome trail here and just kind of keep

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.930 
awesome trail here and just kind of keep
on<00:06:13.379> going<00:06:13.800> and<00:06:13.979> obviously<00:06:14.370> I'm<00:06:14.490> going<00:06:14.639> fast

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
on going and obviously I'm going fast

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.399 
on going and obviously I'm going fast
for<00:06:15.180> the<00:06:15.240> camera<00:06:15.569> you<00:06:15.690> can<00:06:15.840> be<00:06:15.960> a<00:06:15.990> little<00:06:16.169> more

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.409 
for the camera you can be a little more

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:17.839 
for the camera you can be a little more
in<00:06:16.500> depth<00:06:16.740> with<00:06:16.830> how<00:06:17.159> you're<00:06:17.370> following<00:06:17.759> the

in depth with how you're following the

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:19.309 
in depth with how you're following the
trail<00:06:18.060> but<00:06:18.210> I<00:06:18.330> think<00:06:18.509> you<00:06:18.599> get<00:06:18.720> the<00:06:18.750> point<00:06:19.020> and

trail but I think you get the point and

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:21.469 
trail but I think you get the point and
you<00:06:20.190> can<00:06:20.340> start<00:06:20.550> looking<00:06:20.639> around<00:06:20.940> okay<00:06:21.330> I've

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
you can start looking around okay I've

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.420 
you can start looking around okay I've
gone<00:06:21.629> to<00:06:21.840> another<00:06:21.930> nine<00:06:22.289> miles<00:06:22.590> I<00:06:22.889> want<00:06:23.370> to

gone to another nine miles I want to
start<00:06:23.580> looking<00:06:23.909> around<00:06:24.000> here<00:06:24.360> for<00:06:24.569> a<00:06:24.599> campsite

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:25.129 
start looking around here for a campsite

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:30.409 
start looking around here for a campsite
look<00:06:26.129> there's<00:06:26.370> one<00:06:27.229> height<00:06:28.229> bald<00:06:28.560> and<00:06:29.210> I<00:06:30.210> can
