00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.060
 in this small video we will illustrate 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.010
 briefly how an engine works a 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.139
 vapor 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.210
 the steam enters from this conduit 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.100
 through these tubes and the arrives 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:20.340
 piston where you put the piston in motion 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.380
 a horizontal movement that occurs 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.830
 thanks to circular movement thanks 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.880
 to the connecting rod connected to the python for 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.880
 half of a pin the rod rai action 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.270
 true elbow that allows movement 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.040
 of the wheel always the movement of the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.040
 rotates around the scroll bar 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.230
 the scroll bar transforms the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.700
 movement the circular in horizontal and 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.760
 starts the valve of 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.949
 distribution of the marmora of 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.559
 distribution serves to allow the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.360
 steam but pull over real push the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.489
 piston 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.250
 in fact when you are in this position 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.290
 the steam falls from here to choose a little 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.220
 pipe seats arrive in the room of 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.570
 piston and pushes him when he pushes who 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.960
 he wants him to be on the other side of the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.229
 room 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:18.000
 she pushed on this led by 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.659
 where it then exits in the exit hole takes place 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.990
 the opposite 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.710
 in this position the steam enters from 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.900
 here pushes the piston in this sense is 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.210
 the steam present here comes out of this 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.340
 part and in the pole and then exit at 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.930
 end always in movement of the empty 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.320
 puts into action by means of a strap 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.820
 the regulator has points 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.630
 lateral you get up by means of the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.630
 centrifugal force 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:55.470
 when the side PCs close they close 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.869
 the throttle valve when we were the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.110
 butterfly closes makes you less 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.060
 steam and here because when to create 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.740
 movement needs less or 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.740
 less pressure to operate
