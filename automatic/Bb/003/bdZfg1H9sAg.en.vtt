00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.080 
in Sweden we have had a fairly long
tradition<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.380> research<00:02:11.100> into<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.580> field<00:02:11.880> of

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
tradition of research into the field of

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.900 
tradition of research into the field of
whiplash<00:02:12.360> we<00:02:13.230> have<00:02:13.410> accepted<00:02:14.160> with<00:02:14.430> plush<00:02:14.700> as

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
whiplash we have accepted with plush as

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.590 
whiplash we have accepted with plush as
a<00:02:14.940> major<00:02:15.950> problem<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:17.070> traffic<00:02:17.459> so<00:02:18.300> we<00:02:18.450> have

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
a major problem in traffic so we have

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.990 
a major problem in traffic so we have
done<00:02:18.810> epidemiological<00:02:19.590> studies<00:02:20.459> seeing<00:02:20.790> what

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
done epidemiological studies seeing what

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.800 
done epidemiological studies seeing what
is<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.270> frequency<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:22.170> this<00:02:22.350> injury<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:24.000> from

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
is the frequency of this injury and from

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.840 
is the frequency of this injury and from
that<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:25.620> have<00:02:25.770> also<00:02:26.010> seen<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.610> car

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
that we have also seen that car

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.060 
that we have also seen that car
manufacturers<00:02:27.540> have<00:02:27.840> started<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.470> look<00:02:28.830> at

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
manufacturers have started to look at

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.060 
manufacturers have started to look at
solutions<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:30.540> protect<00:02:30.930> from<00:02:31.110> whiplash<00:02:31.380> we

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
solutions to protect from whiplash we

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.830 
solutions to protect from whiplash we
have<00:02:32.280> also<00:02:32.489> in<00:02:32.790> Sweden<00:02:33.239> developed<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
have also in Sweden developed the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.500 
have also in Sweden developed the
research<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:34.590> development<00:02:35.160> tools<00:02:35.430> needed<00:02:35.880> in

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
research and development tools needed in

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.560 
research and development tools needed in
form<00:02:36.959> of<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.200> good<00:02:37.380> crash<00:02:37.709> test<00:02:37.980> dummy

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.699 
developed especially for whiplash
protection<00:02:40.830> assessment<00:02:42.170> it's<00:02:43.170> quite<00:02:43.440> clear

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709

that<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.459> future<00:02:44.610> city<00:02:45.390> safety<00:02:45.900> will<00:02:46.170> be

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
that in the future city safety will be

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.930 
that in the future city safety will be
able<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.739> prevent<00:02:47.040> many<00:02:47.459> unnecessary

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
introduce this system in production

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.430 
introduce this system in production
vehicles<00:02:58.350> within<00:02:58.860> two<00:02:59.160> years
