00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.630
 so the sport is on the towers of 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.850
 classic heater machine I have a 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.800
 partner who is portrayed in euros and at 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.020
 who proposed to use his hangar 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.520
 who are never used to this kind of 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.420
 things to do a little party that we 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.050
 allows to meet people from 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.050
 now have a good time 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.430
 which is great for this event 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.800
 it's the mix of genres so I 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.300
 probably lead the oldest bikes 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.080
 since I have a machine that dates from 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.160
 1948 which by the way is stationed at 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.350
 side of his reincarnation 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.480
 it's a modern version of the city 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.190
 vincent that was recently manufactured 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.060
 it's a machine that was the bike the 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.340
 fastest in the world 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.290
 two series who was nicknamed the widow 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.110
 black because imagine it at the time 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.820
 a motorcycle that rolled between 180 and 200 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.290
 km / hour and unfortunately he had 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.220
 a lot of death to his credit 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.410
 today we would call it a 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.500
 superbike the 1000 vincent is a motorcycle 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.670
 which is 100 frames made almost in 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.770
 aluminum there are metal parts 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.420
 of course it's a machine with a 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.700
 exceptional suspension that is a 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.770
 cantilever suspension and that was copied 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.690
 by the Japanese sometimes be ahead 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.860
 on his time is not always a 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.660
 good idea since unfortunately the 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.120
 firm bassan filed for bankruptcy 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.650
 but 70 years is well there are people 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.870
 like me who revive them on the 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.140
 circuits since these are machines of 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.140
 speed 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.640
 it's part of the paris values club 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.160
 of the biggest clubs of France 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.370
 there we represent the clubs the classic 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.990
 machine our presidents and in bt ttc month 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.540
 who revived a little do it so that we 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.540
 can turn with the boys and more 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.310
 it's a really special year it's 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.270
 the 30 years of the doubs math are there 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:55.170
 is going to have a big gathering on 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.240
 captured September 6 in oberbronn in Alsace 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.100
 there are more than 1,000 registered already at 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.400
 today's time when we wait for that 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.400
 eagerly 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.680
 I want to ask you why 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.350
 you have big bandages on your arms 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.600
 who tells us his two weeks ago 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.300
 it was at the moto coupes legend dijon 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.060
 we were trying to start the mound one 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.120
 unique bike made in France by fitch 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.980
 date at startup and there is 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.490
 at a loss of current between the wire of 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.740
 candle and 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.800
 a mass and its inflamed the senses it 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.330
 there was a big fire around 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.520
 dressing is because either the 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.680
 motorcycle burn if I buy it second 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.780
 solution I was holding it and we saved it 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.410
 so I preferred to hold the bike that is 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.150
 really unique 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.680
 it's been 15 days we're doing 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.330
 working on it we all have to engine 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.270
 the entirety we had the chance 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.669
 precisely by our partners the bubble 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.310
 was strong but the tires had had a 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.840
 problem and have helped us 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.590
 offered us a set of tires for 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.590
 redo the bike 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.560
 it's part of four assembly 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.080
 will do in four different regions 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.210
 in France to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the g6 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.970
 hours so we have a club that oscillates 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:17.320
 between 50 and 80 depending on the years one is 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:20.470
 we cover 7 52 85 to 91 and leon 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.960
 102 86 to 92 ie all the 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.910
 engines and oils of 1st and 2nd 2nd 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.480
 generation where we try to maintain 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.870
 restore repair these bikes 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.090
 who made the glory of not bad 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.800
 two renowned pilots but also 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.800
 bikers of the 80s 90 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:46.090
 11 will suit next year will be 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.949
 I had a great day time 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.509

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:51.509
