00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:10.050
 a lot of underground work is illegal 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.910
 takeover of right of way for it 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.269
 Anyway, no one swings the bad guy 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:19.320
 but that does not bother this rule 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:22.850
 you are barcelona's vegetable guerrilla you 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.400
 Break the law for a handful 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.980
 not very big but tasty antonio and 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.679
 the others are unemployed only one 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.360
 you have plenty of free time so 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.010
 Do you have a public lot? 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.520
 set and a community garden 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.290
 That's my new one 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.480
 passion a meaningful 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.850
 employment if you do not need money 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.620
 and you get to know lots of people 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.680
 I've had a lot since the garden 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.309
 More friends from the town hall want us here 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.340
 do not let 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.410
 But what was in front of the house was 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.090
 completely neglected the dogs have her 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.340
 business was done and there were guesswork 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:08.729
 it is only here through our work 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:11.460
 much more well-groomed more and more spanish 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.470
 recently especially wild plants 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.420
 beginning of the economic crisis horner 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.430
 Cordoba is a pioneer of this 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.090
 move allotments like in 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.070
 Germany is hardly known in spain 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.320
 But what is there especially in Barcelona 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.439
 are occupied houses like this 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.630
 abandoned former poor hospice and such 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.880
 you got the idea of ​​the youthful 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.740
 ask from the occupier if she is her good 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.579
 a piece of garden can cede 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.460
 This created an unusual alliance 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:44.040
 Citizens and occupants plant without 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.810
 own crops without paying rent 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.280
 At first, the cuban was not at ease 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.040
 Of course I am also a squatter 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.960
 because this is not mine 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.439
 There is an eviction action that is in the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.479
 balance 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.210
 but I would say we have one 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:05.490
 abandoned terrain turns into something 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.899
 productive rossi came out 50 years ago 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.060
 andalusia to barcelona 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.259
 looking for work from the village in 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.540
 the city 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.590
 Now, yes, for the first time again 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.590
 vegetable garden balkans 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.480
 it's a completely different air 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:27.420
 here you breathe each plant breathes man 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:29.670
 that's great, it's whole 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.680
 besides tomatoes and aubergines 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.750
 something else grown 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.959
 vegetables connects generations where else 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.530
 I would find friends the 83 are yes 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.540
 clear 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.900
 and we take a little bit for it 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.900
 from your youth, everything mixes 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.500
 from the lawless idyll back to the 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.459
 Legal four walls live like that 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.560
 squatter 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.720
 that could not be hu anna then 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.549
 but imagine a bad conscience 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.549
 she does not have because of her garden 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.079
 The police were already several times 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.359
 us and wanted to clear the terrain 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.340
 but then they realized that we were 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.120
 are completely harmless and they have us in 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.940
 rested 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.889
 so far everything went well for us 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.169
 good that the city leaders now even 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:30.180
 has to rethink this place 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.669
 city ​​hall for the first time a wild one 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.650
 garden legalized the neighbors had 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.989
 For years viewed as your quarter 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.940
 Diseased until one had the idea 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:43.370
 Rip up the paving and close the floor 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.370
 plant with vegetables against decay 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.020
 noise dust demolition houses and garbage else 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.760
 There was nothing here and that for years 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.280
 without the prospect of a solution 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.290
 that makes us angry and of course 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.640
 At some point said the neighbor and we 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.680
 You have to take that into your own hands 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.270
 city ​​planning from below then after a long time 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.430
 back and forth , the politicians were 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.980
 convince that the garden may stay 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.170
 and to sign that everything is here now 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:14.360
 his order should have the neighbors 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:17.180
 her beets even single cordoba hopes 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.820
 that this example makes school 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.950
 everything in quarters like this where 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.990
 none of the many barcelona tourists 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:28.450
 lost and also for their inhabitants 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.450
 otherwise unattractive 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.550
