hand so we have some differences the afo
is<00:01:15.990> no<00:01:16.140> longer<00:01:16.530> made<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:17.070> best<00:01:17.340> as<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.670> see<00:01:17.939> only

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
the afo - the blade got a bit wider if

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.330 
the afo - the blade got a bit wider if
we<00:01:26.369> see<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:27.000> afo<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.170> one<00:01:28.350> with<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.710> black

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
we see the afo is the one with the black

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.109 
we see the afo is the one with the black
plate<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.060> afo<00:01:30.600> -<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:31.259> with<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.890> satin<00:01:32.369> silver

plate the afo - is with the satin silver
color<00:01:33.479> blade<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.740> that's<00:01:35.070> for<00:01:35.340> sure<00:01:35.549> nice<00:01:36.180> that

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
color blade so that's for sure nice that

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.580 
color blade so that's for sure nice that
we<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> bit<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:38.040> wider<00:01:38.310> blade<00:01:39.229> then<00:01:40.229> a

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
we have a bit of a wider blade then a

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.429 
we have a bit of a wider blade then a
point<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.060> really<00:01:42.390> important<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
point that is really important is the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.310 
point that is really important is the
button<00:01:43.649> here<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:45.060> button<00:01:45.479> got<00:01:45.750> bigger

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
button here the button got bigger

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.499 
button here the button got bigger
compared<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.549> original<00:01:48.030> one<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
compared to the original one the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.889 
compared to the original one the
original<00:01:48.570> was<00:01:49.200> smooth<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.820> new<00:01:50.970> one<00:01:51.270> has

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
original was smooth and the new one has

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.840 
original was smooth and the new one has
a<00:01:52.259> bit<00:01:53.220> some<00:01:54.119> steps<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:56.159> steps<00:01:56.460> are

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
a bit some steps on it the steps are

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.660 
a bit some steps on it the steps are
really<00:01:57.360> nice<00:01:57.719> feeling<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.530> your<00:01:58.740> hand<00:01:59.219> as<00:01:59.520> you

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
really nice feeling in your hand as you

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.600 
really nice feeling in your hand as you
open<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.540> knife<00:02:00.689> or<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.140> close<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:01.829> you

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
open the knife or you close it as you

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.990 
open the knife or you close it as you
push<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.420> lock<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.369> they<00:02:05.369> are<00:02:05.490> not<00:02:05.729> sharp

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
push the lock and they are not sharp

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.880 
push the lock and they are not sharp
quite<00:02:06.869> likely<00:02:07.079> they<00:02:07.409> caught<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> bit

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
quite likely they caught a bit

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.609 
quite likely they caught a bit
stonewashed<00:02:08.849> after<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.509> machining<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.379> they

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
stonewashed after the machining so they

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.970 
stonewashed after the machining so they
are<00:02:10.800> really<00:02:11.190> really<00:02:11.520> nicely

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
are really really nicely

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.020 
are really really nicely
and<00:02:13.340> then<00:02:13.610> we<00:02:13.819> see<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.540> handle<00:02:15.110> is<00:02:16.030> pretty

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
and then we see the handle is pretty

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.880 
and then we see the handle is pretty
much<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.780> same<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:19.870> design<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.890> slots<00:02:22.640> is

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
much the same the design of the slots is

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.240 
much the same the design of the slots is
similar<00:02:25.000> but<00:02:26.000> we<00:02:26.360> have<00:02:26.629> the<00:02:27.470> holes<00:02:27.739> for<00:02:28.190> the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
similar but we have the holes for the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.660 
similar but we have the holes for the
pocket<00:02:28.700> clip<00:02:28.849> on<00:02:29.209> from<00:02:29.569> and<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.800> back<00:02:31.010> in<00:02:31.370> two

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
pocket clip on from and the back in two

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.750 
pocket clip on from and the back in two
positions<00:02:32.420> but<00:02:33.140> older<00:02:33.620> one<00:02:33.830> we<00:02:34.130> did<00:02:34.340> not<00:02:34.370> have

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
positions but older one we did not have

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.530 
positions but older one we did not have
that<00:02:34.819> in<00:02:35.090> front<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.830> lanyard<00:02:37.250> hole<00:02:37.430> is<00:02:37.819> in<00:02:38.390> a

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
that in front the lanyard hole is in a

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.259 
that in front the lanyard hole is in a
similar<00:02:38.780> place<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.650> on<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.700> back<00:02:40.880> side<00:02:41.209> of

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
similar place and on the back side of

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.210 
similar place and on the back side of
the<00:02:41.690> knife<00:02:41.720> we<00:02:42.290> have<00:02:42.530> here<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:43.099> glass<00:02:43.400> break<00:02:45.220> you

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
the knife we have here a glass break you

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.559

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.960 
you want to do that the other one had a
flush<00:02:55.190> space<00:02:55.910> and<00:02:56.530> also<00:02:57.530> what<00:02:58.130> helps<00:02:58.430> with<00:02:58.790> the

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
flush space and also what helps with the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.350 
flush space and also what helps with the
handling<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.720> lot<00:03:00.049> is<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:01.400> serrations<00:03:01.819> the

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
handling a lot is the serrations the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.050 
handling a lot is the serrations the
newer<00:03:02.569> one<00:03:02.900> has<00:03:03.910> nice<00:03:04.910> serrations<00:03:05.840> here<00:03:07.060> here

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
newer one has nice serrations here here

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:16.809 
newer one has nice serrations here here
and<00:03:08.980> on<00:03:09.980> top<00:03:10.340> as<00:03:10.760> well<00:03:13.480> on<00:03:14.480> top<00:03:14.870> here<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.819> the

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
and on top as well on top here and the

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:23.500 
and on top as well on top here and the
space<00:03:18.250> is<00:03:19.250> of<00:03:19.579> course<00:03:19.959> steel<00:03:20.959> space<00:03:21.590> with<00:03:22.510> with

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
space is of course steel space with with

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.509 
space is of course steel space with with
the<00:03:23.600> glass<00:03:23.810> break<00:03:24.260> so<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.250> has<00:03:25.489> some

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
the glass break so that has some

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.050 
the glass break so that has some
serrations<00:03:26.510> too<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.430> here<00:03:28.430> we<00:03:28.639> see<00:03:28.850> another

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
serrations too and here we see another

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.650 
serrations too and here we see another
main<00:03:29.569> difference<00:03:29.600> it's<00:03:30.380> open<00:03:30.920> web<00:03:31.420> we<00:03:32.420> have

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
main difference it's open web we have

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.870 
main difference it's open web we have
the<00:03:32.900> construction<00:03:33.130> that<00:03:34.130> is<00:03:34.280> open<00:03:34.730> it's

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
the construction that is open it's

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.690 
the construction that is open it's
easier<00:03:35.239> to<00:03:35.450> clean<00:03:35.660> it's<00:03:36.650> also<00:03:36.799> easier<00:03:37.459> that

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
easier to clean it's also easier that

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.180 
easier to clean it's also easier that
dirt<00:03:38.180> goes<00:03:38.480> in<00:03:38.720> but<00:03:38.989> it's<00:03:39.139> also<00:03:39.350> easier<00:03:39.980> to

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
dirt goes in but it's also easier to

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.590 
dirt goes in but it's also easier to
clean<00:03:40.430> it<00:03:40.670> same<00:03:41.630> is<00:03:41.900> with<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.350> lock<00:03:43.209> as<00:03:44.209> well

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
clean it same is with the lock as well

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.550 
clean it same is with the lock as well
here<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.280> lock<00:03:46.489> is<00:03:46.880> with<00:03:47.299> Walt<00:03:47.630> dick<00:03:48.170> lock

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
here the the lock is with Walt dick lock

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.520 
here the the lock is with Walt dick lock
the<00:03:49.430> location<00:03:50.209> of<00:03:50.389> the<00:03:50.540> safety<00:03:50.870> is<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.260> bit

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
the location of the safety is a bit

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.530 
the location of the safety is a bit
different<00:03:52.239> but<00:03:53.239> it's<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:54.280> same<00:03:55.280> safety<00:03:56.000> that

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
different but it's the same safety that

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.360 
different but it's the same safety that
slides<00:03:57.530> back<00:03:57.920> and<00:03:57.950> forth<00:03:59.560> then<00:04:00.560> on<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.220> back

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
slides back and forth then on the back

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.160 
slides back and forth then on the back
side<00:04:01.400> of<00:04:02.859> the<00:04:03.859> knife<00:04:04.569> we<00:04:05.569> see<00:04:05.780> another

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
side of the knife we see another

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.620 
side of the knife we see another
difference<00:04:08.530> we<00:04:09.530> have<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:10.040> pocket<00:04:10.430> clip<00:04:10.630> of

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
difference we have the pocket clip of

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.400 
difference we have the pocket clip of
course<00:04:12.049> in<00:04:12.410> both<00:04:13.180> sides<00:04:14.180> but<00:04:14.630> we<00:04:14.780> see<00:04:15.019> here

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
course in both sides but we see here

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.789 
course in both sides but we see here
that<00:04:16.370> will<00:04:16.549> not<00:04:16.579> lead<00:04:17.180> to<00:04:17.479> a<00:04:17.510> more<00:04:17.810> deep<00:04:18.470> carry

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
that will not lead to a more deep carry

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.350 
that will not lead to a more deep carry
pocket<00:04:19.510> this<00:04:20.510> one<00:04:20.870> if<00:04:21.380> you<00:04:22.220> mount<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.669> clip<00:04:22.940> on

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
pocket this one if you mount the clip on

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.659 
pocket this one if you mount the clip on
this<00:04:23.599> side<00:04:23.900> and<00:04:24.289> on<00:04:24.650> this<00:04:24.919> end<00:04:25.190> and<00:04:25.400> that's

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
this side and on this end and that's

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:26.920 
this side and on this end and that's
what<00:04:26.060> I<00:04:26.090> gonna<00:04:26.390> do

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
what I gonna do

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.780 
what I gonna do
the<00:04:27.380> knife<00:04:27.979> is<00:04:28.430> really<00:04:29.120> low<00:04:29.570> in<00:04:29.900> the<00:04:30.229> pocket

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
the knife is really low in the pocket

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.340 
the knife is really low in the pocket
itself<00:04:32.080> so<00:04:33.080> that<00:04:33.410> makes<00:04:34.130> for<00:04:34.460> easier<00:04:35.060> carry<00:04:35.419> we

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
itself so that makes for easier carry we

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.640 
itself so that makes for easier carry we
see<00:04:36.530> also<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:37.130> chez<00:04:37.490> Pierre<00:04:38.000> is<00:04:38.650> different

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
see also to chez Pierre is different

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.219 
see also to chez Pierre is different
it's<00:04:39.860> more<00:04:40.130> of<00:04:40.370> a<00:04:40.520> curve<00:04:40.820> here<00:04:41.240> so<00:04:41.990> you<00:04:42.050> have

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
it's more of a curve here so you have

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.360 
it's more of a curve here so you have
more<00:04:42.650> of<00:04:42.680> a<00:04:43.009> quart<00:04:43.370> of<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:44.870> rounded<00:04:45.710> shape<00:04:45.740> of<00:04:46.250> a

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
more of a quart of a rounded shape of a

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.340 
more of a quart of a rounded shape of a
guard<00:04:46.669> here<00:04:47.060> and<00:04:47.240> instead<00:04:47.539> of<00:04:47.600> the<00:04:47.930> older

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
guard here and instead of the older

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.290 
guard here and instead of the older
version<00:04:49.150> same<00:04:50.150> is<00:04:50.389> on<00:04:50.539> top<00:04:51.259> it's<00:04:52.220> more<00:04:52.610> more

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
version same is on top it's more more

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.140 
version same is on top it's more more
rounded<00:04:54.100> so<00:04:55.100> I<00:04:56.050> hope<00:04:57.050> the<00:04:57.229> Commodore<00:04:57.680> see<00:04:57.860> that

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
rounded so I hope the Commodore see that

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.050 
rounded so I hope the Commodore see that
then<00:04:59.150> obviously<00:04:59.750> we<00:05:00.680> have<00:05:00.710> one<00:05:01.340> screw<00:05:01.729> mode

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
then obviously we have one screw mode

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.830 
then obviously we have one screw mode
that<00:05:02.630> is<00:05:02.810> here<00:05:03.050> that<00:05:03.320> is<00:05:04.310> for<00:05:04.669> the<00:05:04.940> stop<00:05:05.479> pin

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
that is here that is for the stop pin

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.740 
that is here that is for the stop pin

we see it here we see it here it says
crude<00:05:26.630> in<00:05:26.930> and<00:05:27.259> actually<00:05:28.070> the<00:05:28.280> stop<00:05:28.669> pin<00:05:28.970> has<00:05:29.300> a

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
a bit of a flat spot so that is better

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:38.770 
a bit of a flat spot so that is better
for<00:05:34.400> the<00:05:35.270> tolerances<00:05:36.080> I<00:05:36.349> did<00:05:36.919> not<00:05:37.070> take<00:05:37.780> apart

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
this knife here yet as I mainly look for

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.909 
this knife here yet as I mainly look for
a<00:05:43.010> black<00:05:43.520> blade<00:05:44.030> version<00:05:44.720> and<00:05:44.870> not<00:05:45.020> the<00:05:45.289> the

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
a black blade version and not the the

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.540 
a black blade version and not the the
satin<00:05:46.430> blade<00:05:46.699> as<00:05:47.030> that<00:05:47.240> is<00:05:47.479> two<00:05:48.159> silver<00:05:49.159> colder

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550
