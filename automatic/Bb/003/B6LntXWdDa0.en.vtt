00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
reduce your workload in your bottom

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.910 
reduce your workload in your bottom
usually<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.840> cut<00:01:43.020> your<00:01:43.170> weights<00:01:43.470> by<00:01:43.680> about

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
usually you cut your weights by about

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.800 
usually you cut your weights by about
fifty<00:01:44.250> percent<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.850> sometimes<00:01:45.210> your<00:01:45.360> volume

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
fifty percent and sometimes your volume

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.389 
fifty percent and sometimes your volume
by<00:01:45.960> as<00:01:46.020> much<00:01:46.229> as<00:01:46.290> fifty<00:01:46.649> percent<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.220> just

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
by as much as fifty percent and you just

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.710 
by as much as fifty percent and you just
train<00:01:47.640> with<00:01:47.850> lighter<00:01:48.060> weight<00:01:48.360> with<00:01:48.540> lower

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
train with lighter weight with lower

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.170 
train with lighter weight with lower

question<00:02:03.259> you<00:02:04.259> said<00:02:04.469> if<00:02:04.649> someone<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.009> getting

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
question you said if someone is getting

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.980 
question you said if someone is getting

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
signs of minor injuries they should take

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.740 
signs of minor injuries they should take
addie<00:02:07.259> load<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.710> was<00:02:07.950> wondering<00:02:07.979> if<00:02:08.750> light

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
addie load so I was wondering if light

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.180 
addie load so I was wondering if light
weight<00:02:10.020> lifting<00:02:10.470> will<00:02:10.619> help

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
weight lifting will help

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.490 
weight lifting will help
minor<00:02:11.430> injuries<00:02:11.970> recovered<00:02:12.510> yeah<00:02:13.170> absolutely

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
minor injuries recovered yeah absolutely

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.140 
minor injuries recovered yeah absolutely
if<00:02:13.920> you're<00:02:14.040> just<00:02:14.220> experiencing<00:02:14.730> some<00:02:14.940> minor

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
if you're just experiencing some minor

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.830 
if you're just experiencing some minor
inflammation<00:02:17.120> what<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.270> will<00:02:18.390> find<00:02:18.570> is<00:02:18.810> that

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
inflammation what you will find is that

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.080 
inflammation what you will find is that
D<00:02:19.230> loading<00:02:19.650> doesn't<00:02:20.070> stress<00:02:20.520> stuff<00:02:20.940> in<00:02:21.060> that

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
D loading doesn't stress stuff in that

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.970 
D loading doesn't stress stuff in that
for<00:02:21.420> example<00:02:21.870> if<00:02:22.020> you're<00:02:22.230> normally<00:02:22.710> bench

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
for example if you're normally bench

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.400 
for example if you're normally bench
pressing<00:02:23.520> 100<00:02:24.270> kilos<00:02:24.690> four<00:02:24.930> sets<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.200> five

pressing 100 kilos four sets of five

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.010 
pressing 100 kilos four sets of five
reps<00:02:25.710> and<00:02:26.040> you're<00:02:26.370> starting<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.820> get<00:02:27.030> into

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
reps and you're starting to get into

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.990 
reps and you're starting to get into
some<00:02:28.170> inflammation<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.860> upper<00:02:29.340> tended<00:02:29.880> and

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
some inflammation that upper tended and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.670 
some inflammation that upper tended and
the<00:02:30.090> pectin<00:02:30.540> in<00:02:30.630> search<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.200> dealt<00:02:31.410> and

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
the pectin in search of the dealt and

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.960 
the pectin in search of the dealt and
you<00:02:31.830> take<00:02:32.010> addie<00:02:32.280> load<00:02:32.460> what<00:02:32.640> you're<00:02:32.730> going<00:02:32.910> to

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
you take addie load what you're going to

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.420 
you take addie load what you're going to
find<00:02:33.000> is<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.390> doing<00:02:34.080> 50<00:02:34.470> kilos<00:02:34.860> four<00:02:35.160> sets<00:02:35.340> of

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
find is that doing 50 kilos four sets of

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.680 
find is that doing 50 kilos four sets of
five<00:02:35.640> isn't<00:02:36.630> going<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:38.030> load<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.270> tended

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
five isn't going to load that tended

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.120 
five isn't going to load that tended
enough<00:02:39.960> to<00:02:40.110> further<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.500> inflammation<00:02:41.040> the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
enough to further the inflammation the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.650 
enough to further the inflammation the
inflammation<00:02:41.670> we'll<00:02:41.790> go<00:02:41.910> ahead<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.120> ease<00:02:42.420> up

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
inflammation we'll go ahead and ease up

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.540 
inflammation we'll go ahead and ease up
but<00:02:43.080> by<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.350> same<00:02:43.680> token<00:02:43.740> you're<00:02:44.250> getting

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
but by the same token you're getting

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.250 
but by the same token you're getting
blood<00:02:44.790> flow<00:02:44.940> you're<00:02:45.150> stimulating<00:02:45.360> blood<00:02:45.870> flow

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.740 
blood flow you're stimulating blood flow
by<00:02:46.590> using<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.100> lighter<00:02:47.310> weight<00:02:47.640> into<00:02:48.600> that

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
by using the lighter weight into that

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.300 
by using the lighter weight into that
area<00:02:48.960> which<00:02:49.230> can<00:02:49.380> help<00:02:49.470> bring<00:02:49.620> nutrients<00:02:50.130> and

area which can help bring nutrients and

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.250 
area which can help bring nutrients and
it<00:02:50.370> can<00:02:50.490> help<00:02:50.670> with<00:02:50.820> healing<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.480> more

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
it can help with healing and more

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.240 
it can help with healing and more

next question Jason got it fast for
about<00:03:30.150> 20<00:03:30.510> hours<00:03:30.540> before<00:03:31.080> my<00:03:31.200> meat<00:03:31.410> for<00:03:31.950> the

about 20 hours before my meat for the
weigh-in<00:03:32.220> how<00:03:32.610> should<00:03:32.850> I<00:03:32.940> approach<00:03:33.060> eating

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
weigh-in how should I approach eating

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.060 
weigh-in how should I approach eating
afterwards<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.110> will<00:03:34.260> have<00:03:34.350> about<00:03:34.470> six<00:03:34.920> hours

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
afterwards I will have about six hours

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.310 
afterwards I will have about six hours
to<00:03:35.340> eat<00:03:35.459> before<00:03:35.610> going<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.090> bed<00:03:36.270> and<00:03:36.510> then<00:03:37.230> the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
competition is the next day should I eat

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.060 
competition is the next day should I eat
everything<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:40.080> sight<00:03:40.140> or<00:03:40.590> take<00:03:40.769> a<00:03:40.800> more

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
supplement some of those at that point

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.110 
supplement some of those at that point
so<00:04:31.360> ultra<00:04:31.900> high<00:04:32.110> carb<00:04:32.470> salty<00:04:33.430> foods<00:04:33.700> that's
