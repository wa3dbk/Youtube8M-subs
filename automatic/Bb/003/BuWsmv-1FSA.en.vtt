00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
it just reduces my cleanup time I can

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.920 
it just reduces my cleanup time I can
smear<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.250> paint<00:01:35.490> around<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.450> squirt<00:01:36.810> it

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
smear the paint around I can squirt it

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.200 
smear the paint around I can squirt it
directly<00:01:37.439> from<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:38.250> tube<00:01:38.490> right<00:01:38.850> onto<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
directly from the tube right onto the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.060 
directly from the tube right onto the
blade<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:39.900> really<00:01:40.079> all<00:01:40.350> about<00:01:40.380> less

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
blade so it's really all about less

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.429 
blade so it's really all about less
cleanup<00:01:41.400> for<00:01:41.729> me<00:01:41.909> less<00:01:42.810> mess<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.259> deal<00:01:43.290> with

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
cleanup for me less mess to deal with

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.160 
cleanup for me less mess to deal with
and<00:01:43.979> when<00:01:44.759> switching<00:01:45.000> between<00:01:45.180> colors<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:46.020> I

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
and when switching between colors if I

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.230 
and when switching between colors if I
have<00:01:46.320> paint<00:01:46.619> left<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> blade<00:01:47.430> all<00:01:47.700> I'm

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
that are a little bit thicker so it's

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.090 
that are a little bit thicker so it's
going<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.060> take<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.300> moment<00:02:36.630> for<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.260> dry<00:02:37.500> so

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
going to take a moment for it to dry so

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.370

completely<00:02:48.390> dried<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.930> me<00:02:48.960> so<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.860> chose<00:02:50.130> to

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
completely dried to me so I chose to

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.730 
completely dried to me so I chose to
grab<00:02:50.520> a<00:02:50.670> pencil<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.240> write<00:02:51.420> on<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:52.440> way<00:02:52.710> I

grab a pencil to write on it that way I

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.590 
grab a pencil to write on it that way I
wouldn't<00:02:53.070> ruin<00:02:53.610> one<00:02:53.820> of<00:02:53.910> my<00:02:54.060> pens<00:02:54.330> because

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
building up on the tip of the pencil

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.580

there<00:03:20.370> yeah<00:03:21.300> that<00:03:21.840> would<00:03:22.110> have<00:03:22.200> totally

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
there yeah that would have totally

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.430 
there yeah that would have totally
trashed<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.520> pen<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:24.450> I've<00:03:24.570> wiped<00:03:24.810> that<00:03:24.930> pencil

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
trashed a pen so I've wiped that pencil

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.070 
trashed a pen so I've wiped that pencil
tip<00:03:25.620> off<00:03:25.890> on<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.160> paper<00:03:26.520> towel<00:03:26.850> and<00:03:27.090> even<00:03:27.870> now

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
tip off on a paper towel and even now

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.930 
tip off on a paper towel and even now
it's<00:03:28.320> still<00:03:28.410> not<00:03:28.740> writing<00:03:29.130> very<00:03:29.310> well<00:03:29.550> because

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
it's still not writing very well because

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.760 
it's still not writing very well because
frankly<00:03:30.390> it's<00:03:30.570> still<00:03:30.810> pretty<00:03:31.050> damp<00:03:31.410> paint

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
frankly it's still pretty damp paint

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.770 
frankly it's still pretty damp paint
guess<00:03:32.460> I<00:03:32.610> should<00:03:32.850> have<00:03:32.940> waited<00:03:33.210> until<00:03:33.510> it

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
guess I should have waited until it

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.740 
guess I should have waited until it
dried<00:03:34.050> completely<00:03:34.370> now<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:36.240> is<00:03:36.570> an

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
dried completely now that is an

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.560 
dried completely now that is an
absolutely<00:03:37.470> crazy<00:03:38.100> concept<00:03:38.580> I'm<00:03:39.150> just<00:03:39.480> gonna

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
absolutely crazy concept I'm just gonna

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.660 
absolutely crazy concept I'm just gonna
keep<00:03:39.750> going<00:03:39.960> even<00:03:40.260> if<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.530> paint's<00:03:40.800> wet<00:03:40.860> but<00:03:41.640> I

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
keep going even if the paint's wet but I

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.940 
keep going even if the paint's wet but I
am<00:03:41.970> glad<00:03:42.210> that<00:03:42.270> I<00:03:42.480> used<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.840> pencil<00:03:43.080> instead<00:03:43.560> of

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950
