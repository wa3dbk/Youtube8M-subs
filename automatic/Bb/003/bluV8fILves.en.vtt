00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.230

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.789

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.800
 healthy at home so come for 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.660
 start I have an avocado here 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.460
 remember that the avocado is a type of 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.230
 healthy fat that even if you want 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.000
 the high negative cholesterol the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.190
 Bad cholesterol is going to help you 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.660
 to reduce it is as if it were taken by iloca 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.289
 Lara for the outside so look 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.480
 consume avocado olive oil walnuts 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.450
 almonds all that is good cholesterol 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.790
 so let's put it in the blender 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.410
 I have here a jalapeño pepper lx 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.480
 the little tail and we're going to take it to 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.520
 fire we have to toast because he believes 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.530
 can you cook me or can not you? 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.150
 put raw but toasted grabs a flavor 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.580
 delicious so let's have fun 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.380
 besides that color he cited a black of the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.320
 of the shell will help us access 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.330
 rustic not only usually these 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.220
 times especially that to this kind of 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.380
 parties become extremely dangerous 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.850
 the house full of peanuts and potato chips 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.100
 things that are not going to do you much good 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.470
 in the bikini era so look 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.240
 I have corn tortillas here and you 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.610
 I'm going to teach how to prepare some tortilla chips 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.530
 light without frying so what I'm going to 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.420
 do is cut it in four to 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.880
 prepare our totopos I know that in 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.040
 mexico there are already some companies that 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.050
 they have the toasts are simply 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.240
 baked so you can turn to 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.460
 them and look at all I'm going to do 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.410
 is to place on a plate and this is the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.850
 quick version if you want to do it 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.380
 you can do in the oven I know that 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.810
 many people outnumber the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.420
 microwave I try to be healthy and 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.700
 practice so this goes for microwave 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.180
 two minutes we flipped them and others 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.070
 same 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.410
 this is how our jalapeño pepper is 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.600
 look, I'm going to take a little bit of the 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.620
 peel with a napkin can not be 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.480
 the water jet 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.160
 I do not want to take it off completely 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.979
 because I'm interested in seeing this 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.440
 little bit of bold in mold language like that 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.520
 that there it smells what is the key to 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.610
 know if it's going to be extremely 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.760
 spicy if it's going to be very spicy remove a 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.769
 little of the jalapeño seeds 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.420
 so that it is going to help that is not 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.890
 so so spicy remember that also 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.470
 when we cook it usually 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.620
 it also becomes like it's spicy there 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.769
 is and we are going to place with the guacamole 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.360
 and we're going to add skim milk 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.700
 Milk is going to help a lot of people 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.040
 like to put avocado lemon so that 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.450
 do not get so very black I 'm going to 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.159
 add milk plus it's going to 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.459
 help to have the consistency of 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.500
 dip 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.810
 let's add it around a quarter 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.120
 of cup and we will add according 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.190
 let's go see the consistency either 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.599
 more aguadito or more thick a little salt 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.599
 and now if to liquefy 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.159
 They are older in this world because 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.170

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.980
 add more milk or you can put 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.030
 water as you wish for this to be 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.610
 come back a little less thick 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.920
 I have a tomato here and we 're going to 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.569
 cut into finite pieces together with 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.020
 the onion if you want you can also 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.870
 add a little coriander 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.720
 and I have my onions 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.520
 and we are going to cut squares 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.710
 the key of this type is that you 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.470
 vegetables are super but super 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.330
 finitas and also if you are interested you are 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.160

 watching the world cup here I'll leave you 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.360

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.660
 We will place in our bunk or in 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.660
 the container where we want to serve 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.450
 and now let's add our peak of 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.450
 rooster 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.740
 this right so good is also this 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.010
 I use it daily as a dressing 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.730
 for my salads I love the taste 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.730
 let's mix it 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:28.700
 and at the top as an ornament I will 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.700
 place more than with the development year 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.070

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.590
 to decorate and I want you to see how 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.110

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.420
 perfect excellent and without absolutely 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.840
 no fat so here they have a 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.880
 healthy and delicious snack for 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.920
 this world or for any time of the 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.420
 year when you have roast meat in the house 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.610
 and you want them not to be filled with pure flesh 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.960
 you can place this also so 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.960
