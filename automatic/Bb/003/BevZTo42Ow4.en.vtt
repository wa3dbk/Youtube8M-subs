to show you a short run I had with the

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.730 
to show you a short run I had with the
fractures<00:00:13.760> they<00:00:14.539> are<00:00:14.719> not<00:00:14.869> as<00:00:15.109> popular<00:00:15.500> as

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
fractures they are not as popular as

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.950 
fractures they are not as popular as
they<00:00:16.070> used<00:00:16.279> to<00:00:16.369> be<00:00:16.430> since<00:00:16.910> they<00:00:17.090> were<00:00:17.330> nerfed<00:00:17.720> a

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
they used to be since they were nerfed a

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.679 
they used to be since they were nerfed a
bit<00:00:18.109> that's<00:00:18.500> quite<00:00:18.800> a<00:00:18.830> while<00:00:19.250> ago<00:00:19.279> and<00:00:19.760> there's

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
bit that's quite a while ago and there's

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.710 
bit that's quite a while ago and there's
always<00:00:21.050> discussions<00:00:22.039> about<00:00:22.509> nerves<00:00:23.509> and

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
always discussions about nerves and

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.089 
always discussions about nerves and
buffs<00:00:23.900> and<00:00:23.990> all<00:00:24.140> that<00:00:24.289> but<00:00:24.529> they<00:00:24.740> are<00:00:24.890> still

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
buffs and all that but they are still

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.759 
buffs and all that but they are still
very<00:00:25.550> useful<00:00:26.329> than<00:00:26.480> actually<00:00:27.079> rather<00:00:27.619> good

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
very useful than actually rather good

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.849 
very useful than actually rather good
against<00:00:28.369> the<00:00:28.640> vehicles<00:00:29.419> and<00:00:30.199> also<00:00:30.470> one<00:00:30.619> point

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
against the vehicles and also one point

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.729 
against the vehicles and also one point
out<00:00:30.980> that<00:00:31.279> the<00:00:32.090> fractures<00:00:32.509> is<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:33.500> only

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
out that the fractures is the only

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.010 
out that the fractures is the only
anti-vehicle<00:00:34.700> lemax<00:00:35.210> weapon<00:00:35.600> that<00:00:35.720> I<00:00:35.780> have

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
anti-vehicle lemax weapon that I have

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.380 
anti-vehicle lemax weapon that I have
used<00:00:36.380> the<00:00:36.980> only<00:00:37.390> second-generation

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
used the only second-generation

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.420 
used the only second-generation
anti-vehicle<00:00:39.320> weapons<00:00:39.770> that<00:00:39.890> I've<00:00:40.070> ever<00:00:40.250> used

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
anti-vehicle weapons that I've ever used

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.119 
anti-vehicle weapons that I've ever used
on<00:00:40.760> any<00:00:40.879> max<00:00:41.180> so<00:00:41.840> I<00:00:41.870> can't<00:00:42.289> really<00:00:42.469> compare<00:00:42.920> it

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
on any max so I can't really compare it

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.630 
on any max so I can't really compare it
to<00:00:43.460> whatever<00:00:43.640> you<00:00:43.879> have<00:00:44.030> on<00:00:44.210> your<00:00:44.390> NC<00:00:44.780> or<00:00:44.809> your

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
to whatever you have on your NC or your

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.700 
to whatever you have on your NC or your
van<00:00:46.640> max<00:00:47.180> now<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:48.019> reason<00:00:48.199> why<00:00:48.350> i<00:00:48.379> spawned

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
van max now the reason why i spawned

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.349 
van max now the reason why i spawned
this<00:00:48.859> fracture<00:00:49.340> max<00:00:49.519> was<00:00:49.699> because<00:00:50.059> there<00:00:50.269> was

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
this fracture max was because there was

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.959 
this fracture max was because there was
a<00:00:50.420> lot<00:00:50.510> of<00:00:50.660> angles<00:00:51.469> and<00:00:51.710> lightnings<00:00:52.190> even<00:00:52.910> if

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
a lot of angles and lightnings even if

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.900 
a lot of angles and lightnings even if
you<00:00:53.059> saunders<00:00:53.510> coming<00:00:53.629> in<00:00:53.989> from<00:00:54.410> da<00:00:55.160> haka<00:00:55.640> I

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
you saunders coming in from da haka I

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.299 
you saunders coming in from da haka I
trying<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.690> get<00:00:56.899> here<00:00:57.109> to<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.559> uplink<00:00:57.949> harbor

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
trying to get here to the uplink harbor

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.160 
trying to get here to the uplink harbor
now<00:00:58.879> one<00:00:59.030> of<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.179> problems<00:00:59.239> with<00:00:59.690> this<00:00:59.899> base

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
now one of the problems with this base

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.479 
now one of the problems with this base
is<00:01:00.199> that<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:01.399> spawn<00:01:01.940> room<00:01:02.239> and<00:01:02.539> the<00:01:03.489> capture

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
is that the spawn room and the capture

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.810 
is that the spawn room and the capture
point<00:01:04.810> there's<00:01:05.810> only<00:01:05.900> one<00:01:06.050> is<00:01:06.530> on<00:01:07.400> opposite

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
point there's only one is on opposite

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.990 
point there's only one is on opposite
sides<00:01:08.060> of<00:01:08.300> this<00:01:08.570> road<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.259> if<00:01:10.189> there<00:01:10.490> is<00:01:10.640> a<00:01:10.670> lot

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
sides of this road and if there is a lot

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.630 
sides of this road and if there is a lot
of<00:01:11.030> Tanks<00:01:11.810> spamming<00:01:12.530> with<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:13.159> splash<00:01:13.430> damage

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
of Tanks spamming with the splash damage

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.730 
of Tanks spamming with the splash damage
here<00:01:13.880> it's<00:01:14.030> almost<00:01:14.299> impossible<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:15.259> defend

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
here it's almost impossible to defend

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.469 
here it's almost impossible to defend
this<00:01:15.979> base<00:01:16.220> so<00:01:16.670> I<00:01:16.729> wanted<00:01:16.939> to<00:01:17.000> make<00:01:17.060> sure<00:01:17.180> that

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
this base so I wanted to make sure that

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:35.050 
this base so I wanted to make sure that
they<00:01:17.600> couldn't<00:01:17.869> get<00:01:18.020> too<00:01:18.320> close

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.310 

so<00:01:36.060> one<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.420> most<00:01:36.600> important<00:01:36.990> things<00:01:37.170> when

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
so one of the most important things when

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.440 
so one of the most important things when
you<00:01:37.440> go<00:01:37.590> against<00:01:37.950> tanks<00:01:38.130> with<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> max<00:01:38.760> is<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
you go against tanks with a max is to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.300 
you go against tanks with a max is to
take<00:01:39.900> back<00:01:40.230> and<00:01:40.380> forward<00:01:40.740> left<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.130> right

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
take back and forward left and right

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.900 
take back and forward left and right
it's<00:01:41.729> still<00:01:42.180> very<00:01:42.330> easy<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.840> hit<00:01:43.050> the<00:01:43.229> tank<00:01:43.440> and

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
it's still very easy to hit the tank and

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.190 
it's still very easy to hit the tank and
but<00:01:44.910> it<00:01:45.000> makes<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.300> very<00:01:45.360> hard<00:01:45.600> for<00:01:45.960> them<00:01:45.990> to

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
but it makes it very hard for them to

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.350 
but it makes it very hard for them to
hit<00:01:46.620> you<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.490> place<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.880> not<00:01:47.970> optimal

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
hit you this place is not optimal

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.570 
hit you this place is not optimal
because<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.690> have<00:01:48.870> a<00:01:48.900> wall<00:01:49.350> behind<00:01:49.590> me<00:01:49.830> and<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
because I have a wall behind me and the

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.030 
because I have a wall behind me and the
splash<00:01:50.880> damage<00:01:51.090> from<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.780> chi<00:01:51.900> or<00:01:52.170> heat<00:01:52.590> would

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
splash damage from a chi or heat would

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.060 
splash damage from a chi or heat would
damage<00:01:53.460> me<00:01:53.700> quite<00:01:53.940> significantly<00:01:54.890> it's<00:01:55.890> not

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
damage me quite significantly it's not

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.070 
damage me quite significantly it's not
the<00:01:56.610> biggest<00:01:56.940> problem<00:01:57.240> dedicates<00:01:57.660> are<00:01:57.900> of

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
the biggest problem dedicates are of

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.920 
the biggest problem dedicates are of
course<00:01:58.290> much<00:01:58.890> more<00:01:58.920> dangerous<00:01:59.460> but<00:01:59.760> it<00:02:00.630> is

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
course much more dangerous but it is

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.140 
course much more dangerous but it is
more<00:02:01.860> dangerous<00:02:02.040> actually<00:02:02.640> for<00:02:02.880> your

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
more dangerous actually for your

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.499 
more dangerous actually for your
engineer<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.460> possibly<00:02:05.460> also<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:06.119> medic

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
engineer and possibly also the medic

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.969 
engineer and possibly also the medic
that's<00:02:06.690> going<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.050> revive<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.500> if<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.800> get

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
that's going to revive you if you get

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:38.670 
that's going to revive you if you get
killed<00:02:08.280> by<00:02:08.729> left

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680

insane I get these free slags that are
just<00:02:43.989> out<00:02:44.230> of<00:02:44.290> this<00:02:44.560> world<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.370> I<00:02:46.090> actually

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
just out of this world and I actually

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.470 
just out of this world and I actually
made<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.260> bit<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.709> rage<00:02:48.010> video<00:02:48.579> that<00:02:49.450> I

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
made a bit of a rage video that I

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.809 
made a bit of a rage video that I
decided<00:02:49.989> not<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.409> upload<00:02:50.829> because<00:02:51.099> it<00:02:51.250> was<00:02:51.459> I

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
decided not to upload because it was I

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.780 
decided not to upload because it was I
said<00:02:51.879> some<00:02:52.239> really<00:02:52.450> nasty<00:02:52.750> things<00:02:52.959> about<00:02:53.290> our

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
said some really nasty things about our

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.670 
said some really nasty things about our
developers<00:02:54.790> I'm<00:02:55.599> sure<00:02:55.840> they're<00:02:56.109> working<00:02:56.349> on

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
developers I'm sure they're working on

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.860 
developers I'm sure they're working on
the<00:02:56.829> problem<00:02:57.159> and<00:02:57.670> hopefully<00:02:58.269> they<00:02:58.450> will<00:02:58.629> fix

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
the problem and hopefully they will fix

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.619 
the problem and hopefully they will fix
it<00:02:59.049> as<00:02:59.230> soon<00:02:59.260> as<00:02:59.439> possible<00:02:59.920> I<00:03:00.159> think<00:03:00.790> that<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.180> am

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
it as soon as possible I think that I am

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.539 
it as soon as possible I think that I am
just<00:03:02.109> like<00:03:02.200> many<00:03:02.409> players<00:03:02.650> suffering<00:03:03.340> from

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
just like many players suffering from

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.509 
just like many players suffering from
the<00:03:03.939> 64-bit<00:03:04.900> client<00:03:05.500> I<00:03:05.650> know<00:03:05.739> that<00:03:05.980> there<00:03:06.400> is<00:03:06.430> a

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
the 64-bit client I know that there is a

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.720 
the 64-bit client I know that there is a
way<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.730> manually<00:03:07.239> switch<00:03:08.019> back<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.290> the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
way to manually switch back to the

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.979 
way to manually switch back to the
32-bit<00:03:09.730> one<00:03:09.969> and<00:03:10.209> i'll<00:03:10.450> probably<00:03:10.900> do<00:03:11.169> that

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
32-bit one and i'll probably do that

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.990 
32-bit one and i'll probably do that
okay<00:03:13.989> i<00:03:14.019> probably<00:03:14.230> follow<00:03:14.560> me<00:03:17.700> so<00:03:18.700> here<00:03:18.879> you

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
okay i probably follow me so here you

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.030 
okay i probably follow me so here you
will<00:03:19.150> see<00:03:19.329> more<00:03:19.510> clearly<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.470> way<00:03:20.560> I<00:03:20.590> straight

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
will see more clearly the way I straight

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.949 
will see more clearly the way I straight
back<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.459> forward<00:03:21.760> in<00:03:21.879> order<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.540> avoid

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
back and forward in order to avoid

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.379 
back and forward in order to avoid
incoming<00:03:23.469> fire<00:03:23.709> now<00:03:24.340> in<00:03:24.459> this<00:03:24.579> situation<00:03:24.639> we

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
incoming fire now in this situation we

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.170 
incoming fire now in this situation we
are<00:03:25.840> in<00:03:25.959> a<00:03:26.139> much<00:03:26.290> better<00:03:26.319> position<00:03:26.709> not<00:03:27.639> for<00:03:28.030> me

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
are in a much better position not for me

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.409 
are in a much better position not for me
particularly<00:03:28.689> that<00:03:29.169> much<00:03:29.379> but<00:03:30.090> other<00:03:31.090> was<00:03:31.389> a

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
particularly that much but other was a

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.289 
particularly that much but other was a
c4<00:03:31.870> by<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.079> way<00:03:32.230> but<00:03:32.799> because<00:03:33.129> it<00:03:33.459> keeps<00:03:33.969> the

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
c4 by the way but because it keeps the

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.839 
c4 by the way but because it keeps the
engineers<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.019> medics<00:03:35.349> safe<00:03:35.650> that<00:03:35.919> normally

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
engineers and medics safe that normally

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.020 
engineers and medics safe that normally
follows<00:03:37.269> a<00:03:37.599> max<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:38.459> in<00:03:39.459> a<00:03:39.609> situation<00:03:39.790> like

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
follows a max and in a situation like

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.539 
follows a max and in a situation like
this<00:03:40.209> is<00:03:40.389> quite<00:03:41.139> important<00:03:41.709> because<00:03:41.769> you<00:03:42.370> will

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
this is quite important because you will

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.159 
this is quite important because you will
attract<00:03:43.000> a<00:03:43.180> lot<00:03:43.359> of<00:03:43.389> incoming<00:03:43.840> fire<00:03:44.139> from

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
attract a lot of incoming fire from

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.710 
attract a lot of incoming fire from
whatever<00:03:45.069> tanks<00:03:45.459> you're<00:03:45.609> fighting<00:03:46.030> anyway

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
whatever tanks you're fighting anyway

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.349 
whatever tanks you're fighting anyway
this<00:03:47.109> was<00:03:47.620> only<00:03:48.310> going<00:03:48.519> to<00:03:48.609> be<00:03:48.729> a<00:03:48.760> four<00:03:49.180> minute

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
this was only going to be a four minute

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.430 
this was only going to be a four minute
video<00:03:49.510> so<00:03:50.139> thank<00:03:50.919> you<00:03:51.040> all<00:03:51.069> for<00:03:51.519> watching<00:03:51.729> and
