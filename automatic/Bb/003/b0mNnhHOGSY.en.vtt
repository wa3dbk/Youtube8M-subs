 Three gunmen attacked the building of the satirical magazine "Charlie Hebdo" and killed 10 people, including the magazine's director, Sharp, and three famous cartoonists, Cabo, Volonski and Tinyos. 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:31.280
 Video footage showed two masked attackers carrying machine-gun Kalashnikov, while the agency AFP, a source close to the investigation that one of the attackers was armed with a portable rocket launcher. 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:44.380
 Local reports reported that the attackers fled on a third-party vehicle, which was taken from the crime scene on Serpollet Street towards the Port de Pantan Metro station in the 11th Parisian district. 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:01:00.100
 French President Hollande came to the scene of the attack and immediately considered it a brutal act of terrorism. Hollande has not accused any party and confirmed that the security services have foiled in recent weeks several terrorist attacks. 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:23.780
 However, French and European political circles have accused radical Islamic groups of threatening the magazine previously, and have been enmity for its cynicism of the Prophet Muhammad and its repeated provocation to the feelings of Muslim immigrants in France . 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:48.660
 This remains one possible hypothesis and no one has the truth. However, European opinion makers have recently begun to talk about the danger of militant groups. Moscow has long been warned by Moscow, especially those extremists who are returning to Europe after being trained to fight in the hotbeds of violence in the Middle East. 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:02:01.280
 The attack cracked the French street and prompted it to accuse the Islamist militants. But on the other hand, some readings raise questions about the timing of the attack and its implications 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:24.040
 Security officials talk about the impossibility of implementing such a security breach in the capital Paris and in a short time without careful planning and information and logistical support, usually donated by integrated organizations and not people. The attack also coincided with an infamous context in which European capitals witnessed demonstrations against what they called the Islamization of Europe. 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:41.340
 These breakthroughs may stifle President Hollande, whose popularity has fallen to record levels and served his adversaries, but the attack will certainly strengthen the stakes of the far right, which is rising in Europe more than ever before.
