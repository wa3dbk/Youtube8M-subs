00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:07.180
 including the 123 mile alongside sparing i wrinkles bm check 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.180
 Middelburg and all Dutch eyes 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.269
 you do not often see 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.030
 is a startling 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.030
 there is robert is when the voices are entered 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.560
 he takes the lead 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.820
 he has in it 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.950
 he is sitting in the garden 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.950
 between the two factory suzuki 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.950
 between middelburg and between seeing 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.370
 and then you have nice from Middelburg in the robert attacker 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.370
 hell yeah right 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.930
 middelburg leads 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.100
 middelburg move forward 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.940
 I see you slide after it 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.850
 it is tradition that arboned 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.960
 for government and 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.710
 see perries 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.060
 this is an initiative of middelburg 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.730
 in all likelihood a decision 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.040
 to continue driving 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.040
 Middelburg which is in the Dutch newspaper 3 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.460
 to force their decision to the match 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.460
 let it go ahead because with the party 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.520
 is that the advantage can be seen off 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.410
 I know it well beyond 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.410
 terribly hard 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.540
 a look back from Middelburg 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.540
 that crazy directors 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.869
 careful middle citizen is not a classic 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.839
 by side to the certain for the uncertain take and cut the bama 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:15.269
 from that day after the company in the weekly newspaper all day 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.069
 I see those parties 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.069
 professor is can this middelburg 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:26.639
 you see in that don't pass by but then land would be the match 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:29.639
 have ended then you can collect 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:35.829
 in these last hundreds of meters you just look 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.749
 see who precedes this is very clever of mastering and reflecting jet work 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:41.559
 Middelburg 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:44.559
 this puts it at a higher level 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:49.099
 grants the team leader suggested that should the match not end 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.039
 Be through a friend then Frank Motion wins the leader 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:57.039
 it goes anyway 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:04.409
 you see crossed 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:09.489
 m gilberto was the streak that means a slippery trace of oil on the job or in this 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.489
 case much later as a mirror 

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:16.619
 more than thirty countries 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:20.079
 police who are the first teams of the start and finish line 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.379
 Middelburg is second or that the end of the competition is known on this 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.349
 moment we don't know 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.150
 that in particular the Jack Middelburg 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.080
 thought very well and and the very professional institutions put it on 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.199
 assen has shown 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:39.249
 the fifteen seconds to go is rising from the second loop 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:41.880
 robert south pole position 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.850
 on the piece of ice is a motorcycle, nobody is clear yet and there would be after the 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:46.970
 match quite sometime 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.839
 protests can follow 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:51.839
 you can because it is a competition 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.369
 through the screen newspaper 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:04.219
 the Italian a set of main island that does not have a good start 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.219
 forced alpro 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:11.739
 not started 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.829
 due to technical problems following the conversion of search engine 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.799
 Middelburg 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.799
 name allah and per country that no longer sees them in that order 

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:24.559
 I'm right again 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:36.159
 I'll see you in third place 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.189
 last year 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:41.009
 he wants to be ready for the army 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.009
 is a punishment everything has a cafe 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:51.919
 Below you will find a number of youth ships from today's world champion 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.919
 sympathetic to it all 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:57.419

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.490

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.590
 clear 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.939
 is about 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:06.939
 too much freedom 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.879
 for a dirt bike he has the second place 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:18.879

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.289
 the vision of haase 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:37.150
 french b 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.110
 Jacky Duyck says Mary Pierce to view the music very well in June 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:45.189
 the edges that were in the see are such 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.379
 kathryn particularly good of course 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:53.330
 during the job growth in march the netherlands but he did not 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.989

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.969
 year round weather 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:10.020
 for me in that area 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.599
 I believe I have to wait for the best with the Surinamese brought together 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.680
 but the lump sum payment 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.680
 so I have had to wait until the end of the 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.779
 of which it is about the first man I have been having a hard time in the coming years 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:26.569
 for problems during the day simply less 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:30.159
 nothing in terms of health and for the rest no one would be in the city anymore 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.990
