00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:37.709 
tension level and I'm gonna notice first

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:40.639 
tension level and I'm gonna notice first
and<00:01:38.130> I'm<00:01:38.549> gonna<00:01:38.670> react<00:01:39.139> at<00:01:40.139> least<00:01:40.380> five

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
and I'm gonna react at least five

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.109 
and I'm gonna react at least five
seconds<00:01:41.130> later<00:01:41.310> because<00:01:41.579> I'm<00:01:41.700> gonna<00:01:41.819> learn

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
seconds later because I'm gonna learn

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.669 
seconds later because I'm gonna learn
first<00:01:42.479> our<00:01:42.689> learning<00:01:43.049> happens<00:01:43.350> after<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
first our learning happens after the

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.679 
first our learning happens after the
shot<00:01:43.889> really<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.490> we'll<00:01:45.029> see<00:01:45.209> if<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.359> can<00:01:45.539> learn

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
shot really and we'll see if I can learn

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.989 
shot really and we'll see if I can learn
and<00:01:46.109> then<00:01:46.679> I'll<00:01:46.799> have<00:01:46.950> my<00:01:47.069> reactivity<00:01:47.729> or<00:01:47.759> my

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:47.999 
and then I'll have my reactivity or my

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:50.389 
and then I'll have my reactivity or my
emotionality<00:01:48.569> or<00:01:48.749> my<00:01:48.840> judgment<00:01:49.319> after<00:01:49.469> and

what there is to observe so it has to go
through<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.910> pins<00:03:27.150> are<00:03:27.480> aware<00:03:28.100> yeah<00:03:29.100> stay<00:03:29.400> on

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.070 
but I don't really care if it strikes
what<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.760> care<00:03:36.090> about<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.510> that<00:03:36.540> you're<00:03:36.810> aware

so that you could strike on the very

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.840 
so that you could strike on the very
next<00:03:40.110> shot<00:03:40.440> after<00:03:40.770> this<00:03:40.920> because<00:03:41.400> you've<00:03:41.730> been

get<00:03:47.550> crazy<00:03:47.790> but<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.960> have<00:03:48.990> subtle<00:03:49.410> reactions

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
get crazy but you have subtle reactions

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.110 
get crazy but you have subtle reactions
we'll<00:03:50.190> talk<00:03:50.370> about<00:03:50.460> that<00:03:50.610> in<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.790> moment

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
we'll talk about that in a moment

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.890 
we'll talk about that in a moment
okay<00:03:51.420> all<00:03:51.960> right

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.580 

oh<00:03:56.420> there<00:03:57.420> we<00:03:57.540> go<00:03:59.720> so<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:01.019> there's<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.349> face

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
oh there we go so and there's the face

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.080 
oh there we go so and there's the face
okay<00:04:01.920> um

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
okay um

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.940 
okay um
striking<00:04:03.659> happen<00:04:03.989> but<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.290> face<00:04:04.500> happened

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
striking happen but the face happened

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.399 
striking happen but the face happened
too<00:04:05.129> and<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:06.269> way<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.780> reason<00:04:07.079> we<00:04:07.140> know<00:04:07.260> that

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
too and the way the reason we know that

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.250 
too and the way the reason we know that
I<00:04:07.470> won<00:04:07.590> twenty<00:04:07.920> dollars<00:04:08.189> is<00:04:08.340> this<00:04:09.140> after<00:04:10.140> the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
I won twenty dollars is this after the

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.149 
I won twenty dollars is this after the
shot<00:04:10.530> is<00:04:11.189> executed<00:04:11.909> comes<00:04:12.269> off<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.980> you<00:04:13.980> see

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
shot is executed comes off and you see

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.279 
shot is executed comes off and you see
the<00:04:14.310> facial<00:04:14.549> grimace<00:04:15.299> and<00:04:15.540> then<00:04:15.900> like<00:04:16.079> and

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
the facial grimace and then like and

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.810 
the facial grimace and then like and
this<00:04:16.590> sort<00:04:16.799> of<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:16.919> reactivity<00:04:17.340> is<00:04:17.639> she's

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
this sort of the reactivity is she's

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.069 
this sort of the reactivity is she's
watching<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.209> ball<00:04:18.359> hit<00:04:18.509> the<00:04:18.539> pins<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:18.900> know<00:04:18.959> if

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
watching the ball hit the pins I know if

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.199 
watching the ball hit the pins I know if
you<00:04:19.169> struck<00:04:19.380> or<00:04:19.500> not<00:04:19.620> did<00:04:19.769> you<00:04:20.150> think<00:04:21.150> you

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
you struck or not did you think you

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.969 
you struck or not did you think you
didn't<00:04:21.509> you<00:04:21.720> know<00:04:21.959> you<00:04:22.019> did<00:04:22.320> you<00:04:22.470> know<00:04:22.770> if<00:04:22.860> you

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
didn't you know you did you know if you

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.210 
didn't you know you did you know if you
struck<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:25.440> it's<00:04:25.620> not<00:04:25.860> that<00:04:26.070> you're<00:04:26.190> not

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
struck and and it's not that you're not

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.320 
struck and and it's not that you're not
supposed<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:26.639> have<00:04:26.729> a<00:04:26.759> reaction<00:04:27.030> we're<00:04:27.240> not

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
supposed to have a reaction we're not

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.969 
supposed to have a reaction we're not
training<00:04:27.870> people<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.199> be<00:04:28.320> robots<00:04:28.770> or

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
training people to be robots or

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.920 
training people to be robots or
automatons<00:04:29.490> here<00:04:29.760> well<00:04:30.270> we<00:04:30.389> are<00:04:30.539> training

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
automatons here well we are training

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.020 
automatons here well we are training
people<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.410> do<00:04:31.590> is<00:04:31.910> to<00:04:32.910> execute<00:04:33.600> and<00:04:34.440> have<00:04:34.740> a

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
people to do is to execute and have a

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.330 
people to do is to execute and have a
split-second<00:04:36.030> of<00:04:36.150> awareness<00:04:37.130> before<00:04:38.130> the

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
split-second of awareness before the

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.920 
split-second of awareness before the
reactive<00:04:38.760> it's<00:04:38.940> like<00:04:39.180> when<00:04:39.389> you<00:04:39.510> wake<00:04:39.630> up<00:04:39.840> in

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
reactive it's like when you wake up in

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.990 
reactive it's like when you wake up in
the<00:04:40.020> morning<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:40.740> when<00:04:41.610> you're<00:04:41.729> laying<00:04:41.850> in

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
the morning and when you're laying in

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.610 
the morning and when you're laying in
bed<00:04:42.120> you<00:04:42.270> can<00:04:42.419> remember<00:04:42.630> that<00:04:42.780> last<00:04:43.080> dream<00:04:43.440> you

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
bed you can remember that last dream you

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.560 
bed you can remember that last dream you
had<00:04:43.770> but<00:04:43.979> if<00:04:44.100> you<00:04:44.190> do<00:04:44.340> anything<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:45.180> dream<00:04:45.419> is

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
had but if you do anything the dream is

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.510 
had but if you do anything the dream is
gone<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:46.440> go<00:04:46.560> brush<00:04:46.770> your<00:04:46.919> teeth<00:04:47.070> you<00:04:47.250> forgot

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
gone you go brush your teeth you forgot

gone you go brush your teeth you forgot
your<00:04:47.610> dream<00:04:47.849> as<00:04:48.510> soon<00:04:48.870> as<00:04:49.020> you<00:04:49.139> start<00:04:49.530> to<00:04:49.710> react

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
your dream as soon as you start to react

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:51.890 
your dream as soon as you start to react
the<00:04:50.820> learning<00:04:51.240> that<00:04:51.360> you<00:04:51.479> might<00:04:51.630> have<00:04:51.750> had

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
the learning that you might have had

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.930 
the learning that you might have had
about<00:04:52.080> what<00:04:52.410> happened<00:04:52.710> in<00:04:52.800> your<00:04:52.889> body<00:04:53.160> or<00:04:53.820> what

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
about what happened in your body or what

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.370 
about what happened in your body or what
happened<00:04:54.270> in<00:04:54.360> terms<00:04:54.539> of<00:04:54.720> how<00:04:54.840> free<00:04:55.080> you<00:04:55.110> were

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
happened in terms of how free you were

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.770 
happened in terms of how free you were
or<00:04:55.710> even<00:04:56.220> what's<00:04:56.789> happening<00:04:57.150> on<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.360> lanes

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
or even what's happening on the lanes

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.890 
or even what's happening on the lanes
you<00:04:58.500> you<00:04:58.770> you<00:04:59.160> start<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.580> erase<00:04:59.760> it<00:04:59.789> fast<00:05:00.449> with

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
you you you start to erase it fast with

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.230 
you you you start to erase it fast with
your<00:05:01.020> reactivity<00:05:01.620> so<00:05:02.340> all<00:05:02.460> we're<00:05:02.610> saying<00:05:02.760> is<00:05:03.030> a

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
your reactivity so all we're saying is a

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.629 
your reactivity so all we're saying is a
split<00:05:03.780> second<00:05:04.229> literally<00:05:04.860> have<00:05:05.070> a<00:05:05.099> second<00:05:05.520> or

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
split second literally have a second or

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.510 
split second literally have a second or
a<00:05:05.669> second<00:05:06.000> of<00:05:06.120> just<00:05:06.389> pure<00:05:06.660> execution<00:05:07.349> and<00:05:07.530> then

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
a second of just pure execution and then

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.210 
a second of just pure execution and then
if<00:05:08.669> you<00:05:08.789> want<00:05:08.970> to<00:05:09.060> have<00:05:09.180> some<00:05:10.130> judgment<00:05:11.130> of

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
if you want to have some judgment of

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.390 
if you want to have some judgment of
reactivity<00:05:11.610> afterwards<00:05:12.270> its<00:05:12.570> afterwards

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
reactivity afterwards its afterwards

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.760 
reactivity afterwards its afterwards
yeah<00:05:14.400> I<00:05:14.430> guess<00:05:15.169> for<00:05:16.169> a<00:05:16.199> long<00:05:16.349> time<00:05:16.530> I<00:05:16.560> thought

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
yeah I guess for a long time I thought

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.290 
yeah I guess for a long time I thought
the<00:05:17.099> goal<00:05:17.550> of<00:05:17.669> the<00:05:17.760> exercise<00:05:18.000> was

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
the goal of the exercise was

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.059 
the goal of the exercise was
you<00:05:19.690> know<00:05:19.780> somehow<00:05:20.050> that<00:05:20.169> my<00:05:20.470> brain<00:05:20.710> couldn't

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069 
you know somehow that my brain couldn't

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:22.710 
you know somehow that my brain couldn't
comprehend<00:05:21.580> all<00:05:21.789> of<00:05:21.909> that<00:05:22.030> information<00:05:22.330> at

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
comprehend all of that information at

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.180 
comprehend all of that information at
once<00:05:22.900> you<00:05:23.169> know<00:05:23.259> if<00:05:23.349> I'm<00:05:23.500> if<00:05:23.830> I'm<00:05:23.949> busy

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
once you know if I'm if I'm busy

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.210 
once you know if I'm if I'm busy
reacting<00:05:24.879> that<00:05:25.419> you<00:05:26.169> know<00:05:26.289> I'm<00:05:26.440> not<00:05:26.560> able<00:05:26.830> to

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
reacting that you know I'm not able to

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.390 
reacting that you know I'm not able to
kind<00:05:27.490> of<00:05:27.610> at<00:05:27.819> least<00:05:27.970> digest<00:05:29.129> you<00:05:30.129> know<00:05:30.250> the

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
kind of at least digest you know the

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.219 
kind of at least digest you know the
accuracy<00:05:31.000> the<00:05:31.030> ball<00:05:31.419> motion<00:05:31.780> they're<00:05:31.930> all<00:05:32.020> all

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
accuracy the ball motion they're all all

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:33.960 
accuracy the ball motion they're all all
those<00:05:32.470> things<00:05:32.710> that<00:05:32.800> are<00:05:32.919> valuable<00:05:33.250> in<00:05:33.580> making

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
those things that are valuable in making

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.850 
those things that are valuable in making
a<00:05:34.090> good<00:05:34.479> decision<00:05:34.720> for<00:05:34.900> the<00:05:35.110> next<00:05:35.139> shot<00:05:35.530> yes

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
a good decision for the next shot yes

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.939 
a good decision for the next shot yes
and<00:05:36.159> so<00:05:36.599> and<00:05:37.599> yeah<00:05:37.960> typically<00:05:38.409> that<00:05:38.620> is<00:05:38.740> that

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
and so and yeah typically that is that

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.080 
and so and yeah typically that is that
it's<00:05:39.099> definitely<00:05:39.460> a<00:05:39.490> struggle<00:05:39.699> of<00:05:39.940> mine

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
it's definitely a struggle of mine

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.629 
it's definitely a struggle of mine
because<00:05:40.389> I<00:05:40.569> am<00:05:41.050> reactive<00:05:41.650> and<00:05:41.800> it<00:05:41.889> shows<00:05:42.129> part

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
because I am reactive and it shows part

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.219 
because I am reactive and it shows part
of<00:05:42.699> what's<00:05:42.849> happening<00:05:43.210> is<00:05:43.330> is<00:05:43.870> you<00:05:44.080> may<00:05:44.199> be

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
of what's happening is is you may be

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.260 
of what's happening is is you may be
losing<00:05:44.800> some<00:05:45.039> information<00:05:45.699> and<00:05:45.909> it<00:05:46.120> may<00:05:46.210> be

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
losing some information and it may be

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.149 
losing some information and it may be
keeping<00:05:46.690> you<00:05:46.810> from<00:05:47.020> really<00:05:47.440> picking<00:05:47.800> out<00:05:47.919> some

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:48.159 
keeping you from really picking out some

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:50.100 
keeping you from really picking out some
important<00:05:48.610> focal<00:05:48.970> points<00:05:49.270> whether<00:05:49.449> it's<00:05:49.990> in

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
important focal points whether it's in

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.869 
important focal points whether it's in
your<00:05:50.139> arm<00:05:50.379> swing<00:05:50.560> or<00:05:50.919> any<00:05:51.400> other<00:05:51.580> part<00:05:51.849> of

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:51.879 
your arm swing or any other part of

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:54.659 
your arm swing or any other part of
what's<00:05:52.060> going<00:05:52.210> on<00:05:52.479> here<00:05:53.069> it's<00:05:54.069> challenging<00:05:54.550> I

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
what's going on here it's challenging I

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.820 
what's going on here it's challenging I
know<00:05:54.759> as<00:05:55.180> we<00:05:55.330> said<00:05:55.509> it's<00:05:55.659> been<00:05:55.810> hard<00:05:56.080> but<00:05:56.680> the

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
know as we said it's been hard but the

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.580 
know as we said it's been hard but the
clearer<00:05:57.310> your<00:05:57.639> screen<00:05:58.150> the<00:05:58.690> more<00:05:58.930> information

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
clearer your screen the more information

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.709 
clearer your screen the more information
that<00:05:59.740> can<00:05:59.889> imprint<00:06:00.280> on<00:06:00.430> it<00:06:00.580> the<00:06:01.120> muddy<00:06:01.389> or<00:06:01.569> the

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:01.719 
that can imprint on it the muddy or the

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:03.839 
that can imprint on it the muddy or the
screen<00:06:02.050> the<00:06:02.530> harder<00:06:02.889> it<00:06:02.979> is<00:06:03.069> for<00:06:03.129> information

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:03.849 
screen the harder it is for information

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:05.550 
screen the harder it is for information
to<00:06:04.120> sort<00:06:04.419> of<00:06:04.449> be<00:06:04.599> put<00:06:04.810> in<00:06:04.930> a<00:06:05.020> place<00:06:05.110> that<00:06:05.229> it<00:06:05.469> can

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
to sort of be put in a place that it can

to sort of be put in a place that it can
be<00:06:05.680> retained<00:06:06.300> it<00:06:07.300> sort<00:06:07.509> of<00:06:07.539> reminds<00:06:07.870> me<00:06:07.990> of

be retained it sort of reminds me of

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.390 
be retained it sort of reminds me of
another<00:06:08.169> exercise<00:06:08.710> that<00:06:08.770> you<00:06:09.009> did<00:06:09.159> with<00:06:09.280> me

we said it as more sort of zip codes

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:55.830 
we said it as more sort of zip codes
open<00:06:54.370> up<00:06:54.490> in<00:06:54.639> terms<00:06:54.849> of<00:06:54.969> attention<00:06:55.449> there's
