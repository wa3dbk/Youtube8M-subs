00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.869
 How are you doing on this occasion? 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.759
 videogames for the year 1992 brought us to 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.529
 the arcade fire arcade machines 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.480
 of fighters he started a trilogy a 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.100
 game that marked a before and after 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.449
 the time of airplane games that 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.610
 we have to go shooting and killing 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.989
 every god more than anything looks like a hack 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.820
 and slash of aircraft from a very game 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.920
 difficult having a trilogy up 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.510
 eurofighter 3 very good by which 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.399
 they did for super nintendo of this 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.769
 version to me is something that I liked 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.170
 very much the by it is necessary to emphasize the 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.120
 version of eurofighter May 3 which is 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.420
 sublime I'm going to insert a credit come on 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.100
 Let's see how it is given to us. 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.960
 before a game I 'm going to catch here 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.629
 I catch this one before a game a 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.540
 very good entertainment quality and 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.370
 of entertainment shooting gameplay 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.700
 control 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.170
 that we are screwed because there are ten 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.190
 fifteen hundred enemies so we have 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.870
 to be quite fast 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.780
 I like a lot of airplanes game 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.120
 I am very bad I am always the first 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.810
 of all but they are games that to me 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.700
 I really like it 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.530
 I would never get to spend a bad game 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.659
 fighter with a credit in my life because 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.299
 I consider everything at least for me 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.710
 I consider it quite a feat that someone 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.909
 spend this with a credit would be 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.039
 incredible I'm going to do the little 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.490
 example that we are seeing and it already begins 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.929
 the thing to get a little fucked up 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.000
 reception of the power up that the 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.789
 shots less bad 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.500
 there was shit they did not give me there 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.240
 violated had to prove a good 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.159
 way to get rid of releasing a good 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.110
 pump at a certain moment and we 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.850
 we free from certain death like there is no 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.770
 for example that he was going to die surely 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.690
 and I do not want to play them again and the 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.909
 palmarla with all of the law for the 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.679
 I command fines treatment you see yourself as 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.390
 we are seeing the screen is very 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.220
 heavy enemy I'm very fucked up because 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.509
 I will not stop moving do not want me 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.269
 reach a shot because a shot 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.709
 means goodbye and how much that in equal 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:15.840
 of course it was a bomb 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.340
 I was seeing my destiny I do not know if 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.130
 this is the phase boss you do not want is 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.940
 a deputy chief I guess I've already done 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.750
 eat the pump and again because go 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.120
 go go colleague god 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.069
 and pretty fucked up the old-fashioned way 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.819
 throwing shots everywhere 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.849
 how difficult it is that a difficult game is 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.730
 a game quite difficult god but another 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.799
 Once God has raped me, come on let's go 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.420
 give him another chance because I 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.489
 I'd like to talk about this great 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.379
 games since they are three fun games 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.150
 a credit will be pe this was the head of 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.140
 the phase had given me for all the 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.940
 possible ways 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.410
 now for example is another level this 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.970
 game also has a very good 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.440
 expectation at the time of starting the 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.080
 levels for example if we start those 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.400
 levels with different characters we do not 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.840
 let's put the first level that 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.420
 we have seen before we put another one in fact 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.340
 harder what makes it a bit 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.560
 variable when playing with the 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.700
 different characters and with so 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.810
 say it the environment that has wishes not 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.550
 it's the same game of using a bomb 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.500
 that they will violate me not the same game 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.970
 the first the second good if it is not 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.920
 somewhat variable since the same starts in 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.120
 a very difficult phase or start in a 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.010
 phase that is thrown to me has touched me 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.410
 as I have seen some phase that was not 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.050
 nothing easy in a tiny cam putada 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.720
 this phase sounds to me like it was a little more 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.660
 easy to boxer a little bit, but the 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.510
 I was hit by two bombs before 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.780
 that we two bombs good ten thousand 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.489
 shots take bomb is the moment in the 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.320
 pump is the moment of salvation I'll 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.420
 I say yes yes you have to reserve them as is 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.160
 but at a certain moment like now 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.120
 when we have the screen and enemies do not 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.440
 they reserve nothing we keep nothing we go to 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.780
 die that is what we want to not die 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.950
 owning something like a giant if evil 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.090
 I do not remember 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.300
 I i i I 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.379
 take bomb to take for sack I have not 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.379
 we committed a lot to the head 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.780
 God, do not see if it 's hard and I have the 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:20.489
 power to the maximum of the shot there is the 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:23.970
 boss the boss like god with the box we go 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.010
 come on, if it was that it was written 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.670
 I'm going to die was city ​​maximum in that 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.890
 moment you're going to die a little easier 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.050
 as we have seen two good bombs 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.240
 dice we have loaded it has not been something 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.330
 very complicated 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.250
 to see this level all this was japan 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.960
 Goth that I do not see on the map 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:48.330
 I know very good geography 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.330
 it is not a virtue of geography 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.870
 we are seeing that it is crazy 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.200
 transient practically because I do not see 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.050
 that is, you can not stop moving neither 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.020
 two seconds 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.389
 and many of the cool shots these 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:09.080
 planes that pass them what piece of 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:11.940
 doping do not you see 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:16.110
 I am the one who goes for them 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.370
 please as there really is an aspect 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.650
 that I would like to analyze what is the 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.110
 control of the game that is very good is 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.030
 something that this saga I really like the 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.920
 control he has is very good but 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.170
 clear at the same time we have that is that if the 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.120
 otherwise it's going to be bad as I ate it 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.710
 with the speed that we have to do in 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.289
 every act this what is this what the fuck 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.210
 austria the classic boss 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.670
 this is the classic boss of this saga yo 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.240
 I'm going to use bombs everywhere 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.240
 8 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.380
 let me stay, I do not have more 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.590
 either that I left what of him 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:53.240
 millions 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:56.670
 well let's hope he does not kill me and this is 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.980
 this shit that ends the scream that 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.330
 paste good friends from youtube 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.070
 I say goodbye here I hope you like the 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.520
 video we see the next video up
