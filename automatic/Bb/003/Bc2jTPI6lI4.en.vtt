00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.130
 today in morocco 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.189
 You have to dream and build your schedule. 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:31.980
 and this year 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.710
 I'm showing 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.530
 be carried out on the slopes of reality, closer and closer to the 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.650
 if you think about the future 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.090
 and in the near future 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.230
 it is ours we are announcing the content with funds run been channel what 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.290
 Because I start strangely at first 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.310
 this is 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.160
 a channel that is the people 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.660
 he people chose the contents want to see impechment times being contained dodo 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.210
 dudu of the protectorate was going to be the one that did not have a channel to be served 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.970
 it's the score 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.610
 this audience and come individual merkel over 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.750
 transit and 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.290
 to exemplify it is an audience that by itself has no value 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.480
 in small applications 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.120
 so it only has value 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.560
 is created 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.149
 a slope that characterizes a peace treaty with which a truest marketer 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.930
 terron 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.600
 it is not a solution and they spend hours and have a certain 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.430
 prefer 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.600
 no minimally unsuccessful system will achieve 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.660
 only that it identifies the visa also between the way 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.270
 I'm the way with what the 15 years 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.350
 Let's hope to live longer. 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.740
 Now this is evolving to think of the correct way in the Brazilian 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.530
 the future cadastre 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.580
 has very little wanted to do with opposition metrics 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.869
 - that ana rech required open lists 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.839
 It's all just coming together 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:16.399
 to be absences and massed hours 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.309
 it's very important 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:23.249
 having in landfills above expectation audiences that have nothing to do with 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.209
 mauricio due list 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.040
 I was sad by the angel of that what is going to be the one when getting out of the car to laugh more 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.090
 has that it comes in a way as the beautiful and the beast of fratel fly the commission 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.989
 open 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.619
 sought 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:41.569
 frequency and above all the concession of this culture 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.359
 with a magnitude 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.719
 the citizen 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:49.169
 not getting integer is the coverage to charge in this perspective 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.819
 It's important because 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.939
 In this perspective, the market can be shaken. 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.849
 dictated by you the amount will move forward so the way he 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.589
 had to be faced having to change will have to have 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:07.999
 It will have to be much more. 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:08.689
