00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
they're so pro-obama and I am I just I

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.470 
they're so pro-obama and I am I just I
guess<00:03:12.430> what<00:03:12.550> I<00:03:12.610> want<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.850> say<00:03:12.970> about<00:03:13.150> that<00:03:13.269> is

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
guess what I want to say about that is

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.370 
guess what I want to say about that is
is<00:03:13.870> because<00:03:15.180> his<00:03:16.180> diverse<00:03:17.790> background<00:03:19.380> that's

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
is because his diverse background that's

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.590 
is because his diverse background that's
I<00:03:20.800> think<00:03:21.489> that's<00:03:21.700> what's<00:03:21.940> really<00:03:22.209> going<00:03:22.540> to

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
I think that's what's really going to

I think that's what's really going to
make<00:03:22.780> us<00:03:23.110> you<00:03:23.440> safer<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.280> restore<00:03:24.640> our
