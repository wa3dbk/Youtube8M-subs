00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
I think it's okay so this is just the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.500 
I think it's okay so this is just the
bottom<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> stand<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.180> looks<00:01:09.330> like

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
bottom of the stand so it looks like

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.030 
bottom of the stand so it looks like
what<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.720> do<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.229> take<00:01:10.380> out<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.740> screw

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
what you do is you take out the screw

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.399 
what you do is you take out the screw

to<00:02:32.770> put<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.130> on<00:02:33.340> but<00:02:33.610> I'm<00:02:33.700> gonna<00:02:33.820> guess<00:02:34.090> like

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
to put that on but I'm gonna guess like

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.870 
to put that on but I'm gonna guess like
the<00:02:34.570> red<00:02:34.750> tag<00:02:35.110> goes<00:02:35.350> in<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.590> back<00:02:35.800> so<00:02:36.460> you<00:02:36.490> just

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
the red tag goes in the back so you just

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.580 
the red tag goes in the back so you just
that<00:02:37.120> for<00:02:37.330> your<00:02:37.480> head<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.960> then<00:02:38.380> what<00:02:38.560> that

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
that for your head and then what that

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.250 
that for your head and then what that
does<00:02:39.040> is<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.550> fits<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.300> oh<00:02:40.390> no<00:02:40.630> wait<00:02:40.840> no<00:02:40.960> this<00:02:41.140> is

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
does is it fits it oh no wait no this is

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.350 
does is it fits it oh no wait no this is
supposed<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.710> be<00:02:41.920> like<00:02:42.490> attached<00:02:42.910> so<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.210> looks

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
supposed to be like attached so it looks

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.910 
supposed to be like attached so it looks
like<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.660> glue<00:02:43.870> came<00:02:44.140> off<00:02:44.380> okay<00:02:44.740> that's

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
like the glue came off okay that's

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.240 
like the glue came off okay that's
alright

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
alright

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.630 
alright
okay<00:02:45.850> so<00:02:45.910> then<00:02:46.270> you<00:02:46.540> put<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.260> helmet<00:02:47.440> on<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.370> I

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
okay so then you put the helmet on and I

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.610 
okay so then you put the helmet on and I
guess<00:02:48.850> that<00:02:48.880> adjusts<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.080> size<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.560> the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
guess that adjusts the size of the

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.020 
guess that adjusts the size of the
helmet<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.100> fit<00:02:51.250> your<00:02:51.370> head<00:02:51.550> now<00:02:51.730> this<00:02:51.880> is

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
helmet to fit your head now this is

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.850 
helmet to fit your head now this is
making<00:02:52.240> me<00:02:52.540> feel<00:02:52.780> like<00:02:53.350> my<00:02:53.500> head's<00:02:53.740> a<00:02:53.830> little
