00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.530 
except change the reverb and chorus
settings<00:01:57.540> for<00:01:57.750> each<00:01:57.780> tone<00:01:59.360> transpose<00:02:00.360> I'm

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
settings for each tone transpose I'm

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.070 
settings for each tone transpose I'm
going<00:02:00.690> to<00:02:00.750> go<00:02:00.870> ahead<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.170> set<00:02:01.620> the<00:02:01.830> the

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
going to go ahead and set the the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.540 
going to go ahead and set the the
strings<00:02:04.080> to<00:02:04.320> an<00:02:04.590> octave<00:02:05.010> down<00:02:05.190> so<00:02:05.370> I'm<00:02:05.430> going

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
strings to an octave down so I'm going

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.969 
strings to an octave down so I'm going
to<00:02:05.580> go<00:02:05.700> negative<00:02:05.940> 12<00:02:06.570> which<00:02:07.260> is<00:02:07.290> since<00:02:07.830> that's

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
to go negative 12 which is since that's

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.320 
to go negative 12 which is since that's
in<00:02:08.100> half<00:02:08.280> steps<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.729> would<00:02:08.850> be<00:02:08.940> an<00:02:09.030> octave

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
in half steps that would be an octave

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.130 
in half steps that would be an octave
down<00:02:11.810> like<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:14.720> now<00:02:15.720> I'm<00:02:15.780> gonna<00:02:15.870> go<00:02:16.020> in<00:02:16.110> and

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
down like that now I'm gonna go in and

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.770 
down like that now I'm gonna go in and
add<00:02:16.800> layer<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.760> another<00:02:18.030> sound<00:02:18.330> let's<00:02:18.540> put<00:02:18.690> an

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
add layer in another sound let's put an

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.880 
add layer in another sound let's put an
organ<00:02:19.050> down<00:02:19.170> there<00:02:19.350> so<00:02:19.530> I'm<00:02:19.620> gonna<00:02:19.709> go<00:02:19.800> back

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
organ down there so I'm gonna go back

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.150 
organ down there so I'm gonna go back
over<00:02:20.040> here<00:02:20.280> turn<00:02:20.970> on<00:02:21.090> my<00:02:21.209> third<00:02:21.480> part<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.160> then

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
over here turn on my third part and then

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.070 
over here turn on my third part and then
set<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.180> be<00:02:24.300> an<00:02:24.390> organ<00:02:24.660> like<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:27.080> you

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
set it to be an organ like that you

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.810 
set it to be an organ like that you
can't<00:02:28.290> really<00:02:28.440> hear<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.770> so<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.310> can<00:02:29.430> also<00:02:29.550> use

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
can't really hear it so you can also use

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.760 
can't really hear it so you can also use
these<00:02:30.000> sliders<00:02:30.720> over<00:02:31.140> here<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.410> adjust<00:02:31.470> the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
these sliders over here to adjust the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.160 
these sliders over here to adjust the
volume<00:02:32.100> so<00:02:32.790> if<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:32.970> go<00:02:33.120> up<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.930> then<00:02:34.080> down

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
volume so if I go up and then down

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.690 
volume so if I go up and then down
there's<00:02:37.170> my<00:02:37.350> organ<00:02:37.860> sound<00:02:40.190> there's<00:02:41.190> my<00:02:41.400> string

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
there's my organ sound there's my string

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.500 
there's my organ sound there's my string
sound<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:47.190> after<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.549> get<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.820> set<00:02:48.120> up<00:02:48.180> just

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
sound so after you get it set up just

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.300 
sound so after you get it set up just
the<00:02:48.600> way<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.780> want<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.500> can<00:02:49.650> now<00:02:49.739> save<00:02:50.070> this

the way you want you can now save this

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.300 
the way you want you can now save this
to<00:02:50.489> memory<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.709> so<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.769> can<00:02:52.860> get<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.040> back<00:02:53.160> to
