00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
in the first place right so it's you

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.180 
in the first place right so it's you
think<00:01:45.690> what<00:01:45.899> they<00:01:46.050> care<00:01:46.380> anything<00:01:46.649> about<00:01:46.860> what

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
think what they care anything about what

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.790 
think what they care anything about what
you<00:01:47.369> think<00:01:47.929> in<00:01:48.929> some<00:01:49.200> ways<00:01:49.410> but<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:52.470> reason<00:01:52.709> I

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
you think in some ways but the reason I

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.960 
you think in some ways but the reason I
say<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.039> is<00:01:53.250> because<00:01:53.580> I<00:01:54.360> bug<00:01:54.840> my<00:01:54.989> hair<00:01:55.259> and

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
say that is because I bug my hair and

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.940 
say that is because I bug my hair and
sometimes<00:01:56.970> my<00:01:57.270> hair<00:01:57.450> look<00:01:57.750> good<00:01:57.929> or<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.319> just

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
sometimes my hair look good or I just

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.680 
sometimes my hair look good or I just
buy<00:01:59.250> my<00:01:59.399> hair<00:01:59.580> for<00:01:59.700> an<00:01:59.759> entire<00:02:00.000> week<00:02:00.239> and

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
buy my hair for an entire week and

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.559 
buy my hair for an entire week and
sometimes<00:02:01.349> I<00:02:01.679> feel<00:02:01.920> like<00:02:02.060> hey<00:02:03.060> maybe<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.539> should

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
sometimes I feel like hey maybe I should

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.270 
sometimes I feel like hey maybe I should
do<00:02:03.899> something<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.200> my<00:02:04.410> hair<00:02:04.590> or<00:02:04.800> let<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.069> down

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
do something to my hair or let it down

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.669 
do something to my hair or let it down
but<00:02:06.030> then<00:02:06.209> again<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:07.020> reason<00:02:07.229> why<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.410> say<00:02:07.619> it

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
but then again the reason why I say it

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.760 
but then again the reason why I say it
is<00:02:07.860> because<00:02:08.060> if<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.209> let<00:02:09.360> my<00:02:09.479> hair<00:02:09.660> down<00:02:09.899> I'm

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
is because if I let my hair down I'm

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.490 
is because if I let my hair down I'm
defeating<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.849> purpose<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.450> bun<00:02:12.840> in<00:02:12.959> my<00:02:13.110> hair

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
defeating the purpose of bun in my hair

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.490 
defeating the purpose of bun in my hair
which<00:02:13.829> is<00:02:14.780> you're<00:02:15.780> gonna<00:02:15.840> have<00:02:16.049> your<00:02:16.230> hair<00:02:16.379> on

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
which is you're gonna have your hair on

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.670 
which is you're gonna have your hair on
your<00:02:16.620> shoulders

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
your shoulders

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.839 
your shoulders
and<00:02:17.769> then<00:02:18.189> it's<00:02:18.340> going<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.519> be<00:02:18.610> brushing

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
and then it's going to be brushing
