00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.039
 it seemed that only superficial 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.109
 this is too much successful success and so 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.480

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.090
 not that Timur is so much 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.190
 structured and so exactly 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.619
 explained how really 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.840
 be aware of your inner ones exactly 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.210
 real spiritual desires like 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.130

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.479
 sit like 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.460
 come from the soul and another important 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.990
 the moment that I am for myself from just him 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.460

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.009

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.130

 say was absolutely cool 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.390
 magic phrase that a good attitude is not 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.460
 tolerate ready-made solutions that is, we when 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.990
 we have something ready to bring that is 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.240
 we we impose another person we 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.189
 just destroying this relationship it was 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.390
