00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.770
 I show you today how this hairstyle 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.330
 is in fact were a brass called 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.240
 The ball proudly I think it's real 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.410
 hard with such a thin smooth 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.849
 to make hair as I I 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.099
 he refers to a serving hair 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.380
 but maybe I'm standing by them 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.759
 girl with thin hair and I face 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.320
 you, that we continue if it so far 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.940
 did not make such a cool 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.350
 events make it a whole lot longer 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.340
 just can not do it though 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.700
 everyone is just always so 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.200
 small pieces on top of it and 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.420
 Meanwhile, it is also so that 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.520
 my hair is really around without menus 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.989
 It is important to say that it is on 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.420
 Do not do it on the first day 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.820
 have showered because because the hair for 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.199
 kids he can be very smooth and thin and there 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.640
 you actually work a lot 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.280
 That's why I would always go second 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.949
 make it work of me it that he 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.059
 about after the hair already in this 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.339
 makes fast pressure because then they are 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.619
 hair so light it easily maneuverable 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.330
 and a bit you have to 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.890
 simply handy with it could because 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.450
 directly better hairstyle do what I 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.760
 recommend it, either we 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.020
 before dry shampoo plus because it with 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.610
 Everyone also this grip 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.650
 The important thing is smooth 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.229
 hair that your god or generally on 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.030
 hairstyle holds or is just volume of powder 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.409
 that 's also the case now 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.720
 many brands 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.040
 I also help a lot because it too 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.479
 so a little bit of years makes zschiedrich 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.700
 that just keeps the hairstyle again and 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.079
 somewhere lumen comes in and I would 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.869
 say i just catch another time i 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.850
 this hairstyle made ok i start 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.770
 just with it the hair topia 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.810
 I do not think so with thin 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.890
 and smooth 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.930
 I just always start at the back 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.160
 behind the scenes, copy everything 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.530
 really takes a broader for it 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.110
 I think brushing is easier 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.910
 even better is such an extra paper came 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.979
 did not know if that was always in the back of the head 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.780
 so that the hair there in the beautiful 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.220
 hold and just not like down 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.050
 slip or is installed and summer 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.270
 it just has to stop somewhere more and more 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.710
 then then in the future just the lengths 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.160
 really through everything 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.280
 of course and the peri every strand 1 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.280
 are 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.770
 the whole shows up once with 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.990
 haas up for so the problem already 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.670
 right in it does not stay uneven 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.670
 hope to be gone again 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.269
 just put my hair draw on 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.790
 1 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:50.050
 that makes and always all the hair up 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.519
 and so it makes in the side relatively tight 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.230
 and whoever is not so far up that they 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.640
 just as much volume would be the whole thing 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.319
 not so accused is but that is 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.420
 I believe something so personal 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.420
 taste could do that we want 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.260
 so if you have all the above are 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.870
 I put my finger in the middle so nicely 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.660
 find your head and just turn it 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.700
 the other hairs around and try 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.049
 just that I do not like the hair 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.569
 a nonsense but that I just 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:21.079
 lay around and all this education 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.640
 not pushing off again when I am 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.769
 So the end is important too 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.660
 that she always lies around each other 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.610
 that she does not go up that way 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.920
 that they are always farther out 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.870
 which are turned at the last 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.560
 wrestle and I 'm just stuck then 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.780
 below underneath and turns it so easily 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.940
 under this whole other hair mountain 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:46.850
 The whole thing then feels with the 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.829
 hair would be relatively loose for me now 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.769
 So do not call negative down 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:57.410
 I usually like that after how long 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:59.180
 the album is three times today then 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.430
 The whole thing sits up here relatively easy 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.510
 but I like to pull it like that 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.099
 a bit apart with them 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:09.380
 even more volume is created and yours 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:12.069
 direction that eth brackets need 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.069
 your breakfast 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.329
 Just yak it up once in a row 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.900
 purely in the back and on the two sides 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.030
 a sloppy and I will 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.590
 I always recognize that now 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.160
 here through the hair go through that 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.230
 whole once stuck under it and 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.460
 so the whole thing is fixed well without that 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.460
 just that you go away 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:55.349
 then the whole thing could be another one 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:57.060
 maybe pull apart a bit 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.379
 wrong hair strands out 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.629
 stuck the whole of it 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:01.440
 plug in 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:10.440
 I would be friends a bit 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:13.889
 out a bit more relaxed and so on 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.270
 it just can not be quite sure if it is 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.129
 has done properly or not but 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.719
 from the principle of ire saturday is a 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:20.219
 So little drugs try more that 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:20.909
 It took me longer to really do it 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:22.620
 worked 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:25.050
 you have to look how much meant 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.969
 piel and how the Sun sets and so but 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.199
 try it after so many times 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:30.270
 I worked out and I think 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:31.860
 it was also occasionally that too 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.919
 ever a short tutorial how to 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.500
 sometime very simple voluminous 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.750
 moves does so a bit s-bahn and 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.940
 and not all that but I hope so 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.990
 works also with you to hear gladly 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.840
 also that you are like that now 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.580
 works like me because I know 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.560
 that I did not have the best 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.419
 but my heart already in the sense 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.430
 something she very much always like that 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.930
 slip out of people so I 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.819
 but now wants to be interested in whether that 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.120
 Girls still hair too 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:04.349
 is working 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:05.759
 among adolescent has that's it 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:07.259
 as I said with a tutorial I hope 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:08.460
 you liked the opposite side 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:10.380
 Happy if you tell me if it will be the same 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.669
 Also works or not be much 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.770
 we'll be back in the next video 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.770
 I am happy when a state shoots
