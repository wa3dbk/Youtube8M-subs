00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 in this clip we build on the previous one 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.099
 clip that is in the previous club went 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.590
 to use it for profit 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.559
 this time it's about loss positions 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.120
 so long to play and so good 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.840
 to continue playing that to the opponent 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.670
 to cause maximum difficulties 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.439
 and as for some players 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.250
 it is difficult to win positions 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.650
 exploit 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.510
 this with other players so they 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.949
 as soon as you get into worse position 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.380
 come on the part inwardly check off 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.719
 internally means to check off 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.540
 actually am already poor you 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.520
 can you give up immediately 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.850
 and yes, I'll stop playing now 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.850
 few trains 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.989
 I take the opinion when you 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.280
 stand worse and this thought 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.510
 but then they should cry 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.510
 about two options 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.480
 Thoughts do one thing 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.699
 Opportunity is the give 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.860
 partie on the pour the opponent the 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.250
 Hand save yourself in one of their energy 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.890
 resource when the when to 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.140
 a tournament can be traded 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.180
 the next day with new energy again 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.640
 his variant go 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.070
 the second variant is aware 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.259
 to decide against the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.140
 opponent in this situation maximum 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.740
 to make problems and for this is this 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.390
 thought 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.250
 actually i can give it to him like that 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.380
 even now a few trains at all 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.990
 not helpful 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.920
 which thought would be helpful 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.530
 consider that for her 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.159
 we have an idea what thought that 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.200
 can be 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.780
 exactly what I said before 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.689
 but perhaps for them 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.380
 other thought better and more helpful 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.610
 that is the same as we have in the 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.290
 profit position and how we look at it 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.649
 Exploit profits already 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:00.659
 that is what thought meant 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.909
 it helpful the thought now who the 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.860
 Opponents pose maximum problems and he 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.670
 you have to prove that he is the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.940
 she actually wins if she does 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.520
 think of this thought instead of that 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.450
 I actually already have thoughts 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.489
 loss position and you know 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.440
 actually revealed trains 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.260
 yet then they will be with another 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.080
 setting with another reason 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.620
 entwine resource to the board and their trains 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.060
 do 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.950
 her goal is not even now 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.860
 to make a few moves but your goal 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.000
 it is then for each individual train the 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.160
 opponents to oppose the maximum 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.280
 you still have maximum problems too 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.400
 make and you will remember if you 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.910
 Do that when you replace your thoughts 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.099
 that is the old thought actually 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.909
 could be absorbed by the new thought 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.620
 I imagine maximum problems would be them 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.019
 many lots already 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.420
 lost are still able to turn around what 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.920
 is the most unpleasant thing to an opponent 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.500
 the one win position can happen 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.680
 the better position it has 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.650
 the most unpleasant thing that can happen to him is 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.950
 that she better resist maximum 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.360
 gets that he resisted a lot 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.790
 The self has this experience 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.510
 are made by her that she prefers 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.069
 have played a few months and you 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.209
 have the opening not good 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:36.950
 was played with my thoughts 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:36.950
 somewhere else and have relatively fast 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.790
 material set and actually 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:46.349
 then had ten minutes needed around 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.560
 to realize that and we have that 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:51.530
 question asked give this game now 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.640
 par 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.930
 worth considering 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.970
 That would be a big tournament now 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.189
 are probably the first batch 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.200
 That was the first in the tenth train 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:07.069
 party that is over now and there always 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.690
 thought to that need not be 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.120
 the alternative is like us too 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.319
 less material to the opponent maximum 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.060
 to make difficulties 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.949
 the opponent was nominally a little bit 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.699
 weaker than me and that's exactly what I have 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.850
 then done 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:23.090
 the partie another 50 trains and took 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.979
 in the end, the game won 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.900
 not because then I'm so terrific 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:32.790
 played chess but that's why 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:35.370
 because my opponent has realized that now 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.030
 suddenly resistance is there and this 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:42.120
 Resistance has led to the 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.160
 advantage of this very clear from the 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.680
 opening out of the first ten trains 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.260
 out first, a bigger one 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.229
 has become and suddenly he has 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.820
 started to let up 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.389
 suddenly the advantage is less and less 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.979
 become and subjectively each computer 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.550
 engine has it then also still with 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:05.100
 clear advantage for him but valued 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.889
 perceived advantage was less and less 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.020
 available and what then leads to it 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.180
 is that he starts to doubt he 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.349
 already has a better position and 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.250
 suddenly it will be in resistance 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:18.800
 opposite 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:21.330
 that's what I got 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.060
 with firm conviction in the 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.460
 situation went to every access 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.310
 I always put the maximum problems 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.530
 everything is possible so do 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.330
 not easy to win the game 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.590
 that will not always succeed 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.570
 still lose games 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.099
 but what you can do at the end 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.300
 is she can look in the mirror 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:42.000
 can look and say you have that 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.830
 opponents in this lot also after mine 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.289
 Error even after my mistakes 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.889
 possibly maximum problems 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:51.300
 and they will be satisfied 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:53.070
 with yourself and with what you do 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.760
 have tried and ultimately it works 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:06:01.139
 that they are after their game of chess 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:04.080
 are satisfied and yes and now and then 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:07.320
 they will succeed in this way too 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.050
 this by this method as possible 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:13.020
 good results to have a whole 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.180
 important basic setting successful 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.770
 are to be top players in the 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.770
 essential this basic setting
