that<00:00:14.910> I've<00:00:15.000> posted<00:00:15.150> about<00:00:15.570> but<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.839> was<00:00:15.929> just

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
that I've posted about but it was just

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.760 
that I've posted about but it was just
too<00:00:16.260> heavy<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.699> have<00:00:18.529> purchased<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.590> few

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
too heavy and so I have purchased a few

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.790 
too heavy and so I have purchased a few
things<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.550> made<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> little<00:00:21.119> smaller<00:00:21.510> so

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
things and made it a little smaller so

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.640 
things and made it a little smaller so
it<00:00:22.800> fits<00:00:22.830> about<00:00:23.189> was<00:00:24.029> about<00:00:24.240> eight<00:00:24.449> inches<00:00:24.840> and

brush for so and I use these when I'm
traveling<00:01:24.299> only<00:01:24.420> mainly<00:01:24.960> because<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.259> have

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
traveling only mainly because I have

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.880 
traveling only mainly because I have
another<00:01:27.049> watercolor<00:01:28.049> kit<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.380> hold<00:01:28.590> some<00:01:28.740> more

another watercolor kit to hold some more

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:38.330 
another watercolor kit to hold some more
so<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:35.689> water<00:01:36.689> holder<00:01:37.340> this

this<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.060> not<00:01:42.090> watertight<00:01:43.040> so<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.250> leaks<00:01:44.549> and

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
this is not watertight so it leaks and

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.190

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
best brushes but they're great for

like it ones round ones flat which
really<00:02:58.020> helps<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:59.130> back<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.550> these<00:02:59.670> really

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
quick this is a flat 5/8 and this is a

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.320 
quick this is a flat 5/8 and this is a
number<00:03:03.870> 4<00:03:04.110> round<00:03:04.410> so<00:03:05.070> I<00:03:05.370> would<00:03:05.850> imagine<00:03:06.090> that

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
number 4 round so I would imagine that

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.880 
number 4 round so I would imagine that
this<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:08.310> 2<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:09.350> don't<00:03:10.350> know<00:03:10.470> though<00:03:10.650> for<00:03:10.860> sure
