atheists say that because Santa Claus
doesn't<00:00:19.529> exist<00:00:19.680> therefore<00:00:20.220> God<00:00:20.820> doesn't

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
doesn't exist therefore God doesn't

bad<00:00:24.210> position<00:00:24.420> for<00:00:24.869> an<00:00:24.960> atheist<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.410> hold<00:00:25.650> if

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
bad position for an atheist to hold if

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.700 
bad position for an atheist to hold if
in<00:00:26.400> fact<00:00:26.580> see<00:00:26.880> if<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.449> fact<00:00:27.630> he<00:00:27.869> does<00:00:28.560> not

atheists generally tend to believe that

atheists generally tend to believe that
the<00:01:46.229> universe<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.890> function<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.119> time

however if we go to scripture now if you

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.999 
however if we go to scripture now if you
don't<00:01:54.810> believe<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.170> Bible<00:01:55.560> then<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:55.860> has

look around us look around us now
whether<00:04:54.669> this<00:04:54.930> intelligent<00:04:55.930> designer<00:04:56.229> is<00:04:56.470> one

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:07.509 
intelligent designer out there there is

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.350 
intelligent designer out there there is
tons<00:05:08.169> and<00:05:08.590> loads<00:05:08.949> of<00:05:09.130> evidence<00:05:09.490> for<00:05:09.729> it<00:05:09.819> look

tons and loads of evidence for it look

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.180 
tons and loads of evidence for it look

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
around us look at the cell look at the

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
around us look at the cell look at the
complexity<00:05:12.819> of<00:05:12.940> our<00:05:13.300> cell<00:05:13.599> it's<00:05:14.470> it

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
complexity of our cell it's it

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.700 
complexity of our cell it's it
flabbergast<00:05:16.210> me<00:05:16.509> even<00:05:17.229> that's<00:05:17.349> a<00:05:17.469> really

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
flabbergast me even that's a really

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.409 
flabbergast me even that's a really
strange<00:05:17.949> word<00:05:18.190> to<00:05:18.340> use<00:05:18.460> in<00:05:18.490> this<00:05:18.699> video<00:05:18.969> it

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
strange word to use in this video it

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.080 
strange word to use in this video it
flabbergast<00:05:20.139> Smee<00:05:20.500> that<00:05:21.130> atheists<00:05:22.060> can

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
flabbergast Smee that atheists can

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.600 
flabbergast Smee that atheists can
honestly<00:05:22.389> think<00:05:23.050> that<00:05:23.139> we<00:05:23.500> just<00:05:24.340> randomly

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
honestly think that we just randomly

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.540 
honestly think that we just randomly
popped<00:05:25.330> into<00:05:25.599> existence<00:05:25.719> and<00:05:26.500> just<00:05:27.340> you've

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
popped into existence and just you've

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.469 
popped into existence and just you've
started<00:05:27.819> evolving<00:05:28.710> in<00:05:30.060> there's<00:05:31.060> so<00:05:31.360> much

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
started evolving in there's so much

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.050 
started evolving in there's so much
evidence<00:05:31.960> for<00:05:32.110> intelligent<00:05:32.199> design<00:05:33.060> just

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
evidence for intelligent design just

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.309 
evidence for intelligent design just
look<00:05:34.780> at<00:05:34.990> the<00:05:35.229> cell<00:05:35.560> my<00:05:35.949> goodness<00:05:37.110> if<00:05:38.110> that's

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:38.319 
look at the cell my goodness if that's

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:40.589 
look at the cell my goodness if that's
not<00:05:38.409> evidence<00:05:38.710> for<00:05:39.159> some<00:05:39.699> sort<00:05:40.000> of<00:05:40.120> design

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
not evidence for some sort of design

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.469 
not evidence for some sort of design
other<00:05:41.500> than<00:05:41.770> evolution<00:05:42.460> I<00:05:42.669> don't<00:05:43.090> know<00:05:43.240> what

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
other than evolution I don't know what

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:47.279 
other than evolution I don't know what
is<00:05:44.250> but<00:05:45.250> going<00:05:45.520> off<00:05:45.669> of<00:05:45.699> that<00:05:45.969> topic<00:05:46.449> when

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
is but going off of that topic when

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.379 
is but going off of that topic when
people<00:05:47.710> use<00:05:47.919> the<00:05:48.130> philosophical<00:05:48.789> arguments

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
people use the philosophical arguments

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:52.019 
people use the philosophical arguments
such<00:05:49.690> as<00:05:49.960> the<00:05:50.409> pink<00:05:50.650> unicorn<00:05:51.130> Santa<00:05:51.490> Claus<00:05:51.699> I

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:52.029 
such as the pink unicorn Santa Claus I

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:55.680 
such as the pink unicorn Santa Claus I
think<00:05:52.870> these<00:05:53.050> are<00:05:53.110> ways<00:05:53.560> to<00:05:53.590> avoid<00:05:54.690> examining

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
think these are ways to avoid examining

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.059 
think these are ways to avoid examining
evidence<00:05:56.110> and<00:05:56.860> I<00:05:57.490> believe<00:05:57.789> this<00:05:58.000> approach<00:05:58.599> is

00:05:59.059 --> 00:05:59.069 
evidence and I believe this approach is

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:01.620 
evidence and I believe this approach is
ultimately<00:06:00.069> dishonest<00:06:00.789> to<00:06:00.909> the<00:06:01.000> individual

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
ultimately dishonest to the individual

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.050 
ultimately dishonest to the individual
believing<00:06:02.380> it<00:06:02.500> that's<00:06:03.460> the<00:06:03.669> end<00:06:03.789> of<00:06:03.849> the<00:06:03.940> video

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
believing it that's the end of the video

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.559 
believing it that's the end of the video
hope<00:06:04.569> it<00:06:04.719> makes<00:06:04.900> sense<00:06:05.169> i<00:06:06.029> ramble<00:06:07.029> a<00:06:07.120> lot<00:06:07.330> I

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:07.569 
hope it makes sense i ramble a lot I

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:10.260 
hope it makes sense i ramble a lot I
didn't<00:06:08.289> edit<00:06:08.409> much<00:06:08.710> so<00:06:09.159> I<00:06:09.430> hope<00:06:09.880> you<00:06:10.029> enjoyed

didn't edit much so I hope you enjoyed
