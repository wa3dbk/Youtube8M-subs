00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.580
 hi friends today I you 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.780
 were talking about a fatal mistake that 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.190
 commit most beginners 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.600
 when he starts the gym 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.039
 they have not been coached for example 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.200
 or who have fallen on a coach not very 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.940
 smart and the people who train 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.050
 at home alone so this type of 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.220
 people there in general it's a 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.170
 person who starts for reasons 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.610
 visuals for superficial reasons 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.530
 there is nothing derogatory when I say 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.420
 it all starts in general sport 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.160
 and that's a reality for reasons 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.630
 visual I had to lose 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.430
 well muscle me a little here I like 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.360
 a little in the mirror and if I like 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.920
 a little in the mirror but I'll tell you 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.660
 to please others is a reality we 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.010
 we are social creatures we are forge 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.359
 our identity through the eyes of 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.859
 other people who watch this 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.909
 video saying yeah anything me 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.199
 I do not care about other people 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.749
 that's not true what will be the 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.460
 dispute between each individual this is the 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.979
 level of importance that we are grants 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.629
 but the reality is that we are forge 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:53.949
 our identity through the eyes of 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.260
 others we are social creatures 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.639
 and we evolve through the eyes of 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.469
 others and the opinion of others so 

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:00.940
 it's not a shame to start the sport 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.339
 for reasons simply 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.870
 the superficial and visually most 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.250
 smokers also they stop from 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.750
 not smoke for health they stop 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.110
 to smoke because it starts to cost 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.700
 expensive 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.950
 the sport is the same we start for 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.480
 visual reasons and after we get 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.220
 focuses on health once one is 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.450
 in rhythm and in the habit on the 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.130
 health and physical performance 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.270
 but so the starting postulate is 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.130
 you started the sport for 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.080
 visual reasons and mistakes that I 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.550
 see a lot of people know and 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.650
 that I hope you will not know 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.840
 or that you do not do it's 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.980
 to segment your body what is it 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.790
 means to feed your body 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.650
 that is to say that you will 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.480
 focus on one or more groups 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.800
 muscular and nothing else it's very 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.540
 simple in the guys it stops there 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.620
 it's the mirror the bathroom is at 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.780
 to say that everything that comes into this 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.980
 framework there must be done but two 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.510
 faces that is to say that it stops at 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.250
 pec biceps to the abs it's over 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.110
 finished end of the discussion 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.040
 from time to time there is one that 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.210
 turn and I hold it I could well 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.770
 little back but usually they 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.240
 stop there that's what the legendary 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.920
 not enter the mirror does not exist 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.570
 so we do not do them and women are 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.220
 exactly the same thing but the reverse 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.130
 that is to say, compromised king we do not fall 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.570
 on the ground we turn or impute the 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.610
 best of them I have the breeches of horse 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.430
 how do i do it's all that's it 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.769
 finished women her glutes thighs 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.690
 and abdou but not all abs and no 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.450
 not just the bottom for the little bead 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.650
 and that's a dramatic mistake 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.540
 firstly because you create yourself 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.690
 psychologically useless complexes 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.000
 you focus 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.110
 on something that does not have a comment 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.450
 to say that it has no real value 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.710
 if you do not like it is not 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.070
 because of your buttocks or because of your 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.810
 pec 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.670
 it's because there is one set 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.080
 it's all like that and then it's okay 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.030
 create imbalances also 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.060
 physical as well at the level of the 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.470
 posture that at the deco level of the 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.120
 coordination for example a potting soil 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.960
 intramuscular muscle but 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.250
 also visual imbalances and 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.340
 this is the problem you started 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.330
 so that visually your body is 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.950
 more beautiful for you to enjoy 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.210
 more and you end up only by 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.310
 example and here I address the guys on 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.660
 the beach in summer you have a good body 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.270
 beaten and bone and two legs two 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.100
 hulls you are ridiculous people get 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.630
 make fun of you we do not care about you 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.030
 the beach a look this guy can be had 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.680
 legs that goes to whores to shame 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.460
 you guys have to wake up and the 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.930
 women is the same 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.640
 you're there focusing on the 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.710
 thighs the glutes and after what we have 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.750
 we have a domed vaulted shoulders that 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.280
 fall the triceps that I hang 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.570
 do you want to say yes in 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.130
 the street the dudes turns around he looks 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.300
 my butt yeah but when they talk to you 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.010
 they were not he's not talking in front of 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.420
 your buttocks he talks to you in the eyes and 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.010
 what's on your face in 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.110
 falling shoulders end to taste you 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.489
 you 're ridiculous you sweat the defeat I 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.500
 I'm sorry guys talking like that 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.870
 but it must be understood that this 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.250
 mistake it drive you your dad that 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.200
 you drive a lot more complex 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.370
 again you will go into 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.830
 a circle where you believe it's 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.930
 always that aspect that makes you 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.430
 you do not like yourself and what 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.020
 imbalance if it's been years that 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.390
 you hold it going to be so much 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.739
 so many differences between 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.269
 working muscles work and forgiveness 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.920
 and those who are not working that 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.400
 to make up for all that it'll be the 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.870
 galley 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.730
 I remember a few years ago 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.440
 I was working I was doing seasons and 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.610
 I work in a ski resort I 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.170
 was taking care of the room is a guy I 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.220
 see me and tell me oh fucking look at me 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.300
 trains me alone at home good I 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.340
 the impression that I'm not too 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.019
 Regular tell me what I need 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.350
 works TV but that he had only 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.790
 pecs of the biceps and abs completed he 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.190
 There was no leg there was not 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.900
 of sadness there was no back I 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.570
 I'm sorry, you guys are ridiculous 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.400
 ridiculous witness ch was ridiculous and 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.900
 it's going to take years to catch up and 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.580
 it's going to be difficult because for 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.530
 catch up with it you have to put in 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.790
 work the muscles that you have 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.960
 not used to work and whose 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.640
 you feel like it's useless 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.500
 and forsaken what you do 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.810
 the obsession and that's really going to be 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.080
 psychologically hard to put in place 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.909
 so 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.090
 it must be understood that a body that 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:37.409
 like a raven still joly it's a 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.599
 harmonious body 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.919
 it's not the size of the muscles of such 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.409
 or such muscles that makes a body is 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.909
 beautiful is the harmony the whole is 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:46.229
 as a musical work what you 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:48.360
 please it's not that the guy a moment he 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.830
 dropped 1 diet or a soft baby no 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.349
 what you like is the succession of 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.550
 notes in rhythm with cadence tempo 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.080
 hotels and the instrument that are going well 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.280
 together 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.259
 the voice of the singer 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.789
 which wedges at that moment and it is this 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:01.919
 harmony that you like in the song 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:05.280
 it's not the dork deceive flat or 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.940
 the mit we do not care about that it's 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.050
 detail 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.120
 when you look at someone you say 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.629
 not at the knees point of view that I 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.699
 will talk to him 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:14.129
 we do not mind working your 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.419
 body as a whole work from 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:16.800
 harmonious way that's why 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.849
 in trainings I propose to you 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.110
 every time trainings that do not 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.789
 not focus on just one part of 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.680
 body but that makes work the 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.150
 globality 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.680
 so please avoid any inconvenience 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.889
 do you avoid imbalances 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.090
 do you also avoid complex 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.620
 Psychological me to focus on 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.900
 useless stuff on your body 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.819
 work your body as a whole 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.740
 this is the advice of the day I hope that 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:39.210
 this video will have been useful to you and we 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.610
 find again soon for new 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.779
 useful or not advice on iron health 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.779
