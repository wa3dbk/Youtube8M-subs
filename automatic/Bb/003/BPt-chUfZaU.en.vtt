00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
together icing sugar and the flock so I

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.170 
together icing sugar and the flock so I
tried<00:03:56.739> that<00:03:56.769> and<00:03:57.100> then<00:03:57.310> mixing<00:03:57.580> in<00:03:57.700> some<00:03:57.730> PVA

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
tried that and then mixing in some PVA

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.840 
tried that and then mixing in some PVA
and<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:59.680> comes<00:04:00.040> out<00:04:00.220> very<00:04:00.280> thick<00:04:01.030> very<00:04:01.709> gloopy

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
and it comes out very thick very gloopy

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.120 
and it comes out very thick very gloopy
popped<00:04:03.850> onto<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.239> bases<00:04:04.720> and<00:04:05.019> it<00:04:05.830> was<00:04:05.950> pretty

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
popped onto the bases and it was pretty

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.020 
popped onto the bases and it was pretty
cool<00:04:06.400> you<00:04:06.700> know<00:04:06.760> it<00:04:06.910> gave<00:04:07.150> a<00:04:07.180> nice<00:04:07.360> big<00:04:09.030> lumpy

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
cool you know it gave a nice big lumpy

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.870 
cool you know it gave a nice big lumpy
base<00:04:10.590> but<00:04:11.590> it<00:04:11.680> didn't<00:04:11.860> look<00:04:11.920> very<00:04:12.100> like<00:04:12.489> snow

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
base but it didn't look very like snow

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.400 
base but it didn't look very like snow
so<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:13.209> gave<00:04:13.330> it<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.570> sprinkling<00:04:13.989> of<00:04:14.080> the<00:04:14.200> flock

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
so I gave it a sprinkling of the flock

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.830 
so I gave it a sprinkling of the flock
over<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.800> top<00:04:15.010> of<00:04:15.220> that<00:04:15.400> I've<00:04:16.209> got<00:04:16.359> some<00:04:16.630> flock

over the top of that I've got some flock

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.000 
over the top of that I've got some flock
on<00:04:16.989> that<00:04:17.109> guy's<00:04:17.290> leg

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010

source<00:04:55.190> the<00:04:55.370> bases<00:04:55.790> even<00:04:56.690> though<00:04:56.810> I<00:04:56.840> suck<00:04:57.200> at

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
source the bases even though I suck at

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.720 
source the bases even though I suck at
life<00:04:57.500> sourcing<00:04:58.070> just<00:04:58.310> to<00:04:58.370> put<00:04:58.490> a<00:04:58.520> little<00:04:58.610> bit

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
life sourcing just to put a little bit

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.180 
life sourcing just to put a little bit
of<00:04:58.790> green<00:04:59.030> from<00:04:59.330> the<00:04:59.390> rods<00:04:59.660> on<00:04:59.870> to<00:05:00.050> their<00:05:00.230> but

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
of green from the rods on to their but

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.230 
of green from the rods on to their but
then<00:05:01.310> that<00:05:01.340> would<00:05:01.520> also<00:05:01.640> mean<00:05:01.790> that<00:05:01.940> light

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
then that would also mean that light

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.090 
then that would also mean that light
sourcing<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:02.690> bases<00:05:03.110> have<00:05:03.530> to<00:05:03.680> light<00:05:03.860> source

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100

back<00:05:04.310> onto<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:04.700> models<00:05:05.000> and<00:05:05.180> I'm<00:05:05.240> not<00:05:05.360> so<00:05:05.480> keen

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
back onto the models and I'm not so keen

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.240 
back onto the models and I'm not so keen
on<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:06.050> idea<00:05:06.080> of<00:05:06.470> that<00:05:06.590> so<00:05:06.770> I<00:05:06.800> might<00:05:06.950> just<00:05:07.100> keep

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
on the idea of that so I might just keep

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.820 
on the idea of that so I might just keep
them<00:05:07.370> as<00:05:07.490> very<00:05:07.610> plain<00:05:07.970> white<00:05:08.270> basis<00:05:08.780> just<00:05:08.960> to

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
them as very plain white basis just to

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.120 
them as very plain white basis just to
highlight<00:05:10.100> the<00:05:10.880> dark<00:05:11.120> models<00:05:11.980> because<00:05:12.980> they

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
highlight the dark models because they

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.530 
highlight the dark models because they
are<00:05:13.280> just<00:05:13.610> pool<00:05:15.070> green<00:05:16.070> eyes<00:05:16.250> dart<00:05:17.180> model
