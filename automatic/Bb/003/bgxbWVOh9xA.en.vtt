themed Xbox 360 controller a little
quick<00:00:15.750> review<00:00:16.020> on<00:00:16.049> it

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
quick review on it

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.740 
quick review on it
first<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.550> all<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.760> think<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.029> joysticks<00:00:18.570> feel

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
first of all I think that joysticks feel

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.179 
first of all I think that joysticks feel
a<00:00:18.779> little<00:00:19.020> bit<00:00:19.140> higher<00:00:19.380> which<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.980> actually

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
a little bit higher which I actually

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.010 
a little bit higher which I actually
really<00:00:20.699> like<00:00:20.910> for<00:00:21.210> first-person<00:00:21.720> shooter

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
really like for first-person shooter

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.609 
really like for first-person shooter
stuff<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.500> far<00:00:22.730> yes<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.000> wired<00:00:24.300> but<00:00:24.900> that

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
stuff so far yes it is wired but that

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.380 
stuff so far yes it is wired but that
also<00:00:25.800> cuts<00:00:26.160> back<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.699> hold<00:00:26.880> mid<00:00:27.180> match

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
also cuts back on that hold mid match

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.480 
also cuts back on that hold mid match
like<00:00:28.260> last<00:00:28.560> second<00:00:28.980> than<00:00:29.099> your<00:00:29.189> controller

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
like last second than your controller

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.060 
like last second than your controller
dies<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:29.970> die<00:00:30.150> which<00:00:31.050> happens<00:00:31.800> more<00:00:31.949> than

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
dies and you die which happens more than

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.610 
dies and you die which happens more than
it<00:00:32.160> really<00:00:32.250> should<00:00:32.579> be<00:00:32.610> honest<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.750> nice<00:00:34.110> modern

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
it really should be honest a nice modern

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.479 
it really should be honest a nice modern

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.889 
warfare 2 logo on there I believe back I
think<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.850> has<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.149> infinite<00:00:39.390> yeah<00:00:39.690> right

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
think it has the infinite yeah right

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.799 
think it has the infinite yeah right
there<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.920> Infinity<00:00:41.640> Ward<00:00:41.850> logo<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.570> Mad

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
there the Infinity Ward logo on it Mad

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.950 
there the Infinity Ward logo on it Mad
Catz<00:00:43.610> what<00:00:44.610> looks<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:44.940> turbo<00:00:45.420> triggers<00:00:45.780> but

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
Catz what looks like turbo triggers but

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.840 
Catz what looks like turbo triggers but
they're<00:00:46.110> actually<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.920> extra<00:00:47.340> buttons<00:00:47.670> you

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
they're actually just extra buttons you

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.750 
they're actually just extra buttons you
can<00:00:48.000> assign<00:00:48.559> with<00:00:49.559> these<00:00:50.070> little<00:00:50.309> toggle

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
can assign with these little toggle

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.939 
can assign with these little toggle
switches<00:00:50.969> here<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.840> wear<00:00:52.140> what<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.649> want<00:00:52.860> them

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
switches here to wear what you want them

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.889 
switches here to wear what you want them
and<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.210> kind<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.449> assign<00:00:54.660> them<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.870> a

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
and you can kind of assign them to a

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.840 
and you can kind of assign them to a
couple<00:00:55.020> certain<00:00:55.410> things<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.710> are<00:00:56.039> set<00:00:56.820> up

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
couple certain things that are set up

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.760 
couple certain things that are set up
clearly<00:00:57.390> for<00:00:57.600> modern<00:00:57.780> warfare<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.649> make

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
clearly for modern warfare you can make

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.920 
clearly for modern warfare you can make
them<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.609> knife<00:00:59.879> buttons<00:01:00.329> cement<00:01:00.660> buttons

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
them like knife buttons cement buttons

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.569 
them like knife buttons cement buttons
and<00:01:01.140> they're<00:01:01.620> kind<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.859> cool<00:01:01.980> actually

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
and they're kind of cool actually

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.399 
and they're kind of cool actually
I<00:01:02.820> don't<00:01:03.210> even<00:01:03.300> know<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.510> much<00:01:03.840> but<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.199> just

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
I don't even know that much but it just

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.460 
I don't even know that much but it just
I<00:01:04.830> was<00:01:05.280> kind<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.610> neat<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.840> believe<00:01:07.350> it

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
I was kind of neat to have I believe it

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.960 
I was kind of neat to have I believe it
comes<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.710> an<00:01:07.799> Arctic<00:01:08.010> camel<00:01:08.400> also<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.729> got<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
comes in an Arctic camel also I got the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.490 
comes in an Arctic camel also I got the
urban<00:01:09.270> camo<00:01:09.600> got<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:10.020> Christmas<00:01:10.049> by<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
urban camo got this for Christmas by the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.780 
urban camo got this for Christmas by the
way<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:13.020> triggers<00:01:13.350> actually<00:01:13.770> feel<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.610> look

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
way the triggers actually feel and look

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.390 
way the triggers actually feel and look
more<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> gun<00:01:15.750> trigger<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.439> pretty

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
more like a gun trigger and it's pretty

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.740 
more like a gun trigger and it's pretty
cool<00:01:17.610> listen<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.060> lore<00:01:18.240> I'll<00:01:18.360> be<00:01:18.509> honest

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
cool listen to lore I'll be honest

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.690 
cool listen to lore I'll be honest
doesn't<00:01:19.140> work<00:01:19.259> very<00:01:19.530> good<00:01:19.860> at<00:01:19.950> all<00:01:20.189> for

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
doesn't work very good at all for

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.640 
doesn't work very good at all for
something<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.900> isn't<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.259> first-person

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
something that isn't the first-person

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.850 
something that isn't the first-person
shooter<00:01:23.189> mainly<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.080> joysticks<00:01:25.619> I

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
shooter mainly because the joysticks I

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.170 
shooter mainly because the joysticks I
don't<00:01:26.070> know<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.340> really<00:01:26.670> think<00:01:26.790> they<00:01:26.939> feel<00:01:27.119> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
don't know I really think they feel a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.310 
don't know I really think they feel a
little<00:01:27.360> higher<00:01:27.630> maybe<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> controller's

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
little higher maybe the controller's

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.410 
little higher maybe the controller's
wider<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.710> don't<00:01:28.920> know<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.070> really<00:01:29.400> looked<00:01:29.610> but

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
wider I don't know I really looked but

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.480 
wider I don't know I really looked but
if<00:01:31.229> you're<00:01:31.470> not<00:01:31.680> using<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.070> first-person

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
if you're not using a first-person

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.850 
if you're not using a first-person
shooter<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:33.150> feels<00:01:33.390> really<00:01:33.869> really<00:01:34.020> weird<00:01:34.560> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
shooter it feels really really weird and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.010 
shooter it feels really really weird and
just<00:01:34.979> loose<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.549> sloppy<00:01:35.729> for<00:01:36.630> first-person

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
just loose and sloppy for first-person

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.850 
just loose and sloppy for first-person
shooter<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.290> works<00:01:37.439> really<00:01:37.619> good

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
shooter it works really good

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.179 
shooter it works really good
d-pads<00:01:38.369> good<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:40.049> all<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.740> place<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.070> all
