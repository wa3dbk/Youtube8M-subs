 that is in switch is the number 24 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.579
 and why I like him so much is when 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.950
 you just can not describe 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.620
 this color is first of all indescribable 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.829
 nice h and secondly somehow that way 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.520
 perfect mix of sun brown orange 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.520

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.199

 adidas is the number 42 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:21.990
 that is something meliÃ¡ stich so that is 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.000

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.560
 it's not that darker anymore 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.990
 as big as it really is not anymore 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.939

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.750
 I think it's just perfect for that 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.800
 fall if red then definitely 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.770

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.800

 squeaky squeaky a bit brown 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:35.030
 So it goes in brown direction and then 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.340
 even a bit darker if so 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.110
 It's a bit like this 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.200

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.530

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.850
 also has number or so in any case 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.150
 the HSG is fully in Germany

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.820
 classic really and indeed it is a 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.950
 yes , some darker members that he 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:17.030
 such a high school student and I really like that 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.550
 like it is the number 44 and that is 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.200
 also super harris lucca schools participate 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.390
 seen my girlfriend at mary and 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.769
 greetings and bring and that has me then 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.769
 sometime supposedly to those 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.360
 but he was able to see him 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.400
 not having understood what I mean 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.110
 Sometimes you have that one 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:42.680
 At some point then you need that 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:46.190
 necessarily and this country that is 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:49.150
 so made by sts is an incredible 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.640
 dark purple that almost like that 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.500
 is painful 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.990
 but in the order it is not quite so 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.780
 dark as here in the bottle but me 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.520
 love so nack the damn dark are 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:04.200
 but not black so easy 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.860
 color is not quite as dark and on 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.020
 every case 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.500
 I like that and I like it too 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:16.220
 already said only 45 and I can 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:19.829
 think the great that is the craftsman 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.090
 Of course, the next color is of sc 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.830
 I've been lucky too 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.140
 This almost black is again one 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.100
 and this time is a very dark one 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.720
 brown this is lady gaga number 86 and 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.510
 I like to do that because he's easy 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.120
 is so dark it is there is brownish 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.320
 also somehow do a heart again because 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.720
 brown leaves and so when the 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.910
 year or year 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.550
 connection and I like him totally 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.550
 like I said I think that's great 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.820
 color is a real chocolate brown 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.250
 where I live full milk chocolate music 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.570
 is out of chocolate so provision 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.580
 You always have autumn 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.100
 so a chocolate nail polish and 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.250
 the last two are actually the jus 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.970
 or that is a juhu of t2 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.540
 and although I have here one of the sc 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.820
 color tuxedo fight hard 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.530
 75 that's a grayish blue and up 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.740
 I really like the hair 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.550
 nice that is so a year are hard too 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.380
 describe 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.810
 so a bit the then I went but 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.410
 still very cool not quite like that 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.880
 and then as a bub I have from chanel the 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:32.910
 color what is the vertigo that is the 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:35.810
 563 what the reason is that you have this 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.310
 then turn to do not have to turn 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.669
 which is different in the case is so one 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.260
 not so cool that 's one 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:47.120
 a bit warmer is a bit 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:49.470
 friendly so liane and only one 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.180
 Particles in it and I already have 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.380
 very surprised because the on the nails 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.850
 not quite like that 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.440
 light is then you see that so 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.150
 a bit sparkle but that is still 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.740
 I will not be so noticeable then 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.950
 Buy this here is actually like that 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.660
 well, or almost the same color 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.400
 not that thomas change their life 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.470
 you can compare that very much 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.930
 a bit darker but still im 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.970
 Order video bit ticker order 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.640
 then that would be about the same 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.860
 give up color and take it along for me 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.810
 so fascinated is that this firstly the 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.790
 It can be really cool colors 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.130
 of which and always the upright 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.930
 which looks like a moist does not look 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:28.020
 it is dry from it looks easy and 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:32.010
 but so freshly applied la carte I 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.180
 you are definitely what I mean but me 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.220
 can not explain it 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.190
 Definitely the two acres as 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.440
 Number nine and ten of my top 10 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.270
 favorit so and were already 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.250
 everyone I wanted to show you the 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.560
 In the fall, you really like to paint 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:49.460
 you always wear the absolute favorites 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.690
 yes that was definitely mine 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.090
 and I would say to us in the next 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.640
 video i think i am to this 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.990
 time in new york or now 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.720
 I do not know exactly everyone 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.970
 probably still on the way 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:08.150
 otherwise I have a nice day 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:08.150
 and I tell them about us nix video 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:19.080
 You should like to look at us and us 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:22.830
 so twitter and take over the 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:27.259
 instagram is misspelled and written in 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.259
 the infobox or could 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.780
 bye
