00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.450
 hi everyone if i josÃ© 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.600
 and young people divided on how to make magic with cards 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.630
 we'll see 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.749
 the mixture and not 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:12.949
 the mixture and does not consist of holding the mallet 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.109
 with these comics on this side 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.109
 and with the thumb 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:23.489
 now the left hand is going to come pick up piles of letters from above 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.819
 and let them fall 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:29.819
 in your partner 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.490
 that is the center goal 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.760
 this goal is very useful to control a card below the deck 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.380
 smoked bring a letter still viewer 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.340
 if we want to keep for example this letter the following euros 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.900
 embeleco that the tastings up here of the deck 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.720
 let's also drag the one below 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.870
 removing 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.630
 the excessive and 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.230
 we remove the middle one 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.770
 and those below 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.740
 I know there is 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.740
 we did mixing 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.590
 if we want to port a letter 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.570
 percent and we should see the letter below because that would be our 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.450
 letter that we are going to bet 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.020
 if in this case it is the diamond ball 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.490
 we know that he is going to jj diamonds before 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.440
 Start the game 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.470
 and we say spectator that we are going to mix and whoever stops us when he wants 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.980
 three claims like this 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.700
 hacienda mecca hindu and when you pay us 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.660
 we turn this amount around 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.550
 and here is the last letter we already knew 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.900
 and he thinks that where we have stopped 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.900
 it is just the letter that the host 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.380
 and so then you can continue the game by adding your letter or doing any 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.520
 another thing 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.180
 that city of chengdu so a way to control the letter to export 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.570
 a letter 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.729
 I hope it's liked in that sense 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.829
 and nothing more 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.729
 comment your uncles 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:14.349
