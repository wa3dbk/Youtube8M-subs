 Hi, my name is Darek Kraśnicki 

00:00:03.244 --> 00:00:08.481
 here I will tell you about the problem of an Internet user who has already had a C driving license for some time. 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.852
 He suddenly stopped to see one eye. 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.110
 "Mr. Dariusz, I'm writing to you because I saw you on YouTube 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.401
 and go straight to the question. 

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:22.125
 I have not seen the right eye for 2 years. 

00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:25.116
 I made C right when I saw you well. 

00:00:25.895 --> 00:00:31.421
 Carriage of things, although after illness, but I managed to pass the psychotest somehow without any sort of dealing. 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.851
 However, when it comes to my eye I have a falcon without any problems, I can see without problems. 

00:00:39.112 --> 00:00:46.398
 However, I can see the right side, up and down, while when I look straight ahead there is a dark spot, 

00:00:46.398 --> 00:00:48.626
 zero view - just around. 

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:55.238
 My question is: can I be a professional driver, unfortunately I must finally go to occupational medicine, 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.479
 there certainly will not be an ophthalmologist. 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.961
 I go by car every day, I do not have problems, 

00:01:02.961 --> 00:01:09.119
 I was driving a C-2 car for two months, it was like saying it to a normal healthy person, 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.792
 unfortunately it was driving without a contract in black, so I did not have to visit doctors. 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:23.803
 I am asking you for advice, because I have no idea what to do in advance, I greet. " 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:30.262
 Good question - although the answer is not satisfactory here. 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.559
 And unfortunately, according to the regulations, according to the current regulations and previous ones - after the examination of the occupational medicine doctor 

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:46.000
 the same doctor is required to issue a negative judgment, and at the same time still report the fact to the communication department. 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.680
 Poviat starosty then directs for research to WOMP. 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.170
 And, rather, driving license category C is lost. 

00:01:53.889 --> 00:02:01.790
 Individuals, according to Polish regulations, can not drive trucks, buses or privileged vehicles 

00:02:01.792 --> 00:02:02.680
 category B. 

00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:10.110
 Also news not very satisfactory for the Internet user. 

00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:12.560
 On this end I am finishing, said Darek Kraśnicki from Wrocław. 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.980
 Obviously, of course, comment on the video below. 

00:02:16.674 --> 00:02:21.080
 www.Badania-Na-Prawo-Jady-Wroclaw.com. 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.600
 Subscribe to the newsletter there, you will find various other similar predicative situations. 

00:02:27.736 --> 00:02:29.720
 Related to the driver's eyesight. 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.440
 Especially the lack of stereoscopic, binocular vision, squint, myopia, 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.680
 farsightedness. 

00:02:38.768 --> 00:02:41.530
 Once again, you say goodbye to Darek Kraśnicki from Wrocław.
