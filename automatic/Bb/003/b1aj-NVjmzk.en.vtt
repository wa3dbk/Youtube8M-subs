00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.070
 Speaks personal beauty here who speaks Bruno 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.279
 today we are here for another video of 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.779
 gta5 and once again an easter video 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.570
 Egg you guys really liked the first one. 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.880
 video easter egg that went from bayern that 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.380
 I found Bayern by accident now it's a 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.420
 another easter egg video here 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.460
 you probably already have seen 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.099
 He is better known as a woman. 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.370
 ghost is the dead woman that we 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.710
 found here on gta5 is not 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.899
 exactly inside the city that one 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.640
 appearance we have here is 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.200
 A little bit out, I'll show you 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.239
 on the map for you in more detail 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.760
 ahead of the video I 'm sending 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.829
 above as you should realize is 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.719
 You have to wait until 11:00 a.m. 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.210
 night that is when a ghost appears 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.300
 it stays from 11 to midnight on the map 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.280
 so it's practically very rare you 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.879
 see this is one hour only you have 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.229
 To find a ghost, it 's because he's after 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.790
 it will disappear you are seeing that the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.860
 image is a little dark because I 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.229
 I stayed a long time without touching the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.560
 xbox control it enters a state 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.060
 energy saving so that's why 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.500
 stayed a little black screen 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.780
 You will see that here I will leave the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.460
 video a little slower I accelerated myself 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.310
 I accelerated a lot in the first half because 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.710
 here we are close to the appearance of the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.200
 It is at this point that I 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.729
 he will appear there in front in this 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.950
 I 'm showing my cell phone there 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.409
 what are you guys going to see? 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.829
 exactly 11 hours it will appear there 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.299
 those there the front stones 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.070
 practically ten minutes is 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.049
 practically one second is a minute in the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.450
 gta are seeing that I also changed one 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.710
 Bit of a cell phone, I thought it was a lot of weight. 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.549
 that every house has a cell phone 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.680
 different is not only the colors but the fact 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.810
 the cell phone is different from the 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.360
 clover is very old is that of 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.850
 I was almost numeric keyboard 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.380
 It's all written wrong there but 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.729
 he is very old so he does not have 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.170
 more choice of nothing 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.060
 after this increase that already appeared there in the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.759
 in front of a business 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.009
 a woman in white appears a 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.590
 patient of something she stays 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.780
 floating and has a message written in 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.099
 blood underneath it also lists what 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.310
 I'm shooting to see if it can 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.310
 knock but nothing happens she and she 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.980
 is simply floating and conforming to 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.599
 you come close she's going to disappear 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.580
 I see you have a distance that 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.870
 she stays after she disappears if you 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.180
 get very close 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.780
 so I've been testing this and not really 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.370
 does not work bullets in her and I'll show 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.709
 A little later on, who is this? 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.989
 person she is not as far as I know 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.760
 appears in the main story of gt a 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.739
 This guy can come and talk, I do not know what 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.780
 is giving spoiler I do not know that in 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.880
 true not because it 's as far as I know it 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.090
 does not appear in the history of gta is a 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.410
 parallel story 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.019
 as you get to that already took O 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.170
 only with the miracle she appears a business 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.660
 very sinister I walk I do not see anymore 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.730
 as the sniper puts there, me 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.739
 I can see the ghost 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:14.579
 you will see that there is an image there 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:17.370
 written jockey goldres3 and here it is a guy 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.810
 is a gta character 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.140
 as far as I know it does not seem like history 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.459
 main as I said then it is not 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.400
 spoiler is nothing 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.620
 O then she stands there are seeing that the will 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.140
 midnight and she's going to disappear I'm going to 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.109
 pushing off a little more is to achieve 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.450
 see her so skype is good start her 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.220
 it simply appears that time goes 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.970
 midnight and you'll see she's going 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.500
 disappear from there 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.450
 here I am going to give a fast forward is 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.400
 because there is no more ten minutes there 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.810
 takes a little advancing well 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.760
 will see that she disappeared to the 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.209
 midnight is gone and you're back there, there's no 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.920
 message no more on the rocks to 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.410
 Do you know who this person is? 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.510
 You will enter this site you can 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.910
 access by the cell phone you enter 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.730
 on the internet to your mobile phone 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.799
 in the game the obvious right then you will come and 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.680
 go look for this site that would be 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.600
 who killed the Leonora English johnson 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.069
 translation would be in Portuguese 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.349
 will see that the page itself is in 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.330
 but there are some excerpts from 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.560
 pages ahead of you 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.840
 goes into detail 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.090
 already in English and is counting on a 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.010
 in 1985 is telling the story of the 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.810
 leonora johnson who was she was a 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.520
 bollywood actress right which is kind 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.980
 stop hollywood here 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.690
 I will not read anything that is here 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.820
 for you if you really want 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.310
 Be curious, you're looking for this. 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.590
 in the game but it's basically that's it 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.130
 talking about her who died and she is the 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.660
 ghost that appears on the stones 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.940
 the guys like I told you to 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.830
 from the map that she looks like this 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.600
 The point I have down here would be 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.690
 saints in this part of the year so much more 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.240
 yellow is the city of the saints and here 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.400
 Above right on this well in this curve is a 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.880
 doctor appearing the ghost 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.950
 exactly at that point then you have 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.130
 that climb this trail cnec a trail of 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:11.040
 I climbed up to the road that is 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.350
 part of the map and this part 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.450
 what is make gray is a half gray trail 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.120
 it's a trail you have to climb on foot 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.389
 or with some car car until you can 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.520
 so motorcycle something off-road nec is 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.169
 easier to climb or even 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.640
 only takes up a little more but 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.260
 You have to climb this stretch if you 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.150
 try to climb on other sides there you 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.400
 It will break if I have already tried many 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.140
 times and I screwed up several times then 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.780
 You have to climb this trail and 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:39.210
 this is the point where the ghost appears 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.640
 Right then this was our video 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.900
 I hope you liked leaving 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.610
 their favorite homes to help 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.169
 education that we will soon bring 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.150
 More easter eggs to you 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.150
 this is it, and see you later
