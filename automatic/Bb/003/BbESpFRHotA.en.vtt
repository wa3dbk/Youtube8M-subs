00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello people welcome back to my 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.099
 channel yes today I would like to you 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.440
 my standard outdoor companion 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.750
 imagine it is here 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.900
 around a knife out of the 111 millimeters 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.449
 series around the victorinox out rider 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:24.210
 the car has a big blade that 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.650
 it needs to be locked tight and then too 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.240
 through this mechanism here 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.789
 is secured accordingly 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.980
 that means you have so if we have 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.690
 daily not unfortunately lok or 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.180
 similar but I take it 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.860
 off the little voice caution her 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.510
 so unfortunately you have no lok or 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.050
 Something like that can be seen quite well now 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.829
 but you have on the side here 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.420
 a small slider in the 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.160
 unfolded state I have to lock 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.780
 So push them down here and 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.320
 can then match the blade again 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.510
 shut down 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.160
 this is now in contrast to each 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.660
 another fair of victorinox's 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.940
 Germany would be better if the times on 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.730
 fold then you see here already then 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.500
 Does it work the little one of the little unfortunately 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.610
 login the blade and prevent that 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.590
 close this blade 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.000
 So I have to push this aside 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.630
 and then can the blade again 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.659
 shut down 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.540
 Personally, I do not think that's bad 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.250
 but the variant here with the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.759
 Sliders I honestly agree 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.060
 his 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.700
 elegant and also chic solved 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.970
 So the car but as I said once the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.240
 correspondingly big things yes to the second 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.799
 Of course , this fair has a very big one 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.250
 Sail is not allowed in the car area 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.439
 absence 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.970
 You lie down next to the saw of 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.450
 the Bundeswehr knife makes me too 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.920
 it's almost the same saw 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.060
 So you see that has the same 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.560
 pay 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.130
 there you see she has the same 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.439
 pay very spicy so really you 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.479
 is also a little bit ago gx the 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.759
 means both when pulling and when 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.290
 I saw the tip is pressed 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.119
 a little bit different worked out 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.770
 so it looks like that at the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.630
 Bundeswehr fair a little bit 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.450
 what was removed from the top though 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.159
 by and large, it is here 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.500
 same saw the you in this post 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.320
 dresses expected 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.750
 So great winners that does not lock 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.730
 by the way so the blade is that 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.630
 only tool here in this car 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.420
 but locked 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.390
 so this is not the saw here 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.280
 the big sword gives big victories 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.630
 then and that was one of the main reasons 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.209
 I choose this car for myself 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.880
 here is the once decided 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.200
 great super victorinox heavy with it 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.290
 which really absolutely failed 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.390
 works and then under this 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.490
 Hiding scissors is very special 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.760
 solved here the toll rider you see 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.130
 a small hook a small nose the 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.230
 Get it with the finger notch up 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.840
 can and then comes to light here 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.820
 a cross screwdriver that is now 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.440
 in the relationship when we have the course 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.660
 Screwdrivers from the Bundeswehr Fair 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.430
 keep it off 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.230
 significantly smaller you see that too 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.700
 significantly smaller than the cross 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.830
 screwdriver now here for 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.680
 example at the back of the Bundeswehr knife 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.010
 there is the gentleman practice 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.630
 Just let me show if that's it now 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.280
 here from the size the better choice 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.530
 is as this big screw turn of 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.540
 the Bundeswehr better I have to say 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.220
 have been here a few times really 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.870
 too big a german army trade fair for 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.580
 screw that I wanted to turn 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.450
 There the experience is easy to show 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.500
 if this is the better option 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.360
 important to know is that this 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.250
 screwdriver not unfolded here 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.269
 can be without the scissors before 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.040
 is taken out 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.840
 here is the scissors 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.370
 so about the location of these 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.239
 screwdriver and can not get out there 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.060
 ok so big blade 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.350
 saw scissors screwdriver cross and 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.850
 then we have the standard here 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.610
 tools with edge cups rather big 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.739
 screwdriver also not locked 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.410
 and then on the other side 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.360
 the can opener with the small step 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.579
 screwdriver how to do that from 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.739
 victorinox child standard tools otherwise 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.630
 with toothpicks and tweezers and 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.620
 then here on the back the 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.299
 corkscrew 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.040
 usually i am not a friend of 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.840
 The corkscrew always exchanges it completely 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.709
 like a cross screwdriver 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.200
 on the back side 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.459
 because this tool continues the car here 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.680
 of course a cross screwdriver 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.180
 I've got the cork on the front 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.520
 She makes it all right in the back 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.280
 then also sense 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:22.390
 and then we have the 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:26.140
 appropriate sewing and boral that is so 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.760
 my outdoor companion as I said next 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.830
 read this book here 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.050
 I personally decide in 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.270
 Lately more and more often for the out 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.880
 rider alone for the reason that 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.620
 Here is a 42 a compliant variant 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.380
 So did I have to do no thoughtless 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.480
 If I have this knife in its shape 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.520
 he could be taken away with something 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.280
 always 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.390
 otherwise I like this lok lock 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.020
 which one sees here now with this 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.490
 rope 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.620
 that's ok but me personally 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.840
 find that here at this car 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.570
 rider with this regulator clearly 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.840
 elegant solved it than this 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.400
 Bundeswehr knife ok so that's mine 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.200
 small outdoor companion where no 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.700
 is relative so I think so too 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.490
 so big that you usually have it 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.380
 I do not carry in my pocket 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.210
 do not do that either 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.810
 in the jacket pocket with in or work 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.700
 Wear is like in a backpack with there it is 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.520
 of course, that's fine 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.050
 So lay my faithful companion 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.570
 sometimes a bit next to each other here 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.950
 So once the trader here that 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:31.260
 Bundeswehr better and here also from the 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:35.470
 111 millimeter series the atrix why 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.690
 victorinox rescue tool okay thank you 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.400

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.250

 See you
