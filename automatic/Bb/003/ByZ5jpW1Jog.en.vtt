much-anticipated sequel to whack whack
revolution<00:00:08.580> one<00:00:08.870> revenge<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.139> mold<00:00:11.179> so

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
revolution one revenge of the mold so

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
revolution one revenge of the mold so
the<00:00:12.840> object<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.290> this<00:00:13.469> game<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.780> hit<00:00:15.780> blocks

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
the object of this game is to hit blocks

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.630 
the object of this game is to hit blocks
and<00:00:16.619> then<00:00:16.980> get<00:00:17.730> points<00:00:18.240> if<00:00:18.859> you<00:00:19.859> hit<00:00:20.340> something

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
and then get points if you hit something

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.759 
and then get points if you hit something
without<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.210> block<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:22.050> don't<00:00:22.289> get<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.529> point<00:00:23.300> so

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
without a block you don't get a point so

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.740 
without a block you don't get a point so
let's<00:00:25.769> try<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.099> lovely<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.720> be

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
let's try and lovely this can be

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.660 
let's try and lovely this can be
set<00:00:28.140> much<00:00:28.410> faster<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.340> becomes

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
set much faster it just becomes

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.220 
set much faster it just becomes
impossible<00:00:30.150> hard<00:00:32.120> because<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.750> run

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
impossible hard because you run

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.610 
impossible hard because you run
incredibly<00:00:34.710> slow<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.160> Minecraft<00:00:35.579> obviously

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
incredibly slow in Minecraft obviously

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.750 
incredibly slow in Minecraft obviously
you<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:37.860> as<00:00:37.980> many<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.309> these<00:00:38.430> as<00:00:38.489> you

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
you can have as many of these as you

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.819 
you can have as many of these as you
want<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.120> could<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.420> hundred<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:40.710> all<00:00:40.770> I

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
want you could have a hundred for all I

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.840 
want you could have a hundred for all I
can<00:00:42.320> this<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.530> basically<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.070> assigned<00:00:44.640> to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
can this is basically just assigned to

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.110 
can this is basically just assigned to
work<00:00:45.030> around<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.570> wiring<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.730> it's<00:00:47.730> as<00:00:47.940> simple

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
work around the wiring so it's as simple

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.450 
work around the wiring so it's as simple
as

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
as

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.299 
as
and<00:00:49.969> then<00:00:50.059> it<00:00:50.210> just<00:00:50.239> turns<00:00:50.600> around<00:00:51.309> because

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
and then it just turns around because

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.509 
and then it just turns around because
i'm<00:00:52.430> lazy<00:00:52.640> that<00:00:52.969> way<00:00:53.559> so<00:00:55.930> this<00:00:56.930> is<00:00:57.140> all<00:00:57.860> the

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
i'm lazy that way so this is all the

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.740 
i'm lazy that way so this is all the
wiring<00:00:59.059> it's<00:00:59.629> pretty<00:00:59.989> compact<00:01:00.440> i<00:01:00.800> suppose<00:01:01.100> i

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
wiring it's pretty compact i suppose i

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.660 
wiring it's pretty compact i suppose i
currently<00:01:02.750> have<00:01:02.960> a<00:01:03.019> wire<00:01:03.590> that<00:01:03.949> is<00:01:04.009> hooked<00:01:04.460> up

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
currently have a wire that is hooked up

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.420 
currently have a wire that is hooked up
to<00:01:05.740> use<00:01:06.740> a<00:01:06.770> function<00:01:07.810> so<00:01:08.810> if<00:01:09.110> you<00:01:09.409> tap<00:01:09.950> this<00:01:10.190> and

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
to use a function so if you tap this and

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.790 
to use a function so if you tap this and
there's<00:01:10.580> no<00:01:10.759> block<00:01:11.000> there<00:01:11.300> I<00:01:11.540> have<00:01:12.350> this<00:01:12.530> wire

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
there's no block there I have this wire

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.639 
there's no block there I have this wire
here<00:01:13.300> which<00:01:14.300> will<00:01:14.450> set<00:01:14.659> an<00:01:14.750> output<00:01:15.110> and<00:01:15.409> I

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
here which will set an output and I

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.530 
here which will set an output and I
could<00:01:15.830> make<00:01:15.979> that<00:01:16.159> subtract<00:01:16.700> your<00:01:16.850> points<00:01:17.360> I'm

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
could make that subtract your points I'm

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.990 
could make that subtract your points I'm
just<00:01:17.780> I<00:01:18.110> can't<00:01:18.530> be<00:01:18.619> bothered<00:01:18.790> because<00:01:19.790> I'd

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
just I can't be bothered because I'd

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.790 
just I can't be bothered because I'd
have<00:01:20.149> to<00:01:20.330> hook<00:01:20.479> up<00:01:20.600> all<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:21.170> pistons<00:01:21.560> on<00:01:21.710> the

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
have to hook up all the pistons on the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.219 
have to hook up all the pistons on the
other<00:01:21.950> side<00:01:22.220> of<00:01:22.250> this<00:01:22.460> thing<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:23.179> I<00:01:23.720> don't

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
other side of this thing and I don't

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.139 
other side of this thing and I don't
have<00:01:24.470> time<00:01:24.649> for<00:01:24.860> that<00:01:24.950> today<00:01:25.509> so<00:01:26.509> um<00:01:27.970> what<00:01:28.970> does

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
have time for that today so um what does

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.529 
have time for that today so um what does
this<00:01:29.330> do<00:01:29.600> well<00:01:30.170> we<00:01:30.800> start<00:01:31.160> off<00:01:31.280> at<00:01:31.520> a<00:01:31.759> clock<00:01:32.090> the

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
this do well we start off at a clock the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.029 
this do well we start off at a clock the
clock<00:01:32.570> goes<00:01:33.050> into<00:01:33.380> a<00:01:34.539> pulse<00:01:35.539> limiter<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.200> that

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
clock goes into a pulse limiter and that

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.550 
clock goes into a pulse limiter and that
turns<00:01:37.429> around<00:01:37.700> a<00:01:38.000> bit<00:01:38.240> of<00:01:38.270> memory<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:38.990> this

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
turns around a bit of memory and this

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.020 
turns around a bit of memory and this
can<00:01:39.740> be<00:01:39.860> as<00:01:39.950> big<00:01:40.130> as<00:01:40.220> you<00:01:40.340> want<00:01:40.610> to<00:01:40.789> you<00:01:40.909> can

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
can be as big as you want to you can

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.580 
can be as big as you want to you can
never<00:01:41.149> wave<00:01:41.479> you<00:01:41.750> can<00:01:41.899> have<00:01:42.050> you<00:01:42.200> know<00:01:42.229> six

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
never wave you can have you know six

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.460 
never wave you can have you know six
terabytes<00:01:43.250> of<00:01:43.399> memory<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:44.170> when<00:01:45.170> you<00:01:45.259> can

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
terabytes of memory and when you can

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.419 
terabytes of memory and when you can
attempt<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:46.479> theoretically<00:01:47.479> and<00:01:48.190> that<00:01:49.190> then

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
attempt it theoretically and that then

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.359 
attempt it theoretically and that then
goes<00:01:49.610> through<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.960> a<00:01:50.990> tiny<00:01:51.590> little<00:01:51.860> decoder

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
goes through to a tiny little decoder

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.240 
goes through to a tiny little decoder
here<00:01:53.350> which<00:01:54.490> is<00:01:55.490> set<00:01:55.759> to<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:56.240> different

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
here which is set to the different

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.580 
here which is set to the different
states<00:01:58.250> so<00:01:58.909> you<00:01:59.540> could<00:01:59.659> have<00:01:59.810> more<00:02:00.079> and<00:02:00.409> then

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
states so you could have more and then

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.130 
states so you could have more and then
if<00:02:01.520> you<00:02:01.670> wanted<00:02:01.970> to<00:02:02.030> have<00:02:02.149> it<00:02:02.180> so<00:02:02.450> too<00:02:02.509> can<00:02:02.899> open

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
if you wanted to have it so too can open

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.080 
if you wanted to have it so too can open
it<00:02:03.229> at<00:02:03.320> same<00:02:03.470> time<00:02:03.590> with<00:02:03.770> three<00:02:03.920> you<00:02:04.729> can<00:02:04.909> do<00:02:05.030> it

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
it at same time with three you can do it

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.569 
it at same time with three you can do it
two<00:02:05.240> ways<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:05.509> can<00:02:05.719> either<00:02:06.310> make<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.340> bigger

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
two ways you can either make a bigger

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.160 
two ways you can either make a bigger
decoder<00:02:07.969> and<00:02:08.269> set<00:02:08.479> those<00:02:08.630> at<00:02:08.810> different

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
decoder and set those at different

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.000 
decoder and set those at different
states<00:02:09.470> or<00:02:09.799> you<00:02:10.250> could<00:02:10.959> and<00:02:11.959> what's<00:02:12.739> probably

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
states or you could and what's probably

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.400 
states or you could and what's probably
better<00:02:13.370> for<00:02:13.459> you<00:02:13.790> know<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.390> game<00:02:14.600> would<00:02:15.140> be<00:02:15.170> to

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
better for you know the game would be to

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.819 
better for you know the game would be to
have<00:02:15.560> multiple<00:02:15.920> clocks<00:02:16.489> and<00:02:16.850> multiple<00:02:17.360> memory

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
have multiple clocks and multiple memory

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:22.449 
have multiple clocks and multiple memory
that<00:02:18.829> way<00:02:19.070> em<00:02:20.290> they<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.680> will<00:02:21.860> be<00:02:21.980> very<00:02:22.130> hard<00:02:22.340> to

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
that way em they it will be very hard to

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.310 
that way em they it will be very hard to
predict<00:02:22.820> where<00:02:23.060> they're<00:02:23.209> going<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.720> still<00:02:23.959> be

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
predict where they're going you still be

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.580 
predict where they're going you still be
different<00:02:24.620> on<00:02:24.890> different<00:02:25.250> clocks<00:02:26.410> anyway<00:02:27.410> um

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
different on different clocks anyway um

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.259 
different on different clocks anyway um
so<00:02:29.410> when<00:02:30.410> one<00:02:30.560> is<00:02:30.680> active<00:02:31.070> this<00:02:31.310> line<00:02:31.850> here<00:02:32.150> is

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
so when one is active this line here is

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.039 
so when one is active this line here is
unpowered<00:02:33.400> which<00:02:34.400> leaves<00:02:35.120> room<00:02:35.420> for<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:36.019> to

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
unpowered which leaves room for you to

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.800 
unpowered which leaves room for you to
press<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.829> pressure<00:02:37.130> pad<00:02:37.459> up<00:02:37.640> here<00:02:38.000> which

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
press the pressure pad up here which

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.569 
press the pressure pad up here which
will<00:02:38.959> go<00:02:39.140> through<00:02:39.380> here<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:39.859> only<00:02:39.980> if<00:02:40.250> this<00:02:40.430> is

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
will go through here so only if this is

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.640 
will go through here so only if this is
unpowered<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.450> your<00:02:42.140> pressure<00:02:42.350> pressure

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
unpowered and your pressure pressure

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.849 
unpowered and your pressure pressure
plate<00:02:43.160> will<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.730> signal<00:02:44.660> goes<00:02:44.870> through<00:02:45.109> here

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
plate will a signal goes through here

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.340 
plate will a signal goes through here
which<00:02:46.130> will<00:02:46.340> add<00:02:46.579> one

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
which will add one

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.500 
which will add one
your<00:02:47.500> score<00:02:47.890> which<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.370> just<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:48.790> little<00:02:49.090> memory

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
your score which is just a little memory

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.270 
your score which is just a little memory
thing<00:02:50.020> right<00:02:50.320> here<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:52.890> yeah<00:02:53.890> I've<00:02:54.040> showed

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
thing right here and yeah I've showed

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.390 
thing right here and yeah I've showed
you<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:55.540> address<00:02:56.350> subtractors<00:02:56.920> thing<00:02:57.130> that's

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
you the address subtractors thing that's

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.580 
you the address subtractors thing that's
the<00:02:57.520> same<00:02:57.700> as<00:02:57.760> this<00:02:58.090> so<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:59.140> would<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.380> be<00:02:59.470> too

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
the same as this so it would it be too

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.650 
the same as this so it would it be too
hard<00:02:59.770> to<00:02:59.830> make<00:03:00.010> a<00:03:00.040> subtract<00:03:00.520> it's<00:03:00.850> just<00:03:01.090> since

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
hard to make a subtract it's just since

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.890 
hard to make a subtract it's just since
I<00:03:01.780> made<00:03:01.960> it<00:03:02.080> so<00:03:02.500> small<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:04.750> would

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
I made it so small and it would

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.550 
I made it so small and it would
be<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:05.020> bit<00:03:05.200> hard<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:10.120> was<00:03:10.240> again<00:03:10.510> if<00:03:11.170> you

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
be a bit hard so that was again if you

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.740 
be a bit hard so that was again if you
want<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:13.060> see<00:03:13.240> more<00:03:13.810> stupid<00:03:14.260> games<00:03:15.630> give<00:03:16.630> me<00:03:16.720> a

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
want to see more stupid games give me a

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.750 
want to see more stupid games give me a
shout<00:03:17.020> and<00:03:18.010> i'll<00:03:18.970> see<00:03:19.330> you<00:03:19.390> next<00:03:19.450> time
