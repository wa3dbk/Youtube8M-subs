to set up the routine mobile or anything

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.040 
to set up the routine mobile or anything
it's<00:00:28.470> just<00:00:29.300> pretty<00:00:30.300> much<00:00:30.480> new<00:00:30.720> out<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.990> box

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050

it's just pretty much new out of the box
with<00:00:31.859> some<00:00:32.040> applications<00:00:32.700> installed<00:00:34.010> go

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
with some applications installed go

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.600 
with some applications installed go
ahead<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.309> run<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.489> quadrant<00:00:36.239> test<00:00:37.309> that's<00:00:38.309> a

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
ahead and run a quadrant test that's a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.810 
ahead and run a quadrant test that's a
that<00:00:39.570> there<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.140> not<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.440> scratch<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
that there is not a scratch in the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.430

screen I put a screen protector on it
and<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.980> was<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.129> really<00:00:44.340> cheap<00:00:44.670> one<00:00:44.940> that

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
and it was a really cheap one that

scratched my put my finger nail through
it<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:50.180> try<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.210> ignore<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.719> but<00:00:52.079> uh<00:00:53.390> run<00:00:54.390> a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
it so try to ignore that but uh run a

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:09.120 
it so try to ignore that but uh run a
full<00:00:55.079> benchmark<00:00:55.800> test<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:58.609> let<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.640> run

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.810 

that<00:01:09.700> as<00:01:09.880> forwards<00:01:10.360> a<00:01:10.450> feel<00:01:10.780> of<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:10.960> phone

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
that as forwards a feel of the phone

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.760 
that as forwards a feel of the phone
feels<00:01:13.079> sort<00:01:14.079> of<00:01:14.170> light<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:14.950> somewhat<00:01:15.579> cheap

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
feels sort of light and somewhat cheap

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.480 
feels sort of light and somewhat cheap
the<00:01:17.770> camera<00:01:18.220> on<00:01:18.369> it<00:01:18.520> though<00:01:18.700> is<00:01:18.970> pretty<00:01:19.479> good

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
the camera on it though is pretty good

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.609 
the camera on it though is pretty good
it's<00:01:21.490> not<00:01:21.670> too<00:01:21.970> bad<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:22.539> it<00:01:22.899> has<00:01:23.020> a<00:01:23.049> panorama

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
it's not too bad and it has a panorama

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:38.690 
it's not too bad and it has a panorama
function<00:01:24.159> which<00:01:24.340> is<00:01:24.450> sorta<00:01:25.450> cool<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:27.610> I<00:01:28.770> mean

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.200 

after<00:01:39.700> I<00:01:39.729> do<00:01:39.909> the<00:01:40.030> quadrant<00:01:40.540> test<00:01:40.780> will<00:01:41.259> do<00:01:41.530> a

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
after I do the quadrant test will do a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.499 
after I do the quadrant test will do a
speed<00:01:43.210> test<00:01:43.630> on<00:01:44.049> my<00:01:44.229> wife<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:44.770> will<00:01:45.310> see<00:01:46.270> what<00:01:46.420> it

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
speed test on my wife I will see what it

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.950 
speed test on my wife I will see what it
runs<00:01:47.759> might<00:01:48.759> be<00:01:48.970> fast<00:01:49.270> might<00:01:49.720> be<00:01:49.899> slow<00:01:51.750> my<00:01:52.750> wife

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
runs might be fast might be slow my wife

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.279 
runs might be fast might be slow my wife
is<00:01:53.200> decent<00:01:54.039> it's<00:01:54.250> not<00:01:54.460> super<00:01:55.450> high<00:01:55.630> speed<00:01:56.080> or

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
is decent it's not super high speed or

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.029 
is decent it's not super high speed or
anything<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.630> here<00:01:58.899> goes<00:01:58.929> the<00:01:59.380> graphics

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
anything so here goes the graphics

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:22.200 
anything so here goes the graphics
testing

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.960 

so<00:02:22.720> not<00:02:22.870> too<00:02:23.350> bad<00:02:23.620> running<00:02:24.160> all<00:02:24.370> right<00:02:24.670> frames

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
so not too bad running all right frames

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:42.030 
so not too bad running all right frames
per<00:02:25.240> second<00:02:28.500> 3d<00:02:29.500> double<00:02:29.950> helix<00:02:34.020> yes<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:41.040> can't

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
per second 3d double helix yes and can't

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.010 
per second 3d double helix yes and can't
really<00:02:42.160> see<00:02:42.700> that<00:02:42.940> too<00:02:43.210> well<00:02:43.450> it's<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:43.780> little

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
really see that too well it's a little

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.080 
really see that too well it's a little
on<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.170> bright<00:02:44.470> side<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:47.880> should<00:02:48.880> try<00:02:49.060> out

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
on the bright side so should try out

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.050 
on the bright side so should try out
uprightness<00:02:50.280> it's<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.370> little<00:02:51.700> on<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.790> dark

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
uprightness it's a little on the dark

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:03.570 
uprightness it's a little on the dark
side<00:02:53.100> yeah<00:02:55.260> try<00:02:56.260> that<00:02:57.360> still<00:02:58.360> too<00:02:58.630> bright<00:03:02.580> try

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
side yeah try that still too bright try

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:15.040 
side yeah try that still too bright try
that<00:03:05.400> zooming<00:03:06.400> maybe

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.560 

if<00:03:16.050> you<00:03:16.170> can<00:03:16.290> see<00:03:16.500> but<00:03:17.570> fell<00:03:20.300> for<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.390> my

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
if you can see but fell for the my

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
if you can see but fell for the my
device<00:03:21.630> I<00:03:22.850> got<00:03:28.250> 2337<00:03:29.900> which<00:03:30.900> isn't<00:03:31.230> as<00:03:31.320> good<00:03:31.530> as

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
device I got 2337 which isn't as good as

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.750 
device I got 2337 which isn't as good as
these<00:03:31.920> other<00:03:32.160> ones<00:03:32.460> and<00:03:34.160> stuff<00:03:35.160> but<00:03:35.370> it's<00:03:35.550> not

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
these other ones and stuff but it's not

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.480 
these other ones and stuff but it's not
too<00:03:36.660> god-awful<00:03:38.660> feeling<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:40.080> so<00:03:41.330> that's<00:03:42.330> that

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
too god-awful feeling it so that's that

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:56.890 
too god-awful feeling it so that's that
going<00:03:44.490> at<00:03:44.730> home<00:03:45.470> and<00:03:46.520> in<00:03:47.520> back<00:03:47.850> out<00:03:54.110> and

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
going at home and in back out and

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:06.250 
going at home and in back out and
brightness<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:57.930> bit<00:03:58.140> again<00:03:59.630> about<00:04:00.630> halfway<00:04:02.060> and

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:14.330 

so<00:04:08.420> try<00:04:09.470> speed<00:04:10.470> nap<00:04:10.770> test<00:04:12.680> just<00:04:13.680> download<00:04:14.130> the

so try speed nap test just download the

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:26.620 
so try speed nap test just download the
app<00:04:14.490> so<00:04:15.980> yes<00:04:16.980> agree<00:04:18.980> begin<00:04:19.980> test<00:04:22.040> so<00:04:25.580> that's
