00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
some other turbines around the area will

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.429 
some other turbines around the area will
also<00:00:30.090> work<00:00:30.300> if<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.869> come<00:00:31.019> over<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.320> this

turbine and place sticky bombs around
the<00:00:33.600> base<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:34.410> will<00:00:34.559> notice<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
the base you will notice that the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.889 
the base you will notice that the
turbine<00:00:35.579> will<00:00:35.790> lift<00:00:35.969> its<00:00:36.180> way<00:00:36.329> up<00:00:36.480> from<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
turbine will lift its way up from the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.479 
turbine will lift its way up from the
ground<00:00:37.110> from<00:00:37.649> here<00:00:37.860> all<00:00:38.129> you're<00:00:38.160> going<00:00:38.370> to

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
ground from here all you're going to

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.670 
ground from here all you're going to
want<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.700> do<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.030> ask<00:00:39.210> someone<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:40.079> use<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> heavy

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
want to do is ask someone to use a heavy

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.799 
want to do is ask someone to use a heavy
vehicle<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:41.340> can<00:00:41.579> be<00:00:41.670> an<00:00:41.760> insurgent<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.480> dump

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
vehicle it can be an insurgent a dump

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.139 
vehicle it can be an insurgent a dump
anything<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:44.129> ram<00:00:44.460> its<00:00:44.640> way<00:00:44.879> into

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
anything like that to ram its way into

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.900 
anything like that to ram its way into
the<00:00:45.510> base<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.530> turbine<00:00:46.739> once<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.879> is

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
the base of the turbine once it is

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.610 
the base of the turbine once it is
lifted<00:00:48.360> from<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.600> ground<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.079> what<00:00:49.469> you'll

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
lifted from the ground and what you'll

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.860 
lifted from the ground and what you'll
notice<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.190> eventually<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:51.120> turbine<00:00:51.570> will

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
notice is eventually the turbine will

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.770 
notice is eventually the turbine will
fall<00:00:52.199> over<00:00:52.440> which<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.610> see<00:00:53.640> right<00:00:54.030> now

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
fall over which you can see right now

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.660 
fall over which you can see right now
now<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.590> really<00:00:55.890> funny<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.460> knock

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
now this is really funny you can knock

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.060 
now this is really funny you can knock
over<00:00:56.699> loads<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.690> turbines<00:00:58.079> using<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.770> glitch

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
over loads of turbines using this glitch

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.000 
over loads of turbines using this glitch
and<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.820> won't<00:01:00.210> despawn<00:01:00.840> unless<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.469> walk<00:01:01.710> so

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
and it won't despawn unless you walk so

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.650 
and it won't despawn unless you walk so
far<00:01:02.250> away<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.789> can't<00:01:03.059> even<00:01:03.149> see<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
far away that you can't even see the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.149 
far away that you can't even see the
turbine<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.530> won't<00:01:04.710> have<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.920> worry<00:01:04.949> about

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
turbine so you won't have to worry about

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.920 
turbine so you won't have to worry about
this<00:01:05.549> D<00:01:05.729> spawning<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.270> moment<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.659> hits<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
this D spawning the moment it hits the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.690 
this D spawning the moment it hits the
ground<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.680> nevertheless<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.310> trick<00:01:08.670> is

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
ground but nevertheless this trick is

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.789 
ground but nevertheless this trick is
very<00:01:09.090> glitchy<00:01:09.360> some<00:01:09.780> may<00:01:09.930> regard<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
very glitchy some may regard it as a

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.789 
very glitchy some may regard it as a
glitch<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.159> itself<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.360> whitley<00:01:13.350> may<00:01:13.530> mess

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
glitch in itself so it whitley may mess

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.200 
glitch in itself so it whitley may mess
up<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.189> may<00:01:14.340> see<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.610> turbine<00:01:14.939> kind<00:01:15.150> of

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
up you may see the turbine kind of

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.609 
up you may see the turbine kind of
glitch<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.570> two<00:01:15.659> different<00:01:15.840> locations<00:01:16.020> you

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
glitch in two different locations you

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.289 
glitch in two different locations you
may<00:01:16.740> say<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> fly<00:01:17.250> into<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> sky<00:01:17.670> or<00:01:17.820> something

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
may say a fly into the sky or something

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.210 
may say a fly into the sky or something
but<00:01:18.750> nevertheless<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.409> fairly<00:01:19.710> easy<00:01:19.860> and

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
but nevertheless it's fairly easy and

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.890 
but nevertheless it's fairly easy and
simple<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.970> once<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.509> have<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.750> on

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
simple to do and once you do have it on

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.539 
simple to do and once you do have it on
the<00:01:21.990> ground<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:22.740> knock<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:22.950> about<00:01:23.340> you

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
the ground you can knock it about you

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.520 
the ground you can knock it about you
can<00:01:23.729> jump<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.450> top<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.810> turbine<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.439> get

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
can jump on top of the turbine and get

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.590 
can jump on top of the turbine and get
it<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.740> fling<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.189> places<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:26.880> really<00:01:27.270> funny

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
it to fling you places it's really funny

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.690

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
before rockstar may patch it but

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.800 
before rockstar may patch it but
nevertheless<00:01:32.130> i<00:01:32.549> spend<00:01:32.939> at<00:01:33.150> least<00:01:33.360> an<00:01:33.630> hour

nevertheless i spend at least an hour
just<00:01:33.990> mucking<00:01:34.409> around<00:01:34.619> with<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:34.950> turbine<00:01:35.369> of

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
just mucking around with this turbine of

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.920 
just mucking around with this turbine of
me<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.820> my<00:01:35.880> friends<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.329> cordon<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.659> few<00:01:36.780> air

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
me and my friends we cordon a few air

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.450 
me and my friends we cordon a few air
strikes<00:01:37.259> as<00:01:37.439> well<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.740> got<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.890> turbine<00:01:38.220> just

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
strikes as well and got the turbine just

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.890 
strikes as well and got the turbine just
to<00:01:38.549> fly<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:39.000> two<00:01:39.090> different<00:01:39.270> locations<00:01:39.450> around

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
to fly in two different locations around

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.230 
to fly in two different locations around
us<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.070> climb<00:01:41.400> onto<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.759> tower<00:01:42.030> and

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
us but you can climb onto this tower and

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.249 
us but you can climb onto this tower and
take<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> look<00:01:42.540> at<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.689> from<00:01:42.780> below<00:01:42.990> because

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
take a look at it from below because

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.380 
take a look at it from below because
it's<00:01:43.530> literally<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.159> turbine<00:01:44.549> falling

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
it's literally just a turbine falling

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.300 
it's literally just a turbine falling
over<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.680> lying<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.130> ground

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
over and it's just lying on the ground

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.639 
over and it's just lying on the ground
now<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.670> base<00:01:47.880> may<00:01:48.180> look<00:01:48.360> invisible<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:49.470> was

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
now the base may look invisible that was

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.139 
now the base may look invisible that was
just<00:01:49.890> because<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.310> base<00:01:50.520> isn't<00:01:50.850> actually

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
just because the base isn't actually

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.639 
just because the base isn't actually
dags<00:01:51.509> it's<00:01:51.750> always<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.140> ground<00:01:52.409> so

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
dags it's always on the ground so

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.410 
dags it's always on the ground so
there's<00:01:52.799> no<00:01:52.860> text<00:01:53.220> for<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.610> but<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.090> can<00:01:54.240> still

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
there's no text for it but you can still

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.880 
there's no text for it but you can still
climb<00:01:54.659> onto<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.049> turbine<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:55.740> still

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
climb onto the turbine you can still

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.289 
climb onto the turbine you can still
walk<00:01:56.100> across<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.700> try<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:56.939> get<00:01:57.030> onto<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
walk across it and try and get onto the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.730 
walk across it and try and get onto the
middle<00:01:57.540> point<00:01:57.750> that's<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.990> fun<00:01:58.170> game<00:01:58.380> we<00:01:58.530> tried

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
middle point that's a fun game we tried

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.410 
middle point that's a fun game we tried
to<00:01:58.860> play<00:01:59.040> because<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.610> course<00:01:59.850> try<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.210> kill

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
to play because of course try and kill

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.670 
to play because of course try and kill
in<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.570> middle<00:02:00.810> point<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.229> actual

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
in the middle point of the actual

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.830 
in the middle point of the actual
turbines<00:02:02.159> spinning<00:02:02.310> around<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.790> rotating<00:02:03.360> it

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
turbines spinning around and rotating it

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.510 
turbines spinning around and rotating it
does<00:02:04.140> take<00:02:04.380> quite<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.619> bit<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.950> challenge<00:02:05.189> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
does take quite a bit of a challenge to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.249 
does take quite a bit of a challenge to
do<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:05.880> but<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.420> should<00:02:06.630> try<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:06.869> out<00:02:07.110> and

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
do so but you should try this out and

do so but you should try this out and
try<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.500> make<00:02:07.680> some<00:02:07.829> cool<00:02:08.009> games<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.399> this

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
try and make some cool games of this

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.680 
try and make some cool games of this
because<00:02:08.640> you'll<00:02:08.819> be<00:02:08.849> amazed<00:02:09.179> with<00:02:09.330> how<00:02:09.390> much

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
fun you can have with a knocked over

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.460 
fun you can have with a knocked over
turbine<00:02:11.730> but<00:02:12.150> guys<00:02:12.420> it's<00:02:12.720> fairly<00:02:13.020> simple

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
turbine but guys it's fairly simple

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.620 
turbine but guys it's fairly simple
easy<00:02:13.740> some<00:02:14.250> people<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:14.820> your<00:02:14.940> lobby<00:02:15.150> may<00:02:15.420> not

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
easy some people in your lobby may not

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.240 
easy some people in your lobby may not
see<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:15.960> turbine<00:02:16.380> for<00:02:16.680> example<00:02:17.070> if<00:02:17.160> you

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
see this turbine for example if you

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.770 
see this turbine for example if you
knock<00:02:17.460> it<00:02:17.490> over<00:02:17.640> with<00:02:17.910> your<00:02:17.940> friend<00:02:18.360> another

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780

person<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.500> city<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:20.010> he<00:02:20.340> comes<00:02:20.580> over

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
person is in the city and he comes over

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.280 
person is in the city and he comes over
to<00:02:20.940> try<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.210> see<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.480> he<00:02:21.780> may<00:02:21.930> not<00:02:22.080> actually

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
to try and see it he may not actually

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.440 
to try and see it he may not actually
see<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.740> because<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.400> kind<00:02:23.820> of<00:02:23.850> an<00:02:24.000> object

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
see it because this is kind of an object

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.030 
see it because this is kind of an object
which<00:02:24.630> will<00:02:24.780> only<00:02:24.960> remain<00:02:25.410> there<00:02:25.650> for<00:02:25.860> as<00:02:25.920> long

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
which will only remain there for as long

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.200 
which will only remain there for as long
as<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.190> have<00:02:26.310> your<00:02:26.340> eyes<00:02:26.580> on<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.820> because<00:02:27.060> it

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
as you have your eyes on it because it

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.480 
as you have your eyes on it because it
may<00:02:27.360> despawn<00:02:27.810> if<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.410> go<00:02:28.530> too<00:02:28.590> far<00:02:28.950> away<00:02:29.010> from

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
may despawn if you go too far away from

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.890 
may despawn if you go too far away from
the<00:02:29.670> actual<00:02:29.940> turbine<00:02:30.390> once<00:02:30.600> it's<00:02:30.750> knocked

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
the actual turbine once it's knocked

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.510 
the actual turbine once it's knocked
over<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:31.440> if<00:02:31.590> your<00:02:31.710> friend<00:02:31.920> comes<00:02:32.160> along<00:02:32.370> and

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
over so if your friend comes along and

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.640 
over so if your friend comes along and
you<00:02:32.970> can't<00:02:33.330> see<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.600> turbine<00:02:33.990> then<00:02:34.500> are<00:02:34.590> we

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
you can't see the turbine then are we

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.690 
you can't see the turbine then are we
going<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.860> want<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.040> do<00:02:35.130> as<00:02:35.250> asked<00:02:35.430> him<00:02:35.580> to

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
going to want to do as asked him to

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.130 
going to want to do as asked him to
knock<00:02:35.880> over<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.240> current<00:02:36.600> turbine<00:02:36.930> which

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
knock over the current turbine which

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.470 
knock over the current turbine which
will<00:02:37.260> be<00:02:37.380> in<00:02:37.560> its<00:02:38.100> actual<00:02:38.640> place<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.240> then

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
will be in its actual place and then

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.850 
will be in its actual place and then
he'll<00:02:39.660> love<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.810> too<00:02:39.900> i<00:02:39.990> bind<00:02:40.170> play<00:02:40.440> with<00:02:40.650> them

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
he'll love it too i bind play with them

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.530 
he'll love it too i bind play with them
you'll<00:02:41.100> understand<00:02:41.610> exactly<00:02:41.760> how<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:42.300> works
