00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.490 

Brown<00:00:02.060> I've<00:00:02.240> read<00:00:02.449> about<00:00:02.540> live<00:00:02.840> view<00:00:03.290> could

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:03.500 
Brown I've read about live view could

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.110 
Brown I've read about live view could
you<00:00:03.560> tell<00:00:03.710> me<00:00:03.770> how<00:00:03.949> it<00:00:04.010> works<00:00:04.220> so<00:00:04.700> the<00:00:04.790> way<00:00:04.910> that

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:05.120 
you tell me how it works so the way that

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.719 
you tell me how it works so the way that
it<00:00:05.210> works<00:00:05.420> is<00:00:05.720> quite<00:00:05.990> straight<00:00:06.319> forward<00:00:06.729> from

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:07.729 
it works is quite straight forward from

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:09.550 
it works is quite straight forward from
the<00:00:07.939> camera<00:00:08.269> itself<00:00:08.570> as<00:00:08.809> you<00:00:08.840> know<00:00:09.020> there's<00:00:09.380> a

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:09.560 
the camera itself as you know there's a

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.690 
the camera itself as you know there's a
mirror<00:00:09.830> inside<00:00:09.950> so<00:00:10.190> let<00:00:10.280> me<00:00:10.340> just<00:00:10.490> show<00:00:10.640> you

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
mirror inside so let me just show you

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.040 
mirror inside so let me just show you
that<00:00:12.550> so<00:00:13.550> within<00:00:14.360> the<00:00:14.450> camera<00:00:14.720> normally

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.050 
that so within the camera normally

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.269 
that so within the camera normally
there's<00:00:15.230> a<00:00:15.290> mirror<00:00:15.530> it<00:00:15.590> points<00:00:15.980> up<00:00:16.099> to<00:00:16.129> the

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
there's a mirror it points up to the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.370 
there's a mirror it points up to the
pentaprism<00:00:16.550> when<00:00:17.390> we<00:00:17.480> operate<00:00:17.600> lively<00:00:18.260> we

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
pentaprism when we operate lively we

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.960 
pentaprism when we operate lively we
pivot<00:00:18.650> that<00:00:18.740> pop<00:00:18.920> mirror<00:00:19.220> up<00:00:19.369> and<00:00:19.550> expose<00:00:19.820> the

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
pivot that pop mirror up and expose the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.029 
pivot that pop mirror up and expose the
sensor<00:00:20.330> so<00:00:20.480> it's<00:00:20.600> a<00:00:20.690> bit<00:00:20.840> like<00:00:20.960> this<00:00:21.110> so<00:00:21.920> now

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
sensor so it's a bit like this so now

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.680 
sensor so it's a bit like this so now
you<00:00:22.100> can<00:00:22.340> see<00:00:22.520> that<00:00:22.699> the<00:00:22.789> sensors<00:00:23.150> expose<00:00:23.539> the

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 
you can see that the sensors expose the

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.480 
you can see that the sensors expose the
mirrors<00:00:23.960> up<00:00:24.140> what<00:00:24.710> we<00:00:24.830> have<00:00:24.980> on<00:00:25.100> the<00:00:25.190> back<00:00:25.310> of

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
mirrors up what we have on the back of

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.269 
mirrors up what we have on the back of
the<00:00:25.550> camera<00:00:25.730> is<00:00:26.240> a<00:00:26.300> live<00:00:26.660> view<00:00:27.109> of<00:00:27.380> actually

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
the camera is a live view of actually

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.980 
the camera is a live view of actually
what<00:00:28.550> you're<00:00:28.730> seeing<00:00:28.940> so<00:00:29.029> as<00:00:29.270> I<00:00:29.359> move<00:00:29.510> my<00:00:29.660> hands

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
what you're seeing so as I move my hands

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.650 
what you're seeing so as I move my hands
you<00:00:30.529> exactly<00:00:30.890> see<00:00:31.160> it<00:00:31.250> is<00:00:31.430> there<00:00:31.730> so<00:00:32.390> we've<00:00:32.509> got

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
you exactly see it is there so we've got

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.239 
you exactly see it is there so we've got
a<00:00:32.689> live<00:00:32.870> preview<00:00:33.140> of<00:00:33.379> exactly<00:00:33.859> what's<00:00:34.069> being

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:34.249 
a live preview of exactly what's being

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:35.919 
a live preview of exactly what's being
seen<00:00:34.460> through<00:00:34.489> the<00:00:34.729> lens<00:00:34.850> exactly<00:00:35.690> and<00:00:35.839> there

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:35.929 
seen through the lens exactly and there

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:38.079 
seen through the lens exactly and there
are<00:00:36.019> only<00:00:36.170> any<00:00:36.530> sort<00:00:36.859> of<00:00:36.949> downsides<00:00:37.850> to<00:00:38.059> that

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:38.089 
are only any sort of downsides to that

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:39.790 
are only any sort of downsides to that
for<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:38.390> photographic<00:00:39.109> point<00:00:39.350> of<00:00:39.469> view<00:00:39.559> um

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
for the photographic point of view um

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.829 
for the photographic point of view um
from<00:00:40.729> a<00:00:40.819> photographic<00:00:41.449> point<00:00:41.690> of<00:00:41.749> view

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:41.839 
from a photographic point of view

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:44.200 
from a photographic point of view
there's<00:00:42.019> no<00:00:42.139> real<00:00:42.319> downsides<00:00:42.829> it<00:00:43.519> does<00:00:43.789> heat

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
there's no real downsides it does heat

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.239 
there's no real downsides it does heat
the<00:00:44.420> body<00:00:44.569> up<00:00:44.809> a<00:00:44.929> little<00:00:45.109> bit<00:00:45.319> but<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:45.799> reality

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:46.249 
the body up a little bit but the reality

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:48.939 
the body up a little bit but the reality
is<00:00:46.280> is<00:00:46.579> that<00:00:46.609> Live<00:00:47.479> View<00:00:47.690> mode<00:00:47.929> will<00:00:48.350> cut<00:00:48.589> the

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
is is that Live View mode will cut the

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.099 
is is that Live View mode will cut the
cut<00:00:49.729> itself<00:00:50.059> out<00:00:50.269> when<00:00:50.479> the<00:00:50.569> internal<00:00:50.870> camera

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
cut itself out when the internal camera

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.919 
cut itself out when the internal camera
temperature<00:00:51.589> reaches<00:00:51.859> 45<00:00:52.159> Celsius<00:00:52.789> right

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
temperature reaches 45 Celsius right

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.959 
temperature reaches 45 Celsius right
and<00:00:54.109> what<00:00:54.409> about<00:00:54.499> autofocus<00:00:55.489> we<00:00:55.670> still<00:00:55.850> got

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
and what about autofocus we still got

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.509 
and what about autofocus we still got
autofocus<00:00:56.449> so<00:00:56.929> because<00:00:57.319> the<00:00:57.499> mirror<00:00:57.739> is<00:00:58.039> part

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
autofocus so because the mirror is part

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.430 
autofocus so because the mirror is part
of<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:58.819> autofocus<00:00:59.209> system<00:00:59.629> in<00:00:59.959> terms<00:01:00.170> of<00:01:00.319> the

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
of the autofocus system in terms of the

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.680 
of the autofocus system in terms of the
optical<00:01:00.859> path<00:01:01.039> then<00:01:01.819> actually<00:01:02.209> you<00:01:02.420> lose

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
optical path then actually you lose

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.570 
optical path then actually you lose
autofocus<00:01:03.499> when<00:01:03.709> you<00:01:03.799> pop<00:01:04.010> use<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.400> Live<00:01:04.549> View

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
autofocus when you pop use the Live View

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.060 
autofocus when you pop use the Live View
you<00:01:05.150> can<00:01:05.180> still<00:01:05.510> manual<00:01:05.840> focus<00:01:06.230> and<00:01:06.380> if<00:01:06.950> you

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
you can still manual focus and if you

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.560 
you can still manual focus and if you
actually<00:01:07.220> connect<00:01:07.550> the<00:01:07.610> camera<00:01:07.760> to<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.330> Cox

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
actually connect the camera to the Cox

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.630 
actually connect the camera to the Cox
computer<00:01:09.380> with<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.590> software<00:01:09.620> you<00:01:10.490> can

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
computer with the software you can

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.270 
computer with the software you can
actually<00:01:10.760> drive<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.570> AF<00:01:11.900> on<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.440> lens<00:01:12.680> from

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
actually drive the AF on the lens from

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.640 
actually drive the AF on the lens from
the<00:01:13.370> buttons<00:01:13.880> on<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.090> computer<00:01:14.510> so<00:01:14.930> very<00:01:15.260> very

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
the buttons on the computer so very very

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.020 
the buttons on the computer so very very
much<00:01:15.770> an<00:01:16.010> ideal<00:01:16.250> product<00:01:16.520> for<00:01:16.640> studio

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
much an ideal product for studio

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.880 
much an ideal product for studio
location<00:01:17.300> house<00:01:17.600> studio<00:01:17.930> work<00:01:18.110> then<00:01:18.290> I<00:01:18.470> think

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
location house studio work then I think

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.260 
location house studio work then I think
not<00:01:19.010> only<00:01:19.040> studio<00:01:19.580> it's<00:01:19.790> also<00:01:20.090> perhaps

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
not only studio it's also perhaps

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.690 
not only studio it's also perhaps
interesting<00:01:20.990> for<00:01:21.470> some<00:01:22.040> prep<00:01:22.280> members<00:01:22.550> of<00:01:22.640> the

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
interesting for some prep members of the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.950 
interesting for some prep members of the
press<00:01:22.910> where<00:01:23.120> the<00:01:23.210> ability<00:01:23.510> to<00:01:23.540> hold<00:01:23.840> the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
camera above your head and still see

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.120 
camera above your head and still see
from<00:01:27.050> the<00:01:27.140> on<00:01:27.230> the<00:01:27.320> viewfinder<00:01:27.530> what<00:01:28.010> the

from the on the viewfinder what the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.950 
from the on the viewfinder what the
camera<00:01:28.400> is<00:01:28.430> seeing<00:01:28.490> gives<00:01:29.390> them<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:29.660> extra

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
camera is seeing gives them that extra

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.360 
camera is seeing gives them that extra
ability<00:01:30.410> that<00:01:30.590> maybe<00:01:30.860> they<00:01:31.010> had<00:01:31.160> in<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.340> old

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
ability that maybe they had in the old

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.620 
ability that maybe they had in the old
days<00:01:31.640> when<00:01:31.820> they<00:01:31.910> could<00:01:32.060> take<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:32.330> pentaprism

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
days when they could take the pentaprism

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.660 
days when they could take the pentaprism
off<00:01:33.050> and<00:01:33.320> so<00:01:33.470> this<00:01:33.650> may<00:01:33.800> be<00:01:33.860> good<00:01:34.430> for<00:01:34.460> wildlife

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
off and so this may be good for wildlife

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.270 
off and so this may be good for wildlife
as<00:01:35.030> well<00:01:35.060> though<00:01:35.330> I<00:01:35.540> think<00:01:36.260> the<00:01:36.560> applications

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
as well though I think the applications

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.860 
as well though I think the applications
will<00:01:37.490> actually<00:01:37.760> extend<00:01:37.970> is<00:01:38.240> once<00:01:38.420> people<00:01:38.600> get

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
will actually extend is once people get

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.810 
will actually extend is once people get
familiar<00:01:39.410> with<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.680> camera<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:40.250> see<00:01:40.640> what

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
familiar with the camera and see what

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.760 
familiar with the camera and see what
this<00:01:40.940> gives<00:01:41.300> them<00:01:41.540> they<00:01:42.350> will<00:01:42.500> find

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
this gives them they will find

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.920 
this gives them they will find
additional<00:01:42.980> uses<00:01:43.820> for<00:01:44.000> it<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:44.240> we<00:01:44.360> might<00:01:44.630> have

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
additional uses for it so we might have

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.840 
additional uses for it so we might have
some<00:01:45.110> ideas<00:01:45.409> right<00:01:45.620> now<00:01:45.830> but<00:01:46.430> this<00:01:46.580> will

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
some ideas right now but this will

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.250 
some ideas right now but this will
ultimately<00:01:47.570> be<00:01:47.750> driven<00:01:47.990> by<00:01:48.200> the

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
ultimately be driven by the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.860 
ultimately be driven by the
photographer's<00:01:48.920> does<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.880> video<00:01:50.360> feed<00:01:50.630> just

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
photographer's does the video feed just

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.420 
photographer's does the video feed just
go<00:01:51.020> onto<00:01:51.230> the<00:01:51.320> laptop<00:01:51.440> I<00:01:51.740> can<00:01:51.770> only<00:01:52.040> see<00:01:52.250> it<00:01:52.310> my

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
go onto the laptop I can only see it my

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.980 
go onto the laptop I can only see it my
laptop<00:01:52.880> always<00:01:53.120> Renier<00:01:53.390> any<00:01:53.600> other<00:01:53.720> way<00:01:53.840> I<00:01:53.870> can

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
laptop always Renier any other way I can

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.260 
laptop always Renier any other way I can
use<00:01:54.200> that<00:01:54.230> video<00:01:54.710> so<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:55.670> can<00:01:55.880> connect<00:01:56.180> the

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
use that video so you can connect the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.390 
use that video so you can connect the
camera<00:01:56.450> through<00:01:57.229> its<00:01:57.350> video<00:01:57.560> output<00:01:57.979> actually

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
camera through its video output actually

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.250 
camera through its video output actually
straight<00:01:58.640> into<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:58.909> regular<00:01:59.330> TV<00:01:59.510> monitor<00:02:00.050> or

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
straight into a regular TV monitor or

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.740 
straight into a regular TV monitor or
even<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:00.979> projector<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:02.300> if<00:02:02.450> you're<00:02:02.600> shooting

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
even a projector so if you're shooting

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.450 
even a projector so if you're shooting
in<00:02:02.900> a<00:02:02.990> studio<00:02:03.050> and<00:02:03.590> your<00:02:03.710> models<00:02:04.070> want<00:02:04.159> to<00:02:04.250> see

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
in a studio and your models want to see

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.430 
in a studio and your models want to see
what's<00:02:04.640> happening<00:02:05.030> live<00:02:05.240> you<00:02:05.840> can<00:02:06.020> put<00:02:06.200> a<00:02:06.229> big

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
what's happening live you can put a big

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.840 
what's happening live you can put a big
plasma<00:02:06.740> on<00:02:07.010> the<00:02:07.130> wall<00:02:07.280> or<00:02:07.460> something<00:02:07.490> like

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
plasma on the wall or something like

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.550 
plasma on the wall or something like
that<00:02:07.909> and<00:02:08.300> they<00:02:08.780> can<00:02:08.810> see<00:02:08.959> a<00:02:09.139> feed<00:02:09.379> it's

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
that and they can see a feed it's

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.649 
that and they can see a feed it's
straight<00:02:09.769> away<00:02:10.060> so<00:02:11.060> here<00:02:11.209> we'll<00:02:11.329> just<00:02:11.359> show

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:11.659 
straight away so here we'll just show

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.530 
straight away so here we'll just show
the<00:02:11.870> UM<00:02:12.019> live<00:02:12.319> view

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
the UM live view

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.720 
the UM live view
and<00:02:13.629> we<00:02:14.080> enable<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.709> live<00:02:15.010> view<00:02:15.159> mode<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.670> we

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
and we enable the live view mode and we

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.390 
and we enable the live view mode and we
can<00:02:15.879> actually<00:02:16.209> move<00:02:16.450> using<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.400> joystick

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
can actually move using the joystick

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.399 
can actually move using the joystick
button<00:02:18.819> we<00:02:19.209> can<00:02:19.390> move<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.720> actual<00:02:19.840> fret<00:02:20.200> the

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
button we can move the actual fret the

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.470 
button we can move the actual fret the
frame<00:02:20.650> around<00:02:20.799> that's<00:02:21.790> useful<00:02:22.030> for<00:02:22.209> when<00:02:22.360> we

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
frame around that's useful for when we

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.869 
frame around that's useful for when we
zoom<00:02:22.720> in<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.769> we<00:02:23.890> can<00:02:24.010> zoom<00:02:24.250> in<00:02:24.430> in<00:02:24.579> various

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
zoom in so we can zoom in in various

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.330 
zoom in so we can zoom in in various
steps<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:25.360> there's<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.599> 5<00:02:26.110> x<00:02:26.439> and<00:02:26.739> there's<00:02:27.220> also

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
steps so there's a 5 x and there's also

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.699 
steps so there's a 5 x and there's also
a<00:02:27.549> 10<00:02:27.849> times<00:02:28.090> magnification<00:02:28.510> which<00:02:29.409> gives<00:02:29.620> you

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
a 10 times magnification which gives you

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.979 
a 10 times magnification which gives you
quite<00:02:29.860> a<00:02:29.920> good<00:02:30.159> view<00:02:30.430> for<00:02:30.730> actually<00:02:31.540> achieving

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
quite a good view for actually achieving

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.680 
quite a good view for actually achieving
accurate<00:02:32.170> focus<00:02:32.769> using<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:33.670> live<00:02:33.879> view<00:02:34.090> when

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
accurate focus using the live view when

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.440 
accurate focus using the live view when
you're<00:02:34.840> obviously<00:02:35.079> manual<00:02:35.650> focusing

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
you're obviously manual focusing

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.819 
you're obviously manual focusing
additionally<00:02:37.450> in<00:02:37.540> live<00:02:37.750> view<00:02:38.019> we<00:02:38.500> can<00:02:38.680> have

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
additionally in live view we can have

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.490 
additionally in live view we can have
extra<00:02:39.280> information<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.930> we<00:02:41.049> can<00:02:41.230> have

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
extra information so we can have

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.599 
extra information so we can have
shooting<00:02:42.040> information<00:02:42.640> we<00:02:43.390> can<00:02:43.569> have<00:02:44.609> picture

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609 
shooting information we can have picture

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.289 
shooting information we can have picture
style<00:02:45.819> information<00:02:47.489> all<00:02:48.489> displayed<00:02:49.030> there

within the live view modes also with the
live<00:02:52.599> view<00:02:52.780> mode<00:02:52.989> we<00:02:53.200> have<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:53.409> ability<00:02:53.739> to

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
live view mode we have the ability to

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.009 
live view mode we have the ability to
add<00:02:54.129> in<00:02:54.370> gridlines<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.329> help<00:02:55.510> you<00:02:55.629> line<00:02:55.810> up<00:02:55.840> the

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
add in gridlines to help you line up the

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.680 
add in gridlines to help you line up the
subject<00:02:56.349> and<00:02:56.799> they<00:02:56.980> match<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.519> typical<00:02:58.090> rule

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
subject and they match the typical rule

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.949 
subject and they match the typical rule
of<00:02:58.840> thirds<00:02:59.079> sections<00:03:00.090> plus<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.659> can<00:03:01.810> actually

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
of thirds sections plus you can actually

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.110 
of thirds sections plus you can actually
see<00:03:02.319> here<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.680> blue<00:03:02.829> lines<00:03:03.099> show<00:03:03.370> us<00:03:03.909> where

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
see here the blue lines show us where

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.729 
see here the blue lines show us where
we've<00:03:04.329> actually<00:03:04.540> added<00:03:04.840> aspect<00:03:05.440> ratio

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
we've actually added aspect ratio

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.559 
we've actually added aspect ratio
information<00:03:06.280> so<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.090> camera<00:03:07.359> has<00:03:07.450> the

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
information so the camera has the

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.509 
information so the camera has the
ability<00:03:07.930> that<00:03:08.109> when<00:03:08.230> it<00:03:08.319> takes<00:03:08.530> pictures<00:03:08.739> it

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
ability that when it takes pictures it

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.110 
ability that when it takes pictures it
can<00:03:09.730> add<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:10.120> predefined<00:03:10.870> crop<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:12.099> an<00:03:12.250> image<00:03:12.489> so

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
can add a predefined crop to an image so

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.670 
can add a predefined crop to an image so
here<00:03:13.359> we've<00:03:13.510> got<00:03:13.629> it<00:03:13.750> set<00:03:13.930> up<00:03:14.019> for<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.230> square<00:03:14.530> so

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
here we've got it set up for a square so

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.160 
here we've got it set up for a square so
a<00:03:14.709> six<00:03:14.980> by<00:03:15.099> six<00:03:15.370> crop<00:03:15.670> there's<00:03:16.599> a<00:03:16.720> number<00:03:16.989> of

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
a six by six crop there's a number of

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.610 
a six by six crop there's a number of
different<00:03:17.440> settings<00:03:18.370> including<00:03:18.819> 4<00:03:19.060> by<00:03:19.209> 5<00:03:19.480> 3<00:03:20.440> by

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
different settings including 4 by 5 3 by

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.330 
different settings including 4 by 5 3 by
4<00:03:20.949> 6<00:03:21.609> by<00:03:21.760> 7<00:03:21.819> crops<00:03:22.389> so<00:03:23.290> actually<00:03:23.650> on<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.919> live

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
4 6 by 7 crops so actually on the live

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.009 
4 6 by 7 crops so actually on the live
view<00:03:24.519> we<00:03:24.699> have<00:03:24.819> the<00:03:24.910> ability<00:03:25.239> to<00:03:25.389> superimpose

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
view we have the ability to superimpose

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.960 
view we have the ability to superimpose
a<00:03:26.199> grid<00:03:26.680> which<00:03:27.010> gives<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:27.340> eat<00:03:27.579> makes<00:03:27.819> it

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
a grid which gives you eat makes it

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.300 
a grid which gives you eat makes it
easier<00:03:28.209> to<00:03:28.239> line<00:03:28.569> up<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.840> camera<00:03:29.169> and<00:03:29.349> as

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
easier to line up the camera and as

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.009 
easier to line up the camera and as
we've<00:03:30.549> shown<00:03:30.730> here<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.449> can<00:03:31.599> even<00:03:31.750> add<00:03:31.989> a

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
we've shown here you can even add a

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.110 
we've shown here you can even add a
cropping<00:03:32.650> information<00:03:33.280> by<00:03:33.819> cropping

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
cropping information by cropping

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.550 
cropping information by cropping
information<00:03:34.780> do<00:03:34.989> you<00:03:35.049> mean<00:03:35.230> you're<00:03:35.349> actually

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
information do you mean you're actually

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.949 
information do you mean you're actually
cropping<00:03:36.129> the<00:03:36.250> captured<00:03:36.639> image<00:03:36.879> now<00:03:37.660> what<00:03:37.840> we

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
cropping the captured image now what we

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.050 
cropping the captured image now what we
do<00:03:38.169> is<00:03:38.319> we<00:03:38.470> add<00:03:38.650> information<00:03:39.639> into<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.879> header

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
do is we add information into the header

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.939 
do is we add information into the header
of<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.299> image<00:03:40.540> so<00:03:41.109> the<00:03:41.319> Canon<00:03:41.590> software

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:41.949 
of the image so the Canon software

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:44.369 
of the image so the Canon software
recognizes<00:03:42.609> this<00:03:42.970> was<00:03:43.180> taken<00:03:43.569> with<00:03:43.660> say<00:03:43.959> a<00:03:44.109> 6

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
recognizes this was taken with say a 6

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.430 
recognizes this was taken with say a 6
by<00:03:44.530> 6<00:03:44.560> or<00:03:44.919> square<00:03:45.220> crop<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:46.480> when<00:03:46.690> you<00:03:46.810> process

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
by 6 or square crop and when you process

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.839 
by 6 or square crop and when you process
the<00:03:47.590> raw<00:03:47.709> file<00:03:48.010> if<00:03:48.129> you'd<00:03:48.250> make<00:03:48.400> no<00:03:48.549> change

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
the raw file if you'd make no change

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.210 
the raw file if you'd make no change
you'll<00:03:49.209> get<00:03:49.389> a<00:03:49.419> square<00:03:49.780> file<00:03:50.049> out<00:03:50.349> but

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
you'll get a square file out but

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.920 
you'll get a square file out but
actually<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:51.669> full<00:03:51.910> resolution<00:03:52.419> of<00:03:52.840> the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
actually the full resolution of the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.140 
actually the full resolution of the
device<00:03:53.049> of<00:03:53.349> the<00:03:53.440> camera<00:03:53.739> is<00:03:53.859> captured<00:03:54.310> so<00:03:54.970> if<00:03:55.060> I

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
device of the camera is captured so if I

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.729 
device of the camera is captured so if I
make<00:03:55.329> a<00:03:55.359> mistake<00:03:55.540> on<00:03:55.900> capture<00:03:56.349> the<00:03:56.590> whole

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
make a mistake on capture the whole

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.589 
make a mistake on capture the whole
image<00:03:57.099> information<00:03:57.370> is<00:03:57.699> actually<00:03:58.060> there<00:03:58.359> and

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
image information is actually there and

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.869 
image information is actually there and
I'm<00:03:58.959> able<00:03:59.109> to<00:03:59.260> recrawl<00:03:59.739> in<00:03:59.919> the<00:04:00.010> software<00:04:00.310> in

I'm able to recrawl in the software in

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.360 
I'm able to recrawl in the software in
post<00:04:01.239> basically<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.470> raw<00:04:02.590> file<00:04:02.859> is<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.129> same

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
post basically the raw file is the same

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.949 
post basically the raw file is the same
as<00:04:03.609> it<00:04:04.060> would<00:04:04.180> have<00:04:04.299> been<00:04:04.419> if<00:04:04.540> you<00:04:04.569> had<00:04:04.750> no

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
as it would have been if you had no

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.000 
as it would have been if you had no
cropping<00:04:05.319> information

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
cropping information

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.339 
cropping information
it's<00:04:06.730> just<00:04:07.060> pre<00:04:07.389> cropped<00:04:07.659> we<00:04:08.049> think<00:04:08.230> this

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
it's just pre cropped we think this

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:09.629 
it's just pre cropped we think this
would<00:04:08.470> be<00:04:08.560> quite<00:04:08.709> useful<00:04:09.010> for<00:04:09.040> people<00:04:09.220> used<00:04:09.549> to

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
would be quite useful for people used to

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.750 
would be quite useful for people used to
