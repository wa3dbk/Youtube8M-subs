end up posting other one later on I
think<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:38.879> 115<00:00:39.690> 28<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.559> was<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> Vepr<00:00:41.550> don't

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
think I 115 28 I was in the Vepr don't

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.910 
think I 115 28 I was in the Vepr don't
ask<00:00:42.059> me<00:00:42.270> why<00:00:42.510> i<00:00:42.540> thought<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.290> gun<00:00:43.500> was<00:00:43.649> really

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
ask me why i thought this gun was really

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.680 
ask me why i thought this gun was really
good<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.280> was<00:00:44.489> done<00:00:45.059> or<00:00:45.239> probably<00:00:45.539> like<00:00:45.660> a

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
good this was done or probably like a

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.540 
good this was done or probably like a
week<00:00:45.840> end<00:00:46.260> week<00:00:46.440> maybe<00:00:46.829> two<00:00:47.039> weeks<00:00:47.070> into<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
week end week maybe two weeks into the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.470 
week end week maybe two weeks into the
game<00:00:48.739> obviously<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.950> mtar<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.430> better<00:00:50.700> even

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
game obviously the mtar is better even

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.729 
game obviously the mtar is better even
the<00:00:51.600> vector<00:00:51.930> i<00:00:51.960> guess<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.350> probably<00:00:52.379> also

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
the vector i guess is probably also

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.160 
the vector i guess is probably also
better<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.460> i<00:00:53.730> was<00:00:54.420> using<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.719> Vepr<00:00:54.870> because

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
better but i was using the Vepr because

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.330 
better but i was using the Vepr because
i<00:00:55.230> thought<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.530> gun<00:00:55.739> was<00:00:55.860> good<00:00:56.070> when<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
i thought this gun was good when the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.340 
i thought this gun was good when the
game<00:00:56.460> first<00:00:56.489> came<00:00:56.789> out<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.360> seems<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.230> it

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
game first came out it seems like it

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.540 
game first came out it seems like it
would<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.469> good<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.980> know<00:00:59.100> judging<00:00:59.399> by<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
would be good you know judging by the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.000 
would be good you know judging by the
fire<00:00:59.820> rating<00:01:00.120> stuff<00:01:00.359> but<00:01:00.690> for<00:01:01.649> some<00:01:01.770> reason

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
fire rating stuff but for some reason

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.619 
fire rating stuff but for some reason
mtar<00:01:02.340> just<00:01:02.550> like<00:01:02.670> melts<00:01:03.090> people<00:01:03.390> i<00:01:03.449> don't<00:01:03.539> know

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629
