and on dips if you're trying to hit

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.169 
and on dips if you're trying to hit
triceps<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.010> want<00:00:29.220> States<00:00:29.490> upright<00:00:29.970> as<00:00:30.060> you

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
triceps you want States upright as you

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.569 
triceps you want States upright as you
can<00:00:30.679> because<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> more<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.040> bend<00:00:32.250> over

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
can because the more you bend over

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.880 
can because the more you bend over
forward<00:00:32.910> yeah<00:00:33.450> more<00:00:34.050> chest<00:00:34.350> involvement

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
forward yeah more chest involvement

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:44.420 
forward yeah more chest involvement
areas<00:00:40.340> so<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.399> was<00:00:41.640> my<00:00:41.790> warmup<00:00:42.450> set<00:00:43.399> now<00:00:44.399> I

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
areas so that was my warmup set now I

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.779 
areas so that was my warmup set now I
did<00:00:44.700> two<00:00:44.940> 25<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.719> 45<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.800> then<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:47.100> drop<00:00:47.460> set

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
did two 25 and 45 and then do drop set

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.260 
did two 25 and 45 and then do drop set
and<00:00:48.000> drop<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.230> 25<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:50.280> didn't<00:00:50.940> go<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.239> a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
and drop one of the 25 I didn't go to a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:00.180 
and drop one of the 25 I didn't go to a
failure<00:00:51.600> again

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:14.490 

and<00:01:01.000> there<00:01:01.270> was<00:01:01.360> a<00:01:01.390> hot<00:01:01.630> mom<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.990> again<00:01:14.229> try<00:01:14.440> to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
and there was a hot mom so again try to

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.430 
and there was a hot mom so again try to
stay<00:01:14.710> as<00:01:14.770> upright<00:01:15.130> as<00:01:15.250> you<00:01:15.580> can<00:01:18.990> no<00:01:19.990> we<00:01:20.200> try<00:01:20.380> to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
stay as upright as you can no we try to

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.130 
stay as upright as you can no we try to
have<00:01:20.590> about<00:01:20.860> a<00:01:21.250> little<00:01:21.310> less<00:01:22.180> than<00:01:22.210> 45<00:01:22.810> degree

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
have about a little less than 45 degree

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.130 
have about a little less than 45 degree
angle<00:01:23.410> on<00:01:23.470> my<00:01:23.530> elbow<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.630> I<00:01:25.660> think<00:01:25.720> if<00:01:25.930> you<00:01:26.020> go

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
angle on my elbow so I think if you go

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:39.340 
angle on my elbow so I think if you go
below<00:01:26.380> that<00:01:26.410> you<00:01:26.920> involve<00:01:27.190> more<00:01:27.759> chest

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.569 

experimental<00:01:40.350> failure<00:01:41.299> drop<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> 25<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:44.280> go<00:01:44.520> to

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
experimental failure drop a 25 and go to

00:01:44.579 --> 00:02:04.569 
experimental failure drop a 25 and go to
failures<00:01:45.090> again

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.459 

make<00:02:05.579> sure<00:02:05.789> on<00:02:05.939> these<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.569> the<00:02:06.810> negative<00:02:07.259> you

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
make sure on these on the negative you

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.040 
make sure on these on the negative you
resist<00:02:08.310> that's<00:02:08.729> my<00:02:08.940> must<00:02:09.179> most<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.750> muscle

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
resist that's my must most of the muscle

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:20.510 
resist that's my must most of the muscle
damage<00:02:10.229> pairs<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.430> eccentric<00:02:12.120> part

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.790 

and<00:02:21.520> just<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.970> prolonged<00:02:22.930> native<00:02:23.260> on<00:02:23.440> that<00:02:23.620> last

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
and just a prolonged native on that last

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.300 
and just a prolonged native on that last
one

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
one

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.640 
one
so<00:02:24.550> failure<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:27.550> then<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.910> went<00:02:28.090> into<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.810> pretty

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
so failure and then I went into a pretty

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.180 
so failure and then I went into a pretty
exhaust<00:02:30.960> this<00:02:31.960> is<00:02:32.050> my<00:02:32.140> warm-up<00:02:32.590> set<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:33.070> mean

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
exhaust this is my warm-up set I mean

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.820 
exhaust this is my warm-up set I mean
it's<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.400> 70<00:02:33.940> pound<00:02:34.150> dumbbell<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.740> it

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
it's a 70 pound dumbbell and so it

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.310 
it's a 70 pound dumbbell and so it
pre-exhaust<00:02:36.340> were<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.760> hand<00:02:36.940> over<00:02:37.240> to<00:02:38.140> hair

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
pre-exhaust were to hand over to hair

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.810 
pre-exhaust were to hand over to hair
extensions<00:02:38.890> with<00:02:39.300> dumbbell<00:02:41.820> school

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820

I like twisting it talks like do I get a

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.780 
I like twisting it talks like do I get a
better<00:03:03.470> contraction<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:07.340> now<00:03:07.490> here's<00:03:07.730> my

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
working set I got the 100 pound Dumbo I

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.930 
working set I got the 100 pound Dumbo I
normally<00:03:12.860> would<00:03:13.010> go<00:03:13.130> heavier<00:03:13.490> but<00:03:13.640> that's<00:03:13.790> all

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940
