didn't<00:01:48.899> need<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.429> they<00:01:50.429> do<00:01:50.490> sit<00:01:50.909> up<00:01:51.030> way<00:01:51.689> too

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
didn't need to do they do sit up way too

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.600 
didn't need to do they do sit up way too
high<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.079> be<00:01:52.320> actual<00:01:52.619> seats<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.159> car<00:01:53.369> in

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
high to be actual seats in the car in

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.130 
high to be actual seats in the car in
vehicle<00:01:53.970> mode<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.479> they<00:01:54.570> put<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.810> detail

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
vehicle mode but they put the detail

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.300 
vehicle mode but they put the detail
into<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.590> think<00:01:55.649> that's<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:56.039> kind<00:01:56.190> of<00:01:56.220> a

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
into it I think that's just kind of a

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.440 
into it I think that's just kind of a
neat<00:01:56.429> little<00:01:56.520> thing<00:01:56.759> they<00:01:56.850> didn't<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:57.209> to<00:01:57.299> do

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
neat little thing they didn't have to do

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.830 
neat little thing they didn't have to do
that

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
that

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.690 
that
I<00:01:57.869> just<00:01:58.500> adds<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.890> little<00:01:58.979> bit<00:01:59.220> to<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.429> idea

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
I just adds a little bit to the idea

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.380 
I just adds a little bit to the idea
this<00:01:59.909> is<00:01:59.970> a<00:02:00.090> car<00:02:01.700> then<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.759> put<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.090> legs<00:02:03.270> out

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
this is a car then you put the legs out

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.840 
this is a car then you put the legs out
here<00:02:03.770> I'm<00:02:04.770> going<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.009> slide<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.429> piece<00:02:05.640> up

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
here I'm going to slide this piece up

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.740 
here I'm going to slide this piece up
into<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.899> body<00:02:07.080> like<00:02:07.289> that<00:02:08.479> turn<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.569> feet

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.510 
that's just how I like to pose think it
hides<00:03:30.820> it<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.030> little<00:03:31.180> bit<00:03:31.300> better<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:33.430> he

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
hides it a little bit better and he

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.830 
hides it a little bit better and he
doesn't<00:03:33.700> give<00:03:33.970> them<00:03:34.030> some<00:03:34.210> bulk<00:03:34.420> there<00:03:34.630> on<00:03:34.720> his

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
doesn't give them some bulk there on his

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.960 
doesn't give them some bulk there on his
backpack<00:03:35.050> but<00:03:35.560> these<00:03:36.250> guys<00:03:36.400> all<00:03:36.610> have<00:03:36.790> pretty

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
backpack but these guys all have pretty

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.840 
backpack but these guys all have pretty
big<00:03:37.120> backpacks<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:38.160> then<00:03:39.160> on<00:03:39.310> this<00:03:39.460> arm<00:03:39.670> as

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
big backpacks and then on this arm as

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.190 
big backpacks and then on this arm as
you<00:03:39.940> can<00:03:40.060> see<00:03:40.180> there's<00:03:40.330> a<00:03:40.360> couple<00:03:40.390> of<00:03:40.690> tabs<00:03:40.930> you

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
you can see there's a couple of tabs you

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.300 
you can see there's a couple of tabs you
can<00:03:41.230> take<00:03:41.500> these<00:03:41.680> uh<00:03:41.940> thruster<00:03:42.940> launchers<00:03:44.310> and

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
can take these uh thruster launchers and

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.050 
can take these uh thruster launchers and
attach<00:03:45.610> them<00:03:45.790> here<00:03:45.820> as<00:03:46.300> some<00:03:47.230> firepower<00:03:48.060> out

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
attach them here as some firepower out

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.570 
attach them here as some firepower out
of<00:03:49.270> this<00:03:49.390> arm<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:49.810> there<00:03:50.650> you<00:03:50.830> have<00:03:50.860> prowl<00:03:51.280> in

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
of this arm and there you have prowl in

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.030 
of this arm and there you have prowl in
robot<00:03:52.150> mode

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
robot mode

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.720 
robot mode
now<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.100> ankles<00:03:54.490> are<00:03:54.610> a<00:03:54.640> little<00:03:54.820> weak<00:03:56.730> just

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
now the ankles are a little weak just

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.330 
now the ankles are a little weak just
the<00:03:57.820> way<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:58.030> is<00:03:58.150> just<00:03:58.390> ball<00:03:59.230> joint<00:03:59.470> ankles<00:03:59.860> not

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
the way it is just ball joint ankles not

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.250 
the way it is just ball joint ankles not
super<00:04:00.700> weak<00:04:00.850> but<00:04:01.060> if<00:04:01.150> you<00:04:01.209> get<00:04:01.360> him<00:04:01.510> too<00:04:02.080> far

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
super weak but if you get him too far

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.660 
super weak but if you get him too far
back<00:04:02.320> he<00:04:02.740> is<00:04:02.770> going<00:04:02.890> to<00:04:03.040> fall<00:04:03.220> over

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
back he is going to fall over

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.330 
back he is going to fall over
but<00:04:04.570> there's<00:04:04.990> certainly<00:04:05.260> some<00:04:05.500> enough<00:04:06.190> to

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
but there's certainly some enough to

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.630 
but there's certainly some enough to
hold<00:04:06.550> them<00:04:06.670> up<00:04:06.820> on<00:04:06.940> a<00:04:06.970> regular<00:04:07.300> pose<00:04:08.640> hearings

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
hold them up on a regular pose hearings

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.070 
hold them up on a regular pose hearings
on<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.030> two<00:04:10.180> car<00:04:10.390> brothers<00:04:12.600> just<00:04:13.600> to<00:04:13.780> show<00:04:13.959> him

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
on the two car brothers just to show him

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.490 
on the two car brothers just to show him
off<00:04:14.200> there<00:04:14.440> I<00:04:15.900> mean<00:04:16.900> one<00:04:17.019> of<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.170> things<00:04:17.380> that

sold them off I got I had a bunch of the

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.340 
sold them off I got I had a bunch of the
old<00:04:21.730> car<00:04:21.940> robots<00:04:22.330> when<00:04:22.480> they<00:04:22.600> first<00:04:22.990> came<00:04:23.200> out

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
old car robots when they first came out

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.490 
old car robots when they first came out
in<00:04:23.440> Japan<00:04:23.590> I<00:04:23.800> had<00:04:24.040> them<00:04:24.160> imported<00:04:25.320> but<00:04:26.320> one<00:04:26.440> of

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
in Japan I had them imported but one of

in Japan I had them imported but one of
the<00:04:26.590> things<00:04:26.710> I<00:04:26.800> never<00:04:26.860> no<00:04:27.160> this<00:04:27.340> is<00:04:27.460> like<00:04:27.669> every

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
the things I never no this is like every

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.600 
the things I never no this is like every
single<00:04:28.270> one<00:04:28.630> of<00:04:28.660> them<00:04:28.810> has<00:04:29.160> kind<00:04:30.160> of<00:04:30.190> a<00:04:30.280> melee

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
single one of them has kind of a melee

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.980 
single one of them has kind of a melee
weapon<00:04:30.640> that<00:04:31.120> they<00:04:31.210> hold<00:04:31.600> in<00:04:31.720> their<00:04:31.840> right

caught that before I'm so they all have
kind<00:04:39.250> of<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.340> basic<00:04:39.790> design<00:04:41.250> between<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.520> three

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
kind of a basic design between the three

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.210 
kind of a basic design between the three
of<00:04:42.730> them<00:04:43.350> but<00:04:44.350> actually<00:04:44.680> it's<00:04:44.830> neat

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
of them but actually it's neat

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.280 
of them but actually it's neat

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
there you have it uh robots in disguise

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.890 
there you have it uh robots in disguise
