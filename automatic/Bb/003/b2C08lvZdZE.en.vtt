00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 DO NOT LEAVE YOUR RIGHTS IN THE DOOR OF YOUR SCHOOL CENTER. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 We share this video because we think that education should not be a mandatory and imposed part of a person's life, 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.500
 but a phase of personal growth that must be joyful and for that is necessary to be responsible on it. 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.500
 1) In school you lose your right to move freely, a right that is essential to everyone. 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:34.000
 A schedule and a bell decide when, and for how long, you can do certain activities, study certain subjects, talk, play, eat, and still sneeze, depending on the discipline of the center! 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 This freedom should never be lost. By depriving you of her, they do not do anything good for you. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 This freedom should never be lost. By depriving you of her, they do not do anything good for you. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 You are not a slave, and you do not need to be deprived of freedom for your own good. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 2) In school you lose the right to think freely and to follow your own interests, 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Teachers, who follow an official schedule and curriculum, are unmindful of the criticisms and often the questions themselves. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Very rarely they offer open debates or participation: it would be against his work. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 But, you're not right to support this salaried role of teachers. You have the right to ask questions and ask for explanations, 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 to sink into the subjects that interest you, and dedicate them all the time you want. And also to understand what you do and for what! 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Remember that raising humans is not the same thing as raising farm animals. Human education is not right to have predefined goals, nor to be equal for everyone. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 3) In the school, you let yourself be classified in a group only for your age. You accept the commitment to stay with this group and do the same thing as they do. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Do you really need this to become a better person or to learn to survive by yourself in the future? 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 No, this is only helpful in reinforcing your sense of belonging to a social class. No one has the right to classify you in this unbecoming way or to decide with whom you should associate with your education. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 4) What is called absenteeism in the school is actually personal responsibility. If you can not control your own education, how can you be responsible for other things after? 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 5) In the school, you leave that others evaluate you and judge in base to repeat like a cockatoos what say some books that you did not elect. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 They force you like that to occupy your school time and "free" in predetermined contents, which are imposed and therefore have nothing to do with your own motivations. And that do not include many important things! 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 School training has a lack of things that are really important for human life, and what is learned is not essential to make a life of its own. 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Most content will be forgotten because it will not be needed at all. In addition, this allows the existence of the ideological and still religious conditioning that clearly exists in the "text books". 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 6) The memorization and the method of the exams are not a good way of teaching, in fact, it is considered as one of the worst! 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 This method only implies the criterion of authority (always needing another one that tells you if what you think is or is not correct), eliminates all the creativity (something can only be true or false, without more than options) 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 And divides students into "stupid" or "smart", "stranded" or "successful", as if they should compete with each other for a price. That way we also learn to dogs! 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Do you see how many things you will not be able to notice for the simple reason that you have not studied the issue and are not properly certified? 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 7) In school centers it is difficult to see how to collaborate to achieve a specific goal. One thing that has been essential for our species since prehistoric times! 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Today, nothing can not be achieved without some collaboration, nothing can succeed alone, or very little. 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 On the other hand, in the school with the collaboration one calls it "to be copied". Think about this question and you will see the huge mistake that entails. If children and young people can not help each other, they will only want to compete for the "big prize" 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 8) Many of the people who remain in compulsory education end up giving up because for them education has lost all sense or because they have been considered too much to be failed by the system. 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 The problem is that they do not see any interest in culture, reading, information: everything seems the same! They really believe they are "stranded". 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 This "school failure" is not due to a lack of intelligence, but has the person is depressed because of the educational system founded in the competition. Spain is the country with more school failure in all of Europe. 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 9) State-mandated compulsory public education has existed for a very short time in history, and it follows the same pattern in all the world where it exists, with very little variation. 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 This shows us that it is not necessary to have a loyal commitment to an educational center or a public authority for the existence of people capable of being good in any profession, 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 to learn, to be creative, to know different languages, to do good things in society or to control one's own life. 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 All of this is naturally learned with the ex- perience of working and communicating with others, or having the freedom to experiment, things that the school does not respect, making dependents and almost slaves to the people who go to school. this. 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Think about it, please. 10) This video is directed at students, teachers and parents, without any desire to impose the ideas it contains. We only hope it serves to make people think ... 

00:05:21.584 --> 00:05:30.580
 ... and to be the detonator of peaceful initiatives. If you apply these ideas in your life, do not do it in a violent way, but cordially. 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 With violence things do not improve, as we have seen so many times in history and in life itself. If you think it's worth it, share these ideas, talk to your friends, and put them into practice 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 Many writers have argued for the need for a freer, responsible and democratic education than the one that applies today, like Francisco Ferrer i Guardia. 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 "Let's start the instruction when the same child asks for it." At 9 am knows the Minister of Public Education that all children read, write and calculate. 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 Do all the children and also the teachers have the same desire at the same time? Why not leave the professor the posibility to do what he wants, because he must know his students better than the Minister or any bureaucrat ... 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 ... and that he must have the necessary liberty to arrange the instruction to his taste and those of the pupils? "The Modern School (Francisco Ferrer i Guardia) 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 I must notice you that this video never say that schools and educational centers should not exist or that the work of a teacher is despicable. ON THE CONTRARY: 

00:06:32.127 --> 00:06:40.130
 So teachers should be able to teach freely! We are not attacking education in oneself, but in the way in which it occurs: 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 a method which produces dreadful results and which decreases the general cultural level every year. We want this to change, that the system is freer to improve in all levels. 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 This project does not involve destroying schools but expanding its present functions, so that they bring about a true education in which the student himself participates and is considered more than an animal without will. 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 But it involves the finalization of all exams, imposed schedules and age classification. 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 I am convinced that membership until the age of 16 (in Spain) in an obligatory internal system is harmful for anyone, that it prevents the free development of the person, 

00:07:15.044 --> 00:07:20.040
 and that diminishes its critical capability and its posibilities to have laborious success in the future (both things, think about it). 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:26.100
 The education it is today is so deficient as a diet entirely based on french fries. 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 It is in your hands the posibility to begin to change this system, either from its inside collectively or with yourself, deciding freely on the most important: your education. 

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:44.290
 It's a good time (because still is) to begin to change this system, which will leave us at almost all in ruin.
