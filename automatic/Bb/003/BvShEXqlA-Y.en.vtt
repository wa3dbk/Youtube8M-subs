00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.520
 welcome to a new region this 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.170
 I give you the review of the mod of the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.119
 spy camera or what is being 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.230
 also in the same way the picture in 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.820
 picture mod 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.099
 so you want pc if we enter fully 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.830
 in the subject and then this camera mode 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.470
 spy is very simple very father and then 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.480
 we can use the tab key to 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.730
 open and close what saying a 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.680
 spy camera of ourselves in this 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.360
 case if I changed my perspective we will see 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.340
 what is the first person perspective 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.950
 since I can change and I can walk 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.320
 playing in third person and the camera 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.730
 extra is going to show me the perspective 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.250
 as if you were seeing at first 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.079
 person which is pretty cool and 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.969
 Well, if we do not want that key 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.219
 the key as default for 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.859
 live and close our camera then 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.800
 we will go to the game menu you 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.769
 we give in options and then to show the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.659
 key or the letter 1 and it will appear 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.270
 this little screen that is going to say 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.859
 we click on the tab and here we 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.810
 different options will appear in 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:15.149
 this case we will look like I have 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.189
 the client side or I know I'm in 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.719
 single player will also not appear 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.649
 the option of when we are in 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:21.959
 multiplayer 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.030
 we are observing with friends because we 

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:25.469
 We can choose the exact lashes in 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.359
 this case because I also have the client 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:30.240
 yes that I open the client was going to appear 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:32.579
 all this list of different options 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.530
 that we have for the mobile in this case 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.689
 in player cam is the player's camera 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.280
 here is my name and it is because it is already 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.829
 activated we have here the picture in 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.049
 picture 6 is the size it will be in 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.179
 proportion to what the screen saying 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.920
 complete in this case comes from a minimum 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.750
 from 10 to a maximum of 90 which is 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.789
 come almost the whole screen come 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.979
 predetermined in 30 in all these are 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.239
 default values of the mod so 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.159
 what will interest us then 

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:57.840
 basically it 's the corner that what 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.250
 saying the corner and there is us 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.259
 a list appears with us we put 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.299
 the mouse on this line is going to 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.219
 appear different numbers and we're going 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.869
 to appear the option to change it like this 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.879
 that we can put ourselves in the center with 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.979
 the 5 video to do a little annoying in 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.600
 this case is predetermined to be 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.660
 in the part of mere down 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.490
 to the right with the number 9 would come 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.530
 being that but I change it to number 1 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.680
 because I find it more comfortable and more 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.600
 practical from here on in then all 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.460
 these are options that do not interest us 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.190
 very much the truth without moving you if you want 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.170
 you can move him to go 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.960
 but I recommend exploring them not 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.820
 move a lot because maybe the woman 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.650
 they leave the camera very transparent 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.410
 or something like that so simply what 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.020
 I recommend moving the corner is the 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.000
 size and also if you want to see what 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.100
 players are now fine I'm 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.920
 mentioning that of players and how 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.140
 add first I'm going to get out of here and 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.150
 I will show you how to remove it in this 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.480
 case when I have it because I have to 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.100
 remove it so we can pib 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.380
 rowing 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.930
 and then the name of the player 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.840
 so let's put it here sandoval and 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.420
 ready and ready the camera is deleted and no longer 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.310
 I have the camera in the upper corner 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.410
 left and in this case to be able 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.830
 add the cdc equal pp 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.720
 but in this case it's a dead up and the 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.430
 Player's name 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.290
 this comes pretty pretty cool 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.420
 when one is playing or if one has 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.280
 a server and you can act with friends 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.290
 then you can add the different 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.600
 cameras and then you do not have to install 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.950
 your friends do not have to install this 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.480
 so that you have it you can 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.550
 be watching the different cameras 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.070
 your friends which is pretty cool 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.530
 but not only is that there are different 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.680
 options if we leave pressed 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.170
 the tab key and turn the wheel of the 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.760
 mouse is going to mark with white our 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.610
 spy camera so if we do 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.560
 one click and leaving pressed 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.350
 every moment the key is going to 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.810
 change camera and this has to be 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.090
 That option is viable if we 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.120
 let's press the key is and that 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.130
 We are clicking on the button 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.790
 central mouse which is quite 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.710
 great so let's do diaz 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.650
 time set 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.750
 and this we do by day and if you notice me 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.970
 I can change again with f5 mi 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.560
 camera to be in first person and 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.180
 in the cold room it will be in 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.280
 third person in which he is quite 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.960
 great and so we are going to be 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.360
 undermining and we may be seeing that what 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.400
 what's on our backs or what's 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.110
 later or on the sides that we 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.930
 we can lose is a pretty mode 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.870
 quite curious very peculiar and quite 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:42.650
 great I loved it very much when I found 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:45.500
 this image mode I'm with in a 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.990
 series as well as that of Sara and the epoc and 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.000
 without minecraft so we have the option 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.060
 to see the two cameras that what is 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.410
 doing one player or the other in this 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.020
 case of willy and vegeta that is doing 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.610
 each one is pretty cool if 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.770
 we do not want to see it simply 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.020
 we remove it we can only expand what 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.310
 which is pretty pretty cool like that 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.440
 So, here we are going to leave 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.970
 this review and if it caught their attention 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.470
 in this way as always in the 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.110
 description I will leave the link in 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.840
 this case are going to be two links one that is 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.850
 the core, let's say, is the core of 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.530
 mod but if this file does not work 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.500
 download the two files that are going to 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.270
 leave in the links 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.060
 and then they install it simply 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.850
 by dragging them to the mods folder in 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.370
 the point folder makes very simple 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.890
 install very father very easy to use 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.420
 This mod is very cool and so if you 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.100
 liked the review they liked this video 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.390
 I would really appreciate it if you read 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.890
 like and they will share it with all their 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.300
 friends and I also invite you to 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.190

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.260
 that then nothing here does not go saying goodbye 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.030
 did not lengthen the video did not lengthen the 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.110
 goodbye I am aldo barelli and the 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.760
