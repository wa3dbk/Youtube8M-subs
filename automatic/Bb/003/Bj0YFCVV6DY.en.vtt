 quite ready for the beach so 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:17.630
 now it's decided you're going to kill 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:19.939
 all the extra pounds and quickly to 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.769
 from today more fats and 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.619
 no more sugars nothing even more fruits 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:27.259
 these fish and broccoli boiled at all 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:31.490
 the meals so if even at breakfast 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:33.800
 how do I think it's already 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.430
 sad and besides it's completely 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.310
 useless 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.680
 it will not help you lose weight even in 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.790
 weight loss you can and you have to 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.080
 consume the fruits 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.630
 in this video you will understand 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.990
 why but especially what 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.850
 fruits 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.040
 you can consume in what quantity 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.290
 and at what time of the day 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.240
 I do not understand you always said he 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.760
 needed 8 and the sugar for mary the 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.890
 sugar fruits so yes but it does not take 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.470
 not put all the sugars in the same 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.870
 basket if you've ever seen the video on 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.790
 the hmi food subscript you know that 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.680
 your body does not react the same 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.170
 way to all the sugars or hydrates of 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.000
 carbon and if you missed it you 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.070
 have the link in the description 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.100
 to make it very simple plus the subscript 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.780
 milk of a food is high plus the 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.630
 your body's hormonal response is 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.980
 fast and harmful for your loss of 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.810
 weight 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.120
 conversely the lower it is the lower the 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.980
 response is tempered and therefore causes 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.170
 much less damage on storage 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.060
 excess in adipose tissue 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.880
 we have long considered the fruits 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.130
 like sugars said fast because of 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.370
 their taste very sweet but it's a 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.350
 fault 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.390
 the empty purpose they contain and the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.760
 fructose that has a glycemic index 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.140
 relatively low since it also 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.900
 around 20 on a scale that's going 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.210
 from 0 to 100 so there is no 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.820
 contraindication to consume fruit 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.190
 even in weight loss just know 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.670
 that even with this super powers of the 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.010
 fructose 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.990
 it still remains a goal so if he 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.390
 should be considered as such 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.710
 when you calculate the amount of 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.180
 carbohydrates in our dietary plan 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.610
 daily other reason also for 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.679
 she had to eat fruits especially 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.230
 now they are an excellent 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.090
 better known source of micronutrients 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.300
 under the name of mineral vitamins and 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.370
 oligo elements that are indispensable to 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.040
 your body you're trying to 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.690
 ask your body in addition to you 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.840
 provide the energy you need 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.000
 for your physical activity to burn 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.220
 all the calories in excess of eliminating 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.270
 excess water and all toxins 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.130
 briefly inside you seduce if in 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.510
 more of that you add your activity 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.410
 professional and personal

 daily 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.910
 you will not be able to fit in 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.920
 length without all these micronutrients 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.930
 essential vitamins and 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.850
 micronutrients are molecules that 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.250
 are at the base of all processes 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.860

 a lot of tryptophan which is the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.049

 precision however clear its importance 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.380
 'the fruit index varies according to 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.530
 of their degree of maturity more they are 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.090
 ripe and over subscript is high try 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.950
 to simply consume them before 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.140
 jam stage for what is 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.640
 quantities everything will depend on you 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.650
