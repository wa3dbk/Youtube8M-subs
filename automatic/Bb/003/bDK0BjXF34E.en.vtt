00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
in the fresh back to coca-cola call

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.179 
in the fresh back to coca-cola call
correctly<00:00:28.580> and<00:00:30.050> as<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.590> see<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:32.009> doing

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
again what I'm gonna do is switch out

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.930 
again what I'm gonna do is switch out
coca-cola<00:00:38.780> solution<00:00:39.780> here<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.790> see<00:00:41.790> if<00:00:41.850> we

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
coca-cola solution here and see if we

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.660 
coca-cola solution here and see if we
can<00:00:42.090> continue<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.480> get<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.780> rust<00:00:43.050> off<00:00:43.670> you

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
can continue to get this rust off you

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.420 
can continue to get this rust off you
see<00:00:44.940> that's<00:00:45.440> coming<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.620> quite<00:00:46.829> well<00:00:46.950> I'm<00:00:47.370> very

surprised so well once again when you
switch<00:00:52.559> out<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.920> solutions<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.210> we

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
switch out the solutions so that that we

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.849 
switch out the solutions so that that we
can<00:00:54.510> get<00:00:54.629> up<00:00:55.940> better<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.199> if<00:00:58.680> you

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
can get up better on this and if you

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.119 
can get up better on this and if you
recall<00:00:58.980> correctly<00:00:59.489> how<00:00:59.820> badly<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:01.350> float<00:01:01.890> was

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
recall correctly how badly the float was

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.359 
recall correctly how badly the float was
rusted<00:01:02.960> it's<00:01:03.960> getting<00:01:04.379> along<00:01:04.559> pretty<00:01:05.100> good

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
rusted it's getting along pretty good

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.190

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
too so again I'm gonna switch out this

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.240 
too so again I'm gonna switch out this

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
some cloths in here to protect it from

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.249 
some cloths in here to protect it from
what<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.280> actually<00:01:24.240> clean<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> gaskets<00:01:25.080> off

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
what I actually clean the gaskets off

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.499 
what I actually clean the gaskets off
and<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:26.430> don't<00:01:26.580> want<00:01:26.700> parts<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> engine

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
and you don't want parts in the engine

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.620 
and you don't want parts in the engine
so<00:01:27.750> there's<00:01:28.530> still<00:01:28.829> better<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.790> dirt<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.479> it

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
so there's still better have dirt in it

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.819 
so there's still better have dirt in it
which<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.140> scrubbed<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.619> I'm<00:01:31.680> gonna

power wash this you want to make sure

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.069 
power wash this you want to make sure
that<00:01:34.110> all<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> engine<00:01:34.680> parts<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.759> be

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
that all the engine parts that can be

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.280 
that all the engine parts that can be
kept<00:01:37.220> sealed<00:01:38.220> our<00:01:38.610> seal<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.720> put<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> screws

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
kept sealed our seal so I put the screws

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.050 
kept sealed our seal so I put the screws
back<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.009> gasket<00:01:41.430> should<00:01:41.460> hold<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.850> in

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
back in the gasket should hold this in

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.929 
back in the gasket should hold this in
place<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:43.380> again<00:01:43.590> we're<00:01:44.130> gonna<00:01:44.250> wash<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.729> up

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
place and again we're gonna wash this up

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.080 
place and again we're gonna wash this up
and<00:01:45.470> shine<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.680> up<00:01:46.920> part<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.729> see<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
and shine this up part you see in the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.730 
and shine this up part you see in the
front<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.540> where<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.840> oil<00:01:49.020> filter<00:01:49.259> normally

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
front is where the oil filter normally

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.730 
front is where the oil filter normally
goes<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:51.240> once<00:01:51.689> we<00:01:51.810> finish<00:01:51.990> with<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.380> engine

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
goes and once we finish with the engine

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.080 
goes and once we finish with the engine
we<00:01:53.040> are<00:01:53.189> then<00:01:53.369> going<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.579> go<00:01:53.700> ahead<00:01:53.820> and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
we are then going to go ahead and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
we are then going to go ahead and
proceed<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.619> power<00:01:55.619> wash<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.479> get<00:01:57.479> rid<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.020> the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
proceed to power wash and get rid of the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.889 
proceed to power wash and get rid of the
rest<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.590> frame<00:01:58.969> once<00:01:59.969> we<00:02:00.180> do<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.360> we

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
rest on the frame once we do that we

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.770 
rest on the frame once we do that we
might<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.380> chance<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.890> paint<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.540> as<00:02:03.540> you

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
might have a chance to paint it as you

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.050
