just like that you basically made your

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.660 
just like that you basically made your
computer<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.210> 13<00:01:03.719> extra<00:01:04.260> USB<00:01:04.409> ports<00:01:05.010> so

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
computer have 13 extra USB ports so

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.280 
computer have 13 extra USB ports so
let's<00:01:05.970> get<00:01:06.060> started<00:01:06.330> with<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> unboxing<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
let's get started with the unboxing and

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:22.070 
let's get started with the unboxing and
I'll<00:01:07.380> show<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.590> guys<00:01:07.770> what<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.189> looks<00:01:08.220> like

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:30.130 

I<00:01:22.140> went<00:01:22.980> up<00:01:23.100> open<00:01:26.180> okay<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:28.460> here<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.550> is

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
I went up open okay so here it is

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.900
