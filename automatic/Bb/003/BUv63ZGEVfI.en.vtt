00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.490 

a little<00:00:00.420> bit<00:00:00.539> of<00:00:00.570> a<00:00:00.630> miscue<00:00:00.900> now<00:00:01.050> Cal<00:00:01.380> is

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
a little bit of a miscue now Cal is

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.389 
a little bit of a miscue now Cal is
going<00:00:01.650> to<00:00:01.770> expand<00:00:02.010> he's<00:00:02.129> going<00:00:02.250> to<00:00:02.340> be

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
going to expand he's going to be

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:03.740 
going to expand he's going to be
slightly<00:00:02.580> behind<00:00:02.850> and<00:00:03.149> again<00:00:03.360> I'm<00:00:03.480> not<00:00:03.600> sure

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
slightly behind and again I'm not sure

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.269 
slightly behind and again I'm not sure
that<00:00:03.899> that's<00:00:03.990> going<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.230> make<00:00:04.350> that<00:00:04.980> big<00:00:05.250> a

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
that that's going to make that big a

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.070 
that that's going to make that big a
difference<00:00:05.370> I<00:00:05.759> think<00:00:05.790> Tech<00:00:06.240> really<00:00:06.540> plays<00:00:06.779> a

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
difference I think Tech really plays a

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.560 
difference I think Tech really plays a
bigger<00:00:07.859> role<00:00:07.950> in<00:00:08.400> a<00:00:08.610> large<00:00:08.820> map<00:00:09.059> like<00:00:09.330> zodiac

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
bigger role in a large map like zodiac

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.259 
bigger role in a large map like zodiac
and<00:00:10.110> kind<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.130> ten<00:00:11.550> seconds<00:00:11.910> here<00:00:12.059> Ted

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
and kind of a ten seconds here Ted

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.940 
and kind of a ten seconds here Ted
seconds<00:00:12.630> there<00:00:12.780> first<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.110> all<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.620> tends<00:00:13.860> not

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
seconds there first of all it tends not

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.279 
seconds there first of all it tends not
to<00:00:14.040> play<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.400> as<00:00:14.580> big<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> role<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.299> Protoss<00:00:15.990> vs

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
to play it as big a role in Protoss vs

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.470 
to play it as big a role in Protoss vs
protoss<00:00:16.590> as<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:16.920> does<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.220> say<00:00:17.789> zerg<00:00:18.000> vs<00:00:18.330> zerg

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
protoss as it does in say zerg vs zerg

robotics<00:00:19.230> facility<00:00:19.350> up<00:00:19.740> for<00:00:19.920> any<00:00:20.010> time<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
robotics facility up for any time in the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.380 
robotics facility up for any time in the
meantime<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:20.789> looks<00:00:20.939> like<00:00:20.970> he's<00:00:21.180> going<00:00:21.330> to

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
meantime so looks like he's going to

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.240 
meantime so looks like he's going to
push<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.689> for<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.900> river<00:00:22.109> grass<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.590> don't<00:00:23.039> see

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
push in for a river grass I don't see

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.320 
push in for a river grass I don't see
what<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.550> looks<00:00:23.699> like<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.880> would<00:00:23.970> be<00:00:24.029> another

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
what it looks like it would be another

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.730 
what it looks like it would be another
robotics<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:24.869> mirrored<00:00:25.289> up<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.590> point

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
robotics so mirrored up to this point

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.310 
robotics so mirrored up to this point
robotics<00:00:26.160> facility<00:00:26.220> also<00:00:26.640> up<00:00:26.880> for<00:00:26.910> Cal<00:00:27.320> and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
robotics facility also up for Cal and

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.650 
robotics facility also up for Cal and
really<00:00:29.160> what<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.429> Protoss<00:00:29.789> vs<00:00:30.090> protoss<00:00:30.420> what

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
really what the Protoss vs protoss what

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.939 
really what the Protoss vs protoss what
usually<00:00:31.050> tells<00:00:31.260> everything<00:00:31.590> is

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
usually tells everything is

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.670 
usually tells everything is
micromanagement<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.850> one<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:34.050> tech<00:00:34.320> decision

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
micromanagement is one is tech decision

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.110 
micromanagement is one is tech decision
but<00:00:34.950> also<00:00:35.130> micromanagement<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.059> I

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
but also micromanagement and I

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.549 
but also micromanagement and I
definitely<00:00:36.420> think<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.930> any<00:00:37.140> time<00:00:37.290> has<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
definitely think that any time has the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.080 
definitely think that any time has the
advantage<00:00:38.129> when<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.610> comes<00:00:38.700> to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
advantage when it comes to

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.000 
advantage when it comes to
micromanagement<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.620> proficient

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
micromanagement is just so proficient

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.590 
micromanagement is just so proficient
and<00:00:41.250> as<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:41.550> saw<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.879> initial<00:00:42.090> match<00:00:42.390> up

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
and as we saw in that initial match up

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.720 
and as we saw in that initial match up
with<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.469> your<00:00:43.590> goons<00:00:43.770> vs<00:00:44.070> cal<00:00:44.280> cal<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.610> no

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
with that your goons vs cal cal is no

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.889 
with that your goons vs cal cal is no
slouch<00:00:45.000> i'm<00:00:45.329> not<00:00:45.420> going<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.600> say<00:00:45.719> he's<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
slouch i'm not going to say he's the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.450 
slouch i'm not going to say he's the
slouch<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.530> any<00:00:46.770> time<00:00:46.980> has<00:00:47.100> been<00:00:47.250> almost

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
slouch is just any time has been almost

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.549 
slouch is just any time has been almost
flawless<00:00:48.059> lately<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.870> his<00:00:49.079> micromanagement

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
flawless lately in his micromanagement

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.260 
flawless lately in his micromanagement
in<00:00:49.800> my<00:00:49.920> minion<00:00:50.250> observer<00:00:50.610> coming<00:00:50.879> out<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.120> try

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
in my minion observer coming out to try

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.299 
in my minion observer coming out to try
to<00:00:51.329> get<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.510> spot<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.800> base<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.160> i'm<00:00:53.250> not

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
to get a spot on the base and i'm not

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.310 
to get a spot on the base and i'm not
sure<00:00:53.550> i<00:00:53.910> don't<00:00:54.180> see<00:00:54.420> any<00:00:54.600> observer<00:00:54.870> I'm<00:00:55.050> sorry

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
sure i don't see any observer I'm sorry

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.080 
sure i don't see any observer I'm sorry
now<00:00:55.530> an<00:00:55.649> observer<00:00:55.949> goin<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.670> do<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.820> same

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
now an observer goin up to do the same

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.939 
now an observer goin up to do the same
and<00:00:57.449> we'll<00:00:57.960> see<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.379> can<00:00:58.530> he<00:00:58.710> comes<00:00:58.859> across

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
and we'll see if we can he comes across

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.560 
and we'll see if we can he comes across
that<00:00:59.219> observer<00:00:59.489> if<00:00:59.699> he'd<00:00:59.850> attracts<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.510> we

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
that observer if he'd attracts it so we

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.849 
that observer if he'd attracts it so we
can<00:01:00.660> go<00:01:00.780> take<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.109> out<00:01:01.199> looks<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.500> he's<00:01:01.739> going

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
can go take it out looks like he's going

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.759 
can go take it out looks like he's going
to<00:01:01.920> bring<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.190> around<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:03.409> yeah<00:01:04.409> he's<00:01:04.559> going<00:01:04.710> to

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
to bring it around I yeah he's going to

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.109 
to bring it around I yeah he's going to
track<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:05.369> take<00:01:05.549> care<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.939> here

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
track it and then take care of it here

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.870 
track it and then take care of it here
in<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.510> second<00:01:06.869> with<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> dragoon<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.850> a

in just a second with a dragoon and a
Reaver<00:01:09.420> out<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.840> looks<00:01:10.020> like<00:01:10.170> we'll<00:01:10.290> see

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
Reaver out and it looks like we'll see

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.260 
Reaver out and it looks like we'll see
if<00:01:10.470> Cal<00:01:10.650> spot<00:01:10.950> yeah<00:01:11.130> unfortunately<00:01:11.549> Cal's

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
if Cal spot yeah unfortunately Cal's

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.789 
if Cal spot yeah unfortunately Cal's
going<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.479> spot<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.810> River<00:01:12.990> he<00:01:13.590> knows<00:01:13.770> a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
going to spot that River he knows a

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.980 
going to spot that River he knows a
Reavers<00:01:14.220> out<00:01:14.400> now<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:15.119> couple<00:01:15.479> probes<00:01:15.780> going

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
Reavers out now a couple probes going

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.999 
Reavers out now a couple probes going
back<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.290> forth<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.710> he<00:01:16.799> knows<00:01:16.979> that

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.960 
basically he's getting information about
the<00:01:18.960> secondary<00:01:19.350> as<00:01:19.470> well<00:01:19.700> seeing<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.759> probes

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the secondary as well seeing the probes

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.090 
the secondary as well seeing the probes
moved<00:01:21.299> back<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.540> forth<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.560> interestingly

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
moved back and forth and interestingly

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.280 
moved back and forth and interestingly
enough<00:01:23.520> anytime<00:01:23.880> couldn't<00:01:24.210> pushing<00:01:25.020> back<00:01:25.170> so

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
enough anytime couldn't pushing back so

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.340 
enough anytime couldn't pushing back so
he<00:01:25.380> knows<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.860> just<00:01:26.369> warped<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:27.350> another

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
he knows that it just warped in another

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.469 
he knows that it just warped in another
gate<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:28.650> going<00:01:28.860> up<00:01:28.979> for<00:01:29.130> kalma<00:01:29.369> meantime<00:01:29.700> he's

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
gate we going up for kalma meantime he's

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.880 
gate we going up for kalma meantime he's
starting<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.810> push<00:01:31.079> some<00:01:31.110> troops<00:01:31.409> up<00:01:31.590> going

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
starting to push some troops up going

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.160 
starting to push some troops up going
for<00:01:32.100> two<00:01:32.220> gateways<00:01:32.460> now<00:01:32.759> again<00:01:33.540> increases<00:01:34.020> it

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
for two gateways now again increases it

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.690 
for two gateways now again increases it
will<00:01:34.259> basically<00:01:34.439> push<00:01:34.860> up<00:01:34.979> his<00:01:35.070> production<00:01:35.520> so

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
will basically push up his production so

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.520 
will basically push up his production so
actually<00:01:36.390> any<00:01:36.509> time<00:01:36.720> taking<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> decisive

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
production advantage at this point is

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.390 
production advantage at this point is
enticed<00:01:39.990> has<00:01:40.409> been<00:01:40.619> mining<00:01:40.920> out<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.130> his<00:01:41.220> base

enticed has been mining out of his base

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.830 
enticed has been mining out of his base
for<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> decent<00:01:42.090> amount<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.420> time<00:01:42.630> than<00:01:42.810> a

for a decent amount of time than a

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.450 
for a decent amount of time than a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
surprise because there wasn't that big a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.679 
surprise because there wasn't that big a
difference<00:01:44.610> between<00:01:44.939> their<00:01:45.299> two<00:01:45.420> basic

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689

difference between their two basic
instructions<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.290> my<00:01:46.439> opinion<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.979> as<00:01:47.729> you

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
instructions in my opinion and as you

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.340 
instructions in my opinion and as you
can<00:01:47.909> see<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.210> looks<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:48.420> he<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.899> think<00:01:49.200> what

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
can see it looks like he I think what

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.109 
can see it looks like he I think what
any<00:01:49.649> time<00:01:49.890> did<00:01:50.040> which<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.369> very<00:01:50.549> clever<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.970> he

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
any time did which is very clever is he

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.490 
any time did which is very clever is he
put<00:01:51.329> down<00:01:51.479> those<00:01:51.630> probes<00:01:51.899> just<00:01:52.170> before<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
put down those probes just before the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.550 
put down those probes just before the
next<00:01:52.590> wis<00:01:52.799> was<00:01:52.920> finished<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.460> had<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.180> mine

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
next wis was finished and had the mine

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.200 
next wis was finished and had the mine
you'll<00:01:55.560> see<00:01:55.770> some<00:01:56.100> very<00:01:56.280> when<00:01:56.640> players<00:01:56.880> really

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
you'll see some very when players really

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.399 
you'll see some very when players really
have<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.420> time<00:01:57.450> again<00:01:57.810> just<00:01:58.049> even<00:01:58.229> do<00:01:58.380> that

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
have the time again just even do that

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.429 
have the time again just even do that
here<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.829> there<00:01:59.329> and<00:02:00.329> not<00:02:00.570> terribly<00:02:01.110> often<00:02:01.259> it

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
here and there and not terribly often it

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.450 
here and there and not terribly often it
looks<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:01.710> he<00:02:01.829> managed<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.159> sneak<00:02:02.340> an

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
looks like he managed to sneak an

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.469 
looks like he managed to sneak an
observer<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> back<00:02:03.000> without<00:02:03.210> cal

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
observer in the back without cal

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.819 
observer in the back without cal
noticing<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.049> he's<00:02:04.170> going<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.380> get<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.530> spot<00:02:04.740> at

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
noticing so he's going to get a spot at

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.280 
noticing so he's going to get a spot at
the<00:02:04.860> tech<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.850> also<00:02:06.210> spotted<00:02:06.540> what<00:02:07.020> Cal's

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
the tech and also spotted what Cal's

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.809 
the tech and also spotted what Cal's
producing<00:02:07.770> four<00:02:08.039> gateways<00:02:08.220> up<00:02:08.459> for<00:02:08.610> him<00:02:08.700> as

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
producing four gateways up for him as

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.639 
producing four gateways up for him as
well<00:02:08.849> still<00:02:09.300> no<00:02:09.450> dropship<00:02:09.899> and

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
well still no dropship and

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.839 
well still no dropship and
we<00:02:10.860> were<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.009> hanging<00:02:11.280> out<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.459> front<00:02:11.730> he

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
we were just hanging out in front he

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.270 
we were just hanging out in front he
just<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.239> Weaver's<00:02:12.569> now<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.739> I'm<00:02:13.860> curious<00:02:14.099> if

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
just to Weaver's now and I'm curious if

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.009 
just to Weaver's now and I'm curious if
we'll<00:02:14.430> see<00:02:14.549> a<00:02:14.579> dropship<00:02:15.000> here<00:02:15.269> anywhere<00:02:15.930> in

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
we'll see a dropship here anywhere in

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.500 
we'll see a dropship here anywhere in
the<00:02:16.079> near<00:02:16.230> future<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.939> looks<00:02:17.939> like<00:02:18.090> hell<00:02:18.269> did

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
the near future and looks like hell did

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.819 
the near future and looks like hell did
realize<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.959> livery<00:02:19.140> was<00:02:19.290> observed<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:19.709> his

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
realize the livery was observed in his

realize the livery was observed in his
base<00:02:19.980> perhaps<00:02:20.220> show<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.670> shiver<00:02:20.879> but<00:02:21.090> looks

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
base perhaps show the shiver but looks

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.990 
base perhaps show the shiver but looks
like<00:02:21.329> any<00:02:21.540> time<00:02:21.720> managed<00:02:22.079> to<00:02:22.200> pull<00:02:22.349> it<00:02:22.379> out

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
like any time managed to pull it out

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.130 
like any time managed to pull it out
kind<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.090> going<00:02:24.599> to<00:02:24.659> bring<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.900> around<00:02:24.989> the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.970 
might be able to sneak it around back
but<00:02:33.480> Cal<00:02:33.629> being<00:02:33.840> persistent<00:02:34.109> taking<00:02:34.739> it<00:02:34.829> out

but Cal being persistent taking it out
and<00:02:35.760> right<00:02:36.599> now<00:02:36.689> so<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:36.989> basically<00:02:37.170> almost

economy<00:02:43.069> but<00:02:44.069> it<00:02:44.519> looks<00:02:44.790> like<00:02:44.879> as<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.180> can<00:02:45.299> see

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
economy but it looks like as you can see

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.759 
economy but it looks like as you can see
and<00:02:45.629> it<00:02:45.720> looks<00:02:46.019> like<00:02:46.079> any<00:02:46.290> times<00:02:46.500> doing<00:02:46.709> a

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
and it looks like any times doing a

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.009 
and it looks like any times doing a
little<00:02:46.950> bit<00:02:47.099> better<00:02:47.190> job<00:02:47.489> in<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.760> macro

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
little bit better job in the macro

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.670 
little bit better job in the macro
Department<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:49.139> I<00:02:49.200> think<00:02:49.409> that<00:02:49.530> maybe

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
Department and I think that maybe

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.809 
Department and I think that maybe
because<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.159> slight<00:02:50.400> economic

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
because of that slight economic

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.369 
because of that slight economic
advantage<00:02:51.180> he's<00:02:51.659> still<00:02:51.840> waiting<00:02:51.989> around<00:02:52.170> and

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
advantage he's still waiting around and

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.170 
advantage he's still waiting around and
back<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.650> see<00:02:52.769> if<00:02:52.799> any<00:02:53.010> other<00:02:53.250> observers<00:02:53.879> looks

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
back to see if any other observers looks

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.599 
back to see if any other observers looks
like<00:02:54.329> push<00:02:54.540> around<00:02:54.659> both<00:02:55.530> players<00:02:55.799> being

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
like push around both players being

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.129 
like push around both players being
essentially<00:02:57.150> mirrored<00:02:57.420> at<00:02:57.510> this<00:02:57.629> point<00:02:57.900> and

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
essentially mirrored at this point and

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.660 
essentially mirrored at this point and
this<00:02:58.500> is<00:02:58.769> I<00:02:58.920> think<00:02:59.010> going<00:02:59.189> to<00:02:59.280> be<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.430> decisive

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
this is I think going to be the decisive

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.059 
this is I think going to be the decisive
factor<00:02:59.879> right<00:03:00.269> here<00:03:00.599> these<00:03:01.379> two<00:03:01.439> Weaver's<00:03:01.920> so

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
factor right here these two Weaver's so

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.319 
factor right here these two Weaver's so
it<00:03:02.159> looks<00:03:02.310> like<00:03:02.370> any<00:03:02.579> time<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.879> going<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.090> push

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
it looks like any time is going to push

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.140 
it looks like any time is going to push
up<00:03:03.680> at<00:03:04.680> any<00:03:04.920> time<00:03:05.159> pushing<00:03:05.370> down<00:03:05.639> at<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.879> exact

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
up at any time pushing down at the exact

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.849 
up at any time pushing down at the exact
same<00:03:06.359> moment<00:03:06.569> and<00:03:06.930> he<00:03:07.079> has<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.200> dropship<00:03:07.620> out<00:03:07.739> as

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
same moment and he has a dropship out as

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.309 
same moment and he has a dropship out as
well<00:03:08.040> so<00:03:08.670> both<00:03:08.849> players<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.930> can<00:03:10.079> see<00:03:10.290> just

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
well so both players you can see just

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.410 
well so both players you can see just
the<00:03:10.650> pro<00:03:10.829> gaming<00:03:11.069> instinct<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:11.970> now<00:03:12.090> big

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
the pro gaming instinct and now big

of<00:04:06.299> dragoons<00:04:06.629> and<00:04:06.810> he<00:04:06.870> might<00:04:07.049> be<00:04:07.139> able<00:04:07.199> to<00:04:07.290> get

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
of dragoons and he might be able to get

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:08.899

a<00:04:07.440> couple<00:04:07.680> shots<00:04:07.709> off<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:08.250> secondary<00:04:08.760> we'll

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
a couple shots off the secondary we'll

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.610 
a couple shots off the secondary we'll
see<00:04:09.060> what<00:04:09.449> happens<00:04:09.569> in<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.870> reforms<00:04:10.440> come

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
see what happens in the reforms come

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.979 
see what happens in the reforms come
back<00:04:10.769> in<00:04:10.949> probes<00:04:11.400> coming<00:04:11.699> off<00:04:11.790> Cal's<00:04:12.090> line<00:04:12.389> to

a precious probes and that's going to

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.819 
a precious probes and that's going to
that<00:04:18.510> that'll<00:04:18.989> be<00:04:19.109> probably<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.500> difference

a couple Dark Templar in hopes and maybe

can<00:04:49.660> take<00:04:49.840> down<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.110> observers<00:04:50.530> of<00:04:50.740> any<00:04:51.070> time

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
can take down the observers of any time

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.770 
can take down the observers of any time
any<00:04:51.430> time<00:04:51.490> producing<00:04:51.970> two<00:04:52.150> more<00:04:52.300> weavers<00:04:52.600> I

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
any time producing two more weavers I

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.210 
any time producing two more weavers I
think<00:04:53.230> you<00:04:53.320> saved<00:04:53.470> the<00:04:53.590> drop<00:04:53.800> ship<00:04:53.980> so<00:04:54.100> we

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
think you saved the drop ship so we

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.820 
think you saved the drop ship so we
might<00:04:54.400> bring<00:04:54.639> the<00:04:54.730> dropship<00:04:55.150> back<00:04:55.330> around<00:04:55.830> as

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
might bring the dropship back around as

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.110 
might bring the dropship back around as
you<00:04:57.010> can<00:04:57.100> see<00:04:57.190> that<00:04:57.220> dark<00:04:57.520> temper<00:04:57.850> archive

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.909 
you can see that dark temper archive
being<00:04:58.360> highlighted<00:04:58.930> he<00:04:59.200> has<00:04:59.320> another<00:04:59.590> Weaver

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
little bit if any time doesn't dedicate

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:41.100 
little bit if any time doesn't dedicate
a<00:05:39.760> few<00:05:39.940> troops<00:05:40.150> in<00:05:40.300> the<00:05:40.330> background<00:05:40.690> no

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
a few troops in the background no

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.440 
a few troops in the background no
unfortunately<00:05:41.650> cannon<00:05:42.400> going<00:05:42.520> down<00:05:42.789> for

unfortunately cannon going down for

unfortunately cannon going down for
anytime<00:05:43.900> in<00:05:44.200> the<00:05:44.229> background<00:05:44.680> so<00:05:44.860> those<00:05:45.010> dark

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
anytime in the background so those dark

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.290 
anytime in the background so those dark
templar<00:05:45.520> effectively<00:05:46.030> going<00:05:46.150> to<00:05:46.210> be

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
templar effectively going to be

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.469 
templar effectively going to be
neutralized<00:05:46.750> in<00:05:47.740> my<00:05:48.010> opinion<00:05:48.280> maybe<00:05:48.970> wondered

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
neutralized in my opinion maybe wondered

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:50.730 
neutralized in my opinion maybe wondered
and<00:05:49.570> we'll<00:05:49.720> see<00:05:49.840> if<00:05:49.870> those<00:05:49.990> cannons<00:05:50.350> get<00:05:50.530> up<00:05:50.620> in

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
and we'll see if those cannons get up in

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.050 
and we'll see if those cannons get up in
time<00:05:50.860> i<00:05:50.919> think<00:05:51.220> they<00:05:51.310> will<00:05:51.460> be<00:05:51.550> at<00:05:51.669> least<00:05:51.789> one

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
time i think they will be at least one

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.760 
time i think they will be at least one
will<00:05:52.240> probably<00:05:52.990> the<00:05:53.229> second<00:05:53.530> and<00:05:53.650> that's

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
will probably the second and that's

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:54.900 
will probably the second and that's
really<00:05:53.950> going<00:05:54.100> to<00:05:54.160> neutralize<00:05:54.550> that<00:05:54.580> attack

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
really going to neutralize that attack

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.070 
really going to neutralize that attack
so<00:05:55.060> any<00:05:55.180> time<00:05:55.300> going<00:05:55.479> to<00:05:55.570> be<00:05:55.660> free<00:05:55.810> to<00:05:55.900> push

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
so any time going to be free to push

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.690 
so any time going to be free to push
into<00:05:56.260> cal<00:05:56.500> space<00:05:56.710> we'll<00:05:57.280> see<00:05:57.400> if<00:05:57.460> a<00:05:57.550> single

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
into cal space we'll see if a single

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.150 
into cal space we'll see if a single
dragons<00:05:58.090> but<00:05:58.389> kind<00:05:58.870> of<00:05:58.930> pushes<00:05:59.590> back<00:05:59.740> to<00:05:59.950> sign
