the height of the object the other two
are<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.390> left<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.200> right<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.619> forward<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
are for left and right and forward and

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.859 
are for left and right and forward and
backwards<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:38.970> necessarily<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.750> order

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
backwards not necessarily in that order

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.460 
backwards not necessarily in that order
I<00:01:40.670> just<00:01:41.670> find<00:01:41.850> 1.5<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.720> probably<00:01:43.079> about<00:01:43.170> right

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
I just find 1.5 is probably about right

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.590 
I just find 1.5 is probably about right
maybe<00:01:43.770> 1.8<00:01:44.579> actually<00:01:45.180> we'll<00:01:45.329> see<00:01:45.479> how<00:01:45.540> that

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
maybe 1.8 actually we'll see how that

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.359 
maybe 1.8 actually we'll see how that
works<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.170> then<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.040> right<00:01:47.970> brackets<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:49.369> hit

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
works and then to right brackets and hit

00:01:50.369 --> 00:02:00.280 
works and then to right brackets and hit
OK<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.320> we<00:01:52.320> will<00:01:52.530> preview<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.130> now

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.990 

third<00:02:00.470> person<00:02:00.860> you<00:02:00.980> can<00:02:01.130> see<00:02:01.400> that<00:02:01.430> the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
third person you can see that the

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.500 
third person you can see that the
machine<00:02:02.750> gunner<00:02:02.960> has<00:02:03.230> spawned<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:04.510> appears

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
machine gunner has spawned and appears

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.050 
machine gunner has spawned and appears
to<00:02:05.660> be<00:02:05.750> parented<00:02:06.290> to<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:07.100> top<00:02:07.340> of<00:02:07.370> the<00:02:07.520> jet<00:02:07.880> we

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
to be parented to the top of the jet we

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:16.009 
to be parented to the top of the jet we
will<00:02:08.240> test<00:02:08.600> it<00:02:08.690> out<00:02:08.810> now

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:24.050 

seems<00:02:17.019> to<00:02:17.140> be<00:02:17.260> sticking<00:02:17.680> with<00:02:17.829> it

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.230 

you

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.820 

he<00:02:30.240> may<00:02:30.540> fall<00:02:30.780> out<00:02:30.990> when<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.200> turn<00:02:31.440> upside<00:02:31.800> down

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
he may fall out when I turn upside down

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.050 
he may fall out when I turn upside down
that<00:02:32.220> seems<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.700> happen<00:02:32.850> sometimes<00:02:34.790> but<00:02:35.790> not

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
that seems to happen sometimes but not

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.320 
that seems to happen sometimes but not
the<00:02:36.270> case<00:02:36.480> this<00:02:36.720> time<00:02:37.730> but<00:02:38.730> if<00:02:38.820> it<00:02:38.940> does<00:02:39.120> happen

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
the case this time but if it does happen

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.280 
the case this time but if it does happen
don't<00:02:39.690> be<00:02:39.840> surprised<00:02:42.110> thanks<00:02:43.110> for<00:02:43.260> watching

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
don't be surprised thanks for watching

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.830 
don't be surprised thanks for watching
that<00:02:43.710> seems<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.220> pretty<00:02:44.460> much<00:02:44.610> sum<00:02:45.570> everything

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
that seems to pretty much sum everything

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.140 
that seems to pretty much sum everything
up
