00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
with a clean face i'm applying my primal

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.289 
with a clean face i'm applying my primal
to<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.920> perfectly<00:01:08.100> honest<00:01:08.670> i<00:01:08.820> don't<00:01:08.880> know<00:01:09.060> if

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
to be perfectly honest i don't know if

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.230 
to be perfectly honest i don't know if
this<00:01:09.450> thing<00:01:09.689> even<00:01:09.869> does<00:01:10.259> anything<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:11.460> me<00:01:11.700> but

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
this thing even does anything for me but

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.179 
this thing even does anything for me but
I'm<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.630> habit<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:13.020> doing<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.680> I'm<00:01:13.950> just

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
I'm in the habit of doing it so I'm just

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.669 
I'm in the habit of doing it so I'm just
going<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.430> continue<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:15.119> for<00:01:15.960> foundation<00:01:16.530> as

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
going to continue and for foundation as

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:18.109 
going to continue and for foundation as
you<00:01:16.829> can<00:01:16.950> see<00:01:17.130> I'm<00:01:17.219> faked<00:01:17.429> and<00:01:17.700> at<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.969> moment

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
you can see I'm faked and at the moment

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.029 
you can see I'm faked and at the moment
so<00:01:18.420> I'm<00:01:18.630> mixing<00:01:19.020> together<00:01:19.200> two<00:01:19.649> of<00:01:19.859> my

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
so I'm mixing together two of my

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:21.919 
so I'm mixing together two of my
favorite<00:01:20.399> foundations<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.270> get<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> perfect

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929 
favorite foundations to get the perfect

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:24.830 
favorite foundations to get the perfect
shade<00:01:22.439> for<00:01:22.469> me<00:01:22.859> and<00:01:23.130> obviously<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.390> probably

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
shade for me and obviously this probably

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.330 
shade for me and obviously this probably
isn't<00:01:25.079> the<00:01:25.229> way<00:01:25.320> most<00:01:25.530> people<00:01:25.679> apply<00:01:26.159> their

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
isn't the way most people apply their

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.550 
isn't the way most people apply their
foundation<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.119> kind<00:01:27.539> of<00:01:27.659> dotted<00:01:27.960> around<00:01:28.079> and

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
foundation I kind of dotted around and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.410 
foundation I kind of dotted around and
then<00:01:28.710> spread<00:01:29.069> it<00:01:29.130> out<00:01:29.369> with<00:01:29.579> my<00:01:29.789> fingers<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
then spread it out with my fingers and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.510 
then spread it out with my fingers and
that<00:01:31.079> leaves<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.590> really<00:01:31.950> really<00:01:32.310> bad

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
that leaves like a really really bad

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.969 
that leaves like a really really bad
finish<00:01:32.969> so<00:01:33.359> then<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.960> go<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.289> with<00:01:34.499> my<00:01:34.679> Beauty
