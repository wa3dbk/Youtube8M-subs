00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.200
 knowledge of what photography is 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.599
 picture first look useless and 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.700
 too theoretically myself so earlier 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.770
 considered but still think that some 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.599
 theory is necessary because it gives the base and 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.360
 understanding of basic fundamental 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.740
 principles without which I simply have nowhere 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.990
 I will try to explain everything as much as possible 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.689
 brief and to the point but how is it with me 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.820
 you will judge and so the word itself 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.860
 photography as wikipedia tells us 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.860
 translated from Greek as 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.510
 light painting that is drawing with light we 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.969
 you see items due to the fact that 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.399
 the light falling on them is reflected then we 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.170
 fixed by the retina of our eyes it all 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.300
 we used to go with you in school 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.910
 course of optical physics who is now about 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.609
 I remember this because the camera is on 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.449
 a similar situation actually occurs 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.129
 reflected light is fixed on 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.079
 photosensitive material for example 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.420
 on a film or on a digital matrix 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.100
 the camera now I will talk in words about 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.170
 the process of receiving photos 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.940
 this is how this information will be useful for 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.830
 full understanding of the algorithm 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.140
 camera but that in turn 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.369
 will allow us to grasp more seriously the whole 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.500
 photographing process 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.330
 I 'll start the very beginnings 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.920
 occurrence of photographs 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.380
 the fact is that the progenitors of modern 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.060
 Cameras were very simple devices. 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.130
 essentially the same principles 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.680
 used to this day in the most 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.659
 modern and most sophisticated 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.090
 cameras and so began with the camera 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.820
 pinhole obscura is not a man how can 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.619
 think and the name of the camera obscura is 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.710
 Latin phrases which 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.240
 translated as dark room 1 camera 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.579
 really were dark 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.780
 rooms or large drawers with small 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.570
 a hole in one wall 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.490
 rays of light passing through this little 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.799
 hole and created an image on 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.540
 opposite wall 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.189
 when I was in the photo museum in riga then 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.250
 live hit the real 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.079
 pinhole camera it was a small dark 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.729
 room in one wall which was 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.590
 made a small hole literally 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.969
 several millimeters in diameter 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.619
 the opposites she room 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.420
 an inverted image was projected 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.000
 buildings that were located on 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.400
 opposite street image in 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.290
 camera and soon i'm not usually very sharp 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.200
 but it is enough to 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.370
 recognize the contours and shapes of objects 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.870
 who are outside 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.879
 this feature of reflected light 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.250
 noticed a long time ago in some kind there 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.900
 century BC but they say what 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.060
 Leonardo da Vinci became the first 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.610
 use the camera obscura to create 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.650
 sketches he just took and copied 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.400
 reflected image circling it 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.610
 a pencil 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.140
 but in the 18th century, chemists discovered that 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.769
 certain substances under the influence 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.440
 Sveta 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.360
 changes its properties and color like this in 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.459
 early 19th century using 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.260
 photosensitive chemistry turned out 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.209
 make the first fixed on the copper 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.790
 image plates ie first 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.010
 photo on the copper plate inflicted and 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.769
 photosensitive emulsion and by 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.870
 pinhole cameras got fixed 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.430
 image is essentially a principle 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.680
 photographing since no way 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.480
 changed the hole in the wall became 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.609
 Lens prototype well, and in the 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.560
 the opposite wall to which earlier 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.120
 project the image afterwards 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.209
 placed the photosensitive element 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.549
 who was able to remember this 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.750
 most reflected image first in 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.760
 as a photosensitive element 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.709
 used a copper plate with 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.370
 applied to it and photosensitive 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.109
 emulsions 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.109
 then a photosensitive element 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:29.540
 began to act film but now 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:32.120
 matrices of digital cameras so 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.620
 summarize the above camera 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.959
 fixed on the photosensitive layer 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.180
 real display of objects in essence 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.250
 its he is not much different from the usual 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.049
 pinhole cameras or rather to say it 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.769
 just an advanced camera 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.419
 pinhole 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.510
 a little later we will consider 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:48.680
 device of modern cameras and 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.730
 information from this video lesson to us 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.730
 will be very helpful
