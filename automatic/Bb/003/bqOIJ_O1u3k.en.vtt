our<00:00:09.050> theme<00:00:09.290> of<00:00:09.349> looking<00:00:09.769> at<00:00:09.889> some<00:00:10.070> traditional

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
our theme of looking at some traditional

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.880 
our theme of looking at some traditional
origami<00:00:10.910> and<00:00:11.390> we're<00:00:11.480> going<00:00:11.660> to<00:00:11.780> make<00:00:11.900> a<00:00:12.140> frog

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:12.890 
origami and we're going to make a frog

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.620 
origami and we're going to make a frog
and<00:00:13.160> this<00:00:13.670> frog<00:00:13.910> is<00:00:13.940> actually<00:00:14.510> I<00:00:14.540> think

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
and this frog is actually I think

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.040 
and this frog is actually I think
Chinese<00:00:15.500> in<00:00:15.679> origin<00:00:15.939> it's<00:00:16.939> it's<00:00:17.449> said<00:00:17.869> to<00:00:17.900> be

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
Chinese in origin it's it's said to be

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.659 
Chinese in origin it's it's said to be
kind<00:00:18.349> of<00:00:18.439> like<00:00:18.560> a<00:00:18.590> jumping<00:00:18.949> frog<00:00:19.369> but<00:00:19.519> I'd

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:19.669 
kind of like a jumping frog but I'd

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.729 
kind of like a jumping frog but I'd
probably<00:00:19.880> just<00:00:20.119> say<00:00:20.329> a<00:00:20.359> moving<00:00:21.230> frog<00:00:21.529> because

00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:21.739 
probably just say a moving frog because

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.859 
probably just say a moving frog because
it<00:00:21.980> kind<00:00:22.159> of<00:00:22.220> just<00:00:22.369> glides<00:00:22.939> more<00:00:23.599> than<00:00:23.749> it

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
it kind of just glides more than it

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.630 
it kind of just glides more than it
jumps<00:00:24.230> depending<00:00:24.769> on<00:00:24.890> how<00:00:25.279> you're<00:00:25.429> doing

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
jumps depending on how you're doing

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.579 
jumps depending on how you're doing
things<00:00:25.849> but<00:00:26.089> it<00:00:26.659> is<00:00:26.839> sort<00:00:27.109> of<00:00:27.140> an<00:00:27.259> action

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:27.589 
things but it is sort of an action

specific size for a pet specialty r with
your<00:00:48.860> color<00:00:49.190> side<00:00:49.520> facing<00:00:50.030> down<00:00:50.060> and<00:00:50.540> I<00:00:50.960> just

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
your color side facing down and I just

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.870 
your color side facing down and I just
need<00:00:51.350> some<00:00:51.590> preliminary<00:00:52.160> creases<00:00:52.640> in<00:00:52.790> my

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
need some preliminary creases in my

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.290 
need some preliminary creases in my
paper<00:00:53.120> by<00:00:53.420> folding<00:00:53.990> and<00:00:54.260> half<00:00:55.000> vertically<00:00:56.000> and

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
paper by folding and half vertically and

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.300 
paper by folding and half vertically and
horizontally<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:57.350> then<00:00:58.010> what<00:00:58.160> we're<00:00:58.250> going

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
horizontally and then what we're going

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.440 
horizontally and then what we're going
to<00:00:58.460> do<00:00:58.610> is<00:00:58.940> get<00:00:59.360> to<00:00:59.600> a<00:00:59.630> blintz<00:01:00.350> base<00:01:01.030> by<00:01:02.030> folding

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
to do is get to a blintz base by folding

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.999 
to do is get to a blintz base by folding
all<00:01:02.600> these<00:01:02.750> points<00:01:03.050> in<00:01:03.320> so<00:01:03.560> I'll<00:01:03.680> get<00:01:03.800> these

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
all these points in so I'll get these

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.429 
all these points in so I'll get these
two<00:01:04.250> creases<00:01:04.489> started<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:05.420> then<00:01:06.259> we're<00:01:06.350> going

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
two creases started and then we're going

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.260 
two creases started and then we're going
to<00:01:06.500> take<00:01:06.619> each<00:01:06.829> of<00:01:07.159> the<00:01:07.189> four<00:01:07.490> corners<00:01:08.060> and

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
to take each of the four corners and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.959 
to take each of the four corners and
fold<00:01:08.569> into<00:01:08.929> the<00:01:09.590> center<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:10.460> you<00:01:10.579> can<00:01:10.759> use

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:10.969 
fold into the center and you can use

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:13.209 
fold into the center and you can use
those<00:01:11.149> creases<00:01:11.539> on<00:01:11.960> either<00:01:12.229> side<00:01:12.649> as<00:01:12.859> a<00:01:12.890> guide

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
those creases on either side as a guide

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.309 
those creases on either side as a guide
keep<00:01:13.969> your<00:01:14.119> little<00:01:14.240> triangle<00:01:14.780> within<00:01:15.109> that

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:15.319 
keep your little triangle within that

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:18.219 
keep your little triangle within that
those<00:01:15.770> two<00:01:16.069> creases<00:01:16.340> of<00:01:16.549> course<00:01:16.969> so<00:01:17.899> get<00:01:18.109> all

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
those two creases of course so get all

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.349 
those two creases of course so get all
four<00:01:18.590> of<00:01:18.619> these<00:01:18.859> corners<00:01:19.490> fold<00:01:19.789> it<00:01:19.969> into<00:01:20.119> the

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:20.359 
four of these corners fold it into the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:30.800 
four of these corners fold it into the
middle

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.390 

so<00:01:31.810> you<00:01:31.930> get<00:01:32.080> a<00:01:32.110> nice<00:01:32.290> little<00:01:32.590> square<00:01:33.040> shape

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
so you get a nice little square shape

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.910 
so you get a nice little square shape
like<00:01:33.640> this<00:01:33.870> I'm<00:01:34.870> going<00:01:35.050> to<00:01:35.110> flip<00:01:35.290> it<00:01:35.350> over<00:01:35.560> for

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
like this I'm going to flip it over for

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.330 
like this I'm going to flip it over for
a<00:01:35.950> second<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.660> I<00:01:37.660> want<00:01:38.020> to<00:01:38.140> go<00:01:38.260> ahead<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:38.860> take

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
a second and I want to go ahead and take

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.620 
a second and I want to go ahead and take
and<00:01:39.700> fold<00:01:40.650> two<00:01:41.650> of<00:01:41.890> these<00:01:42.040> corners<00:01:42.730> towards

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
and fold two of these corners towards

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.810 
and fold two of these corners towards
the<00:01:43.870> center<00:01:44.230> I<00:01:45.270> keep<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:47.310> center<00:01:48.310> line<00:01:48.550> in

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
the center I keep the center line in

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.020 
the center I keep the center line in
mind<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.390> fold<00:01:49.630> both<00:01:49.780> of<00:01:49.990> these<00:01:50.110> in<00:01:53.940> so<00:01:54.940> you

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
mind and fold both of these in so you

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.630 
mind and fold both of these in so you
get<00:01:55.120> something<00:01:55.390> that<00:01:55.570> looks<00:01:55.750> like<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:56.080> house

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
get something that looks like a house

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.490 
get something that looks like a house
flip<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:57.790> back<00:01:57.940> over<00:01:58.120> again<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:58.900> I'm<00:01:59.230> going<00:01:59.350> to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
flip it back over again and I'm going to

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.890 
flip it back over again and I'm going to
take<00:01:59.740> each<00:01:59.980> of<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.250> outer<00:02:00.520> edges<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.480> fold

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
take each of the outer edges and fold

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.440 
take each of the outer edges and fold
them<00:02:02.020> in<00:02:02.230> to<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.100> center<00:02:03.460> now<00:02:04.060> you're<00:02:04.330> going

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
them in to the center now you're going

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.900 
them in to the center now you're going
to<00:02:04.540> be<00:02:04.690> creating<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.560> crease<00:02:05.890> an<00:02:06.190> edge<00:02:06.640> right

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
to be creating a crease an edge right

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.220 
to be creating a crease an edge right
here<00:02:06.970> that's<00:02:07.330> even<00:02:07.690> with<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.930> edge<00:02:08.080> of<00:02:08.170> that

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.230 
here that's even with the edge of that

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.650 
here that's even with the edge of that
paper<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.920> you<00:02:09.460> should<00:02:09.670> keep<00:02:09.910> this<00:02:10.149> bottom

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
paper and you should keep this bottom

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.260 
paper and you should keep this bottom
edge<00:02:10.750> nice<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.470> even<00:02:12.250> with<00:02:12.520> itself<00:02:12.910> as<00:02:13.150> we

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
edge nice and even with itself as we

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.200 
edge nice and even with itself as we
make<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:13.630> fold<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.770> do<00:02:14.920> both<00:02:15.160> sides<00:02:15.490> just

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
make this fold so do both sides just

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.550 
make this fold so do both sides just
make<00:02:16.390> sure<00:02:16.420> everything's<00:02:16.840> nice<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.110> smooth

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
make sure everything's nice and smooth

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.080 
make sure everything's nice and smooth
there's<00:02:17.800> a<00:02:17.890> little<00:02:18.070> bit<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.310> layers<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.910> paper

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
there's a little bit of layers of paper

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.370 
there's a little bit of layers of paper
here<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:19.660> you<00:02:19.720> want<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.960> try<00:02:20.080> make<00:02:20.260> sure

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
here so you want to try make sure

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.750 
here so you want to try make sure
everything<00:02:20.680> is<00:02:20.740> nice<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.010> smooth<00:02:21.490> when<00:02:21.700> you

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
everything is nice and smooth when you

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.330 
everything is nice and smooth when you
fold<00:02:21.940> it<00:02:22.090> over<00:02:22.560> then<00:02:23.560> I'm<00:02:23.710> going<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:23.890> take<00:02:24.070> the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
fold it over then I'm going to take the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.940 
fold it over then I'm going to take the
bottom<00:02:24.790> edge<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.510> fold<00:02:25.930> straight<00:02:26.410> up<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:26.800> that

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
bottom edge and fold straight up so that

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.470 
bottom edge and fold straight up so that
that<00:02:27.070> center<00:02:27.520> part<00:02:27.790> gets<00:02:27.940> folded<00:02:28.150> in<00:02:28.450> half

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
that center part gets folded in half

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.410 
that center part gets folded in half
we'll<00:02:29.050> bring<00:02:29.200> that<00:02:29.380> edge<00:02:29.530> right<00:02:29.740> up<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.070> those

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
we'll bring that edge right up to those

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.680 
we'll bring that edge right up to those
bottoms<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.570> those<00:02:31.690> triangles<00:02:32.230> there<00:02:33.690> I'm

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
bottoms of those triangles there I'm

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.480 
bottoms of those triangles there I'm
going<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:34.930> take<00:02:35.020> each<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.440> these<00:02:35.560> flaps<00:02:36.040> and

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
going to take each of these flaps and

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:44.250 
going to take each of these flaps and
fold<00:02:36.850> them<00:02:37.060> down<00:02:37.120> creating<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.320> triangle<00:02:43.260> now

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
fold them down creating a triangle now

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.080 
fold them down creating a triangle now
that<00:02:44.380> I've<00:02:44.470> got<00:02:44.650> both<00:02:44.860> of<00:02:44.890> those<00:02:45.190> creases<00:02:45.670> I'm

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
that I've got both of those creases I'm

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.640 
that I've got both of those creases I'm
just<00:02:46.270> going<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.420> pinch<00:02:46.900> right<00:02:47.170> on<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.410> top<00:02:47.620> of

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
just going to pinch right on the top of

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.380 
just going to pinch right on the top of
that<00:02:47.890> triangle<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.459> pull<00:02:48.730> that<00:02:48.910> layer<00:02:49.209> of

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
that triangle and pull that layer of

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.710 
that triangle and pull that layer of
paper<00:02:49.630> free<00:02:50.320> and<00:02:50.700> then<00:02:51.700> once<00:02:52.270> I've<00:02:52.450> done<00:02:52.660> that

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
paper free and then once I've done that

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.449 
paper free and then once I've done that
you<00:02:53.020> can<00:02:53.050> fold<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.620> straight<00:02:53.800> down<00:02:54.130> if<00:02:54.340> you

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
you can fold it straight down if you

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.800 
you can fold it straight down if you
want<00:02:54.580> to<00:02:54.820> i'm<00:02:55.030> going<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.209> do<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.390> same<00:02:55.570> thing

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
want to i'm going to do the same thing

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.260 
want to i'm going to do the same thing
on<00:02:55.930> this<00:02:56.050> side<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.560> pop<00:02:57.160> that<00:02:57.370> layer<00:02:57.580> free<00:02:58.000> and

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
on this side to pop that layer free and

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.780 
on this side to pop that layer free and
then<00:02:59.080> we're<00:02:59.200> going<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.380> take<00:02:59.650> this<00:03:00.190> edge<00:03:00.489> and

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
then we're going to take this edge and

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.720 
then we're going to take this edge and
fold<00:03:01.150> it<00:03:01.330> up<00:03:01.480> instead<00:03:02.260> of<00:03:02.320> down<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.950> you'll<00:03:03.580> be

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
fold it up instead of down and you'll be

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.550 
fold it up instead of down and you'll be
making<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:04.120> new<00:03:04.270> crease<00:03:04.570> they're<00:03:04.810> so<00:03:05.050> smooth<00:03:05.410> it

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
making a new crease they're so smooth it

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.740 
making a new crease they're so smooth it
out<00:03:05.650> really<00:03:05.950> good<00:03:06.100> when<00:03:06.280> you<00:03:06.370> do<00:03:06.520> that<00:03:09.720> get<00:03:10.720> a

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
out really good when you do that get a

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.800 
out really good when you do that get a
nice<00:03:11.020> good<00:03:11.290> crease<00:03:11.620> going<00:03:12.420> then<00:03:13.420> I'm<00:03:13.600> going<00:03:13.720> to

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
nice good crease going then I'm going to

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.070 
nice good crease going then I'm going to
flip<00:03:13.959> everything<00:03:14.290> over<00:03:14.770> and<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:16.209> want<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.750> take

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
flip everything over and I want to take

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.160 
flip everything over and I want to take
up<00:03:17.410> here<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.280> take<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.270> flap<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:19.570> you<00:03:19.959> see

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
up here and take the flap that you see

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
and fold it straight up so that we get a

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.410 
and fold it straight up so that we get a
nice<00:03:23.860> little<00:03:24.130> triangle<00:03:24.730> shape<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.209> I'll<00:03:25.300> do

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
nice little triangle shape and I'll do

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.270 
nice little triangle shape and I'll do
the<00:03:25.480> same<00:03:25.570> thing<00:03:26.020> on<00:03:26.140> this<00:03:26.290> side<00:03:29.040> open<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.160> back

the same thing on this side open it back

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.910 
the same thing on this side open it back
out<00:03:30.550> and<00:03:30.910> I'm<00:03:31.420> going<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.630> take<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.410> area<00:03:32.800> that

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
out and I'm going to take the area that

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.500 
out and I'm going to take the area that
you<00:03:33.070> see<00:03:33.250> here<00:03:33.370> there's<00:03:33.550> a<00:03:33.610> seam<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.239> paper

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
you see here there's a seam of paper

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.150 
you see here there's a seam of paper
here<00:03:34.870> I'm<00:03:34.930> going<00:03:35.020> to<00:03:35.110> open<00:03:35.260> up<00:03:35.530> both<00:03:35.739> of<00:03:35.800> these

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
here I'm going to open up both of these

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.540 
here I'm going to open up both of these
pockets<00:03:36.760> from<00:03:36.910> either<00:03:37.120> so

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
pockets from either so

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.060 
pockets from either so
if<00:03:37.640> you<00:03:37.760> can<00:03:38.000> kind<00:03:38.300> of<00:03:38.330> get<00:03:38.480> it<00:03:38.570> started<00:03:39.070> once

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
if you can kind of get it started once

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
you get both of them opened up a little

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.210 
you get both of them opened up a little
you<00:03:42.020> can<00:03:42.140> put<00:03:42.320> a<00:03:42.350> little<00:03:42.500> pressure<00:03:42.710> on<00:03:42.980> that

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
you can put a little pressure on that

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.540 
you can put a little pressure on that
tip<00:03:43.550> push<00:03:44.360> straight<00:03:44.900> up<00:03:45.110> what<00:03:45.980> we<00:03:46.100> want<00:03:46.280> to<00:03:46.370> do

tip push straight up what we want to do

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.280 
tip push straight up what we want to do
is<00:03:46.760> push<00:03:47.000> straight<00:03:47.390> up<00:03:47.540> so<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:47.870> that<00:03:48.020> edge

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
is push straight up so that that edge

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.950

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.690 
lines up at the top here this side
should<00:03:51.170> smush<00:03:51.470> down<00:03:51.680> fairly<00:03:51.980> easily<00:03:52.250> because

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
should smush down fairly easily because

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.160 
should smush down fairly easily because
of<00:03:52.850> the<00:03:52.940> edge<00:03:53.060> there<00:03:53.360> and<00:03:53.540> there<00:03:53.690> is<00:03:53.720> an<00:03:54.020> edge

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
of the edge there and there is an edge

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.810 
of the edge there and there is an edge
here<00:03:54.500> too<00:03:54.710> you<00:03:55.070> just<00:03:55.250> need<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.520> make<00:03:55.610> sure<00:03:55.670> that

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
here too you just need to make sure that

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.700 
here too you just need to make sure that
the<00:03:56.090> paper<00:03:56.300> gets<00:03:56.630> smoothed<00:03:57.050> out<00:03:57.230> so<00:03:57.500> we<00:03:57.560> can

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
the paper gets smoothed out so we can

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.560 
the paper gets smoothed out so we can
get<00:03:57.800> that<00:03:57.980> nice<00:03:58.160> little<00:03:58.400> rectangle<00:03:59.180> of<00:03:59.300> shape

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
get that nice little rectangle of shape

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.630 
get that nice little rectangle of shape
I'm<00:04:00.380> going<00:04:00.560> to<00:04:00.650> do<00:04:00.800> the<00:04:00.920> same<00:04:01.160> thing<00:04:01.400> on<00:04:01.520> this

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
I'm going to do the same thing on this

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.920 
I'm going to do the same thing on this
side<00:04:01.700> so<00:04:01.910> again<00:04:02.090> I'm<00:04:02.300> just<00:04:02.390> kind<00:04:02.600> of<00:04:02.630> popping

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
side so again I'm just kind of popping

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.980 
side so again I'm just kind of popping
open<00:04:03.200> these<00:04:03.530> air<00:04:03.860> pockets<00:04:03.970> on<00:04:04.970> the<00:04:05.030> sides

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
open these air pockets on the sides

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.160 
open these air pockets on the sides
pushing<00:04:06.650> straight<00:04:07.340> up<00:04:07.580> and<00:04:07.850> smashing<00:04:08.810> down

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
pushing straight up and smashing down

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.200 
pushing straight up and smashing down
and<00:04:09.470> just<00:04:09.950> make<00:04:10.160> sure<00:04:10.430> on<00:04:10.610> this<00:04:10.790> one<00:04:10.850> that

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
and just make sure on this one that

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.780 
and just make sure on this one that
you're<00:04:11.330> really<00:04:11.630> getting<00:04:12.050> this<00:04:12.200> part<00:04:12.790> pulled

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
you're really getting this part pulled

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.090 
you're really getting this part pulled
up<00:04:14.060> again<00:04:15.050> so<00:04:15.350> that<00:04:15.380> you're<00:04:15.620> getting<00:04:15.710> a<00:04:15.920> nice

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
up again so that you're getting a nice

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.949 
up again so that you're getting a nice
crease<00:04:16.430> it<00:04:16.609> goes<00:04:16.760> right<00:04:16.970> into<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.450> corner

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
crease it goes right into the corner

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.820 
crease it goes right into the corner
there<00:04:19.630> so<00:04:20.630> you<00:04:20.720> get<00:04:20.810> two<00:04:20.989> little<00:04:21.260> rectangles

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
there so you get two little rectangles

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.280 
there so you get two little rectangles
on<00:04:22.010> either<00:04:22.280> side<00:04:22.670> and<00:04:22.940> that<00:04:23.690> is<00:04:23.990> our<00:04:24.140> little

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
on either side and that is our little

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.590 
on either side and that is our little
finish<00:04:24.620> froggy<00:04:24.920> and<00:04:25.190> then<00:04:25.610> if<00:04:25.940> you<00:04:26.120> give<00:04:26.330> him<00:04:26.480> a

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
finish froggy and then if you give him a

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.170 
finish froggy and then if you give him a
good<00:04:26.780> little<00:04:27.020> bit<00:04:27.290> of<00:04:27.440> air<00:04:28.250> from<00:04:28.610> underneath<00:04:28.880> I

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
good little bit of air from underneath I

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.910 
good little bit of air from underneath I
had<00:04:29.360> a<00:04:29.390> peek<00:04:29.600> in<00:04:29.750> him<00:04:29.870> at<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.110> right<00:04:30.290> angle<00:04:30.320> he

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
had a peek in him at the right angle he

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.600 
had a peek in him at the right angle he
might<00:04:31.100> jump<00:04:31.370> let's<00:04:31.610> see<00:04:32.320> okay<00:04:33.320> he<00:04:33.500> just

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
might jump let's see okay he just

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.640 
might jump let's see okay he just
scooted<00:04:34.610> really<00:04:34.910> fast<00:04:35.150> so<00:04:35.510> I<00:04:35.540> don't<00:04:36.140> know<00:04:36.320> you

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
scooted really fast so I don't know you

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.010 
scooted really fast so I don't know you
can<00:04:36.860> get<00:04:37.070> him<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.390> actually<00:04:38.390> jump<00:04:38.660> I<00:04:38.840> think

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
can get him to actually jump I think

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.330 
can get him to actually jump I think
it's<00:04:39.110> more<00:04:39.170> of<00:04:39.320> a<00:04:39.410> scooting<00:04:39.890> frog<00:04:40.130> than

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
it's more of a scooting frog than

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.180 
it's more of a scooting frog than
anything<00:04:40.700> so<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.750> basic<00:04:42.440> dimensions<00:04:42.770> for

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
anything so the basic dimensions for

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.390 
anything so the basic dimensions for
this<00:04:43.400> guy<00:04:43.669> are<00:04:43.940> about<00:04:44.390> 10<00:04:45.169> centimeters<00:04:45.530> wide

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
this guy are about 10 centimeters wide

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:55.840 
this guy are about 10 centimeters wide
and<00:04:47.000> about<00:04:47.690> eight<00:04:48.020> centimeters<00:04:48.740> long<00:04:49.040> and<00:04:54.850> you

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
and about eight centimeters long and you

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.000 
and about eight centimeters long and you
can<00:04:56.030> definitely<00:04:56.180> play<00:04:57.140> around<00:04:57.380> with<00:04:57.590> this<00:04:57.740> and

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
can definitely play around with this and

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.520 
can definitely play around with this and
make<00:04:58.730> different<00:04:59.210> sizes<00:04:59.630> and<00:04:59.660> see<00:05:00.110> which<00:05:00.290> one's

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
make different sizes and see which one's

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.830

go farther you have little small ones

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.320 
go farther you have little small ones
move<00:05:03.050> more<00:05:03.320> or<00:05:03.590> bigger<00:05:03.890> ones<00:05:04.160> move<00:05:04.430> more<00:05:04.700> can

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
move more or bigger ones move more can

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.909 
move more or bigger ones move more can
