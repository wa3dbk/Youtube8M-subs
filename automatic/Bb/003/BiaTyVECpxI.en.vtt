hey guys are from over geeks we're down

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.290 
hey guys are from over geeks we're down
on<00:00:06.509> time<00:00:06.870> here<00:00:07.080> at<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.259> HTC<00:00:07.620> One<00:00:08.040> e8<00:00:08.820> lounge

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300

event<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:09.990> we<00:00:10.050> will<00:00:10.110> have<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.500> do<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.889> quick

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
event and we will have to do a quick

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.520 
event and we will have to do a quick
comparison<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.330> new<00:00:12.480> HTC<00:00:12.900> One<00:00:13.230> II<00:00:13.259> eight

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
comparison of the new HTC One II eight

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.760 
comparison of the new HTC One II eight
and<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:14.250> Samsung<00:00:14.759> Galaxy<00:00:15.360> s5<00:00:16.049> because<00:00:16.470> these

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
and the Samsung Galaxy s5 because these

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.870 
and the Samsung Galaxy s5 because these
are<00:00:16.949> definitely<00:00:17.039> phones<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.789> are

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
are definitely phones that are

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.880 
are definitely phones that are
comparable<00:00:18.270> because<00:00:19.109> they<00:00:19.260> are<00:00:19.350> also<00:00:19.470> based

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
comparable because they are also based

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.330 
comparable because they are also based
on<00:00:20.220> exactly<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.600> same<00:00:21.630> SOC<00:00:22.560> which<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.189> the

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
on exactly the same SOC which is the

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.089 
on exactly the same SOC which is the
Qualcomm<00:00:23.820> Snapdragon<00:00:24.109> 801<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.070> a

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 so this is a

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.570 
Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 so this is a
quad-core<00:00:26.630> SOC<00:00:27.630> clocked<00:00:28.199> at<00:00:28.500> 2.5<00:00:29.039> years<00:00:29.070> in

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
yeah but actually it doesn't really

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.010 
yeah but actually it doesn't really
matter<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.149> can<00:00:51.329> upgrade<00:00:51.570> both

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
matter because you can upgrade both

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.400
