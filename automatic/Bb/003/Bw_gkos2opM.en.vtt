00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
camera clip itself so how this works is

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.240 
camera clip itself so how this works is
it's<00:01:38.440> got<00:01:38.590> these<00:01:38.770> two<00:01:39.510> bolts<00:01:40.510> here<00:01:41.170> which<00:01:42.130> you

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
it's got these two bolts here which you

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.030 
it's got these two bolts here which you
can<00:01:42.430> tighten<00:01:42.820> down<00:01:43.080> around<00:01:44.080> whatever<00:01:44.770> you're

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
can tighten down around whatever you're

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.400

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
trying to strap on to and then once it's

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.630 
trying to strap on to and then once it's
tight<00:01:47.650> this<00:01:48.160> base<00:01:48.550> plate<00:01:48.670> will<00:01:49.210> slide<00:01:49.540> down

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
tight this base plate will slide down

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.910 
tight this base plate will slide down
like<00:01:51.640> this<00:01:51.940> and<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.870> red<00:01:53.110> lever<00:01:53.380> will<00:01:53.620> remove

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
like this and the red lever will remove

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.910 
like this and the red lever will remove
it<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.280> then<00:01:55.090> this<00:01:55.420> lever<00:01:56.110> on<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.350> side<00:01:56.440> is

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
it and then this lever on the side is

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.530 
it and then this lever on the side is
designed<00:01:57.460> to<00:01:57.760> push<00:01:58.510> into<00:01:58.960> this<00:01:59.080> side<00:01:59.380> of<00:01:59.620> the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
designed to push into this side of the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.980 
designed to push into this side of the
clip<00:02:01.540> to<00:02:01.990> make<00:02:02.530> keep<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.570> tripod<00:02:04.570> mount<00:02:04.780> or

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
clip to make keep the tripod mount or

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.110 
clip to make keep the tripod mount or
the<00:02:05.110> base<00:02:05.410> plate<00:02:05.710> here<00:02:05.920> from<00:02:06.250> moving<00:02:07.000> around

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
the base plate here from moving around

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.260 
the base plate here from moving around
you<00:02:07.330> can<00:02:07.450> see<00:02:07.630> here<00:02:08.789> there's<00:02:09.789> a<00:02:09.849> fair<00:02:10.090> bit<00:02:10.209> of

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
you can see here there's a fair bit of

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.490 
you can see here there's a fair bit of
movement<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:10.660> then<00:02:10.750> once<00:02:10.929> I<00:02:11.049> tighten<00:02:11.469> down

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
movement and then once I tighten down

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.150 
movement and then once I tighten down
this<00:02:11.859> knob<00:02:12.099> here<00:02:12.780> there<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:13.930> no<00:02:14.200> more<00:02:14.709> movement

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
this knob here there is no more movement

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.610 
this knob here there is no more movement
in<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.460> mount<00:02:18.570> so<00:02:19.570> that's<00:02:19.750> pretty<00:02:20.050> cool<00:02:20.350> and

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
in that mount so that's pretty cool and

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.780 
in that mount so that's pretty cool and
that<00:02:20.770> would<00:02:20.860> be<00:02:20.950> really<00:02:21.130> good<00:02:21.250> for<00:02:21.490> carrying

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
that would be really good for carrying

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.980 
that would be really good for carrying
around<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.690> digital<00:02:23.260> SLR<00:02:23.350> but<00:02:24.420> we're<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.450> GoPro

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
around a digital SLR but we're a GoPro

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.450

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
that comes with it probably a really

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.990 
that comes with it probably a really
good<00:03:01.930> idea<00:03:02.050> to<00:03:02.260> look<00:03:02.380> at<00:03:02.500> this<00:03:02.710> as<00:03:03.000> setting

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000

have to loosen off these bolts a little
bit<00:05:15.620> more<00:05:16.180> this<00:05:17.180> is<00:05:17.240> why<00:05:17.540> it's<00:05:17.690> important<00:05:18.080> that

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
bit more this is why it's important that

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.530 
bit more this is why it's important that
you<00:05:18.229> put<00:05:18.380> in<00:05:18.500> those<00:05:18.650> thicker<00:05:18.889> bolts<00:05:19.370> and<00:05:19.580> then

tightening down these bolts you're going

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.760 
tightening down these bolts you're going
to<00:05:24.830> do<00:05:24.950> about<00:05:25.160> a<00:05:25.220> turn<00:05:25.669> on<00:05:25.970> each<00:05:26.780> side<00:05:27.080> and<00:05:27.410> then

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
to do about a turn on each side and then

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.280 
to do about a turn on each side and then
rotate<00:05:28.250> back<00:05:28.580> and<00:05:28.610> forth<00:05:29.060> just<00:05:29.990> like<00:05:30.169> you

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
rotate back and forth just like you

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.300

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
one side you want to make sure that it

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.560 
one side you want to make sure that it
stays<00:05:41.050> square<00:05:42.460> once<00:05:43.460> it's<00:05:43.640> tight<00:05:43.940> I'm<00:05:44.419> going

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
stays square once it's tight I'm going

the base plate I'm going to slide that
into<00:05:50.180> the<00:05:50.600> camera<00:05:51.050> clip<00:05:51.289> it's<00:05:52.070> going<00:05:52.280> to<00:05:52.370> hear

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
into the camera clip it's going to hear

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.010 
into the camera clip it's going to hear
it<00:05:52.610> click<00:05:52.820> that's<00:05:53.090> when<00:05:53.300> the<00:05:53.419> safety<00:05:53.840> has<00:05:53.930> been

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
it click that's when the safety has been
