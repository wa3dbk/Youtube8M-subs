00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
looks like we've got a lot of different

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.960 
looks like we've got a lot of different
visits<00:03:26.010> from<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.459> bunch<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:26.910> different

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
visits from a bunch of different

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.970 
visits from a bunch of different
countries<00:03:27.480> which<00:03:27.630> is<00:03:27.750> encouraging<00:03:28.079> we<00:03:28.859> can

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
countries which is encouraging we can

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.220 
countries which is encouraging we can
also<00:03:29.130> drill<00:03:29.549> in<00:03:29.760> specifically<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.599> the<00:03:30.900> US

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
also drill in specifically to the US

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.470 
also drill in specifically to the US
states<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.519> we<00:03:32.639> can<00:03:32.760> look<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.060> see<00:03:33.269> where

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
states and so we can look and see where

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.809 
states and so we can look and see where
people<00:03:33.630> are<00:03:33.840> coming<00:03:33.870> from<00:03:34.609> specific<00:03:35.609> to<00:03:35.700> the

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
United States and it's going to go in

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.960 
United States and it's going to go in
here<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.470> yank<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.160> information<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:38.819> show

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
here and yank the information and show

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.910 
here and yank the information and show
us<00:03:39.090> graphically<00:03:39.690> on<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:40.049> map<00:03:40.349> what<00:03:40.769> that

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
us graphically on this map what that

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.520 
us graphically on this map what that
looks<00:03:41.130> like<00:03:41.630> so<00:03:42.630> here's<00:03:42.870> our<00:03:42.989> map<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.470> it

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
looks like so here's our map and it

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.559 
looks like so here's our map and it
shows<00:03:43.739> you<00:03:43.950> exactly<00:03:44.669> where<00:03:45.180> people<00:03:45.480> are

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
shows you exactly where people are

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.240 
shows you exactly where people are
visiting<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.530> looks<00:03:46.709> like<00:03:46.799> we<00:03:47.099> have

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
visiting so it looks like we have

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.979 
visiting so it looks like we have
Arizona<00:03:47.609> and<00:03:47.940> New<00:03:48.090> York<00:03:48.269> or<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.599> places<00:03:48.959> that

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
Arizona and New York or the places that

so<00:04:46.439> one<00:04:47.189> of<00:04:47.219> the<00:04:47.400> things<00:04:47.430> I<00:04:47.729> thought<00:04:47.909> was

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
so one of the things I thought was

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.700 
so one of the things I thought was
interesting<00:04:48.240> is<00:04:48.659> if<00:04:48.840> we<00:04:48.960> look<00:04:49.139> at<00:04:49.229> operating

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
interesting is if we look at operating

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.300 
interesting is if we look at operating
system<00:04:50.219> Mac<00:04:51.000> is<00:04:51.379> overwhelmingly<00:04:52.379> the<00:04:53.069> most

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
system Mac is overwhelmingly the most

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.920 
system Mac is overwhelmingly the most
popular<00:04:53.789> operating<00:04:54.120> system<00:04:54.599> so<00:04:54.719> it<00:04:54.780> looks

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
popular operating system so it looks

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.209 
popular operating system so it looks
like<00:04:54.960> we're<00:04:55.199> connecting<00:04:55.680> with<00:04:55.740> a<00:04:55.830> lot<00:04:55.979> of<00:04:56.009> mac

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:56.219 
like we're connecting with a lot of mac

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:58.129 
like we're connecting with a lot of mac
users<00:04:56.580> out<00:04:56.759> there<00:04:56.789> and<00:04:57.240> not<00:04:57.569> a<00:04:57.599> lot<00:04:57.750> of<00:04:57.810> Windows

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
users out there and not a lot of Windows

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.200 
users out there and not a lot of Windows
user<00:04:58.379> which<00:04:58.620> could<00:04:58.830> explain<00:04:58.979> why<00:04:59.280> internet

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
user which could explain why internet

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.999 
user which could explain why internet
explorer<00:05:00.599> is<00:05:00.779> not<00:05:01.050> so<00:05:01.229> popular<00:05:01.439> on<00:05:01.680> this<00:05:01.860> site

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
explorer is not so popular on this site

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:03.800 
explorer is not so popular on this site
so<00:05:02.189> we<00:05:02.639> need<00:05:02.789> to<00:05:02.849> figure<00:05:03.000> out<00:05:03.120> why<00:05:03.360> that<00:05:03.569> is<00:05:03.779> and

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
so we need to figure out why that is and

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.320 
so we need to figure out why that is and
if<00:05:04.080> it's<00:05:04.169> significant<00:05:04.800> so<00:05:05.219> we<00:05:05.789> can<00:05:05.879> also<00:05:06.060> go

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
if it's significant so we can also go

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.059 
if it's significant so we can also go
and<00:05:06.449> look<00:05:06.569> and<00:05:06.750> see<00:05:06.990> what<00:05:07.319> kind<00:05:07.560> of<00:05:07.620> colors<00:05:08.039> and

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069 
and look and see what kind of colors and

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:10.909 
and look and see what kind of colors and
resolution<00:05:08.849> these<00:05:09.419> guys<00:05:09.659> have<00:05:09.960> so<00:05:10.319> we<00:05:10.529> can<00:05:10.680> see

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
resolution these guys have so we can see

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.279 
resolution these guys have so we can see
that<00:05:11.099> yeah<00:05:11.629> everybody's<00:05:12.629> pretty<00:05:12.840> much<00:05:13.050> in<00:05:13.199> the

that yeah everybody's pretty much in the
modern<00:05:13.560> world<00:05:13.620> we<00:05:14.129> can<00:05:14.250> see<00:05:14.430> domains<00:05:14.639> we<00:05:15.090> can
