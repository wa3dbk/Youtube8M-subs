is so when might that be do you remember

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.830 
is so when might that be do you remember
when<00:00:10.769> you<00:00:10.860> were<00:00:10.950> younger<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.730> could<00:00:12.630> play

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
when you were younger and you could play

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.890 
when you were younger and you could play
video<00:00:13.019> games<00:00:13.410> for<00:00:13.620> up<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.830> 8<00:00:14.040> 9<00:00:14.759> 10<00:00:15.179> 11<00:00:15.360> hours<00:00:15.780> a

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
video games for up to 8 9 10 11 hours a

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.890 
video games for up to 8 9 10 11 hours a
time<00:00:16.490> and<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.670> played<00:00:17.970> until<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.330> Sun<00:00:18.630> came

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
time and you played until the Sun came

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.340 
time and you played until the Sun came
up

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
up

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.010 
up
marathon<00:00:20.340> video<00:00:20.609> game<00:00:20.850> sessions<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.630> think

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
marathon video game sessions I think

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.500 
marathon video game sessions I think
every<00:00:22.289> game<00:00:22.470> has<00:00:22.650> taken<00:00:22.980> part<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.310> them<00:00:23.519> more

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
every game has taken part in them more

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.880 
every game has taken part in them more
obviously<00:00:24.840> more<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.230> when<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:25.500> were<00:00:25.619> younger

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
obviously more so when we were younger

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.490 
obviously more so when we were younger
when<00:00:26.609> we<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:26.939> more<00:00:27.420> time<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.869> burn<00:00:28.050> less

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
when we have more time to burn less

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.609 
when we have more time to burn less
