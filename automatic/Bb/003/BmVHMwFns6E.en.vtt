00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:01.930
 if I squeeze 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.190
 they are of the same age. 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.560
 good morning you can see from the courage pisa eyes - text 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.400
 as some food experts say 12 milan 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.640
 eyes like the sea that pushes were built just anguish maybe the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.060
 answer many of these questions made in the sky the sincerity of smoke of the 

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:26.480
 today's lion constellation you say milanista 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.579
 was of text seville 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.750
 during the spring equinox of 10500 BC 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.510
 the sphinx that the eyes pointed exactly to the right 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.510
 she would then see herself reflected in the sky 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.990
 the sphinx could therefore be a sort of millennial clock 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.030
 therefore the hands indicate the year 10500 BC 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.170
 exactly the same pathetic prophesied date I asked for the construction of 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.170
 pyramids 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.860
 we are among the many anterior ones of the sphinx 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.200
 right under his vote here we find a granite star called 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.270
 estelle people was placed here by the pharaoh thutmose and quartered on this 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.400
 stars we see an image that made us talk a lot there are two sphinxes 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.710
 over two times moon from shoulders to the other 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.190
 one facing east the other facing west from here starting one 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.780
 passionate the brave Italian researcher has published a hypothesis 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.780
 very surprising 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.520
 according to Italian researchers diego baratono the representation of two 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.030
 mythological lions engraving gravestone international law of the sphinx 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.780
 it would only be the last of the clues 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.109
 juve, fascinating self-confident games of a second sphinx 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.390
 is pointed submissive executive 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.540
 in a dream 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.070
 Italian researchers would even have identified the tour 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.109
 whose point of view 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:17.609
 it would be a symmetrical point with respect to the existing sphinx 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.780
 with respect to the circumference identified precisely by the bold criticisms 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.780
 flat villa of giza 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.729
 karaoke partially covered by the part you see 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:43.190
 they seem to look a lot like those you find 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.930
 I go back to the tub where 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.039
 it was closed to traffic 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:51.589
 a special coincidence also because we are exactly behind 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:55.959
 the pyramid of chefren mem. indicated by tuna bar as 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.619
 the probable place to dig to find the second
