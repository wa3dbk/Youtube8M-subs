00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
but really quick but very easy to make

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.980 
but really quick but very easy to make
because<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.920> know<00:00:29.130> every<00:00:30.060> time<00:00:30.269> we<00:00:30.330> was<00:00:30.630> right

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
because you know every time we was right

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.659 
because you know every time we was right
above<00:00:31.170> his<00:00:31.320> head<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.830> let<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.130> thing<00:00:32.160> you

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
above his head you let the thing you

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.850 
above his head you let the thing you
have<00:00:32.820> let<00:00:33.149> them<00:00:33.329> try<00:00:33.600> me<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.899> go<00:00:34.050> off<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.500> you

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
have let them try me to go off and you

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.400 
have let them try me to go off and you

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
probably get off almost perfectly every

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.639 
probably get off almost perfectly every
time

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
time

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.549 
time
very<00:00:38.190> simple<00:00:38.610> very<00:00:38.670> easy<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.329> visualize<00:00:39.809> his

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559
