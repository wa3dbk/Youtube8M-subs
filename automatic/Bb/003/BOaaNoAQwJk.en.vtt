00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.050 
the bottom just in case you don't want
anybody<00:02:41.590> pulling<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.040> trigger<00:02:42.250> or<00:02:42.430> yourself

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
anybody pulling the trigger or yourself

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.630 
anybody pulling the trigger or yourself
accidentally<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.709> turn<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:45.160> on<00:02:45.220> and

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
accidentally so you turn that on and

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.080 
accidentally so you turn that on and
then<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.660> have<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:46.959> laser<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:47.890> then<00:02:48.090> a

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
then you have a laser and then a

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.420 
then you have a laser and then a
selector<00:02:49.690> switch<00:02:49.989> so<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:50.709> can<00:02:50.890> select<00:02:51.160> the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
selector switch so you can select the

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.229 
selector switch so you can select the
switch<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.910> do<00:02:52.060> just<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.510> flashlight<00:02:54.239> next

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
switch to do just the flashlight next

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.960 
switch to do just the flashlight next
one<00:02:55.450> is<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.870> dim<00:02:56.290> LED<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.310> then<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:57.730> goes<00:02:57.910> to

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
one is the dim LED and then it goes to

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.080 
one is the dim LED and then it goes to
the<00:02:58.150> laser<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.780> then<00:02:59.340> there<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.790> bright

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
the laser and then there is the bright

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.839 
the laser and then there is the bright
and<00:03:01.590> then<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.769> laser<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:05.170> course<00:03:05.380> all

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
and then the laser and of course all

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.809 
and then the laser and of course all
so<00:03:07.849> there's<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.209> Cobra<00:03:08.720> from<00:03:09.140> vector<00:03:09.500> optics

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
so there's the Cobra from vector optics

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.280 
so there's the Cobra from vector optics
