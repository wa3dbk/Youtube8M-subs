xbox<00:01:48.689> one<00:01:48.869> ps4<00:01:49.170> one<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.710> things<00:01:49.859> I<00:01:49.950> was

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
xbox one ps4 one of the things I was

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.099 
xbox one ps4 one of the things I was
really<00:01:50.280> struggle<00:01:50.759> struggle<00:01:51.420> worthy<00:01:51.899> about

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
really struggle struggle worthy about

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.709 
really struggle struggle worthy about
ghosts<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.590> xbox<00:01:53.009> one<00:01:53.219> ps4<00:01:53.520> was<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
ghosts like xbox one ps4 was that the

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.300 
ghosts like xbox one ps4 was that the
game<00:01:54.929> the<00:01:55.350> maps<00:01:55.560> were<00:01:55.710> pretty<00:01:55.920> much<00:01:56.009> designed

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
game the maps were pretty much designed

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.529 
game the maps were pretty much designed
for<00:01:56.520> ground<00:01:56.729> war<00:01:56.850> that's<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.149> always<00:01:57.210> felt

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
for ground war that's what I always felt

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:58.969 
for ground war that's what I always felt
that's<00:01:57.750> what<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.929> thought<00:01:58.109> the<00:01:58.560> maps<00:01:58.770> would<00:01:58.920> be

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
that's what I thought the maps would be

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.319 
that's what I thought the maps would be
because<00:01:59.340> they<00:01:59.609> were<00:01:59.700> so<00:01:59.850> big<00:02:00.119> was<00:02:00.299> that

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
because they were so big was that

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.149 
because they were so big was that
they're<00:02:00.570> all<00:02:00.600> being<00:02:01.079> ground<00:02:01.380> work<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.770> that

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
they're all being ground work and that

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.560 
they're all being ground work and that
was<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> master<00:02:02.640> plan<00:02:02.759> for<00:02:02.880> mid<00:02:03.149> fade<00:02:03.299> award

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
was the master plan for mid fade award

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.389 
was the master plan for mid fade award
nope<00:02:03.929> they<00:02:04.350> took<00:02:04.530> out<00:02:04.649> all<00:02:04.679> the<00:02:04.859> best<00:02:05.159> maps

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
nope they took out all the best maps

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.900 
nope they took out all the best maps
from<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:06.179> know<00:02:06.240> 66<00:02:06.780> playlist<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.910> didn't

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
from the you know 66 playlist and didn't

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.070 
from the you know 66 playlist and didn't
put<00:02:09.030> any<00:02:09.210> of<00:02:09.330> them<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.539> ground<00:02:09.750> were<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.960> only

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
put any of them in ground were the only

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.570 
put any of them in ground were the only
good<00:02:10.320> map<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.500> can<00:02:10.710> think<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.950> from<00:02:11.100> ground<00:02:11.400> war

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
good map I can think of from ground war

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.340 
good map I can think of from ground war
was<00:02:11.730> sovereign<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.330> felt<00:02:12.810> like<00:02:12.900> all<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.080> maps

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
was sovereign I felt like all the maps

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.510 
was sovereign I felt like all the maps
could<00:02:13.500> played<00:02:13.710> pretty<00:02:13.950> well<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.220> ground<00:02:14.400> or

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
could played pretty well in ground or

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.090 
could played pretty well in ground or
except<00:02:14.730> for<00:02:14.880> maybe<00:02:14.970> strike<00:02:15.300> zone<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.980> is

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
except for maybe strike zone so that is

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.050 
except for maybe strike zone so that is
when<00:02:17.250> things<00:02:17.280> I'm<00:02:17.640> really<00:02:17.670> liking<00:02:17.940> about
