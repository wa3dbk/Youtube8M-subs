about that in a letter to my speaker
placement<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.340> such<00:00:53.699> okay<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.780> can<00:00:54.930> almost

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
placement and such okay you can almost

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.139 
placement and such okay you can almost
lose<00:00:55.320> sight<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.649> what's<00:00:56.010> real<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.579> what's<00:00:57.030> not

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
lose sight of what's real and what's not

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.689 
lose sight of what's real and what's not
because<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.750> sound<00:00:58.050> kind<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.710> simulates<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
because the sound kind of simulates and

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.580 
because the sound kind of simulates and
emulates<00:01:00.059> what<00:01:00.120> happens<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.690> real<00:01:00.899> life<00:01:01.020> if

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
emulates what happens in real life if

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.529 
emulates what happens in real life if
you're<00:01:01.829> ever<00:01:02.010> stuck<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.579> war<00:01:02.760> zone<00:01:02.789> now<00:01:03.270> I

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
mentioned the THX certification in case

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.120 
mentioned the THX certification in case
you're<00:01:06.420> not<00:01:06.479> familiar<00:01:06.540> with<00:01:06.840> thx<00:01:07.320> basically

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
you're not familiar with thx basically

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.340 
you're not familiar with thx basically
it's<00:01:08.280> widely<00:01:08.610> considered<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.180> ultimate<00:01:09.390> mark

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
it's widely considered the ultimate mark

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.020 
it's widely considered the ultimate mark
of<00:01:10.530> quality<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:11.040> speaker<00:01:11.460> system<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:11.939> it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
of quality for speaker system so it

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.840 
of quality for speaker system so it
means<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.689> Z<00:01:12.840> 5300<00:01:13.680> has<00:01:13.860> been<00:01:14.130> tested<00:01:14.760> and

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
means the Z 5300 has been tested and

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.050 
means the Z 5300 has been tested and
approved<00:01:14.939> by<00:01:15.540> KJ's<00:01:16.049> X<00:01:16.439> rather<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:17.850> based

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.320 
rigorous testing we don't see too many
of<00:01:22.680> these<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.250> very<00:01:23.430> cool<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.150> in

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
sound but what about power because all

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.319 
sound but what about power because all
that<00:01:35.310> means<00:01:35.520> nothing<00:01:35.790> without<00:01:35.909> power<00:01:36.240> right

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
that means nothing without power right

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.819 
that means nothing without power right
well<00:01:37.020> as<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.290> see<00:01:37.409> over<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:37.710> you've<00:01:37.799> got

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.310 
well as you can see over here you've got
five<00:01:38.189> satellites<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.509> you've<00:01:40.049> got<00:01:40.200> your

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
five satellites and you've got your

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.039 
five satellites and you've got your
stunning<00:01:40.650> sub<00:01:41.100> woofer<00:01:41.729> okay<00:01:42.000> that's<00:01:42.450> -<00:01:42.780> here

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
stunning sub woofer okay that's - here

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:43.630 
stunning sub woofer okay that's - here
we<00:01:43.140> go

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
we go

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.100 
we go
235<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.090> think<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.360> 35<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.780> quarter

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
235 and I think it's 35 the quarter

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.200 
235 and I think it's 35 the quarter
