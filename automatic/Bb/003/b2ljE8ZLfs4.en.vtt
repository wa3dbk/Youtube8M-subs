but<00:02:27.819> we<00:02:28.000> will<00:02:28.239> add<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.569> little<00:02:29.079> bit<00:02:29.290> more

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
but we will add a little bit more

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.990 
but we will add a little bit more

moist don't want to plant the tree too
deeply<00:02:40.079> when<00:02:41.079> we<00:02:41.230> put<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.680> into<00:02:41.829> the<00:02:42.040> hole<00:02:42.250> in<00:02:42.459> a

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
minute we'll have a look that we've got

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
doesn't require too much banging in but

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.119 
doesn't require too much banging in but
if<00:03:29.979> you<00:03:30.010> if<00:03:30.639> soil<00:03:30.940> is<00:03:31.329> hard<00:03:32.049> and<00:03:32.290> compact<00:03:32.859> you

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
if you if soil is hard and compact you

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.129 
if you if soil is hard and compact you
will<00:03:33.220> need<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.579> knock<00:03:33.790> that<00:03:34.030> in<00:03:34.299> now<00:03:34.870> we'll

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
will need to knock that in now we'll

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.640 
will need to knock that in now we'll
take<00:03:35.379> the<00:03:35.560> tree<00:03:35.889> out<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.430> bag<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.900> soil<00:03:38.229> that

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
take the tree out the bag the soil that

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.189 
take the tree out the bag the soil that
the<00:03:39.159> roots<00:03:39.430> have<00:03:39.669> been<00:03:39.879> soaked<00:03:40.209> in<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:40.750> bucket

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:41.199 
the roots have been soaked in a bucket

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:46.349 
the roots have been soaked in a bucket
24<00:03:41.919> hours<00:03:42.370> prior<00:03:42.639> to<00:03:43.030> planting<00:03:45.030> we'll<00:03:46.030> put<00:03:46.239> the

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
24 hours prior to planting we'll put the

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.129 
24 hours prior to planting we'll put the
tree<00:03:46.750> against<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:48.099> stake<00:03:48.489> and<00:03:49.000> now<00:03:49.629> it's<00:03:49.870> time

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
tree against the stake and now it's time

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.860 
tree against the stake and now it's time
to<00:03:50.650> just<00:03:50.829> back<00:03:51.129> fill<00:03:51.459> in<00:03:51.669> with<00:03:52.209> some<00:03:52.239> compost

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
to just back fill in with some compost

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.229 
to just back fill in with some compost
we<00:03:53.260> know<00:03:53.440> we're<00:03:53.709> at<00:03:53.829> the<00:03:53.979> right<00:03:54.220> height<00:03:54.579> this

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
we know we're at the right height this

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.449 
we know we're at the right height this
is<00:03:55.449> the<00:03:55.659> original<00:03:55.840> soil<00:03:56.379> height<00:03:56.799> you'll<00:03:57.310> see

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
is the original soil height you'll see

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.740 
is the original soil height you'll see
the<00:03:57.609> rootstock<00:03:58.000> here<00:03:58.510> and<00:03:59.939> the<00:04:00.939> graft<00:04:01.239> here

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
the rootstock here and the graft here

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.390 
the rootstock here and the graft here
make<00:04:02.590> sure<00:04:02.620> you<00:04:02.979> never<00:04:03.599> plant<00:04:04.599> the<00:04:04.870> graft

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
make sure you never plant the graft

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.670 
make sure you never plant the graft
below<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.699> soil<00:04:06.909> level<00:04:07.150> so<00:04:08.139> you'll<00:04:08.319> see<00:04:08.500> the

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
below the soil level so you'll see the

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.309 
below the soil level so you'll see the
original<00:04:09.189> level<00:04:09.370> that<00:04:09.729> that<00:04:10.090> tree<00:04:10.569> was<00:04:10.810> on<00:04:10.989> in

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
original level that that tree was on in

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.979 
original level that that tree was on in
the<00:04:11.549> nursery<00:04:12.549> and<00:04:12.759> that's<00:04:13.419> a<00:04:13.599> level<00:04:13.780> you

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
the nursery and that's a level you

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.149 
the nursery and that's a level you
should<00:04:14.199> be<00:04:14.319> working<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:15.509> so<00:04:16.509> now<00:04:16.900> just

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:18.159 
should be working to so now just

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:21.249 
should be working to so now just
backfill<00:04:19.159> the<00:04:19.340> compost<00:04:19.900> so<00:04:20.900> there's<00:04:21.049> a<00:04:21.109> good

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:21.259 
backfill the compost so there's a good

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.080 
backfill the compost so there's a good
idea<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.769> give<00:04:21.919> the<00:04:22.039> tree<00:04:22.310> a<00:04:22.340> bit<00:04:22.610> of<00:04:22.729> a<00:04:22.789> shake

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
idea to give the tree a bit of a shake

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.980 
idea to give the tree a bit of a shake
as<00:04:23.389> the<00:04:24.110> soils<00:04:24.560> going<00:04:24.949> in<00:04:25.300> so<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.419> soil<00:04:26.689> gets

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
as the soils going in so the soil gets

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.600 
as the soils going in so the soil gets
around<00:04:27.469> in<00:04:28.009> amongst<00:04:28.490> all<00:04:28.759> the<00:04:28.939> roots<00:04:29.210> a

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.570 

three-quarter<00:04:34.610> fill<00:04:34.879> the<00:04:35.060> whole<00:04:36.189> again<00:04:37.189> give

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
three-quarter fill the whole again give

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.529 
three-quarter fill the whole again give
it<00:04:37.729> a<00:04:37.939> good<00:04:38.449> shake<00:04:39.520> get<00:04:40.520> all<00:04:40.699> the<00:04:40.879> soil<00:04:41.300> down

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
it a good shake get all the soil down

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.649 
it a good shake get all the soil down
amongst<00:04:42.289> the<00:04:42.530> roots<00:04:43.090> now<00:04:44.090> it's<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.419> time<00:04:44.599> to

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:44.659 
amongst the roots now it's the time to

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:48.939 
amongst the roots now it's the time to
tread<00:04:45.280> firm<00:04:46.280> the<00:04:46.550> tree<00:04:46.849> into<00:04:47.120> the<00:04:47.300> position<00:04:48.020> go

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
tread firm the tree into the position go

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:54.519 
tread firm the tree into the position go
all<00:04:49.129> the<00:04:49.340> way<00:04:49.370> around<00:04:49.699> the<00:04:50.090> tree<00:04:53.169> there<00:04:54.169> we<00:04:54.289> go

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:54.529 
all the way around the tree there we go

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:58.589 
all the way around the tree there we go

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:43.149 
guard around the base and simply start
from<00:05:36.810> the<00:05:36.930> bottom<00:05:37.349> and<00:05:38.569> unwrap<00:05:39.919> the<00:05:40.919> guard

around the base of the tree and this

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.939 
around the base of the tree and this
will<00:05:47.159> stop<00:05:47.430> any<00:05:47.610> rabbits<00:05:48.500> chewing<00:05:49.500> away<00:05:49.770> at
