00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:08.889
The player of the weekend is Paul-George Ntep.
We talked about him here on here before as

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.230
I am a big fan of his but he is on another
planet at the moment. He has taken his game

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.060
into another dimension. He is leading his
team Rennes who are now 5th in the table and

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.680
unbeaten in the last two months. He was deadly
on Saturday against Monaco with two assists.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:42.570
He is only 22 but his talent is immense. And
right now, he is the best player in Ligue

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.660
1.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.059
The result of the weekend is without a doubt
St Etienne’s 3 - 0 win against Lyon in the

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.910
Derby du Rhone, one of the biggest games in
French football. And the curse is over. For

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:03.390
the first time since April 1994, les Verts
managed to beat their enemy at home in the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.290
league thanks to Bayal Sall. Ricky Van Wolfswinkel
and Renaud Cohade. They also hit the post

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:18.250
and the bar while Lyon missed a penalty! Gautier
and his men put a lot of intensity, of aggression

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.549
and physicality and the visitors could not
cope. You can already be excited by the return

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.750
fixture in Lyon on April 18th.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.740
The manager of the weekend is René Girard.
Lille are in crisis. They are struggling in

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.490
Europe, they are16th in the table and their
manager can’t find any solutions to the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.820
problems. His team have lost five and drawn
one in its last six league games. The Dogues

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.799
are only two points clear of the bottom three
now. When you think that last season they

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.210
finished 3rd! Even if it is not the club’s
philosophy to sack managers, Girard has no

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.581
answer to what is going wrong and he could
be gone very soon.

00:01:55.581 --> 00:02:00.710
The game to look out for this week is Lille
- PSG on Wednesday evening. Saying that it’s

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.700
a must win game for Lille and their manager
René Girard is not even close from the truth.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.090
It is more than that. Another defeat would
be dramatic and would bring Girard even closer

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.750
to the sack. He and his players have to turn
things round, starting against the Champions

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.310
on Wednesday. But PSG are on a roll now. They
have won their last 9 games in all competitions

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:38.840
and Ibra is back to 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:57.900
his best.
