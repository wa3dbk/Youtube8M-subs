started watchdogs and we started to

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.920 
started watchdogs and we started to
define<00:02:04.760> it<00:02:04.790> was<00:02:05.090> about<00:02:05.330> I

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
define it was about I

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.780

connectivity within the box that you're
playing<00:02:09.649> with<00:02:09.860> so<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.490> mobile<00:02:10.820> device<00:02:11.000> needed

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
playing with so the mobile device needed

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.690 
playing with so the mobile device needed
to<00:02:11.750> be<00:02:11.900> part<00:02:12.170> of<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.350> experience<00:02:12.710> needed<00:02:13.430> to

to be part of the experience needed to

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.690 
to be part of the experience needed to
be<00:02:13.820> in<00:02:13.880> real<00:02:14.060> time<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:15.320> by<00:02:15.500> starting<00:02:15.800> early<00:02:16.460> we

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
be in real time so by starting early we

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.520 
be in real time so by starting early we

managed to have people who could tackle

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.320 
managed to have people who could tackle
those<00:02:18.710> kind<00:02:18.980> of<00:02:19.040> difficulty<00:02:19.640> today<00:02:20.150> we<00:02:20.300> have

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
those kind of difficulty today we have

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.230 
those kind of difficulty today we have

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
form of activities simplicity well how

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.820 
form of activities simplicity well how
does<00:02:38.510> that<00:02:38.720> work<00:02:38.930> like<00:02:38.959> if<00:02:39.320> I<00:02:39.440> was<00:02:39.590> going<00:02:39.739> to

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
does that work like if I was going to

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.199 
does that work like if I was going to
challenge<00:02:40.040> one<00:02:40.310> of<00:02:40.400> my<00:02:40.520> friends<00:02:40.940> are<00:02:41.030> they

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
something innocent but how does he join

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.190 
something innocent but how does he join
like<00:02:58.370> does<00:02:58.640> he<00:02:58.760> join<00:02:58.970> as<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.239> character<00:02:59.630> does<00:03:00.050> he

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
like does he join as a character does he

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.070 
like does he join as a character does he
join<00:03:00.440> as<00:03:00.770> well<00:03:01.070> it's<00:03:01.340> more<00:03:01.520> like<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:01.810> let's<00:03:02.810> see

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
join as well it's more like a let's see

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.750 
join as well it's more like a let's see
it<00:03:03.230> as<00:03:03.350> almost<00:03:03.590> an<00:03:03.830> operator<00:03:04.220> like<00:03:04.610> her

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
it as almost an operator like her

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.150 
it as almost an operator like her
someone<00:03:05.150> is<00:03:05.239> gonna<00:03:05.360> watch<00:03:05.680> this<00:03:06.680> isn't<00:03:06.890> like

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
someone is gonna watch this isn't like

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.010 
someone is gonna watch this isn't like
one<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.370> those<00:03:07.520> guys<00:03:07.730> who<00:03:07.790> can<00:03:08.060> control<00:03:08.420> CTOs

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
one of those guys who can control CTOs

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.110 
one of those guys who can control CTOs
is<00:03:09.230> long<00:03:09.440> right<00:03:09.680> so<00:03:10.459> that's<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:10.790> different

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
is long right so that's a different

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.210 
is long right so that's a different
perspective<00:03:11.330> on<00:03:11.720> thing<00:03:11.930> on<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.739> mobile

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
perspective on thing on the mobile

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.370 
perspective on thing on the mobile
device<00:03:13.850> but<00:03:14.390> those<00:03:14.480> who<00:03:14.600> didn't<00:03:14.870> see<00:03:15.049> it<00:03:15.200> of

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
device but those who didn't see it of

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.490 
device but those who didn't see it of
course<00:03:15.620> we<00:03:15.920> need<00:03:16.100> to<00:03:16.190> describe<00:03:16.580> it<00:03:16.700> more<00:03:17.500> it's

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
course we need to describe it more it's

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.050 
course we need to describe it more it's
like<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.860> grid<00:03:19.130> right<00:03:19.370> like<00:03:19.549> the<00:03:19.760> players

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
like the grid right like the players

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.550 
like the grid right like the players
working<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:20.720> hard<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:21.080> build<00:03:21.260> that<00:03:21.500> thing

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
working so hard to build that thing

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.400 
working so hard to build that thing
which<00:03:22.010> is<00:03:22.040> almost<00:03:22.459> like<00:03:22.670> a<00:03:23.260> visualization<00:03:24.260> of

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
which is almost like a visualization of

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.770 
which is almost like a visualization of
data<00:03:24.620> flow<00:03:24.890> in<00:03:25.070> Chicago<00:03:25.580> and<00:03:25.790> better<00:03:26.570> and

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
data flow in Chicago and better and

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.150 
data flow in Chicago and better and
stronger<00:03:27.080> you<00:03:27.350> are<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.680> better<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:28.040> can

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
stronger you are the better you can

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.500 
stronger you are the better you can
