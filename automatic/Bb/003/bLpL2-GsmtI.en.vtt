could have been the mom that made it off
I<00:03:13.640> would<00:03:14.640> agree<00:03:14.910> because<00:03:15.390> I've<00:03:15.540> heard<00:03:15.870> that

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
I would agree because I've heard that

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.520 
I would agree because I've heard that
before<00:03:16.310> but<00:03:17.310> there's<00:03:17.790> no<00:03:18.120> scab<00:03:18.570> no<00:03:19.020> bumps

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
before but there's no scab no bumps

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.530 
before but there's no scab no bumps
anything<00:03:20.250> on<00:03:20.459> there<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:20.880> there's<00:03:21.090> actually

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
anything on there and there's actually

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.160 
anything on there and there's actually
hair<00:03:21.810> growing<00:03:22.200> on<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.770> nub<00:03:22.980> so<00:03:23.940> I'm<00:03:24.570> kind<00:03:25.050> of

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
hair growing on the nub so I'm kind of

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.620 
hair growing on the nub so I'm kind of
confused<00:03:25.590> I'm<00:03:25.890> hoping<00:03:26.580> that's<00:03:26.820> genetic<00:03:27.390> and

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
confused I'm hoping that's genetic and

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.040 
confused I'm hoping that's genetic and
I've<00:03:27.840> read<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.440> first<00:03:28.739> strain<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:30.050> tailless

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
I've read the first strain of tailless

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.630 
I've read the first strain of tailless
rats<00:03:31.380> so<00:03:32.220> I'm<00:03:32.520> waiting<00:03:32.850> for<00:03:32.989> him<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.170> be<00:03:34.640> old

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
rats so I'm waiting for him to be old

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.240 
rats so I'm waiting for him to be old
enough<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.060> bring<00:03:36.420> back<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.750> his<00:03:37.050> mom<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.560> see

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
enough to bring back to his mom and see

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.820 
enough to bring back to his mom and see
if<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.430> get<00:03:38.489> more<00:03:38.880> tailless<00:03:41.450> now<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.810> used<00:03:43.200> half

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
if I get more tailless now I used half

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.910 
if I get more tailless now I used half
inch<00:03:44.130> mesh<00:03:44.459> on<00:03:44.760> all<00:03:45.390> these<00:03:45.959> are<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.709> first

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
inch mesh on all these are the first

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.500 
inch mesh on all these are the first
five<00:03:47.070> tubs<00:03:47.550> and<00:03:48.739> that<00:03:49.739> holds<00:03:50.280> all<00:03:50.459> of<00:03:50.519> my<00:03:50.910> dog

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
five tubs and that holds all of my dog

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.610 
five tubs and that holds all of my dog
food<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:52.110> use<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:53.330> dog<00:03:54.330> food<00:03:54.600> called<00:03:54.959> kibbles<00:03:55.530> and

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
food I use a dog food called kibbles and

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.370 
food I use a dog food called kibbles and
bits<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:56.510> that's<00:03:57.510> big<00:03:57.810> enough<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.350> doesn't

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
bits and that's big enough so it doesn't

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.150 
bits and that's big enough so it doesn't
go<00:03:58.739> down<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.580> half<00:04:00.030> inch<00:04:00.269> mesh<00:04:00.570> and<00:04:01.010> then<00:04:02.010> I

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
go down the half inch mesh and then I

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.330 
go down the half inch mesh and then I
use<00:04:02.489> Missouri<00:04:03.030> rat<00:04:03.390> food<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:04.590> obviously
