00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.469
 welcome to girls a games 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.950
 de I'm i and present to you 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:17.890
 today the game of the day unicorn 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.770
 Princess so I thought right into that 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.720
 play and here you can already see the 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.910
 princess with her unicorn the whole 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.860
 looking forward to me waiting for you 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.200
 her 1 for her dream prince so 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.829
 That's the right dress 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.680
 Bad if you start with me 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:39.250
 the hairstyle and geerlings around daily 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.510
 debate the hairstyles and look something 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.510
 is there are 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.680
 I'm up here for this 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.770
 so princess like and that's why 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.060
 i would take that too i would 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.150
 I'd like to suggest one first 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.560
 dress because the as &amp; s what you want me 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.760
 then choose 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.760
 to match the dress 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.370
 Of course, the last one is something very nice 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.920
 luck to be full but she should be one 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.770
 princess she is allowed to specify it 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.070
 there are only underneath there 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.590
 you still judge her so corsets and 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.590
 corsages like I do not know now 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:36.410
 ok i think i would fit a dress 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.360
 is better to a unicorn princess 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:43.430
 a question i think with glitter 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.760
 Nice that the pack I think Schwinger 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.470
 what do you think brother down with glitter 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.970
 I think pink with glitter very nice 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:02:02.150
 then missing the matching 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:06.470
 shoes which the below I know with 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:09.470
 the dress the white was already the best 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.540
 because the relatively neutral left shoes 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.300
 there are now with ghraib against the 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.880
 here and as said that bites in 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.940
 I know that, so take the white ones 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:25.730
 it goes on with its predecessors with 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:28.580
 the pid sorry of course 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:46.640
 I do not think so much at all 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:48.760
 beautiful then but the earrings the 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.819
 Here they fit perfectly 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.350
 ok now we still have after the crown 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.720
 of course in princess ter also 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.590
 a green so no real crown 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.590
 but a crown 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.010
 then we turn over to the unicorn 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.360
 the right side is also up here 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.910
 You can not do two buttons that way 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.709
 Change a lot as the princess did 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.670
 my princess is also essential 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:32.660
 I look more important than the unicorn 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:35.239
 what all there is in the procedure that 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.730
 wendler grunow i believe the green one 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.700
 horse was a little worse or here 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.580
 blue has drunk a bit too much and 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:48.230
 pink this is finally going to matte 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.730
 dress or white 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.350
 I think I do not know is white 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.660
 relatively neutral and that is not now 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.519
 pink is not that much 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.930
 Well, that's why I'm going to turn white now 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.459
 Take a horse and have a look 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.260
 orphanage, of course, excuse me 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.130
 and then I'll see what I'm doing here 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.130
 still on or 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.290
 Let's take a look and wander 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:23.870
 so far , of course, my 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.250
 note forget pink and do not know the 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.979
 white missed in white shoes and 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:34.120
 pink hair fit 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:36.020
 that's ideal what do you think 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.090
 I now have my princess 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.560
 Styling is not always coming 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.910
 not even this background because 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.630
 Watch it now and if you are here 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.990
 sun down on this palms sun card 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:51.110
 that's what comes up 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:54.140
 princess castle in the background me 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.460
 think that fits quite well in color and 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.150
 yes then I'm already done with 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.560
 my food and her unicorn roversi 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.560
 present time 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.000
 beautiful 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.680
 now I could theoretically right 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.960
 still print or stop 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.470
 Send or save as a picture 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.510
 because here on the bottom left the replay button 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.550
 press and play on the whole again 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.800
 I hope you enjoyed it when you did 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.490
 now our game necessarily says 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.280
 play 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.530
 then you will find the link to the game 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.810
 directly below in the video description 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.390
 or my game of the day article 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.370
 this game where so I'll 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.940
 I publish every day as a 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.160
 article and just take a look 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.280
 I would say 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.280
 bye for now
