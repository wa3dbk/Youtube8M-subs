really love about shooting video on DSLR

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.680 
really love about shooting video on DSLR
is<00:00:12.809> like<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.139> 70<00:00:13.559> or<00:00:13.710> 5d<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.969> large<00:00:15.240> sensor

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
is like the 70 or 5d is the large sensor

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.560 
is like the 70 or 5d is the large sensor
size<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.260> being<00:00:16.500> able<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.859> use<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.400> whole<00:00:18.029> line

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
size and being able to use a whole line

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.170 
size and being able to use a whole line
of<00:00:18.600> lenses<00:00:19.310> now<00:00:20.310> one<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.640> problems<00:00:20.789> we'll

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
of lenses now one of the problems we'll

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.359 
of lenses now one of the problems we'll
run<00:00:21.359> into<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.930> when<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.260> go<00:00:22.380> outside<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.130> try<00:00:23.310> to

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
run into is when we go outside to try to

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.519 
run into is when we go outside to try to
shoot<00:00:23.640> video<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.449> have<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> lot<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.019> exposure

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
shoot video we have a lot of exposure

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.330 
shoot video we have a lot of exposure
problems<00:00:26.180> usually<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.570> photography

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
problems usually in photography

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.040 
problems usually in photography
photographers<00:00:29.340> use<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.359> shutter<00:00:30.660> speed<00:00:30.900> to

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
photographers use the shutter speed to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.090 
photographers use the shutter speed to
compensate<00:00:31.410> while<00:00:32.340> keeping<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.149> f-stop

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
compensate while keeping the f-stop

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.709 
compensate while keeping the f-stop
wherever<00:00:35.100> they<00:00:35.309> want<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:35.969> if<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.239> have<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> lens

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
wherever they want so if you have a lens

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.080 
wherever they want so if you have a lens
like<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.930> one<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.469> 50<00:00:37.800> which<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> f-stop

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
like this one the 50 which is a f-stop

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.959 
like this one the 50 which is a f-stop
1.4<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.649> could<00:00:40.800> shoot<00:00:41.010> wide<00:00:41.219> open<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.820> use

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
1.4 you could shoot wide open and use

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.630 
1.4 you could shoot wide open and use
your<00:00:42.120> shutter<00:00:42.360> speed<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.960> darken<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.520> but<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
your shutter speed to darken it but the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.119 
your shutter speed to darken it but the
problem<00:00:45.030> we<00:00:45.239> are<00:00:45.270> facing<00:00:45.480> as<00:00:46.200> videographers

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
problem we are facing as videographers

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.819 
problem we are facing as videographers
or<00:00:47.489> cinematographers<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:49.800> to

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
or cinematographers is that we like to

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.729 
or cinematographers is that we like to
use<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.219> 180<00:00:50.640> shutter<00:00:51.210> degree<00:00:51.570> rule<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.559> that

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
use the 180 shutter degree rule so that

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.279 
use the 180 shutter degree rule so that
means<00:00:52.949> if<00:00:53.100> we're<00:00:53.250> shooting<00:00:53.430> at<00:00:53.960> 24<00:00:54.960> frames<00:00:55.199> per

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
means if we're shooting at 24 frames per

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.470 
means if we're shooting at 24 frames per
second<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:56.250> lock<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.820> shutters<00:00:57.149> being<00:00:57.390> at

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
second we lock in the shutters being at

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.369 
second we lock in the shutters being at
148<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:59.160> only<00:00:59.399> variable<00:00:59.910> left<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.989> control

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
148 the only variable left to control

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.280 
148 the only variable left to control
exposure<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.190> then<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.579> aperture<00:01:03.170> but<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
exposure is then the aperture but the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.950 
exposure is then the aperture but the
problem<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.799> by<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.100> time<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:05.580> close<00:01:06.479> down<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
problem is by the time we close down the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.200 
problem is by the time we close down the
aperture<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.890> create<00:01:08.220> exposure<00:01:08.549> we've<00:01:08.939> lost

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
aperture to create exposure we've lost

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.030 
aperture to create exposure we've lost
that<00:01:09.479> shallow<00:01:09.780> depth<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.200> field<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.650> we're

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
that shallow depth of field that we're

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.969 
that shallow depth of field that we're
always<00:01:11.159> looking<00:01:11.310> for<00:01:12.020> so<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.470> tool<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.710> we

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
always looking for so one tool that we

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.749 
always looking for so one tool that we
can<00:01:14.130> use<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.520> work<00:01:15.509> around<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:17.070> fader

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
can use to work around this is a fader

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.600 
can use to work around this is a fader
nd<00:01:17.909> or<00:01:18.570> ND<00:01:19.020> filters<00:01:19.380> now<00:01:19.590> normal<00:01:19.950> ND<00:01:20.220> filters

nd or ND filters now normal ND filters
are<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.270> little<00:01:21.509> more<00:01:21.720> affordable<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.590> they're

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
are a little more affordable and they're

very n DS allow you to adjust the
exposure<00:01:33.090> now<00:01:33.689> these<00:01:33.869> are<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.079> two

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380

polarizing<00:01:34.860> pieces<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.520> glass<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.000> as<00:01:36.420> you

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
polarizing pieces of glass and as you

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.899 
polarizing pieces of glass and as you
rotate<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.290> you'll<00:01:37.799> notice<00:01:38.009> here<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.670> gets

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
rotate it you'll notice here it gets

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.170 
rotate it you'll notice here it gets
darker<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.600> brighter<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.579> allows<00:01:41.909> us

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
darker and brighter and this allows us

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.330 
darker and brighter and this allows us
to<00:01:42.360> smoothly<00:01:42.750> adjust<00:01:44.299> our<00:01:45.299> exposure<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
to smoothly adjust our exposure on the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.429 
to smoothly adjust our exposure on the
fly<00:01:47.579> now<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.420> one<00:01:48.600> right<00:01:48.750> here<00:01:49.020> gives<00:01:49.290> us

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
fly now this one right here gives us

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.819 
fly now this one right here gives us
about<00:01:49.799> eight<00:01:50.159> stops<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:51.030> latitude<00:01:51.590> there<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.799> a

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
about eight stops of latitude there is a

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.819 
about eight stops of latitude there is a
minimum<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.640> maximum<00:01:54.140> if<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.259> go<00:01:55.380> beyond<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
minimum and maximum if you go beyond the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.319 
minimum and maximum if you go beyond the
maximum<00:01:56.570> you<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.869> may<00:01:58.079> run<00:01:58.320> into<00:01:58.469> some<00:01:58.560> color

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
maximum you you may run into some color

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.270 
maximum you you may run into some color
changes<00:02:00.329> or<00:02:00.509> shifts<00:02:00.960> but<00:02:01.560> between<00:02:01.950> minimum

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
changes or shifts but between minimum

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.719 
changes or shifts but between minimum
and<00:02:02.399> maximum<00:02:02.759> on<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.450> fader<00:02:04.290> nd<00:02:04.549> you<00:02:05.549> get

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
and maximum on this fader nd you get

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.960 
and maximum on this fader nd you get
almost<00:02:06.030> close<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.899> perfect<00:02:07.229> color<00:02:08.190> ratio<00:02:08.670> so

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
almost close to perfect color ratio so

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.249 
almost close to perfect color ratio so
now<00:02:09.090> I'm<00:02:09.209> going<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.479> show<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.660> guys<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.869> series

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.979 
now I'm going to show you guys a series
of<00:02:10.379> images<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.099> I've<00:02:11.670> shot<00:02:11.970> both<00:02:12.360> without

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
of images that I've shot both without

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.820 
of images that I've shot both without
the<00:02:13.230> fader<00:02:13.470> in

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
the fader in

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.190 
the fader in
by<00:02:14.610> using<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.060> aperture<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.540> close<00:02:15.840> down<00:02:16.050> and

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
by using the aperture to close down and

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.290 
by using the aperture to close down and
get<00:02:16.320> correct<00:02:16.620> exposure<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.340> then<00:02:17.850> you'll<00:02:18.030> see

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
get correct exposure and then you'll see

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.080 
get correct exposure and then you'll see
the<00:02:18.480> same<00:02:18.720> image<00:02:19.170> with<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.280> fader<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.760> Dion

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
the same image with the fader and Dion

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.230 
the same image with the fader and Dion
and<00:02:21.480> shooting<00:02:22.380> as<00:02:22.500> fast<00:02:22.770> as<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:23.040> can<00:02:23.310> which<00:02:24.030> is

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
and shooting as fast as I can which is

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.380 
and shooting as fast as I can which is
an<00:02:24.450> f-stop<00:02:25.020> 1.4<00:02:25.980> on<00:02:26.130> this<00:02:26.280> 50mm<00:02:26.610> years<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.210> take

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
an f-stop 1.4 on this 50mm years to take

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:43.270 
an f-stop 1.4 on this 50mm years to take
a<00:02:27.420> look

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:03:36.440 

you

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.840 

so<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:37.540> can<00:03:37.720> see<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.080> dramatic<00:03:38.230> difference

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
so you can see the dramatic difference

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.910 
so you can see the dramatic difference
between<00:03:39.850> using<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.360> fader<00:03:40.600> nd<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:41.230> get<00:03:41.410> great

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
between using a fader nd to get great

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.690 
between using a fader nd to get great
shallow<00:03:42.460> depth-of-field<00:03:43.170> versus<00:03:44.170> not<00:03:44.700> and

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
shallow depth-of-field versus not and

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.150 
shallow depth-of-field versus not and
what<00:03:46.120> this<00:03:46.270> is<00:03:46.510> is<00:03:46.750> it's<00:03:46.960> not<00:03:47.140> it's<00:03:47.680> not<00:03:47.800> just<00:03:47.860> a

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
what this is is it's not it's not just a

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.310 
what this is is it's not it's not just a
tool<00:03:48.430> but<00:03:48.730> it<00:03:48.880> really<00:03:49.090> allows<00:03:49.600> us<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:50.140> get

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
tool but it really allows us to get

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.110 
tool but it really allows us to get
problems<00:03:50.650> out<00:03:50.980> of<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.190> way<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.580> as

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
problems out of the way and as

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.600 
problems out of the way and as
cinematographer<00:03:52.600> Zoar<00:03:53.140> videographers<00:03:53.830> tell

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
cinematographer Zoar videographers tell

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.660 
cinematographer Zoar videographers tell
the<00:03:54.850> story<00:03:55.180> visually<00:03:55.780> or<00:03:56.550> capture<00:03:57.550> those

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
the story visually or capture those

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.990 
the story visually or capture those
images<00:03:58.110> without<00:03:59.110> being<00:03:59.800> tied<00:04:00.100> down<00:04:00.160> by

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
images without being tied down by

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.640 
images without being tied down by
limitations<00:04:01.840> of<00:04:02.320> a<00:04:02.800> camera<00:04:04.350> and<00:04:05.350> that's

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
limitations of a camera and that's

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.950 
limitations of a camera and that's
really<00:04:05.920> what<00:04:06.190> we're<00:04:06.310> trying<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.670> do<00:04:06.850> get<00:04:07.810> the

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
really what we're trying to do get the

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.840 
really what we're trying to do get the
technology<00:04:08.530> out<00:04:08.560> of<00:04:08.740> the<00:04:08.800> way<00:04:08.950> focus<00:04:09.550> on<00:04:09.700> the

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
technology out of the way focus on the

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.230 
technology out of the way focus on the
story<00:04:10.060> focus<00:04:10.720> on<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:11.020> image<00:04:12.000> because<00:04:13.000> that's

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
story focus on the image because that's

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.150 
story focus on the image because that's
really<00:04:13.480> what<00:04:13.720> it's<00:04:13.870> all<00:04:13.990> about<00:04:14.020> so<00:04:14.290> I<00:04:14.530> strongly

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
really what it's all about so I strongly

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.160 
really what it's all about so I strongly
suggest<00:04:15.340> you<00:04:15.610> check<00:04:15.790> these<00:04:16.360> things<00:04:16.420> out<00:04:16.840> this

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
suggest you check these things out this

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.310 
suggest you check these things out this
is<00:04:17.380> again<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:17.830> Lightcraft<00:04:18.220> fader<00:04:18.670> nd<00:04:19.320> this

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
is again the Lightcraft fader nd this

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.360 
is again the Lightcraft fader nd this
one<00:04:20.530> right<00:04:20.680> here<00:04:20.950> was<00:04:21.190> $91<00:04:22.140> it<00:04:23.140> is<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.500> 72

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
one right here was $91 it is the 72

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.310 
one right here was $91 it is the 72
millimeter<00:04:24.850> filter<00:04:25.270> size<00:04:25.480> now<00:04:26.140> what<00:04:26.290> I

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
millimeter filter size now what I

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.050 
millimeter filter size now what I
strongly<00:04:26.770> recommend<00:04:26.980> is<00:04:27.460> you<00:04:27.640> get<00:04:27.850> the

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
strongly recommend is you get the

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.970 
strongly recommend is you get the
largest<00:04:28.480> one<00:04:28.870> that<00:04:28.900> you're<00:04:29.440> think<00:04:29.800> you're

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
largest one that you're think you're

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.280 
largest one that you're think you're
going<00:04:30.160> to<00:04:30.220> need<00:04:30.250> on<00:04:30.730> a<00:04:30.760> lens<00:04:31.060> so<00:04:31.750> for<00:04:31.960> instance

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
going to need on a lens so for instance

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.380 
going to need on a lens so for instance
the<00:04:32.530> largest<00:04:32.860> lenses<00:04:33.220> I'm<00:04:33.370> working<00:04:33.760> with<00:04:33.910> are

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
the largest lenses I'm working with are

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.260 
the largest lenses I'm working with are
72<00:04:34.870> millimeters<00:04:35.560> this<00:04:36.220> is<00:04:36.400> a<00:04:36.430> large<00:04:36.760> zoom<00:04:37.030> lens

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
72 millimeters this is a large zoom lens

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.690 
72 millimeters this is a large zoom lens
from<00:04:37.480> Canon<00:04:37.540> and<00:04:38.140> what<00:04:38.770> I'm<00:04:38.890> able<00:04:39.040> to<00:04:39.160> do<00:04:39.400> is

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
from Canon and what I'm able to do is

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.000 
from Canon and what I'm able to do is
instead<00:04:40.600> of<00:04:40.660> buying<00:04:40.930> a<00:04:41.110> bunch<00:04:41.290> of<00:04:41.380> fader<00:04:41.590> andis

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
instead of buying a bunch of fader andis

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.490 
instead of buying a bunch of fader andis
I<00:04:42.370> can<00:04:43.000> go<00:04:43.240> out<00:04:43.390> and<00:04:43.420> get<00:04:43.720> a<00:04:43.780> bunch<00:04:43.990> of<00:04:44.140> stepper

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
I can go out and get a bunch of stepper

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.950 
I can go out and get a bunch of stepper
rings<00:04:44.800> that<00:04:45.460> 50<00:04:45.850> millimeter<00:04:46.300> lens<00:04:46.390> that<00:04:46.900> I

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
rings that 50 millimeter lens that I

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.930 
rings that 50 millimeter lens that I
have<00:04:47.110> on<00:04:47.230> the<00:04:47.350> 70<00:04:47.770> right<00:04:47.890> now<00:04:48.100> is<00:04:48.400> a<00:04:49.830> 58

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
have on the 70 right now is a 58

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.320 
have on the 70 right now is a 58
millimeter<00:04:51.940> filter<00:04:52.900> size<00:04:53.760> so<00:04:54.760> I<00:04:54.790> can<00:04:54.880> take<00:04:55.210> the

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
millimeter filter size so I can take the

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.580 
millimeter filter size so I can take the
72<00:04:55.870> millimeter<00:04:56.530> filter<00:04:57.240> put<00:04:58.240> it<00:04:58.360> on<00:04:58.480> a<00:04:58.840> stepper

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
72 millimeter filter put it on a stepper

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.400 
72 millimeter filter put it on a stepper
ring<00:04:59.800> and<00:05:00.070> then<00:05:00.790> use<00:05:01.270> it<00:05:01.450> on<00:05:01.570> that<00:05:01.750> lens<00:05:02.080> and<00:05:02.260> if

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
ring and then use it on that lens and if

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.840 
ring and then use it on that lens and if
you<00:05:02.500> get<00:05:02.650> these<00:05:02.830> these<00:05:03.010> are<00:05:03.190> about<00:05:03.370> six<00:05:03.730> to
