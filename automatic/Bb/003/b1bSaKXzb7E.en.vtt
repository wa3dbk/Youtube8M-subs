00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.679
 bordas and beautiful 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:16.839
 fifa not much yet not aware not much especially this 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:19.640
 leads to the internet with the keys of the course 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.739
 I want you to explain to mans 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.739
 what is the course 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.909
 what does it mean for you personally where it all comes from 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.790
 because what has it behind 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.790
 Croatia 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.410
 he is an architect the peeled soul 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.570
 because this club 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.570
 facebook wants to make sense 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.680
 certainly the red philippe athletics gymnastics 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.820
 am I going to touch everything 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.580
 good physical condition but without really knowing how to serve him 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.550
 clinic started telling me about the speed course that had made its 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.190
 physical qualities him 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.310
 but I understood that I understood 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.780
 we have arms of the legs 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.300
 but what is the course yet afraid 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.810
 the course is a training method 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.300
 a physical preparation the obstacles 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.170
 because the time problem 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.110
 what is your family here 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.730
 sacred obstacle course is like the obstacle course but 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.750
 having taken place at the bar 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.660
 more relaxed at the best time 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.820
 and all that 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.560
 we see more now guys who will make sources have written 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.190
 things 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.070
 completely useless 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.060
 because it's like borloo 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.060
 for the only time out there it's made for crystal 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.740
 it is first the useful side 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.910
 we will be careful 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.000
 did the MÃ©tis trio support him when he was no longer caring 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.370
 who does not wear in stairs vincent not beware 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.600
 but for me it is a tree that must pay attention but after with 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.900
 the ease you see young people who will have fun doing 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.120
 they are six but also the extension 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.930
 that's why it's a martial art 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.120
 in philosophy 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.510
 we did what it cost martial 6% 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.720
 the confrontation between the obstacles 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.350
 finally in the martial arts any object of kills this year to hurt or 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.020
 not someone to know who is strong 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.470
 while with the obstacle the trick the encounter was played the euro zone 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.379
 it's you against yourself 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.260
 that's why the beauty of the tax gesture so important that the exhibition in 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.289
 suburbs 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:19.859
 I believe that the beauty of the prophetic gesture 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.859
 she reflects love 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.479
 it's the expression it's fake not tried to do my thing 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.109
 and the strength that you are linking sem 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.399

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:35.789
 a cougar of the magazine pillar English is nice but as we do not materialize 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:38.789
