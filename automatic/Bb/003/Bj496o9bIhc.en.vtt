side exactly do the same this one is a
lot<00:01:52.800> more<00:01:52.950> flimsy<00:01:53.280> but<00:01:53.910> it<00:01:54.060> sounds<00:01:54.300> a<00:01:54.330> lot<00:01:54.420> more

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479

studio because he's got the other side
to<00:01:57.690> hold<00:01:57.870> it<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.260> it<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:59.220> although<00:01:59.670> we'll

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
to hold it on to it so although we'll

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.620 
to hold it on to it so although we'll
just<00:02:00.000> put<00:02:00.150> that<00:02:00.240> back<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:04.520> clicks<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.729> as<00:02:06.390> you'd

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
just put that back on clicks in as you'd

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.810

expect<00:02:06.990> exactly<00:02:07.580> no<00:02:08.580> missing<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:10.760> there<00:02:11.760> you

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
expect exactly no missing and there you

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.640 
expect exactly no missing and there you
go<00:02:11.970> not<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.810> something<00:02:13.020> that's<00:02:13.320> pretty<00:02:13.470> good

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
go not to something that's pretty good

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.700

it's<00:02:20.860> like<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.040> thick<00:02:21.340> it's<00:02:21.640> not<00:02:21.730> really<00:02:22.180> too

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
it's like a thick it's not really too

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.119 
it's like a thick it's not really too
bendable<00:02:22.989> it<00:02:23.769> is<00:02:24.269> bendy<00:02:25.269> but<00:02:25.599> not<00:02:25.980> not<00:02:26.980> the

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
bendable it is bendy but not not the

case<00:02:31.359> was<00:02:31.629> there<00:02:31.870> but<00:02:32.049> certainly<00:02:33.010> looks<00:02:33.159> nice

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.830 

so<00:02:41.310> he<00:02:41.370> doesn't<00:02:41.670> fatten<00:02:42.150> up<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.390> phone<00:02:42.629> too

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840
