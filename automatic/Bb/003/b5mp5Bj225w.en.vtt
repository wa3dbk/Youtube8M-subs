00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.970
 I'm going to prepare some peppers 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.340
 piquillo candied with them 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:18.470
 dishes are usually accompanied 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:21.529
 meat fish but also serves to 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.840
 make for example an appetizer of a 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.390
 montadito of goat cheese with 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.000
 candied peppers that is to say has 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.290
 many applications 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.280
 We're going to need garlic cloves 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:40.129
 piquillo peppers in preserved salt 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:44.340
 olive oil virgin vinegar 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:46.350
 balsamic of modena and sugar 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.870
 the first step we have put in 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.360
 oil in a pan and add a few 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.300
 Garlic cloves when you're just a 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.329
 little gold we will add the peppers 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.780
 of the piquillo 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.570
 that those taught in strips also 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.200
 can leave whole but good in me 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.080
 I like them like that and I've split them or 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.659
 just lengthwise in strips once 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.270
 that we added the peppers what 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:19.340
 we will have about half an hour on fire very 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:22.350
 shortly we add a little salt 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.320
 and we also add 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.530
 to sugar 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.950
 I'm going to put it about two tablespoons 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.950
 of sugar 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:41.530
 and we will need to add the vinegar 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.130
 modena now let's leave this that 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.130
 go doing little by little and 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.130
 we will continue 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.010
 we also add the spoonful of 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.010
 Modena vinegar 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.830
 and now we will remove from time to time 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.560
 when 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.050
 but good now let's leave it a 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.310
 half an hour so everything is conquered 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.440
 fine and then we will continue 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.470
 you see little by little how it is going 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.260
 evaporating the water that the 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.690
 peppers is becoming a salsita more 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.170
 thick and the peppers are gone 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.810
 softening it still fits like a 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.750
 little room of hour so we'll wait for 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.150
 see the result pass to the average 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.450
 This is the result 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.870
 very rich and now we have them 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.599
 take out a container you can eat it 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.180
 in cold dishes that is already to taste of 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.700
 each one and even you can also 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.370
 vote to save it for quite 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.830
 time but good as we have done a 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.650
 very small amount because it is for 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.269
 consume it immediately then 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.269
 I hope you liked the idea 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.720
 this is our final result 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.720
 of candied peppers
