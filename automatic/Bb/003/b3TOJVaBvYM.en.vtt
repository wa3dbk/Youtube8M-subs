macros<00:00:01.050> to<00:00:02.330> create<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.360> macro<00:00:03.600> we're<00:00:04.500> going<00:00:04.650> to

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
macros to create a macro we're going to

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.629 
macros to create a macro we're going to
have<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.980> do<00:00:05.160> is<00:00:05.720> start<00:00:06.720> macros<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.639> macros

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
have to do is start macros and macros

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.839 
have to do is start macros and macros
are<00:00:08.790> located<00:00:09.269> right<00:00:09.420> here<00:00:10.250> now<00:00:11.250> I'm<00:00:11.550> going<00:00:11.790> to

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
are located right here now I'm going to

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.020 
are located right here now I'm going to
make<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.000> macro<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.660> makes<00:00:13.410> this<00:00:14.030> sculpting

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
make a macro that makes this sculpting

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.840 
make a macro that makes this sculpting
plane<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.680> we<00:00:16.800> can<00:00:16.980> quickly<00:00:17.220> go<00:00:17.550> through<00:00:17.580> the

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
plane so we can quickly go through the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.590 
plane so we can quickly go through the
brushes<00:00:18.300> later<00:00:18.539> on<00:00:18.920> so<00:00:20.119> let's<00:00:21.119> make<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.420> new

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
brushes later on so let's make a new

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.560 
brushes later on so let's make a new
macro<00:00:22.789> and<00:00:23.789> follow<00:00:24.060> along<00:00:24.180> very<00:00:24.600> closely

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
macro and follow along very closely

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.700 
macro and follow along very closely
first<00:00:27.570> off<00:00:27.810> go<00:00:28.199> over<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:29.359> and<00:00:30.359> pick<00:00:30.660> 3d<00:00:31.470> plane

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
first off go over here and pick 3d plane

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:41.030 
first off go over here and pick 3d plane
click<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.860> drag<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.190> out<00:00:36.440> hit<00:00:37.440> edit<00:00:39.469> hit<00:00:40.469> make

click and drag it out hit edit hit make

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:50.889 
click and drag it out hit edit hit make
a<00:00:41.250> poly<00:00:41.520> mesh<00:00:46.070> go<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.129> geometry<00:00:49.370> divide<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
a poly mesh go to geometry divide and

00:00:50.899 --> 00:01:00.490 
a poly mesh go to geometry divide and
divide<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.590> level<00:00:55.370> six

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.430 

ok

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
ok

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:16.110 
ok
and<00:01:02.559> then<00:01:03.399> we<00:01:04.330> need<00:01:04.510> do<00:01:04.720> in<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:06.070> macro

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.780 

i'm<00:01:16.630> going<00:01:16.780> to<00:01:16.840> call<00:01:16.990> this<00:01:17.020> macro<00:01:20.490> plane<00:01:21.490> and

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
i'm going to call this macro plane and

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.080 
i'm going to call this macro plane and
it's<00:01:22.240> going<00:01:22.420> to<00:01:22.540> be<00:01:22.690> located<00:01:23.040> underneath<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
it's going to be located underneath the

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:37.350 
it's going to be located underneath the
z<00:01:25.480> startup<00:01:28.950> macros<00:01:31.230> miscellaneous

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.860 

should<00:01:38.360> be<00:01:38.450> located<00:01:38.930> here

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.830 

then<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:44.800> could<00:01:45.400> take<00:01:45.550> that<00:01:45.700> macro<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.510> then

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
then I could take that macro and then

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.620 
then I could take that macro and then
put<00:01:47.110> it<00:01:47.230> over<00:01:47.410> to<00:01:48.130> my<00:01:48.670> menu<00:01:49.000> over<00:01:49.210> here<00:01:49.240> on<00:01:49.480> the

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
put it over to my menu over here on the

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.360 
put it over to my menu over here on the
other<00:01:49.660> side<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:53.500> take<00:01:53.710> that<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:54.070> put<00:01:54.100> it<00:01:54.280> over

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
other side so take that and put it over

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:03.770 
other side so take that and put it over
there<00:01:54.550> first

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.740

we<00:03:17.900> go<00:03:18.160> and<00:03:19.160> I<00:03:19.280> can<00:03:19.430> take<00:03:19.520> the<00:03:19.670> standard<00:03:20.030> brush

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
we go and I can take the standard brush

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.830 
we go and I can take the standard brush
and<00:03:20.450> paint<00:03:20.780> on<00:03:20.959> it<00:03:20.989> when<00:03:21.920> I<00:03:21.950> get<00:03:22.040> done<00:03:22.340> with<00:03:22.520> it

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
and paint on it when I get done with it

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.470 
and paint on it when I get done with it
initialize<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:24.020> brush<00:03:24.230> again<00:03:27.160> perfect<00:03:28.480> now

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
initialize the brush again perfect now

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.990 
initialize the brush again perfect now
we<00:03:29.540> have<00:03:29.750> a<00:03:29.780> good<00:03:30.170> atmosphere<00:03:30.520> to<00:03:31.520> start

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
we have a good atmosphere to start

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.460 
we have a good atmosphere to start
learning<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.360> brushes<00:03:32.870> because<00:03:33.050> I<00:03:33.320> can

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
learning the brushes because I can

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.370 
learning the brushes because I can
quickly<00:03:33.709> make<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.040> plane<00:03:34.370> quickly<00:03:35.299> go<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.750> kind

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
quickly make a plane quickly go to kind

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.130 
quickly make a plane quickly go to kind
of<00:03:36.440> go<00:03:36.560> into<00:03:36.769> how<00:03:37.070> that<00:03:37.250> brush<00:03:37.489> works<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.140> then

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
of go into how that brush works and then

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.550 
of go into how that brush works and then
out<00:03:39.950> again<00:03:40.060> we<00:03:41.060> need<00:03:41.090> one<00:03:41.480> more<00:03:41.510> macro<00:03:41.930> which

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
out again we need one more macro which

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.890 
out again we need one more macro which
I'm<00:03:42.799> going<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.130> explain<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.180> you<00:03:44.420> in<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.690> next
