00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The PlayBook as it stands today...
Sorry
[laughter]

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Umm, the PlayBook as it...
I'm getting one of those recursive loops which you see in [unclear speech]

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So the PlayBook as it stands today, has a front facing camera and a rear facing camera.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Both support 1080p HD, so you get some pretty impressive video through that as well.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So we're inside the application we can actually just switch it around and you can see my face.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Hello.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So, this is the front facing camera obviously and you can see at the top that we can switch it very easily between using video camera and using the camera itself.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And then its just as easy as recording.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And then we can switch it back so we can see everybody else.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And again similar to before, this is where all the options are when you swipe down from the top.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So this is a nice segue to jump over to the video app.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So inside the video app

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
(I'm going to show you the recorded ones)
we've got a nice little high-def demonstration. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So now this is a video as its playing on the device and (let me turn my volume here so everybody can hear)

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
[music]

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So that kind of background noise, that's actually Need For Speed still running in the background. You can kind of hear a little subtrack in there. I've got it turned down as far as I can, but it has a little bit of weight.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So, this also proves that Need For Speed is still running in the background, so its multi-tasking. So you can turn that off and I can show you how to do that inside the options.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
[applause]

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Impressive. Ok.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So now, here's what's really cool. We tap on this and you can see all the different pieces, right.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So you can see that we can tap on the top-left corner and we would go back into ...

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Hear that now? That's Need For Speed, ok.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
That's the Need For Speed track that I was talking to you guys about. And I'll turn it back down.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now if you go back into the video, you can see that there's another one up in the top-right hand corner.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
If I click this, this actually puts the video up there but now I'm running on my device, I've got just big controls. This is what we call Presenter Mode.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So in this case, its feeding the HDMI, [...] or the full video out to HDMI, but on the device I now have full control.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So instead of it being Mirror Mode, I can watch the movie, and I can do anything I want.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So in fact, I can come back over here and play Need For Speed, while I'm still pouring the video out there and...

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
[applause]
So that's how [fast]

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Ok, so we'll come back to Need For Speed in a minute.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Ok, so like I said, you'll never rent a movie in another hotel room ever again.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So, full control over all these pieces. And you can do that inside your own application. So the other place we've implemented that on the device is, not surprisingly, the PowerPoint application which is Slides To Go.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So inside Slides To Go you can put that into Presenter Mode, you can see your notes and slides and the actual full presentation is done out through HDMI.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
[...] going to use it as you won't have to carry around a projector - if you can find something that supports HDMI,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
just plug it in the back of the big wide-screen TV in the meeting room and off you go.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Okay...
&gt;&gt; Is that API going to be available for apps?
&gt;&gt; Yea, this is available for apps today. Yup, absolutely.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Ok, so I'm going to go, ..., back out of Mirror Mode here.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Ok, so now you can really see my screen again. So what's cool is that you can see - you can still hear Need For Speed - and the camera is actually running in this little, small window.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And what's totally insane is that - let's get rid of the pictures so you can see better. So I have the camera running, and I can actually run Need For Speed and the camera at the same time.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Like that.
Ok, so let's, ..., let's pause that for a second. I'm going to get rid of the camera.
Now,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Tariq and I are going to show you guys, so Tariq's running over there, to show you guys some of the other stuff so everybody can see across the room.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So we're going to run a couple of different Need For Speed demos, so you guys can actually see what its like. So the one that I'm running is actually a, cop crashing crazy one,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
where you actually have to smash cop cars with your car.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
[laughter].
Not recommended in real life.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And you actually, its like a take-down type of event. 
And, so, but you guys can't see is that, I'm playing this off the big screen, but

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
this is all exactly what's happening on the device. The exact same thing.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So I can look on the device, or I can look on the full-screen.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And the best place I've ever seen this demonstrated is at an Adobe vendor event we did in South Korea about 3 weeks ago.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And we had a full HD setup with 60 foot screens, and one of my guys played Need For Speed on the screen and it was phenomenal.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
The police will try to arrest you if you slow down.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Ooh, drifting... yesss.
[laughter]
[some comments about game]

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Busted! So as you can see, how addictive this is. And this is the stuff that's going to come out of the box, ok.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So you can have a variety of different applications you can use from YouTube, to the Kobo Book Reader to Bing Maps.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000
The weather application is quite good as well. So there's tons of really cool things you'll be able to check out. And we think,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
I'm going to search for Toronto just for you guys.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
[laughter]
[some comment about typing]

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And I will, I'll also, do this just so you guys can prove that, that I can prove to you guys that this works as well.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
That's the OTA software download. That's not what I wanted.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So I have the orientation, I can turn the orientation lock on and off as well.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So for example, if I turn it side-ways it won't change. It does that automatically in HDMI, which is why its not doing it.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So we picked Toronto and you can see, uh, [...] about it.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:56.000
So, again, like, really simple easy stuff that you'll be able to do that use the product and needless to say, we're very excited about it.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Yes, question.
&gt;&gt; Any video chat [...]?
&gt;&gt; Yea.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Yea, so it would be a PlayBook to PlayBook. 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:16.000
&gt;&gt; Skype?
&gt;&gt; No, Skype is not on the product yet. All the APIs that allow Skype to do what they need to do are there, but they won't be there at launch.
