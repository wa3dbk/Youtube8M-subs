00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.240 
here to do the bean boozled challenge
Garrett<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.170> mean<00:00:13.380> like<00:00:13.500> it's<00:00:13.650> just<00:00:13.889> gonna<00:00:14.040> be

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
Garrett I mean like it's just gonna be

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.060 
Garrett I mean like it's just gonna be
units<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:14.880> shouldn't<00:00:15.179> be<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:15.330> bad<00:00:15.719> right<00:00:16.070> and

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
units it shouldn't be that bad right and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.130 
units it shouldn't be that bad right and
I<00:00:17.279> think<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.820> sort<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.330> have<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.630> slight

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
I think we sort of have a slight

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.689 
I think we sort of have a slight
advantage<00:00:19.170> because<00:00:20.010> we<00:00:21.230> ate<00:00:22.279> hot<00:00:23.279> cheetos

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
advantage because we ate hot cheetos

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.120 
advantage because we ate hot cheetos
