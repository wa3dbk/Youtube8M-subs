00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
lots of people think this is kind of

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.840 
lots of people think this is kind of
pointless<00:01:54.100> that<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.220> bands<00:01:55.460> might<00:01:55.729> be

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
dangerous

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
dangerous
but<00:01:57.409> I<00:01:57.800> think<00:01:58.100> it's<00:01:58.370> brilliant<00:01:58.570> if<00:01:59.570> ever<00:01:59.960> my

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
but I think it's brilliant if ever my

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.240 
but I think it's brilliant if ever my
birds<00:02:00.920> flew<00:02:01.340> away<00:02:01.460> or<00:02:02.860> there<00:02:03.860> was<00:02:03.979> an<00:02:04.070> issue

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
birds flew away or there was an issue

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:09.409 
with somebody stealing my bird the only

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.710 
with somebody stealing my bird the only
way<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.619> can<00:02:09.860> take<00:02:10.129> a<00:02:10.159> band<00:02:10.549> like<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.060> off<00:02:11.450> of

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
way you can take a band like that off of
