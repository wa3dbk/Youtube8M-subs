video let's start by looking at the
advantages<00:00:04.529> of<00:00:04.620> having<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.950> 10<00:00:05.190> who<00:00:05.400> takes<00:00:05.670> the

advantages of having a 10 who takes the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
with Barry Bonds at 10 is that he starts

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.759 
with Barry Bonds at 10 is that he starts
too<00:00:29.670> deep<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.570> very<00:00:30.840> rarely<00:00:31.080> takes<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.590> ball

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
too deep so very rarely takes the ball

can see here when he does start flatter

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.520 
can see here when he does start flatter
he<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.360> quite<00:00:36.600> good<00:00:36.809> at<00:00:36.930> taking<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.290> ball<00:00:37.410> to

by taking the ball to the line he

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.900 
by taking the ball to the line he

attracts the Argentine defenders and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.369 
attracts the Argentine defenders and
that's<00:00:45.090> what<00:00:45.300> opens<00:00:45.629> up<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.899> hole<00:00:46.050> for<00:00:46.260> you

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.839 
World Cup in 2011 then I think Barry
Bonds<00:04:12.389> is<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:12.750> best<00:04:12.930> candidate<00:04:13.549> but<00:04:14.549> I<00:04:14.579> don't

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
Bonds is the best candidate but I don't

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.099 
Bonds is the best candidate but I don't
think<00:04:15.000> that's<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.299> way<00:04:15.329> the<00:04:15.569> Wallabies<00:04:15.810> can

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
think that's the way the Wallabies can

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.920 
think that's the way the Wallabies can
