00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.599
 Hello everyone 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.160
 It is Yassun of the world rubber market 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:17.410
 This time 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:20.230
 I think that I want to do it by how to play against the top rotation of the back table software 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.220
 I have a question this time 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:30.189
 I'm Shake Back and Front 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:32.160
 Table software so it is possible to play strongly the ball of the rotation and the upper rotation was But how 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.910
 Do you do 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.610
 Especially I want to know how to play strongly against downward rotation 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.360
 You wish 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:44.110
 It is said that 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:48.050
 This time we will keep up against turning upwards next time 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:54.230
 I will do it for the bottom turn 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:59.570
 Rotation on top of the on whether Tteyuu rotation is the rotation on the drive Saab say little of questioner's 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:02.120
 I do not know for a while, but this time I'm doing it against the up serve 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.449
 I want to go there 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.400
 Against evil serve 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:12.720
 It will only fit 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:17.310
 If you are not good at up serve, you will not know what to do 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:22.630
 If hit, it will hit the third ball attack with high probability 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:28.360
 If you are troubled with such content, please take a look 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:31.500
 For the ex-men there, I can take the lead from the receive up-serve and attack 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:37.100
 Quite important thing is to say 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:40.990
 As a front squad if you can not get a solid battle here 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:45.960
 It will be difficult to attack firmly 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.960
 Please take a close look at this point quite important 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.470
 I think that I would like to explain the people 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.120
 At first just apply for the upper rotation firmly 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:03.820
 Please look for an angle that exceeds the net 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:10.479
 Here that is not play next time you or I towards the bottom in an attempt to suppress with respect to the upper rotation 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:12.300
 In order to find the procedure of using the rotation of the upper rotation just to hit firmly 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.020
 I will 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.020
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.319
 Ha ha ha 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.410
 There Yes 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.860
 ok was 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:32.620
 Then 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.310
 If you remember the angle Tteyuu exceeds the net to the back serve in the first one of the steps in turn 2 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.690
 Go to the second step 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.690
 In the second step 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:48.970
 Since it is fine from the same position, please flip the wrist from that angle and flip it off 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.970
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.960
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.150
 re 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.590
 th 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.280
 Hmm 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.530
 Bach
