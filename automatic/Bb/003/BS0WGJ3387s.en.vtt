the artillery shells I think these might
be<00:03:35.640> illegal<00:03:35.850> because<00:03:36.150> these<00:03:36.420> are<00:03:37.280> pretty

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
be illegal because these are pretty

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.039 
be illegal because these are pretty
powerful<00:03:38.640> I<00:03:38.790> meant<00:03:39.030> two<00:03:39.180> inch<00:03:39.360> ones<00:03:39.630> instead

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
powerful I meant two inch ones instead

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.569 
powerful I meant two inch ones instead
of<00:03:40.200> just<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.470> normal<00:03:40.769> one<00:03:40.980> inch<00:03:41.130> ones<00:03:41.370> or

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
of just the normal one inch ones or

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:56.479 
of just the normal one inch ones or
whatever<00:03:41.790> they<00:03:41.940> are<00:03:51.170> and<00:03:54.470> that's<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:55.739> I<00:03:55.950> think

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
whatever they are and that's it I think

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:05.680 
whatever they are and that's it I think
I'd<00:03:56.630> spent<00:03:57.630> a<00:04:00.079> hundred<00:04:01.519> and<00:04:04.070> ten

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
I'd spent a hundred and ten

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.570 
I'd spent a hundred and ten
together<00:04:05.930> for<00:04:06.290> this<00:04:06.740> I<00:04:06.950> think<00:04:07.160> that's<00:04:07.340> what<00:04:07.490> it

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
together for this I think that's what it

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.370 
together for this I think that's what it
was<00:04:08.440> so<00:04:09.440> pretty<00:04:09.920> good<00:04:10.040> deal
