street this is also a felt tip eyeliner

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.770 
street this is also a felt tip eyeliner
so<00:00:16.720> I<00:00:16.960> start<00:00:17.500> by<00:00:17.740> making<00:00:18.220> a<00:00:18.520> line<00:00:18.789> going

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:19.780 
so I start by making a line going

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.080 
so I start by making a line going
straight<00:00:20.259> up<00:00:20.289> the<00:00:20.470> same<00:00:20.830> as<00:00:21.070> my<00:00:21.429> bottom<00:00:21.880> lash

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
straight up the same as my bottom lash

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.890 
straight up the same as my bottom lash
line<00:00:22.119> like<00:00:22.539> this<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:27.189> before<00:00:27.730> I<00:00:27.970> start<00:00:28.509> lining

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
line like this and before I start lining

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.190 
line like this and before I start lining
in<00:00:29.199> the<00:00:29.560> whole<00:00:29.740> cat<00:00:30.160> line<00:00:30.429> I<00:00:30.730> do<00:00:31.269> my<00:00:31.749> other<00:00:31.960> eye

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
in the whole cat line I do my other eye

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.350 
in the whole cat line I do my other eye
so<00:00:32.619> I<00:00:32.650> can<00:00:33.010> make<00:00:33.160> sure<00:00:33.190> it's<00:00:33.579> even<00:00:34.060> on<00:00:34.180> both

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
so I can make sure it's even on both

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.990 
so I can make sure it's even on both
sides<00:00:34.930> after<00:00:35.800> I<00:00:36.100> have<00:00:36.310> this<00:00:36.460> line<00:00:36.760> right<00:00:36.940> here

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
sides after I have this line right here

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.110 
sides after I have this line right here
and<00:00:37.800> making<00:00:38.800> sure<00:00:39.160> it<00:00:39.310> matches<00:00:39.460> the<00:00:39.730> other<00:00:39.880> eye

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
and making sure it matches the other eye

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.200 
and making sure it matches the other eye
i<00:00:40.570> will<00:00:41.530> start<00:00:41.770> at<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.160> end<00:00:42.340> right<00:00:42.580> here<00:00:42.940> and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
bigger the illusion will be I start to

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.680 
bigger the illusion will be I start to
fill<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.649> front<00:01:40.920> part<00:01:41.160> by<00:01:41.789> dabbing<00:01:42.509> in

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
fill in the front part by dabbing in

00:01:42.690 --> 00:02:07.359 
fill in the front part by dabbing in
small<00:01:43.530> streaks

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.800 

joining<00:02:08.369> small<00:02:08.640> streaks<00:02:09.000> first<00:02:09.300> help<00:02:09.630> you

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
joining small streaks first help you

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.260 
joining small streaks first help you
line<00:02:10.140> up<00:02:10.170> where<00:02:11.009> your<00:02:11.220> line<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.430> going<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.120> be

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
line up where your line is going to be

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.690 
line up where your line is going to be
so<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:13.110> will<00:02:13.200> be<00:02:13.230> easier<00:02:13.680> for<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.069> make<00:02:14.490> the

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
so it will be easier for you to make the

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:32.080 
so it will be easier for you to make the
line<00:02:14.880> smooth<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:16.410> second<00:02:16.740> time

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.880 

because<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.120> have<00:02:33.390> small<00:02:33.720> eyes<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:34.290> usually<00:02:34.530> like

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
because I have small eyes I usually like

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.950 
because I have small eyes I usually like
to<00:02:35.270> make<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.480> end<00:02:36.660> really<00:02:37.110> really<00:02:37.560> big
