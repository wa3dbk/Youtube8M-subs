00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
and as with the last time there's going

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.480 
and as with the last time there's going
to<00:01:59.149> be<00:01:59.180> a<00:01:59.270> couple<00:01:59.810> of<00:02:00.020> different<00:02:00.700> mini-map<00:02:01.700> xml

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
to be a couple of different mini-map xml

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.539 
to be a couple of different mini-map xml
config<00:02:03.360> files<00:02:03.689> one<00:02:04.409> for<00:02:04.680> color<00:02:04.860> blind<00:02:05.130> one<00:02:05.340> for

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
config files one for color blind one for

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.900 
config files one for color blind one for
non<00:02:05.700> color<00:02:06.000> blind<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.720> also<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.920> kind<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
non color blind and also the kind of the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.540 
non color blind and also the kind of the
default<00:02:09.360> one<00:02:09.630> that<00:02:10.200> comes<00:02:10.410> with<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.709> as<00:02:11.310> per

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
default one that comes with it as per

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.210 
default one that comes with it as per
standard<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:12.989> think<00:02:13.170> we're<00:02:13.260> Jimbo's<00:02:13.620> also

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
standard and I think we're Jimbo's also

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.100 
standard and I think we're Jimbo's also
I've<00:02:14.489> put<00:02:14.819> in<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.060> Jimbo's<00:02:15.360> optionals<00:02:15.870> files

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
I've put in the Jimbo's optionals files

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.440 
I've put in the Jimbo's optionals files
in<00:02:16.410> there<00:02:16.590> as<00:02:16.770> well<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.250> can<00:02:17.450> experiment

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
in there as well so you can experiment

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.110 
in there as well so you can experiment
with<00:02:18.720> different<00:02:19.080> Jimbo's<00:02:19.920> reticles<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.640> see

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
with different Jimbo's reticles and see

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.259 
with different Jimbo's reticles and see
what<00:02:21.269> see<00:02:21.750> which<00:02:21.870> ones<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.290> like<00:02:22.319> best<00:02:23.269> so

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
what see which ones you like best so

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.199 
what see which ones you like best so
hopefully<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.840> covers<00:02:25.170> everything<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:27.060> can

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
hopefully that covers everything you can

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.320 
hopefully that covers everything you can
ask<00:02:27.390> questions<00:02:27.599> below<00:02:28.319> but<00:02:29.190> as<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:30.030> said<00:02:30.180> I

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
ask questions below but as I said I

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.089 
ask questions below but as I said I
really<00:02:30.750> can't<00:02:31.140> guarantee<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.830> will<00:02:31.950> be

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
really can't guarantee that I will be

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.820 
really can't guarantee that I will be
able<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.310> give<00:02:32.519> you<00:02:32.670> an<00:02:32.849> answer<00:02:33.060> if<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.480> have

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
able to give you an answer if you have

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.710 
able to give you an answer if you have
the<00:02:34.830> only<00:02:35.040> other<00:02:35.160> thing<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.819> want<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.150> note<00:02:36.420> is

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
the only other thing I want to note is

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.520 
the only other thing I want to note is
that<00:02:37.580> code<00:02:38.580> Oh<00:02:38.700> Sees<00:02:38.940> hit<00:02:39.150> log<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.660> because<00:02:40.440> it

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
that code Oh Sees hit log and because it

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.460 
that code Oh Sees hit log and because it
uses<00:02:40.920> bits<00:02:41.549> all<00:02:41.790> XVM<00:02:42.299> to<00:02:42.450> work<00:02:42.630> as<00:02:43.049> far<00:02:43.290> as<00:02:43.380> i

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
uses bits all XVM to work as far as i

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.880 
uses bits all XVM to work as far as i
know<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.799> is<00:02:43.950> not<00:02:43.980> compatible<00:02:44.640> with<00:02:45.180> XP<00:02:45.810> m<00:02:46.019> so

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
know it is not compatible with XP m so

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.070 
know it is not compatible with XP m so
in<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:48.060> case<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.569> can<00:02:48.720> only<00:02:48.870> suggest

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
in that case I can only suggest

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.789 
in that case I can only suggest

a<00:03:04.709> bit<00:03:04.920> more<00:03:05.190> work<00:03:05.459> but<00:03:06.350> having<00:03:07.350> that<00:03:07.910> many

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
a bit more work but having that many

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.930 
a bit more work but having that many
different<00:03:09.450> versions<00:03:09.690> is<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:11.430> would<00:03:11.609> be<00:03:11.760> with<00:03:11.910> a

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
different versions is it would be with a

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.479 
different versions is it would be with a
pain<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.510> don't<00:03:12.750> know<00:03:13.410> how<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.739> get<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.250> to

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
pain and I don't know how to get that to

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.000 
pain and I don't know how to get that to
work<00:03:14.519> with<00:03:14.880> XVM<00:03:15.390> without<00:03:15.959> installing<00:03:16.380> XVM

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
work with XVM without installing XVM

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.090 
work with XVM without installing XVM
doing<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.370> lot<00:03:17.489> of<00:03:17.549> mucking<00:03:17.970> around<00:03:18.060> myself<00:03:18.390> so

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
yeah I I I know nothing about XVM I will

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.670 
yeah I I I know nothing about XVM I will
freely<00:03:22.890> admit<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.489> but<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.450> don't<00:03:24.870> know<00:03:24.959> there
