 their 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:30.189
 for funds and returned to celebrate to show that their little ones and dancers 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.060
 series never give up in the face of adversity 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.060
 his secondary studies in his mission 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.800
 in this installment it's a lot short so that at once 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.620
 dan harem theme 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.930
 after suffering for weeks all kinds of expletives an immense showed his 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.360
 the hammer jumped fraga 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.140
 we start like this with a usual Japanese guy who returns his strength with the rhythm 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.340
 of the two thugs 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.490
 to later meet other classmates 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.530
 They will discover a new enemy 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.379
 the cÃ¡rmenes 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.379
 that will not make things easy 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.810
 for funds and assets that most likely is similar to the previous 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.580
 touring the right facility whenever marking a rhythm with the buttons 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.580
 we decided song should take the two warriors 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.490
 he who walks until he drives down for example 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.410
 Throughout our hesperia hotel we will find a large number of soldiers 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.550
 enemies to annihilate 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.550
 although it will not make things difficult 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.470
 to make things easier 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.180
 born the event figure 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.180
 a legendary leg because they help us 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.080
 in addition to being superior to your partner about it at your doors the property 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.970
 of breivik after a few seconds to become weakened 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.970
 mandujano 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.850
 but if we want to succeed 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.110
 it is not enough to give orders we should feel the music 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.550
 if we follow the rhythm correctly I know neither enters into a feverish state 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.580
 emboldening between songs and dances 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.390
 fostering swarzak and defense 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.909
 As a novelty, the affected dictatorship marks the rhythm perfectly 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.559
 our hero will unleash a special ability depending on him 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.639
 efe inform efe 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:18.619
 and again to cover with a magical 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:21.619
 the Cuban between tijuana throw a rain of alternates 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:24.899
 keep fever 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:28.229
 since wasting time I could suppose there is the banana goat 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:32.069
 the battles are usually something long circulating more than 10 thousand 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.219
 someone must be quite concentrated so as not to fail 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:45.459
 another possible civil action each of the previous game just a miracle the 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.269
 which we can perform during a fever 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.109
 after a small dance that will determine the strength of the miracle we detect a 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.250
 power that can be helpful as invoking a storm 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.479
 When we create units, we find another fairly juicy novelty and that is that 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:03.479
 we will not create units using materials without rhyme or reason 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.409
 we have a revolution scheme that we can improve our creatures and 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:13.349
 empower them by choosing different ways simply to level up respecting their 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.309
 current state 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:18.789
 as we evolve our beings we will unlock new types of soldiers 

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:22.279
 as I do not go to the flying paragraphs 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:25.369
 to obtain the necessary materials for operations 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:29.129
 we must resort to home missions or try your luck in several mini-games 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.609
 jaime lobera de patapon 2 jesus has included a multiplayer mode to play 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.739
 in Basque mode with our friends in different missions 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.739
 controlling each one a baby unlocking new challenges according to 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.689
 let's move forward in our adventure 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:51.840
 also at the end of each mission we will participate in a small said what 

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:54.839
 which will determine the amount of our oscar awards 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.729
 if you need background returns with impeccable artistic style 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:08.009
 Simple graphic that feels like a glove 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:10.659
 the melodies are the strong point of the fire 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.620
 the songs of the bread to ponzo pegaditos and to which we fell in love with them 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.000
 while the sound of weapons and the screams of the fallen rays accompanying 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.489
 happy panels 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.720
 it's a bit long and playable with a lot of missions and situations that 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.370
 improvement in all aspects amount of delivery 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.969
 except for one 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:30.460
 the originality 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.460
 however this is not much of a problem 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.689
 because football has enough food to eat so that those who know 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:40.159
 after approving the first paragraph 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:43.159
 great how big with style 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:47.619
