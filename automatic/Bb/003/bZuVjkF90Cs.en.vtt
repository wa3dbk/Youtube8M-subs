00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
you first started discovering it and

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.380 
you first started discovering it and
really<00:00:19.949> getting<00:00:20.220> into<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:21.180> began

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
really getting into it and began

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.939

which<00:00:24.869> really<00:00:25.170> kind<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.070> began<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.910> movement

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
which really kind of began this movement

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
latte art and that really started again

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.709

in the early 90s at least in America of
course<00:00:41.850> several<00:00:42.780> people<00:00:43.079> along<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.440> way<00:00:43.469> have

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
course several people along the way have

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.440 
course several people along the way have
put<00:00:43.950> their<00:00:44.070> own<00:00:44.100> stamp<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.850> people<00:00:45.090> like

put their own stamp on it people like

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.799 
put their own stamp on it people like
like<00:00:46.110> krysta<00:00:46.500> Furio<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.730> couple<00:00:48.660> decades

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
like krysta Furio and a couple decades

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.510 
like krysta Furio and a couple decades
later<00:00:49.289> came<00:00:49.620> along<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.070> started<00:00:50.340> doing

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
later came along and started doing

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.029 
later came along and started doing
really<00:00:50.850> cool<00:00:51.030> stuff<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.539> later<00:00:52.530> christopher

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
really cool stuff and later christopher

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.410 
really cool stuff and later christopher
nicely<00:00:53.430> people<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.210> really

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
nicely people like that have really

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.110 
nicely people like that have really
started<00:00:54.770> kind<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.800> taking<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.309> an<00:00:56.670> all<00:00:56.969> new

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
started kind of taking it in an all new

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.959 
started kind of taking it in an all new
direction<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.809> has<00:00:57.870> evolved<00:00:58.469> into<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.370> much

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
direction it has evolved into a a much

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.310 
direction it has evolved into a a much
different<00:01:00.420> thing<00:01:00.629> than<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.899> was<00:01:01.109> when<00:01:01.289> it

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
different thing than it was when it

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.529 
different thing than it was when it
began<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.949> began<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> very<00:01:02.850> basic<00:01:03.180> way<00:01:03.480> to

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
began it began as a very basic way to

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.109 
began it began as a very basic way to
intentionally<00:01:04.320> mix<00:01:04.949> espresso<00:01:05.369> with<00:01:05.610> milk<00:01:05.880> in

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
intentionally mix espresso with milk in

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.090 
intentionally mix espresso with milk in
a<00:01:06.240> way<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.720> was<00:01:06.930> recognizable<00:01:07.530> maybe<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.010> a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
a way that was recognizable maybe in a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.390 
a way that was recognizable maybe in a
heart<00:01:08.369> or<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.670> dot<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.990> now<00:01:10.049> we<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.040> do<00:01:11.189> so

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
heart or a dot and now we can just do so

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.219 
heart or a dot and now we can just do so
much<00:01:11.640> everything<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.210> still<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.720> combination

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
much everything is still the combination

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.130 
much everything is still the combination
of<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.530> heart<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.920> leaf<00:01:14.189> or<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> dot<00:01:14.900> but<00:01:15.900> arranging

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
of a heart a leaf or a dot but arranging

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.560 
of a heart a leaf or a dot but arranging
them<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.650> different<00:01:16.770> ways<00:01:17.030> really<00:01:18.030> enables<00:01:18.479> us

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
them in different ways really enables us

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.179 
them in different ways really enables us
to<00:01:18.630> make<00:01:18.869> some<00:01:19.110> very<00:01:19.590> intricate<00:01:20.159> very

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
to make some very intricate very

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.859 
to make some very intricate very
interesting<00:01:20.909> designs<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.509> coffee

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
interesting designs and coffee

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.190 
interesting designs and coffee
there<00:01:22.560> are<00:01:22.680> several<00:01:22.890> objective<00:01:24.200> quality

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
there are several objective quality

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.039 
there are several objective quality
markers<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:25.950> latte<00:01:26.280> art<00:01:26.689> especially<00:01:27.689> as

if<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.710> design<00:02:16.040> takes<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.730> very<00:02:17.030> long<00:02:17.270> amount<00:02:17.660> of

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
if a design takes a very long amount of

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.690 
if a design takes a very long amount of
time<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:18.320> know<00:02:18.410> you're<00:02:18.860> not<00:02:19.010> doing<00:02:19.340> your<00:02:19.490> job

as<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:19.910> barista<00:02:20.180> as<00:02:20.450> well<00:02:20.600> as<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:20.870> could<00:02:21.050> be<00:02:21.200> so

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
as a barista as well as you could be so

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.410 
as a barista as well as you could be so
speed<00:02:21.890> is<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.040> factor<00:02:22.220> if<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:23.060> takes<00:02:23.210> a<00:02:23.270> very

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
speed is a factor if it takes a very

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.730 
speed is a factor if it takes a very
long<00:02:23.690> time<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.080> produce<00:02:24.230> something<00:02:24.560> that

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
long time to produce something that

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.050 
long time to produce something that
means<00:02:25.070> that<00:02:25.190> someone<00:02:25.430> has<00:02:25.460> waited<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:25.910> long

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
means that someone has waited a long

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.880 
means that someone has waited a long
time<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.480> get<00:02:26.660> that<00:02:26.900> very<00:02:27.260> beautiful<00:02:27.770> design

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
time to get that very beautiful design

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.800 
time to get that very beautiful design
but<00:02:28.310> maybe<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.670> drink<00:02:28.910> itself<00:02:29.300> might<00:02:29.630> not<00:02:29.660> be

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
but maybe the drink itself might not be

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.360 
but maybe the drink itself might not be
as<00:02:30.230> delicious<00:02:30.470> as<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:30.890> could<00:02:31.100> have<00:02:31.130> been

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
as delicious as it could have been

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.520 
as delicious as it could have been
