00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.629 

okay<00:00:00.750> so<00:00:00.810> in<00:00:01.110> Maya<00:00:01.350> and<00:00:01.680> we're<00:00:02.310> going<00:00:02.490> to

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
okay so in Maya and we're going to

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.610 
okay so in Maya and we're going to
unfold<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.950> head<00:00:05.029> using<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.089> new<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.660> full<00:00:07.200> 3d

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
unfold a head using the new and full 3d

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.879 
unfold a head using the new and full 3d
methods<00:00:08.069> we<00:00:09.030> can<00:00:09.059> fuse<00:00:09.480> UV<00:00:09.809> over<00:00:10.230> here<00:00:10.469> in<00:00:10.769> a

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
methods we can fuse UV over here in a

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.589 
methods we can fuse UV over here in a
separate<00:00:11.190> editor<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.700> like<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.000> have<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.450> the

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
separate editor I like to have it in the

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.919 
separate editor I like to have it in the
same<00:00:12.840> in<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.620> window<00:00:13.860> next<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.299> the<00:00:15.299> head<00:00:15.450> I'm

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
same in the window next to the head I'm

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.679 
same in the window next to the head I'm
viewing<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:17.220> if<00:00:17.430> we<00:00:17.640> just<00:00:18.119> select<00:00:18.779> the

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
viewing so if we just select the

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.140 
viewing so if we just select the
outliner<00:00:22.010> we<00:00:23.010> get<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> two<00:00:23.369> window<00:00:23.640> view<00:00:23.820> that's

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
outliner we get a two window view that's

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.130 
outliner we get a two window view that's
the<00:00:24.240> only<00:00:24.420> reason<00:00:24.630> I'm<00:00:24.689> selecting<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
the only reason I'm selecting the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.800 
the only reason I'm selecting the
outliner<00:00:25.439> just<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.769> get<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.039> window<00:00:26.460> view

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
outliner just to get it to window view

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:34.630 
outliner just to get it to window view
and<00:00:28.160> then<00:00:29.160> select<00:00:30.740> panels<00:00:32.600> UV<00:00:33.600> texture<00:00:33.930> editor

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
and then select panels UV texture editor

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.280 
and then select panels UV texture editor
we<00:00:35.640> have<00:00:35.670> them<00:00:35.880> side<00:00:36.090> by<00:00:36.120> side<00:00:36.300> which<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.050> find

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
we have them side by side which I find

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.190 
we have them side by side which I find
easier<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.890> work<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.780> now<00:00:39.780> at<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:39.960> point

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
easier to work with now at this point

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.850 
easier to work with now at this point
it's<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.190> complete<00:00:41.489> mess<00:00:41.670> there's<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.860> big

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
it's a complete mess there's a big

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.069 
it's a complete mess there's a big
overlap<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.340> polygons<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.420> need<00:00:45.570> something

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
overlap in polygons so I need something

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.150 
overlap in polygons so I need something
to<00:00:46.200> start<00:00:46.410> with<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:48.289> the<00:00:49.289> easiest<00:00:49.530> way<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.920> do

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
to start with and the easiest way to do

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.439 
to start with and the easiest way to do
it<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> start<00:00:50.760> with<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> planar<00:00:51.270> projection

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
it is to start with a planar projection

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.970 
it is to start with a planar projection
because<00:00:51.930> then<00:00:52.079> everything<00:00:52.320> will<00:00:52.530> fit<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
because then everything will fit in the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.319 
because then everything will fit in the
image<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.489> won't<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.730> stuff<00:00:53.969> sticking

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
image and you won't have stuff sticking

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.319 
image and you won't have stuff sticking
out<00:00:55.430> there<00:00:56.430> will<00:00:56.550> be<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.670> lot<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.789> overlap<00:00:56.969> but

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
out there will be a lot of overlap but

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.209 
out there will be a lot of overlap but
we<00:00:57.420> don't<00:00:57.600> care<00:00:57.780> about<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.989> right<00:00:58.140> now<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.620> it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
we don't care about that right now so it

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.009 
we don't care about that right now so it
could<00:00:59.370> go<00:00:59.550> to<00:01:02.030> I'm<00:01:03.030> an<00:01:03.180> animation<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.780> need<00:01:03.930> to

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
could go to I'm an animation I need to

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.210 
could go to I'm an animation I need to
be<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.199> polygons<00:01:05.780> create<00:01:06.780> UVs<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.560> create<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
be in polygons create UVs and create the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.410 
be in polygons create UVs and create the
UVs<00:01:08.570> there's<00:01:09.570> also<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:10.170> faster<00:01:10.890> methods<00:01:11.299> we<00:01:12.299> all

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
UVs there's also a faster methods we all

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.000 
UVs there's also a faster methods we all
know<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:12.960> right-click<00:01:13.200> we<00:01:13.710> get<00:01:13.890> this

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
know if we right-click we get this

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.640 
know if we right-click we get this
marking<00:01:14.490> menu<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.060> can<00:01:15.240> get<00:01:15.420> your<00:01:16.200> selections

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
marking menu you can get your selections

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.200 
marking menu you can get your selections
quickly<00:01:17.280> if<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.600> hold<00:01:18.840> down<00:01:18.900> shift<00:01:20.030> you<00:01:21.030> get<00:01:21.150> a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
quickly if you hold down shift you get a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.490 
quickly if you hold down shift you get a
different<00:01:21.570> marking<00:01:21.900> menu<00:01:22.310> which<00:01:23.310> includes

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
different marking menu which includes

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.249 
different marking menu which includes
mapping<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.119> I<00:01:27.119> can<00:01:27.299> now<00:01:27.450> say<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.840> want<00:01:28.110> a

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
mapping and I can now say I want a

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.810 
mapping and I can now say I want a
planar<00:01:28.590> map<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.100> Z<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:30.500> think<00:01:31.549> so<00:01:32.549> now<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:32.790> just

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
planar map in Z I think so now it's just

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.899 
planar map in Z I think so now it's just
plainly<00:01:33.689> planar<00:01:34.619> rejection<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.189> see<00:01:35.369> across

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
plainly planar rejection and see across

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.390 
plainly planar rejection and see across
the<00:01:36.000> face<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.689> we<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:37.680> something<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.250> start

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
the face and we have something to start

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.880 
the face and we have something to start
with<00:01:38.520> all<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.299> polygons<00:01:39.689> are<00:01:39.900> maps<00:01:40.200> they<00:01:40.710> are

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
with all the polygons are maps they are

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.770 
with all the polygons are maps they are
connected<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.670> they're<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.020> UV<00:01:43.470> space<00:01:44.780> so

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
connected and they're in the UV space so

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.800 
connected and they're in the UV space so
to<00:01:45.869> unfold<00:01:46.670> this<00:01:47.670> head<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.149> need<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.450> cut<00:01:48.720> it

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
to unfold this head I need to cut it

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.510 
to unfold this head I need to cut it
open<00:01:48.930> somewhere<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:49.890> I'm<00:01:49.979> going<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.220> cut<00:01:50.430> it

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
open somewhere so I'm going to cut it

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.800 
open somewhere so I'm going to cut it
open<00:01:50.610> at<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.939> back<00:01:51.470> so<00:01:52.470> let's<00:01:52.680> say<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.280> go<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.810> my

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
open at the back so let's say I go to my

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.160 
open at the back so let's say I go to my
edge<00:01:55.439> selection<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.340> say<00:01:56.630> here<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.780> what<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:57.960> want

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
edge selection I say here is what I want

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.130 
edge selection I say here is what I want
want<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.469> start<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.829> cut<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.250> should<00:01:59.490> not<00:01:59.909> have

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
want to start the cut I should not have

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.120 
want to start the cut I should not have
soft<00:02:01.140> selection<00:02:01.380> on<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:01.920> where<00:02:02.100> I

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
soft selection on so this is where I

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.910 
soft selection on so this is where I
start<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.490> cut<00:02:03.110> now<00:02:04.110> if<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.350> double<00:02:04.409> click<00:02:04.680> on

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
start the cut now if I double click on

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.310 
start the cut now if I double click on
it<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.280> selects<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> entire<00:02:06.450> edge<00:02:06.689> all<00:02:06.990> around

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
it it selects the entire edge all around

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.040 
it it selects the entire edge all around
but<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.680> don't<00:02:07.710> want<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.190> front<00:02:08.840> so<00:02:09.840> what<00:02:09.959> I'm

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
but I don't want the front so what I'm

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.660 
but I don't want the front so what I'm
going<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.289> do<00:02:10.440> I'm<00:02:10.590> going<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.890> select<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.610> one

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
going to do I'm going to select this one

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.880 
going to do I'm going to select this one
and<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.660> selector<00:02:13.080> where<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.319> needs<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.560> go

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
and the selector where it needs to go

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.620 
and the selector where it needs to go
on<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.130> other<00:02:14.190> side<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.730> double-click<00:02:15.300> there

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
on the other side and double-click there

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.290 
on the other side and double-click there
if<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.740> do<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.430> only<00:02:17.760> selects<00:02:18.180> the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
if you do that it only selects the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.809 
if you do that it only selects the
portion<00:02:18.690> between<00:02:19.020> those<00:02:19.590> two<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.490> Front's

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
portion between those two so the Front's

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.460 
portion between those two so the Front's
not<00:02:20.940> ex-inspector<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.660> edge<00:02:21.810> all<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.380> way

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
not ex-inspector the edge all the way

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.650 
not ex-inspector the edge all the way
across<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:23.490> back<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:23.910> that's<00:02:24.420> what<00:02:24.600> I'm

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
across the back and that's what I'm

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.220 
across the back and that's what I'm
going<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.930> cut<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.350> UV<00:02:25.680> open<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.810> I'm<00:02:28.080> going

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
going to cut this UV open and I'm going

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.570 
going to cut this UV open and I'm going
to<00:02:28.350> do<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.709> by<00:02:28.890> simply<00:02:29.250> hitting<00:02:29.340> the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
to do that by simply hitting the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.330 
to do that by simply hitting the
scissors<00:02:29.910> cut<00:02:31.100> open<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:33.830> then<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:35.040> need<00:02:35.250> to

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
scissors cut open and then I need to

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:43.449 
scissors cut open and then I need to
select<00:02:35.550> my<00:02:35.760> UVs<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:38.900> go<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:39.959> polygons<00:02:41.360> unfold

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
select my UVs and go to polygons unfold

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.740 
select my UVs and go to polygons unfold
I'm<00:02:44.810> going<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.900> select<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.320> new<00:02:47.030> unfold<00:02:48.030> 3d

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
I'm going to select the new unfold 3d

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.590 
I'm going to select the new unfold 3d
methods<00:02:49.320> if<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.430> choice<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:50.730> not<00:02:51.000> up<00:02:51.180> there<00:02:51.360> if

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
methods if the choice is not up there if

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.420 
methods if the choice is not up there if
you<00:02:51.750> just<00:02:51.989> have<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.350> legacy<00:02:54.769> methods<00:02:55.769> there

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
you just have the legacy methods there

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.460 
you just have the legacy methods there
you<00:02:57.300> need<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.570> go<00:02:57.769> into<00:02:58.769> your<00:03:00.350> plugin<00:03:01.350> manager

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
you need to go into your plugin manager

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.190 
you need to go into your plugin manager
and<00:03:02.239> make<00:03:03.239> sure<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:04.290> unfold<00:03:04.830> 3d<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:06.200> actually

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
and make sure the unfold 3d is actually

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.880 
and make sure the unfold 3d is actually
loaded<00:03:07.940> which<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.209> in<00:03:09.390> this<00:03:09.510> case<00:03:11.450> so<00:03:12.890> we're

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
loaded which it is in this case so we're

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.160 
loaded which it is in this case so we're
going<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.100> select<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.489> unfort<00:03:14.940> 3d<00:03:15.360> method<00:03:15.959> has

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
going to select the unfort 3d method has

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.870 
going to select the unfort 3d method has
seems<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.860> have<00:03:16.950> less<00:03:17.130> options<00:03:19.640> and<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.700> just

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
seems to have less options and I just

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.039 
seems to have less options and I just
have<00:03:20.970> all<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.209> options<00:03:21.480> selected

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
have all the options selected

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:28.130 
have all the options selected
and<00:03:23.090> if<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.239> apply<00:03:25.200> this<00:03:25.730> it<00:03:26.730> enforce<00:03:27.720> my<00:03:27.870> face

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
and if I apply this it enforce my face

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.090 
and if I apply this it enforce my face
in<00:03:28.470> one<00:03:29.310> go<00:03:29.930> so<00:03:30.930> it's<00:03:31.049> not<00:03:31.140> unfolded<00:03:31.769> there's

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
in one go so it's not unfolded there's

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.170 
in one go so it's not unfolded there's
no<00:03:32.220> more<00:03:32.400> overlap<00:03:32.930> and<00:03:34.820> this<00:03:35.820> is<00:03:35.970> basically

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
no more overlap and this is basically

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.370 
no more overlap and this is basically
usable<00:03:37.640> we<00:03:38.640> have<00:03:38.730> every<00:03:39.000> is<00:03:39.150> entire<00:03:39.630> face<00:03:39.840> laid

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
usable we have every is entire face laid

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.590 
usable we have every is entire face laid
out<00:03:40.560> one<00:03:41.400> of<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.579> big<00:03:41.700> advantages<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:42.329> this

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
out one of the big advantages of this

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.060 
out one of the big advantages of this
method<00:03:42.660> is<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:43.530> does<00:03:43.950> it

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
method is that this does it

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.390 
method is that this does it
symmetrically<00:03:45.230> so<00:03:46.230> there<00:03:46.470> it's<00:03:46.980> nicely

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
symmetrically so there it's nicely

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.100 
symmetrically so there it's nicely
somatically<00:03:47.940> laid<00:03:48.150> out<00:03:48.299> it<00:03:48.480> thinks<00:03:48.959> about

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
somatically laid out it thinks about

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.160 
somatically laid out it thinks about
that<00:03:49.739> geometry<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.670> then<00:03:51.180> so<00:03:51.630> still<00:03:51.840> straight

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
that geometry and then so still straight

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.740 
that geometry and then so still straight
the<00:03:52.799> face<00:03:53.040> is<00:03:53.250> still<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.459> bit<00:03:53.610> small<00:03:54.030> in

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
the face is still a bit small in

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.410 
the face is still a bit small in
comparison<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.530> rest<00:03:55.709> of<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:58.730> UVs<00:03:59.730> so

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
comparison to the rest of the UVs so

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.860 
comparison to the rest of the UVs so
I'll<00:04:00.780> just<00:04:01.019> do<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.260> same<00:04:01.410> thing<00:04:01.470> I'll<00:04:01.920> select

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
I'll just do the same thing I'll select

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.960 
I'll just do the same thing I'll select
some<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:03.900> you<00:04:04.019> V's<00:04:04.200> in<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.440> center

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
some of you V's in the center

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.470 
some of you V's in the center
oops<00:04:05.970> yeah<00:04:07.190> make<00:04:08.190> my<00:04:08.340> soft<00:04:08.579> selection<00:04:08.910> make

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
oops yeah make my soft selection make

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.870 
oops yeah make my soft selection make
sure<00:04:09.630> that<00:04:09.840> it's<00:04:10.140> exactly<00:04:10.579> within<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:11.670> UV

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
sure that it's exactly within the UV

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.400 
sure that it's exactly within the UV
plane<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.470> then<00:04:13.470> using<00:04:14.280> scale<00:04:15.019> I'm<00:04:16.019> going<00:04:16.289> to

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
plane and then using scale I'm going to

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.140 
plane and then using scale I'm going to
make<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.620> face<00:04:16.799> a<00:04:16.829> bit<00:04:17.130> wider<00:04:17.370> making<00:04:18.000> sure

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
make the face a bit wider making sure

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.640 
make the face a bit wider making sure
that<00:04:18.329> if<00:04:18.600> I<00:04:18.720> go<00:04:18.900> too<00:04:18.959> far<00:04:19.229> it<00:04:19.410> starts

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
that if I go too far it starts

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.199 
that if I go too far it starts
overlapping<00:04:20.039> again<00:04:20.370> just<00:04:20.669> pushing<00:04:21.030> out<00:04:21.180> a

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
overlapping again just pushing out a

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.600 
overlapping again just pushing out a
little<00:04:21.510> bit<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:21.930> then<00:04:22.830> also<00:04:23.039> pushing<00:04:23.460> light<00:04:23.580> a

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
little bit and then also pushing light a

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.570 
little bit and then also pushing light a
little<00:04:23.880> bit<00:04:23.970> in<00:04:24.090> this<00:04:24.210> direction<00:04:25.430> just<00:04:26.430> to

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
little bit in this direction just to

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.180 
little bit in this direction just to
give<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.880> face

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
give the face

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.270 
give the face
a<00:04:27.220> little<00:04:27.520> bit<00:04:27.610> more<00:04:27.760> space<00:04:29.010> then<00:04:30.010> we<00:04:30.130> might

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
a little bit more space then we might

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.690 
a little bit more space then we might
want<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.610> make<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.270> bottom<00:04:31.570> straight<00:04:32.020> again

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
want to make the bottom straight again

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.320 
want to make the bottom straight again
in<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:33.820> layout<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:35.520> when<00:04:36.520> we're<00:04:36.640> done<00:04:36.820> you

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
in the layout and when we're done you

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.060 
in the layout and when we're done you
always<00:04:37.780> want<00:04:38.050> to<00:04:38.110> make<00:04:38.200> sure<00:04:38.350> that<00:04:38.770> all<00:04:39.010> your

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
always want to make sure that all your

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.440 
always want to make sure that all your
UV<00:04:39.730> s<00:04:39.790> fit<00:04:40.270> within<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:41.200> image<00:04:41.470> plane<00:04:42.300> so<00:04:43.300> we're

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
UV s fit within the image plane so we're

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.380 
UV s fit within the image plane so we're
going<00:04:43.600> to<00:04:43.980> normalize<00:04:44.980> the<00:04:45.370> UV<00:04:45.610> so<00:04:45.910> there<00:04:46.090> they

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
going to normalize the UV so there they

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.850 
going to normalize the UV so there they
fit<00:04:46.540> exactly<00:04:46.660> within<00:04:47.140> the<00:04:47.230> image<00:04:47.380> plane<00:04:47.590> I

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
fit exactly within the image plane I

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.760 
fit exactly within the image plane I
think<00:04:48.610> it<00:04:48.700> took<00:04:48.790> me<00:04:48.940> a<00:04:48.970> total<00:04:49.030> of<00:04:49.660> about<00:04:50.440> two

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
think it took me a total of about two

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.010 
think it took me a total of about two
minutes<00:04:50.920> and<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:51.880> whole<00:04:52.000> face<00:04:52.240> has<00:04:52.390> unfolded

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
minutes and the whole face has unfolded

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.100 
minutes and the whole face has unfolded
so<00:04:53.590> this<00:04:53.770> unfort<00:04:54.250> 3d<00:04:54.640> method<00:04:55.060> is<00:04:55.240> a<00:04:55.810> great

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
so this unfort 3d method is a great

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.680 
so this unfort 3d method is a great
improvement<00:04:56.620> over<00:04:56.770> older<00:04:57.520> versions<00:04:58.000> that

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
improvement over older versions that

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.170 
improvement over older versions that
were<00:04:58.840> available<00:04:59.080> in<00:04:59.530> Maya<00:05:00.340> prior<00:05:00.730> to<00:05:00.880> Maya

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
were available in Maya prior to Maya

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.900 
were available in Maya prior to Maya
