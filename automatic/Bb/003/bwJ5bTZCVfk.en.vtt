whatever so that you know once you once
you<00:03:53.720> taffies<00:03:54.110> agreed<00:03:54.500> it's<00:03:54.680> not<00:03:54.800> all<00:03:55.480> next<00:03:56.480> one

you taffies agreed it's not all next one
you<00:03:57.260> know<00:03:57.350> it<00:03:57.620> also<00:03:57.890> depends<00:03:58.280> on<00:03:58.370> the

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
you know it also depends on the

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:59.830 
you know it also depends on the
structure<00:03:58.730> of<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:59.000> deal<00:03:59.239> and<00:03:59.360> I<00:03:59.450> think<00:03:59.690> that's

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
structure of the deal and I think that's

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.000 
structure of the deal and I think that's
where<00:04:00.020> we're<00:04:00.230> at<00:04:00.260> I<00:04:00.530> think<00:04:00.770> they're<00:04:00.860> just

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
where we're at I think they're just

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.250 
where we're at I think they're just
trying<00:04:01.160> to<00:04:01.190> sort<00:04:01.430> that<00:04:01.550> how<00:04:01.640> and<00:04:01.970> I<00:04:02.690> think<00:04:03.140> his

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
trying to sort that how and I think his

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.229 
trying to sort that how and I think his
comment<00:04:03.590> specifically<00:04:04.190> relate<00:04:04.700> to<00:04:05.030> were

the<00:04:07.280> deal<00:04:07.489> and<00:04:07.880> I<00:04:08.180> don't<00:04:08.420> think<00:04:08.600> the<00:04:08.660> very<00:04:08.780> keen

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
the deal and I don't think the very keen

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.170 
the deal and I don't think the very keen
on<00:04:09.200> ticketing<00:04:09.709> now<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.100> right<00:04:10.310> take<00:04:10.580> him<00:04:10.610> you

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.100
