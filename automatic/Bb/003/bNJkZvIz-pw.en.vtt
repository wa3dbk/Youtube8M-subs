washing the mixing bowls three or four

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.130 
washing the mixing bowls three or four
times<00:01:33.030> tonight<00:01:34.030> I'm<00:01:34.270> just<00:01:34.420> gonna<00:01:34.570> cream<00:01:34.930> this

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
times tonight I'm just gonna cream this

times tonight I'm just gonna cream this
together

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:48.450 

it's<00:01:40.710> gonna<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> little<00:01:41.310> bit<00:01:41.640> thick

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.420 

and<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.480> trick<00:01:49.720> is<00:01:49.930> if<00:01:50.260> it's<00:01:50.980> not<00:01:51.160> to<00:01:51.340> the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
and the trick is if it's not to the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.070 
and the trick is if it's not to the
right<00:01:51.610> consistency<00:01:52.240> or<00:01:52.330> it's<00:01:52.450> not<00:01:52.600> softened

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
right consistency or it's not softened

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.930 
right consistency or it's not softened
enough<00:01:53.170> you<00:01:53.860> can<00:01:54.010> add<00:01:54.130> a<00:01:54.160> little<00:01:54.400> milk<00:01:54.640> we're

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
enough you can add a little milk we're

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.330 
enough you can add a little milk we're
gonna<00:01:55.060> add<00:01:55.240> some<00:01:55.270> milk<00:01:55.720> but<00:01:55.780> more<00:01:56.650> milk<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:57.040> bad

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
gonna add some milk but more milk it bad

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.530 
gonna add some milk but more milk it bad
obviously<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.180> thinner<00:01:58.450> it's<00:01:58.630> gonna<00:01:58.840> be<00:02:03.540> okay

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
obviously the thinner it's gonna be okay

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.840 
obviously the thinner it's gonna be okay
this<00:02:04.750> is<00:02:04.990> four<00:02:05.260> to<00:02:05.410> six<00:02:05.680> tablespoons<00:02:06.130> we're

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
this is four to six tablespoons we're

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.150 
this is four to six tablespoons we're
gonna<00:02:07.060> eyeball<00:02:07.240> it<00:02:07.510> in<00:02:07.780> here<00:02:11.040> sometimes<00:02:12.040> you

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
gonna eyeball it in here sometimes you

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.550
