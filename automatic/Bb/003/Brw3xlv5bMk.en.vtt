why i used a super red blush is that

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.990 
why i used a super red blush is that
when<00:01:21.360> you're<00:01:21.570> going<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.710> Sun<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.729> glow

when you're going to the Sun the glow

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.840 
when you're going to the Sun the glow
that<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.450> get<00:01:24.720> even<00:01:25.619> though<00:01:25.979> partially<00:01:26.790> is

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
that you get even though partially is

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.240 
that you get even though partially is
because<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.590> melanin<00:01:29.040> production

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
because of the melanin production

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.410 
because of the melanin production
increasing<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.710> end<00:01:31.710> up<00:01:32.100> being<00:01:32.400> more<00:01:32.640> and
