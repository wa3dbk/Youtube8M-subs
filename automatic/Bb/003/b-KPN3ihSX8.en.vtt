the<00:00:23.320> operating<00:00:23.830> system<00:00:24.220> that<00:00:24.250> would<00:00:24.550> soon

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
the operating system that would soon

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.930

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 
become windows XP you will notice

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.670 
become windows XP you will notice
several<00:00:28.180> interface<00:00:28.930> elements<00:00:29.440> that<00:00:29.590> are

several interface elements that are

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.220 
several interface elements that are
similar<00:00:30.190> to<00:00:30.369> Neptune<00:00:30.820> and<00:00:31.029> several<00:00:31.750> elements

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
similar to Neptune and several elements

that<00:00:32.349> are<00:00:32.470> similar<00:00:32.890> to<00:00:32.920> XP<00:00:33.610> because<00:00:34.270> these

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
that are similar to XP because these

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.360 
that are similar to XP because these
developments<00:00:35.110> were<00:00:35.199> made<00:00:35.410> before<00:00:35.590> XP<00:00:36.129> came
