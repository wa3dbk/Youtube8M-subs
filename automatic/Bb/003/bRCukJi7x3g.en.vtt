00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
made the belt put the belt on and this

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.550 
made the belt put the belt on and this
thing<00:00:28.470> was<00:00:28.859> moving<00:00:29.279> but<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.449> head<00:00:31.380> unit

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560

wasn't<00:00:32.070> moving<00:00:32.579> like<00:00:33.059> correctly<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.780> popped

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
wasn't moving like correctly so I popped

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.500 
wasn't moving like correctly so I popped
the<00:00:34.170> top<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.860> top<00:00:35.070> off<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.940> watched<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.420> and

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.209 
I'm like this thing looks like it seized
up<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:38.910> took<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:40.020> bar<00:00:40.230> out<00:00:40.469> which<00:00:41.010> is

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.630 
put it back together and still didn't
work<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.289> ripped<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> motor<00:00:47.010> completely

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640

slid the head unit back and forth like a
million<00:01:01.710> times<00:01:01.739> because<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.730> felt<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:03.059> it

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
million times because it felt like it

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.090 
million times because it felt like it
was<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.600> really<00:01:04.909> stuck<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.210> place<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:07.439> after

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
a lot of work here it it fired up and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.899 
a lot of work here it it fired up and
just<00:01:13.260> started<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:14.040> know<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.580> said<00:01:14.760> it's

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
just started you know like I said it's

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.130 
just started you know like I said it's
been<00:01:15.000> about<00:01:15.150> three<00:01:15.479> hours<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.750> him<00:01:15.960> playing

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
been about three hours of him playing

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.830 
been about three hours of him playing
with<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.500> thing<00:01:16.710> still<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.700> pieces<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.420> i'm

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
with this thing still in pieces but i'm

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.840 
with this thing still in pieces but i'm
gonna<00:01:18.990> let<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.200> run<00:01:19.500> through<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> few<00:01:20.460> times

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
gonna let it run through a few times

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.420 
gonna let it run through a few times
just<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.479> motor<00:01:22.259> gets<00:01:22.560> used<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.040> spin<00:01:23.400> it

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
just so that motor gets used to spin it

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.950 
just so that motor gets used to spin it
again<00:01:23.640> because<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.180> thing's<00:01:24.360> probably<00:01:24.570> been

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
again because this thing's probably been

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.620 
again because this thing's probably been
sitting<00:01:25.229> geez<00:01:25.680> for<00:01:26.040> at<00:01:26.729> least<00:01:26.909> for<00:01:27.330> me<00:01:27.450> it's
