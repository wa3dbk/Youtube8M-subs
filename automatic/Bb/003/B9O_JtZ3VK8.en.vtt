00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.249 
one and also the coolest one you spin
the<00:01:55.619> knife<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.890> goes<00:01:56.040> around<00:01:56.430> your<00:01:56.640> hand<00:01:57.259> hold

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
the knife it goes around your hand hold

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.480 
the knife it goes around your hand hold
it<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.500> you're<00:01:58.619> gonna<00:01:58.710> stab<00:01:58.979> something<00:01:59.250> like

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
it like you're gonna stab something like

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.190 
it like you're gonna stab something like
that<00:02:00.170> then<00:02:01.170> spin<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:02.180> I'm<00:02:03.180> gonna<00:02:03.299> flick<00:02:03.810> at<00:02:04.049> it

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
that then spin it I'm gonna flick at it

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.020 
that then spin it I'm gonna flick at it
so<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.500> spins<00:02:04.680> over<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.759> ended<00:02:05.969> up

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
so it spins over and you ended up

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.119 
so it spins over and you ended up
catching<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.390> somewhere<00:02:06.600> around<00:02:07.129> here

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
catching it somewhere around here

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.610 
catching it somewhere around here
depending<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.239> side<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.629> hand

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.130 

so<00:02:14.620> it's<00:02:14.770> been<00:02:15.420> it's<00:02:16.420> kind<00:02:16.630> of<00:02:16.660> hard<00:02:16.840> with<00:02:16.990> the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
so it's been it's kind of hard with the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.890 
so it's been it's kind of hard with the
small<00:02:17.350> knife<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.560> used<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:18.480> I'm<00:02:19.480> used<00:02:19.630> to<00:02:19.690> this

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
small knife and used to I'm used to this

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:28.380 
small knife and used to I'm used to this
knife<00:02:20.140> which<00:02:20.740> is<00:02:20.910> lot<00:02:21.910> larger<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:27.270> she's<00:02:28.270> gonna

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
knife which is lot larger so she's gonna

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.530 
knife which is lot larger so she's gonna
practice<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:30.010> first<00:02:30.220> two<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.670> few<00:02:31.120> times<00:02:31.330> just

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
practice the first two a few times just

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.660
