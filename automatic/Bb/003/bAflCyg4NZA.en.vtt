we<00:01:31.829> need<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.130> help<00:01:32.430> our<00:01:32.670> digestive<00:01:33.299> system

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
we need to help our digestive system

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.929 
we need to help our digestive system
process<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.710> food<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.189> effectively<00:01:35.790> as

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
process this food as effectively as

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.730 
process this food as effectively as
possible<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.990> what<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.200> want<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.500> for<00:01:37.710> that

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
possible so what we want to do for that

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.429 
possible so what we want to do for that
is<00:01:38.299> considering<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.810> majority<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.290> us

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
is considering that the majority of us

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.810 
is considering that the majority of us
ninety-nine<00:01:41.040> percent<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.460> us<00:01:41.549> pretty<00:01:41.729> much

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
ninety-nine percent of us pretty much

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.999 
ninety-nine percent of us pretty much
have<00:01:42.570> an<00:01:42.689> underactive<00:01:42.960> stomach<00:01:43.200> which<00:01:43.740> means

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
have an underactive stomach which means

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:44.749 
have an underactive stomach which means
that<00:01:44.070> we're<00:01:44.250> not<00:01:44.369> producing<00:01:44.520> enough

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
that we're not producing enough

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.510 
that we're not producing enough
hydrochloric<00:01:45.450> acid<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.290> digest<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.680> food<00:01:46.860> we

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
hydrochloric acid to digest the food we

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.130 
hydrochloric acid to digest the food we
need<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.820> help<00:01:48.090> out<00:01:48.240> our<00:01:48.270> stomach<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:48.899> need<00:01:49.049> to

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
need to help out our stomach we need to

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.200 
need to help out our stomach we need to
really<00:01:49.290> call<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.950> reinforcements<00:01:50.640> so

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
really call in the reinforcements so

proteins and if you want to further help
that<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.630> can<00:02:24.660> also<00:02:24.870> look<00:02:25.110> for<00:02:25.440> a

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
that you can also look for a

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.700 
that you can also look for a
hydrochloric<00:02:26.250> acid<00:02:26.840> capsule<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.320> usually

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
hydrochloric acid capsule so usually

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.170 
hydrochloric acid capsule so usually
it's<00:02:28.830> like<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.220> teen<00:02:29.430> it's<00:02:29.640> called<00:02:29.820> betting

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
it's like that teen it's called betting

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.300 
it's like that teen it's called betting
usually<00:02:30.570> I<00:02:30.810> just<00:02:31.740> asked<00:02:32.070> her<00:02:32.130> like<00:02:32.220> a

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
usually I just asked her like a

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.090 
usually I just asked her like a
hydrochloric<00:02:32.850> acid<00:02:33.180> capsule<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.500> what<00:02:34.980> the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
hydrochloric acid capsule and what the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.470 
hydrochloric acid capsule and what the
hydrochloric<00:02:35.610> acid<00:02:35.880> will<00:02:35.970> do<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.330> will

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
hydrochloric acid will do is that will

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.780 
hydrochloric acid will do is that will
increase<00:02:37.110> your<00:02:37.290> stomach's<00:02:37.860> ability<00:02:38.280> or<00:02:38.520> your

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
increase your stomach's ability or your

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.820 
increase your stomach's ability or your
stomach's<00:02:39.260> hydrochloric<00:02:40.260> acid<00:02:40.560> production

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
stomach's hydrochloric acid production

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.570 
stomach's hydrochloric acid production
or<00:02:44.960> concentration<00:02:46.160> hydrochloric<00:02:47.160> acid<00:02:47.490> is

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
or concentration hydrochloric acid is

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.160 
or concentration hydrochloric acid is
what<00:02:47.670> our<00:02:47.700> stomach<00:02:48.000> produces<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.810> break<00:02:49.020> down

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
what our stomach produces to break down

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.870 
what our stomach produces to break down
protein<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.830> you'll<00:02:50.310> find<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:50.610> if<00:02:50.760> you

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
protein and you'll find that if you

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.120 
protein and you'll find that if you
increase<00:02:51.270> your<00:02:51.450> hydrochloric<00:02:52.110> acid<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.980> will

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
increase your hydrochloric acid it will

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.590 
increase your hydrochloric acid it will
make<00:02:53.160> digesting<00:02:53.700> food<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.940> lot<00:02:54.060> easier<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:54.540> you

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
make digesting food a lot easier so you

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.510 
make digesting food a lot easier so you
have<00:02:54.720> hydrochloric<00:02:55.260> acid<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.680> digestive

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
have hydrochloric acid and digestive

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.130 
have hydrochloric acid and digestive
enzymes<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:57.090> lot<00:02:57.240> of<00:02:57.360> times<00:02:57.540> they're<00:02:57.750> separate

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
enzymes a lot of times they're separate

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.230 
enzymes a lot of times they're separate
some<00:02:58.590> might<00:02:58.920> combine<00:02:59.340> both<00:02:59.580> so<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.000> just<00:03:00.120> have

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
some might combine both so you just have

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.820 
some might combine both so you just have
to<00:03:00.330> look<00:03:00.450> out<00:03:00.630> for<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.840> so<00:03:01.530> here's<00:03:01.680> what<00:03:01.770> you

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
to look out for that so here's what you

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.170 
to look out for that so here's what you
want<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.010> do<00:03:02.100> is<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.280> hydroelectric<00:03:02.700> doing

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
want to do is the hydroelectric doing

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.360 
want to do is the hydroelectric doing
hydrochloric<00:03:03.630> acid<00:03:03.960> take<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.620> couple<00:03:04.890> capsules

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
hydrochloric acid take a couple capsules

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.130 
hydrochloric acid take a couple capsules
before<00:03:05.880> your<00:03:06.090> meal<00:03:06.270> so<00:03:06.600> it's<00:03:06.690> going<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.900> read

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
before your meal so it's going to read

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.610 
before your meal so it's going to read
up<00:03:07.350> your<00:03:07.560> digestive<00:03:08.010> juices<00:03:08.340> 10<00:03:09.330> if<00:03:10.320> you<00:03:10.470> feel

a burning sensation you've had too many
that's<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.020> upper<00:03:13.230> limit<00:03:13.380> I'm<00:03:13.650> just<00:03:13.740> kind<00:03:13.950> of

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
that's the upper limit I'm just kind of

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.230 
that's the upper limit I'm just kind of
tone<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.310> back<00:03:14.340> down<00:03:14.640> from<00:03:14.820> there<00:03:14.940> but<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.150> so

tone it back down from there but it so

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.260 
tone it back down from there but it so
again<00:03:15.390> it's<00:03:15.510> totally<00:03:15.750> safe<00:03:15.900> it's<00:03:16.530> fine<00:03:16.710> don't

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
again it's totally safe it's fine don't

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.370 
again it's totally safe it's fine don't
second<00:03:18.270> thing<00:03:18.390> are<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.690> digestive<00:03:19.080> enzymes

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
second thing are the digestive enzymes

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.050 
second thing are the digestive enzymes
the<00:03:19.500> digestive<00:03:19.980> enzymes<00:03:20.280> again<00:03:20.580> our<00:03:20.670> specific

this is what I usually do is I'll take
you<00:03:28.950> know<00:03:29.070> one<00:03:29.280> before<00:03:29.640> wandering<00:03:29.970> one<00:03:30.390> after

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
you know one before wandering one after

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.290 
you know one before wandering one after
and<00:03:30.960> it<00:03:31.680> just<00:03:31.830> helps<00:03:32.250> your<00:03:32.400> stomach<00:03:32.820> it<00:03:33.030> gives

and it just helps your stomach it gives
your<00:03:33.480> body<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.840> enzymes<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.710> needs<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:35.220> break

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
your body the enzymes and needs to break

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.100 
your body the enzymes and needs to break
down<00:03:35.520> those<00:03:35.670> foods<00:03:35.910> because<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.600> lot<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.840> times

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
down those foods because a lot of times

down those foods because a lot of times
we're<00:03:37.410> not<00:03:37.500> doing<00:03:37.770> it<00:03:37.830> effectively<00:03:38.130> enough<00:03:38.640> so

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
a digestive issue so enzymes and

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.930 
a digestive issue so enzymes and
hydrochloric<00:03:47.190> acid<00:03:47.190> will<00:03:47.520> make<00:03:47.640> a<00:03:47.700> big

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940

going<00:04:48.750> to<00:04:48.840> dilute<00:04:49.139> everything<00:04:49.470> so<00:04:50.220> small

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
going to dilute everything so small

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.490 
going to dilute everything so small
little<00:04:50.760> sips<00:04:51.060> throughout<00:04:51.300> the<00:04:51.419> meal<00:04:51.630> a<00:04:51.840> little

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
little sips throughout the meal a little

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.680 
little sips throughout the meal a little
bit<00:04:52.950> more<00:04:53.070> obviously<00:04:53.400> before<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.880> meal<00:04:54.000> the

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
bit more obviously before the meal the

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.940 
bit more obviously before the meal the
other<00:04:54.840> option<00:04:55.169> you<00:04:55.260> have<00:04:55.320> at<00:04:55.560> this<00:04:55.650> time<00:04:55.710> of

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
other option you have at this time of

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.710 
other option you have at this time of
year<00:04:55.980> is<00:04:56.160> obviously<00:04:56.460> some<00:04:56.669> red<00:04:56.910> wine<00:04:57.210> now

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
year is obviously some red wine now

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.320 
year is obviously some red wine now
here's<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.080> thing<00:04:58.230> red<00:04:59.040> wine<00:04:59.280> meaning<00:04:59.880> one

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
here's the thing red wine meaning one

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.270 
here's the thing red wine meaning one
glass<00:05:00.600> one<00:05:01.080> glass<00:05:01.290> does<00:05:01.530> it<00:05:01.650> protect<00:05:01.890> is

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
glass one glass does it protect is

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.460 
glass one glass does it protect is
protective<00:05:02.820> cardioprotective<00:05:03.480> two<00:05:04.200> glasses

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
protective cardioprotective two glasses

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.310 
protective cardioprotective two glasses
it<00:05:04.710> becomes<00:05:04.919> a<00:05:05.010> risk<00:05:05.190> factor<00:05:05.490> okay<00:05:06.390> so<00:05:06.900> one

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
it becomes a risk factor okay so one

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.730 
it becomes a risk factor okay so one
glass<00:05:07.560> is<00:05:07.740> okay<00:05:08.240> nothing<00:05:09.240> wrong<00:05:09.390> as<00:05:10.200> we're<00:05:10.440> at

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
glass is okay nothing wrong as we're at

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.310 
glass is okay nothing wrong as we're at
all<00:05:10.919> and<00:05:11.100> some<00:05:11.250> other<00:05:11.400> good<00:05:11.550> stuff<00:05:11.900> and<00:05:12.900> the

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
all and some other good stuff and the

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.870 
all and some other good stuff and the
other<00:05:13.440> thing<00:05:13.500> is<00:05:13.740> that<00:05:13.770> it<00:05:13.919> actually<00:05:14.040> helps

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
other thing is that it actually helps

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.600 
other thing is that it actually helps
digestion<00:05:15.390> cancel<00:05:16.380> red<00:05:16.500> wine<00:05:16.740> has<00:05:17.370> some

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
digestion cancel red wine has some

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.400 
digestion cancel red wine has some
enzymes<00:05:17.910> there<00:05:18.120> that<00:05:18.270> improves<00:05:18.930> digestion

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
enzymes there that improves digestion

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.219 
enzymes there that improves digestion
not<00:05:19.979> white<00:05:20.190> wine<00:05:20.370> red<00:05:20.729> wine<00:05:20.930> that's<00:05:21.930> an<00:05:22.080> option

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
not white wine red wine that's an option

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.010 
not white wine red wine that's an option
if<00:05:22.440> you<00:05:22.530> want<00:05:22.560> you<00:05:23.550> don't<00:05:23.669> have<00:05:23.790> to<00:05:23.850> do<00:05:23.940> it<00:05:24.060> so

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
if you want you don't have to do it so

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.110 
if you want you don't have to do it so
those<00:05:25.470> are<00:05:25.500> some<00:05:25.800> really<00:05:26.100> helpful<00:05:26.340> things<00:05:26.700> to

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
those are some really helpful things to

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.630 
those are some really helpful things to
improve<00:05:27.840> your<00:05:27.990> digestion<00:05:28.370> during<00:05:29.370> the<00:05:29.460> meal

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
improve your digestion during the meal

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.340 
improve your digestion during the meal
now<00:05:30.090> the<00:05:30.150> other<00:05:30.300> thing<00:05:30.390> you<00:05:30.600> can<00:05:30.660> consider<00:05:31.110> is

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
now the other thing you can consider is

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.380 
now the other thing you can consider is
called<00:05:31.590> the<00:05:31.770> meal<00:05:32.100> sequencing<00:05:32.940> and<00:05:33.090> this<00:05:33.240> is<00:05:33.360> a

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
called the meal sequencing and this is a

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.719 
called the meal sequencing and this is a
little<00:05:33.780> less<00:05:34.110> realistic<00:05:34.560> I<00:05:34.860> find<00:05:35.130> because

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
little less realistic I find because

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.580 
little less realistic I find because
essentially<00:05:36.120> this<00:05:36.270> is<00:05:36.330> this<00:05:36.690> is<00:05:36.840> the<00:05:36.930> idea<00:05:37.140> so

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
essentially this is this is the idea so

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.650 
essentially this is this is the idea so
proteins<00:05:38.280> and<00:05:38.520> fats<00:05:38.700> take<00:05:38.970> longer<00:05:39.300> to<00:05:39.540> digest

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
proteins and fats take longer to digest

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.080 
proteins and fats take longer to digest
in<00:05:39.990> carbohydrates<00:05:40.530> so<00:05:41.250> let's<00:05:41.729> say<00:05:41.820> you<00:05:41.940> have

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
in carbohydrates so let's say you have

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.540 
in carbohydrates so let's say you have
turkey<00:05:42.630> and<00:05:42.840> then<00:05:43.470> you<00:05:43.650> follow<00:05:43.950> the<00:05:44.160> turkey

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
turkey and then you follow the turkey

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.680 
turkey and then you follow the turkey
with<00:05:45.300> potatoes<00:05:46.260> as<00:05:46.500> an<00:05:47.010> example<00:05:47.360> the<00:05:48.360> turkey

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
with potatoes as an example the turkey

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.360 
with potatoes as an example the turkey
is<00:05:48.720> mainly<00:05:49.020> protein<00:05:49.500> and<00:05:49.620> fat<00:05:49.800> so<00:05:49.830> therefore

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
is mainly protein and fat so therefore

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.860 
is mainly protein and fat so therefore
it's<00:05:50.460> going<00:05:50.580> to<00:05:50.640> take<00:05:50.729> several<00:05:51.030> hours<00:05:51.270> to<00:05:51.510> get

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
it's going to take several hours to get

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.170 
it's going to take several hours to get
kind<00:05:52.350> of<00:05:52.440> empty<00:05:52.740> out<00:05:52.919> of<00:05:52.979> your<00:05:53.070> stomach<00:05:53.310> if<00:05:53.580> you

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
kind of empty out of your stomach if you

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.920 
kind of empty out of your stomach if you
have<00:05:54.330> carbohydrates<00:05:54.750> or<00:05:55.320> fruit<00:05:55.979> sometimes

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
have carbohydrates or fruit sometimes

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.029 
have carbohydrates or fruit sometimes
served<00:05:57.930> after<00:05:58.350> the<00:05:58.380> meal<00:05:58.620> which<00:05:58.800> is<00:05:58.890> not<00:05:59.010> a

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
served after the meal which is not a

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.500 
served after the meal which is not a
good<00:05:59.190> idea<00:05:59.250> if<00:05:59.729> you<00:05:59.789> have<00:05:59.880> that<00:05:59.940> stuff<00:06:00.120> sitting

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
good idea if you have that stuff sitting

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.260 
good idea if you have that stuff sitting
on<00:06:00.630> top<00:06:00.960> of<00:06:01.229> the<00:06:01.680> fat<00:06:01.830> and<00:06:01.919> protein<00:06:02.250> well<00:06:03.120> then

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
on top of the fat and protein well then

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.250 
on top of the fat and protein well then
that's<00:06:03.479> when<00:06:03.630> you're<00:06:03.780> gonna<00:06:03.870> start<00:06:04.080> getting

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
that's when you're gonna start getting

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.900 
that's when you're gonna start getting
some<00:06:04.380> digestive<00:06:04.590> issues<00:06:05.160> okay<00:06:05.610> because<00:06:05.789> it's

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
some digestive issues okay because it's

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.060 
some digestive issues okay because it's
not<00:06:06.060> going<00:06:06.270> to<00:06:06.360> empty<00:06:06.600> out<00:06:06.750> in<00:06:07.020> a<00:06:07.740> very

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
not going to empty out in a very

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.370 
not going to empty out in a very
pleasant<00:06:08.940> manner<00:06:09.300> oks<00:06:09.870> it's<00:06:10.020> going<00:06:10.140> to<00:06:10.200> take<00:06:10.320> a

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
pleasant manner oks it's going to take a

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.540 
pleasant manner oks it's going to take a
long<00:06:10.590> time<00:06:10.740> for<00:06:10.800> the<00:06:10.979> protein<00:06:11.250> to<00:06:11.310> get<00:06:11.430> out

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
long time for the protein to get out

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.100 
long time for the protein to get out
you're<00:06:12.120> going<00:06:12.240> to<00:06:12.300> have<00:06:12.360> the<00:06:12.479> carbohydrates

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
you're going to have the carbohydrates

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
you're going to have the carbohydrates
which<00:06:13.260> are<00:06:13.350> going<00:06:13.470> to<00:06:13.560> be<00:06:13.620> digesting

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
which are going to be digesting

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.650 
which are going to be digesting
themselves<00:06:14.580> on<00:06:14.700> top<00:06:15.000> of<00:06:15.150> that<00:06:15.240> and<00:06:15.419> they<00:06:15.479> have

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
themselves on top of that and they have

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.390 
themselves on top of that and they have
nowhere<00:06:15.840> to<00:06:15.960> go<00:06:16.080> astron<00:06:17.039> start<00:06:17.190> getting<00:06:17.340> all

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
nowhere to go astron start getting all

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.460 
nowhere to go astron start getting all
the<00:06:17.490> gas<00:06:17.669> and<00:06:18.060> the<00:06:18.120> belching<00:06:18.539> and<00:06:18.870> all<00:06:19.260> that

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
the gas and the belching and all that

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.230 
the gas and the belching and all that
discomfort<00:06:19.740> so<00:06:20.669> what<00:06:20.789> you<00:06:20.850> want<00:06:20.970> to<00:06:21.030> do<00:06:21.090> it<00:06:21.150> the

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
discomfort so what you want to do it the

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.390 
discomfort so what you want to do it the
sequencing<00:06:21.810> is<00:06:21.990> start<00:06:22.350> off<00:06:22.530> with<00:06:22.770> a<00:06:22.800> simple

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
sequencing is start off with a simple

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.090 
sequencing is start off with a simple
and<00:06:23.640> end<00:06:24.419> off<00:06:24.600> with<00:06:24.840> a<00:06:24.870> complex<00:06:25.289> okay<00:06:25.740> so<00:06:25.830> start

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 
and end off with a complex okay so start

off<00:06:53.170> with<00:06:53.610> the<00:06:54.610> turkey<00:06:55.620> obviously<00:06:56.620> that's<00:06:56.800> the

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:56.920 
off with the turkey obviously that's the

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.130 
off with the turkey obviously that's the
ideal<00:06:57.430> situation<00:06:57.670> is<00:06:58.270> that<00:06:58.690> going<00:06:59.020> to<00:06:59.110> happen

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:02.860 
probably not will I ever do that at with

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.800 
probably not will I ever do that at with
that<00:07:03.040> kind<00:07:03.220> of<00:07:03.250> like<00:07:03.430> turkey<00:07:03.790> dinner<00:07:03.970> I<00:07:04.180> don't

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810 
that kind of like turkey dinner I don't

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.540 
that kind of like turkey dinner I don't
think<00:07:05.020> so<00:07:05.170> realistically<00:07:06.010> because<00:07:06.250> I<00:07:06.340> like

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550

the<00:07:07.150> combination<00:07:07.360> of<00:07:07.810> turkey<00:07:08.200> with<00:07:08.350> stuffing

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.470 
the combination of turkey with stuffing

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.200 
the combination of turkey with stuffing
and<00:07:08.920> cranberry<00:07:09.280> sauce<00:07:09.460> that's<00:07:09.820> just<00:07:10.000> the

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.210 
and cranberry sauce that's just the

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.850 
and cranberry sauce that's just the
combination<00:07:10.390> I<00:07:10.690> like<00:07:10.840> in<00:07:10.960> my<00:07:10.990> mouth<00:07:11.170> so<00:07:11.680> that's

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860 
combination I like in my mouth so that's

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.040 
combination I like in my mouth so that's
the<00:07:11.950> way<00:07:12.040> it's<00:07:12.130> gonna<00:07:12.190> go<00:07:12.340> but<00:07:13.300> anyways<00:07:13.570> you

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.050 
the way it's gonna go but anyways you

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.900 
the way it's gonna go but anyways you
can<00:07:14.200> try<00:07:14.350> that<00:07:14.380> sequencing<00:07:14.920> if<00:07:15.040> you<00:07:15.160> want<00:07:15.370> if

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:15.910 
can try that sequencing if you want if

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.370 
can try that sequencing if you want if
it's<00:07:16.240> realistic<00:07:16.510> for<00:07:16.750> you<00:07:16.840> that's<00:07:16.990> great<00:07:17.230> if

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:17.380 
it's realistic for you that's great if

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.680 
it's realistic for you that's great if
not<00:07:17.560> just<00:07:18.490> use<00:07:18.700> the<00:07:18.790> digestive<00:07:19.210> enzymes<00:07:19.540> of

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:19.690 
not just use the digestive enzymes of

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.480 
not just use the digestive enzymes of
hydrochloric<00:07:20.140> acid<00:07:20.560> and<00:07:20.620> the<00:07:20.710> apple<00:07:21.370> cider
