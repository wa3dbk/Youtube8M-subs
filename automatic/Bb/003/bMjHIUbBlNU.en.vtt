00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.840
 who edited felipe santos today with 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.539
 application or dumont you can see 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.970
 here and here we use to do the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.430
 same wind director process then it is 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.550
 exactly the same thing the director 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.840
 Toast in case we're going to do this. 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.000
 thoreau because there are people who are not 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.730
 able to use the directory is 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.860
 finding some kind of difficulty 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.280
 will be moving data from these groups 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.489
 what the world's 1 at the moment 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.020
 the internal memory 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.649
 the monte forum is free in the pre 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.320
 story 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:01.350
 Only with some limitations will you go to 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:04.049
 you for you to get unlimited there you 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.869
 have to pay or use the freedom that was 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.869
 my case than with freedom and everything 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.280
 unlocked application 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.130
 I believe the made version can move 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.900
 three-step applications is one 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:25.310
 thing as soon as the game is running 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.310
 is in the internal memory 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.220
 Come on it 's very simple. 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.759
 the application will open 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:41.040
 in defense of lessa here and will ask the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:43.350
 root access and come here at most add 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.710
 whose name you are going to put the name of 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.710
 game 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.290
 the origin you will seek to distance where 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.700
 are the game data 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.200
 currently is the case here is in memory 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.630
 android the baby 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.240
 This folder I will not start this 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.330
 business world he already asked 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.870
 you even automatically create the folder 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:15.170
 there at the same address your card 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.500
 sd believe a hundred or had to 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.550
 manually and will select in case 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.430
 I'll leave it the way it is 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:35.710
 done that you will see here in the little 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:35.710
 which will give because in 17 gave ok 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:48.130
 he can sing it from here you click on 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:50.980
 yes he is exactly the same as the 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.620
 manager toast in case here i am 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.180
 dying from internal to external memory 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.910
 but you do not need to do this to you 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.840
 you can create the empty folder 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.800
 there in an internal memory same process 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:10.180
 of the director and band and only come here to create 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.860
 a fashion entry into the game since he 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.970
 It's dying because I told you 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.270
 you do not 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:20.200
 the game was in internal memory when 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.330
 is moving the files to aac completed 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.120
 look finished you will see that 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.610
 simply click on this piano and trio 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.060
 the right upper right and 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:35.560
 everything's ok, you can put as many 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.390
 games you want is in the case as long as 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.580
 be with the application when you are 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:49.200
 paid and point is no longer occupying the 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:51.790
 internal memory space is already on psd 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.950
 there is an application running 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.630
 identical to the directory too well if 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.550
 You could not use the director and 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.990
 blind you use the dick and vice view 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.800
 I will open the game that only to prove that 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.800
 is working perfectly 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:37.460
 the beauty of the galley 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:39.900
 so this is not going to stretch me too much 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.610
 I'll even do a test with this 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.100
 application then how to move those 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.690
 other games here because we know that 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.350
 are all in the internal memory 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.890
 I hope I have helped you hug and even 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.890
 the next
