thought well I kind of saving that for
my<00:04:31.600> last<00:04:31.870> choice<00:04:32.169> if<00:04:32.650> things<00:04:32.890> don't<00:04:33.070> work<00:04:33.280> out

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
my last choice if things don't work out

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.350 
my last choice if things don't work out
well<00:04:34.450> he<00:04:34.600> said<00:04:35.160> not<00:04:36.160> a<00:04:36.190> good<00:04:36.400> idea<00:04:36.460> so<00:04:37.120> let<00:04:37.270> me

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
well he said not a good idea so let me

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.790 
well he said not a good idea so let me
let<00:04:37.630> me<00:04:37.720> get<00:04:37.990> you<00:04:38.110> in<00:04:38.169> touch<00:04:38.380> with<00:04:38.440> somebody

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
let me get you in touch with somebody

let me get you in touch with somebody
who's<00:04:39.160> done<00:04:39.400> this<00:04:39.640> and<00:04:39.880> it<00:04:40.090> was<00:04:40.180> a<00:04:40.210> guy<00:04:40.419> who<00:04:40.479> had

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
who's done this and it was a guy who had

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.450 
who's done this and it was a guy who had
been<00:04:40.960> down<00:04:41.229> the<00:04:41.380> traditional<00:04:41.860> route<00:04:42.039> of

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
been down the traditional route of

been down the traditional route of
pushing<00:04:42.699> and<00:04:42.880> had<00:04:43.060> transitioned<00:04:43.600> to

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
pushing and had transitioned to

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.129 
pushing and had transitioned to
self-publishing<00:04:44.830> because<00:04:45.819> of<00:04:46.060> more<00:04:46.569> control

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
self-publishing because of more control

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.379 
self-publishing because of more control
of<00:04:47.169> his<00:04:47.500> product<00:04:48.009> the<00:04:48.639> ownership<00:04:48.910> of<00:04:49.240> his

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
of his product the ownership of his

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.870 
of his product the ownership of his
intellectual<00:04:49.750> property<00:04:50.530> better<00:04:51.250> royalty

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
intellectual property better royalty

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.670 
intellectual property better royalty
payments<00:04:52.419> and<00:04:52.569> that<00:04:52.690> sort<00:04:52.990> of<00:04:53.050> thing<00:04:53.110> a<00:04:53.500> little

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
payments and that sort of thing a little

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.760 
payments and that sort of thing a little
more<00:04:53.800> flexibility<00:04:54.460> I<00:04:54.699> like<00:04:55.449> the<00:04:55.690> sound<00:04:56.349> of<00:04:56.590> all

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
more flexibility I like the sound of all

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.270 
more flexibility I like the sound of all
that<00:04:56.800> so<00:04:57.669> I<00:04:58.090> eventually<00:04:58.810> found<00:04:59.050> friesen<00:05:00.039> press

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
that so I eventually found friesen press

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.140 
that so I eventually found friesen press
and<00:05:00.580> I<00:05:01.449> went<00:05:02.020> through<00:05:02.169> a<00:05:02.259> couple<00:05:02.470> of<00:05:02.680> others

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150

and I went through a couple of others
interviews<00:05:04.150> and<00:05:05.340> frankly<00:05:06.340> fries<00:05:06.550> and<00:05:06.729> crass

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
interviews and frankly fries and crass

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.360 
interviews and frankly fries and crass
offered<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:07.509> best<00:05:07.690> my<00:05:08.680> final<00:05:08.919> mess<00:05:09.160> with

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
offered the best my final mess with

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.150 
offered the best my final mess with
message<00:05:10.030> would<00:05:10.240> be<00:05:10.440> go<00:05:11.440> and<00:05:11.620> talk<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:11.830> somebody

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
message would be go and talk to somebody

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.950 
message would be go and talk to somebody
about<00:05:12.400> it<00:05:12.580> that<00:05:13.000> is<00:05:13.180> really<00:05:13.479> what<00:05:13.630> this<00:05:13.810> is

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
about it that is really what this is

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.200 
about it that is really what this is
about<00:05:14.110> if<00:05:14.889> they<00:05:15.070> tell<00:05:15.280> you<00:05:15.400> know<00:05:15.580> you're<00:05:15.849> ok

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
about if they tell you know you're ok

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.909 
about if they tell you know you're ok
you're<00:05:16.389> just<00:05:16.599> your<00:05:17.020> little<00:05:17.289> anxious<00:05:17.440> or<00:05:17.800> you

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
you're just your little anxious or you

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.409 
you're just your little anxious or you
got<00:05:18.070> a<00:05:18.099> funny<00:05:18.370> little<00:05:18.580> personality<00:05:19.360> or

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
got a funny little personality or

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.390 
got a funny little personality or
whatever<00:05:19.690> then<00:05:19.870> get<00:05:20.050> on<00:05:20.080> with<00:05:20.410> it<00:05:20.440> but<00:05:20.770> if<00:05:21.190> you

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
whatever then get on with it but if you

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.210 
whatever then get on with it but if you
have<00:05:21.610> something<00:05:21.849> like<00:05:22.180> PTSD<00:05:22.479> going<00:05:23.110> on<00:05:23.229> now<00:05:23.979> is

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
have something like PTSD going on now is

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.529 
have something like PTSD going on now is
the<00:05:24.400> time<00:05:24.580> to<00:05:24.639> get<00:05:24.880> it<00:05:25.030> correct<00:05:25.330> advice

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
the time to get it correct advice

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:29.760 
the time to get it correct advice
waiting<00:05:26.500> decades<00:05:27.270> like<00:05:28.270> I<00:05:28.479> did<00:05:28.720> that's<00:05:29.229> not

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
waiting decades like I did that's not

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:30.730 
waiting decades like I did that's not
the<00:05:29.949> way<00:05:30.039> to<00:05:30.070> do

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
the way to do

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.960 
the way to do
so<00:05:31.310> this<00:05:31.669> is<00:05:31.789> about<00:05:31.940> hope<00:05:32.289> you're<00:05:33.289> not<00:05:33.319> alone

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
so this is about hope you're not alone

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.719 
so this is about hope you're not alone
there's<00:05:34.970> lots<00:05:35.300> of<00:05:35.569> us<00:05:35.750> out<00:05:35.900> there<00:05:36.139> with<00:05:36.349> this

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
there's lots of us out there with this

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.939 
there's lots of us out there with this
and<00:05:37.729> just<00:05:38.180> it<00:05:38.509> seems<00:05:38.780> just<00:05:39.139> learning<00:05:39.530> that

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
and just it seems just learning that

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:41.290 
and just it seems just learning that
you're<00:05:40.130> not<00:05:40.250> alone<00:05:40.490> with<00:05:40.729> that<00:05:40.849> makes<00:05:41.120> it<00:05:41.270> just

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
you're not alone with that makes it just

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.370 
you're not alone with that makes it just
a<00:05:41.509> little<00:05:41.539> bit<00:05:41.750> easier<00:05:41.960> to<00:05:42.289> come<00:05:42.470> forward

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
a little bit easier to come forward

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.669 
a little bit easier to come forward
thanks<00:05:45.380> Chris<00:05:45.590> really<00:05:46.009> appreciated
