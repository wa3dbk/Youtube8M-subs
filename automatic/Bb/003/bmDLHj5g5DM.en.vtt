we<00:00:58.450> can<00:00:58.660> move<00:00:58.870> and<00:00:59.080> see<00:00:59.800> new<00:00:59.980> worlds<00:01:00.010> like<00:01:00.640> over

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
we can move and see new worlds like over

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.940 
we can move and see new worlds like over
here<00:01:01.270> oh<00:01:01.450> now<00:01:01.960> you're<00:01:02.170> in<00:01:02.290> a<00:01:02.350> waterfall<00:01:04.950> figure

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
here oh now you're in a waterfall figure

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.330 
here oh now you're in a waterfall figure
that<00:01:06.310> is<00:01:06.900> wild<00:01:07.900> look<00:01:08.140> at<00:01:08.290> I'm<00:01:08.410> going<00:01:08.680> into<00:01:09.310> a

zone<00:01:12.580> probably<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.510> most<00:01:13.600> interesting<00:01:14.080> thing

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
zone probably the most interesting thing

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.840 
zone probably the most interesting thing
about<00:01:14.260> virtual<00:01:14.770> reality<00:01:15.250> is<00:01:15.400> the<00:01:15.580> fact<00:01:15.790> that

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
about virtual reality is the fact that

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.280 
about virtual reality is the fact that
you're<00:01:16.030> seeing<00:01:16.300> your<00:01:16.510> viewpoint<00:01:17.050> on<00:01:17.170> the

world and not somebody else's it's the

surprise<00:03:03.060> professor<00:03:04.060> drew<00:03:04.359> browning<00:03:04.930> took<00:03:05.230> me

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
surprise professor drew browning took me

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.280 
surprise professor drew browning took me
on<00:03:05.439> a<00:03:05.680> tour<00:03:05.980> of<00:03:06.040> his<00:03:06.340> work<00:03:06.579> home<00:03:07.120> we<00:03:07.720> created<00:03:07.989> a

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
on a tour of his work home we created a

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.309 
on a tour of his work home we created a
house<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:09.099> that<00:03:09.489> becomes<00:03:10.359> the<00:03:10.540> front<00:03:10.930> end<00:03:11.170> or

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
house that that becomes the front end or

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.750 
house that that becomes the front end or
the<00:03:11.349> interface<00:03:11.889> so<00:03:12.099> that<00:03:12.129> people<00:03:12.579> can

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
the interface so that people can

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.879 
the interface so that people can
experience<00:03:13.150> these<00:03:13.540> various<00:03:14.319> art<00:03:14.590> works

Margolis<00:04:06.250> showed<00:04:06.579> me<00:04:06.790> some<00:04:07.030> of<00:04:07.060> this<00:04:07.269> new

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
Margolis showed me some of this new

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.349 
Margolis showed me some of this new
vocabulary<00:04:08.319> with<00:04:09.099> his<00:04:09.310> program<00:04:09.879> which<00:04:10.209> allows

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
vocabulary with his program which allows

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.319 
vocabulary with his program which allows
the<00:04:10.690> viewer<00:04:10.870> to<00:04:11.019> draw<00:04:11.409> in<00:04:11.680> 3d<00:04:12.250> so<00:04:12.879> you<00:04:12.970> can<00:04:13.239> make

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
the viewer to draw in 3d so you can make

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.000 
the viewer to draw in 3d so you can make
sort<00:04:13.629> of<00:04:13.659> any<00:04:13.840> types<00:04:14.229> of<00:04:14.409> drawings<00:04:14.799> that<00:04:14.919> you

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
sort of any types of drawings that you

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.120 
sort of any types of drawings that you
want<00:04:15.220> and<00:04:15.489> sort<00:04:16.239> of<00:04:16.329> look<00:04:16.989> around<00:04:17.139> them<00:04:17.590> rotate

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
want and sort of look around them rotate

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.430 
want and sort of look around them rotate
around<00:04:18.250> them<00:04:18.609> and<00:04:18.760> actually<00:04:18.940> walk<00:04:19.780> inside<00:04:20.229> of

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
around them and actually walk inside of

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.379 
around them and actually walk inside of
them<00:04:20.620> also<00:04:20.859> you<00:04:21.609> could<00:04:21.699> draw<00:04:21.880> anywhere<00:04:22.270> that's

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
them also you could draw anywhere that's

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:23.790 
them also you could draw anywhere that's
why<00:04:22.510> it's<00:04:22.630> called<00:04:22.690> infinite<00:04:23.199> studios<00:04:23.560> you<00:04:23.650> can

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
why it's called infinite studios you can

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.770 
why it's called infinite studios you can
make<00:04:23.979> things<00:04:24.250> as<00:04:24.460> big<00:04:24.880> or<00:04:25.030> as<00:04:25.120> small<00:04:25.180> as<00:04:25.659> you

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
make things as big or as small as you

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.950 
make things as big or as small as you
know<00:04:25.990> I<00:04:26.320> just<00:04:27.220> cover<00:04:27.580> the<00:04:27.729> whole<00:04:27.880> space<00:04:28.180> yeah

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
know I just cover the whole space yeah

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.950 
know I just cover the whole space yeah
absolutely<00:04:30.300> and<00:04:31.300> then<00:04:31.570> you<00:04:31.659> could<00:04:31.780> walk

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
absolutely and then you could walk

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.779 
absolutely and then you could walk
inside<00:04:32.380> of<00:04:32.590> it<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:33.010> could<00:04:33.130> actually<00:04:33.340> use<00:04:33.550> this

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
inside of it you could actually use this

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.600 
inside of it you could actually use this
as<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.030> sort<00:04:34.389> of<00:04:34.419> message<00:04:34.870> board<00:04:35.260> so<00:04:35.949> right<00:04:36.370> here

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
as a sort of message board so right here

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.830 
as a sort of message board so right here
I<00:04:36.639> could<00:04:36.820> sort<00:04:37.030> of<00:04:37.090> bright<00:04:37.300> WTTW<00:04:39.270> and<00:04:40.270> write<00:04:40.659> in

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
I could sort of bright WTTW and write in

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.650 
I could sort of bright WTTW and write in
3d

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
3d

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.330 
3d
well<00:04:42.990> that<00:04:43.140> just<00:04:43.320> got<00:04:43.530> you<00:04:43.680> an<00:04:43.770> extra<00:04:44.100> 30

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
well that just got you an extra 30
