we've<00:00:10.830> got<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.160> basic<00:00:11.490> interface<00:00:11.790> ahead<00:00:12.300> of

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
we've got the basic interface ahead of

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.330 
we've got the basic interface ahead of
us<00:00:12.599> with<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.440> four<00:00:13.769> different<00:00:14.070> points

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
us with this the four different points

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.370 
us with this the four different points
of<00:00:14.400> view<00:00:14.610> we're<00:00:15.299> going<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.509> go<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.960> look<00:00:16.200> at

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:16.380 
of view we're going to go and look at

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.780 
of view we're going to go and look at
the<00:00:16.529> right<00:00:16.740> hand<00:00:16.980> side<00:00:17.070> where<00:00:17.430> we've<00:00:17.520> got<00:00:17.670> the

the right hand side where we've got the

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.450 
the right hand side where we've got the
tool<00:00:18.000> section<00:00:18.710> okay<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:19.770> we've<00:00:20.130> got<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
tool section okay so we've got the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.819 
tool section okay so we've got the
objects<00:00:21.060> box<00:00:21.509> open<00:00:22.020> at<00:00:22.110> the<00:00:22.230> moment<00:00:22.380> and

objects box open at the moment and

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.040 
objects box open at the moment and
there's<00:00:23.820> different<00:00:24.180> types<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.599> object<00:00:24.960> that

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
there's different types of object that

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.229 
there's different types of object that
you<00:00:25.200> can<00:00:25.380> select<00:00:25.619> now<00:00:26.489> you<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.790> use<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> whole

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:27.239 
you can select now you can use a whole

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.690 
you can select now you can use a whole
combination<00:00:27.509> of<00:00:27.989> these<00:00:28.470> simple<00:00:29.040> objects<00:00:29.550> to

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
combination of these simple objects to

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.310 
combination of these simple objects to
shape<00:00:29.970> them<00:00:30.149> into<00:00:30.239> anything<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.840> want<00:00:31.110> really

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the movements and rotation and scaling

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.550 
the movements and rotation and scaling
of<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.700> object<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.120> you've<00:01:27.299> created

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
of the of the object that you've created

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.260 
of the of the object that you've created
so<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.860> what's<00:01:29.100> called<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.580> gizmo<00:01:30.030> and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
so this is what's called the gizmo and

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.230 
so this is what's called the gizmo and
it<00:01:31.260> shows<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.860> three<00:01:32.100> different<00:01:32.490> splines

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
it shows you the three different splines

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.380 
it shows you the three different splines
that<00:01:33.510> we<00:01:33.710> modify<00:01:34.710> our<00:01:34.740> objects<00:01:35.460> along<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.060> XY

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
that we modify our objects along the XY

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.750 
that we modify our objects along the XY
and<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:36.780> set<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.380> they're<00:01:37.950> always<00:01:38.520> in

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
and the set and they're always in

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.149 
and the set and they're always in
different<00:01:39.060> colors<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.450> got<00:01:39.630> blue<00:01:40.130> yellow<00:01:41.130> and

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
different colors we got blue yellow and

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.640 
different colors we got blue yellow and
the<00:01:41.880> right<00:01:42.060> here<00:01:42.360> now<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.200> click<00:01:43.440> in<00:01:43.590> the

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
just one part of the spline you just

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.450 
just one part of the spline you just
change<00:02:39.780> one<00:02:40.430> axis<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.760> object<00:02:42.150> okay<00:02:43.460> this

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
change one axis of the object okay this

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.690 
change one axis of the object okay this
is<00:02:44.640> how<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.850> create<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.810> modify<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:47.250> object

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
is how you create and modify the object

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.390 
is how you create and modify the object
