00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.730
 hey people or at the start with 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.919
 a new episode today and sometimes with 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.740
 a completely different Swiss theme 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.530
 Manufacturers vector has on the base year 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.780
 2015 a very interesting smart watch 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.090
 so there are two in total 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.660
 piece of this manufacturer once you see 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.980
 you here 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.740
 the user with the display and a 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.310
 diameter of 44 mm and here you see 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.560
 using the media with a real display 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.110
 40 5 millimeters they are indeed 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.010
 interesting is the smart switches is cool 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.840
 but that should receive up to 30 days 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.760
 that 's crazy, it' s just there 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.379
 do not stop my whole day 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.329
 not even half a day a few 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.360
 come now that had a few days 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.629
 but because this keeps you watching for 30 days 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.289
 here for example the user here can 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.329
 you imagine 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.430
 it just has a digital one 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.890
 monochrome display means this 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.309
 one color, one can say black 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.010
 know and you know it from today's e 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.799
 books also run that way 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.750
 a huge savings and they have one 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.909
 own operating system that the whole 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.400
 still possible we are beautiful 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.770
 but the dial also lights up the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.630
 The clock is cool all the time 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.180
 it recognized in three images again 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.159
 solid stainless steel bracelet leather bracelet 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.950
 or a no and bracelet these three 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.509
 variants are typed up to 50 liters 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.640
 Water is not a cool feature 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.860
 really cool but the top hammer is 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.409
 just the whole running android ios and 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.990
 on the windows phone that is also one 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.299
 really cool thing all started 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.979
 have the apple yes for what do you need 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.899
 a smartphone at all that's it 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.880
 too expensive and there are those under pressure 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.009
 I think the vector is exactly this 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.600
 target group meets for the people 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.119
 actually not sure yet 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.159
 what you need a smart today is it 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.070
 a cool mix of new director in 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.930
 Two o'clock is such a cool 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.549
 between you think you have to 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.960
 Imagine that does not look 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.259
 again normal clock which is operated on 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.700
 the pages with these three buttons and hp 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.190
 smart touch function and you have to 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.020
 the running match gives three rubrics 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.080
 in the past there were two in my 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.200
 There are now three 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.380
 once the standish must be called one 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.260
 smart watch with a sim card the 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.450
 completely without problems has worked 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.000
 received three lte region and 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.280
 imperfectly working or the cellphone 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.730
 the second part is the 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.290
 support 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.870
 that means it supports or means 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.880
 it is available and I will post it to you 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.530
 times in the info card and videos 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.220
 if that denies you, look at you 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.440
 one time 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.560
 But the way is different 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.970
 is also a support but more than 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.300
 Supporters thought that means you can 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.340
 there are no apps on it but now 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.530
 still retrieve messages 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.080
 should read news read the man 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.870
 stop get all the information 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.330
 Students have the whole fitness trek 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.430
 currently running around the apps of vector 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.050
 Nonetheless , the others want 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.390
 offer developers the opportunity 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.670
 make for even more apps for this 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.490
 she can now develop the cool 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.459
 Watches are available this summer 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.190
 expected release date and 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.050
 criticized this I need you once 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.120
 the link to that since a thanks goes to 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.280
 if you have the footage around that 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.430
 video material has provided 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.400
 he was there with live on the 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.810
 baselworld 2015 could handle the clock 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.190
 could keep up behind the scenes with 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.430
 the whole developer speak on the 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.130
 cool report on his blog over 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.050
 and thanks for the material with 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.060
 I could use this material for you 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.500
 Produce video if you like the video 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.260
 If I like such videos 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.790
 should produce more often just one 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.420
 let me dream one up 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.239
 comment 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.040
 and more important, please tell me something 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.989
 you would receive from this 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.760
 You will buy with smart this time 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.830
 do you sell or do you of that 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.360
 completely distance the topic we see 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.360
 We'll see you next time
