you<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.540> know<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.750> tempo<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
you have to do is know the tempo of the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.500 
you have to do is know the tempo of the
song<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.130> beat<00:01:08.280> match<00:01:08.490> any<00:01:08.790> track<00:01:09.210> ok

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
song and you can beat match any track ok

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.340 
song and you can beat match any track ok
so<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.840> track<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.470> at<00:01:10.770> 128<00:01:11.610> beats<00:01:11.850> per<00:01:12.030> minute

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
so this track is at 128 beats per minute

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.149 
so this track is at 128 beats per minute
to<00:01:13.350> get<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:14.250> 129<00:01:14.810> we<00:01:15.810> need<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.140> push<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
to get it to 129 we need to push the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.090 
to get it to 129 we need to push the
pitch<00:01:17.400> bend<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:18.409> positive<00:01:19.409> point<00:01:20.159> eight<00:01:20.630> ok<00:01:22.100> so

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
pitch bend to positive point eight ok so

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.600 
pitch bend to positive point eight ok so
let's<00:01:23.369> put<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.670> at<00:01:23.790> positive<00:01:24.060> point<00:01:24.630> eight<00:01:26.930> 129

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
let's put it at positive point eight 129

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.440 
let's put it at positive point eight 129
to<00:01:29.610> get<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.880> 130<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.780> needs<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.619> 2<00:01:32.250> plus<00:01:32.579> 0.8

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
to get to 130 it needs to be 2 plus 0.8

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.330 
to get to 130 it needs to be 2 plus 0.8
so<00:01:33.930> that's<00:01:34.140> one<00:01:34.470> point<00:01:34.770> six<00:01:35.420> and<00:01:37.130> there's<00:01:38.130> at

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
so that's one point six and there's at

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.090 
so that's one point six and there's at
130<00:01:38.850> right<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:40.200> moves<00:01:40.470> backwards<00:01:40.860> as<00:01:40.950> well

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
130 right this moves backwards as well

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.780 
130 right this moves backwards as well
so<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.460> let's<00:01:42.450> say<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.750> track<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.229> at<00:01:43.619> 128<00:01:44.520> and

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
so if let's say this track is at 128 and

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.230 
so if let's say this track is at 128 and
we<00:01:45.090> needed<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.509> get<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.990> 125<00:01:46.860> that's<00:01:47.850> three

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
we needed to get it to 125 that's three

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.830 
we needed to get it to 125 that's three
bpms<00:01:48.840> down<00:01:49.049> eight<00:01:49.590> times<00:01:50.220> 324<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.509> we<00:01:51.630> need<00:01:51.750> to

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
bpms down eight times 324 so we need to

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.859 
bpms down eight times 324 so we need to
go<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.990> negative<00:01:52.350> two<00:01:53.100> point<00:01:53.280> four<00:01:53.610> Oh<00:01:56.869> too

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
go to negative two point four Oh too

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.750 
go to negative two point four Oh too
much<00:01:58.070> back<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> little<00:01:59.219> bit

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.550 

negative<00:02:02.300> two<00:02:02.480> point<00:02:02.660> four<00:02:02.900> it's<00:02:03.260> close

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
negative two point four it's close

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.560 
negative two point four it's close
enough<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.860> 125<00:02:04.640> so<00:02:05.920> that's<00:02:06.920> how<00:02:07.190> it<00:02:07.280> works

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
enough to 125 so that's how it works

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.480 
enough to 125 so that's how it works
each<00:02:08.570> temper<00:02:09.170> point<00:02:09.500> is<00:02:09.680> worth<00:02:09.979> Oh<00:02:10.220> point

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
each temper point is worth Oh point

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.450 
each temper point is worth Oh point
eight<00:02:10.670> percent<00:02:11.150> on<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.480> pitch<00:02:11.660> band<00:02:12.310> which<00:02:13.310> is

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
eight percent on the pitch band which is

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.020 
eight percent on the pitch band which is
great<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:13.970> if<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.750> just<00:02:14.960> know<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:16.580> tempo<00:02:16.940> of

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
great so if you just know the tempo of

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.370 
great so if you just know the tempo of
