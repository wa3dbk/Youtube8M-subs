00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 today in the menu of my personal train there is 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.690
 the risotto with green asparagus that 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.300
 thanks to the advice of a dear lady 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.700
 I will prepare very very much indeed 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.889
 therefore we will not prepare the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.770
 classic asparagus sauce to add 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.779
 rice or we will use asparagus like this 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.279
 how they are common and with the peel 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.650
 and is curious to discover the recipe 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.930
 then don't miss the video for 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.900
 prepare 4 portions of risotto with 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.550
 asparagus we need 500 grams 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.670
 of green asparagus 280 grams of rice per 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.760
 risotto 600 thousand liters of broth 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.989
 vegetable or meat 100 milliliters of 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.379
 dry white wine a clove of garlic 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:49.350
 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil salt 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.640
 pepper just 30 grams of cheese 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.649
 grated parmesan cheese, then 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.530
 girls and two words before starting 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.629
 I suggested you use the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.059
 classic green asparagus you can 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.670
 find simply at the supermarket 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.250
 but if you like you can also collect 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.590
 wild asparagus from mine 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.700
 parts are called sparatine that I am 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.880
 also went to collect with 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.950
 the administrator now let's see how 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.350
 settle down spread it instead of 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.310
 peel them as you usually do 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.540
 we remove the most extreme part that 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.540
 maybe a little harder 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.040
 remove the point from point is the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.479
 plunge into a saucepan with water 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.909
 which then we will need the tips for 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.040
 decoration while the stem is removed 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.079
 so I repeat that after having them 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.259
 clearly washed well remove 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.299
 pieces and put them aside 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.600
 we do the same thing with all 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.600
 asparagus 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.560
 as I told you, I put all the pins 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.259
 inside the promised saucepan the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.330
 here a bit of salt we go to cook for 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.600
 about 10 minutes 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.009
 what we do instead with the stems 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.590
 let's look at blending them directly like that 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.260
 to form a cream a carella that 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.010
 then we will cook with a little oil 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.010
 salt pepper 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.780
 we thus obtained a cream of 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.200
 asparagus you see that beautiful that I put 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.610
 two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:30.370
 we put a little pepper diary 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.290
 abundant in my opinion the pepper is 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.850
 important when eating 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.850
 asparagus a little salt as required 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.660
 we mix we can cook on the fire 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:46.720
 moderate for about 10 minutes 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.450
 in the meantime we heat the broth 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.510
 vegetable meat even if you like it 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.760
 more 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.859
 after ten minutes of slow cooking e 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.400
 what we do we can remove or 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:05.290
 the stick co 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:11.310
 I can't ok with the garlic we raise the 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.310
 flame eto'o we are the rice 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.420
 we mix stir until the 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.250
 rice begins to creak 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.800
 feel the rice that fries the good 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.340
 so now we can blend with the 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.650
 white wine always sustained flame 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.880
 we mix for well until complete 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.880
 alcohol processing 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.250
 once evaporated lay what 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:41.510
 let's start to hydrate ours 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.430
 rice I put the broth itself to boil 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.610
 add slowly I hope after 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.170
 ladle and I recommend mix a lot 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.670
 often to facilitate spillage 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.230
 of starch from every grain 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.099
 in this way we could also get 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:58.010
 a strangely creamy risotto 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:00.349
 meanwhile I also drained the tips 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.720
 of asparagus that have become soft 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.799
 at the right point for better cooking 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.380
 which I have not told you before 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.329
 you may also prefer cooking a 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.500
 steam however to speed up the times I have 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.500
 preferred to boil them 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.669
 we continue to hydrate as I told you 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.530
 in short, for about 10 12 minutes the heads 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:26.160
 seems on the package the time of 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:29.040
 cooking indicates two minutes before the 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.020
 After cooking you see how the 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.290
 risotto must be a little soft noah 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.510
 don't dry it too much what we do 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:43.560
 if we add the grana cheese 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:46.680
 grated the flame goes and then it 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.410
 let us maintain with the cheese instead of 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.270
 use butter or cream 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.770
 we use the sub-line the result 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.300
 it will be excellent anyway 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.740
 we will get an extremely risotto between 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.110
 Moscow 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.950
 we mix stir then we will go to 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.030
 implant with a couple of minutes 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.520
 this risotto from the preparation 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.669
 really unusual has so impressed me since 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.530
 to push me to propose the taste 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.540
 of asparagus is enhanced e 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.400
 let's face it the preparation is also 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.350
 extremely simple I invite you to 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.110
 try this recipe and let me tell you 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.010
 what different you find with the classic e 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.010
 used as facts
