of cut angel food cake inside there I've

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.200 
of cut angel food cake inside there I've
already<00:00:37.739> washed<00:00:37.920> my<00:00:38.040> hands<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.700> clean

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.270 
already washed my hands so it's clean
but<00:00:39.600> I'd<00:00:39.780> recommend<00:00:39.960> squishing<00:00:40.739> down<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
but I'd recommend squishing down the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.970 
but I'd recommend squishing down the
cake<00:00:41.489> with<00:00:41.700> spoons<00:00:42.660> rather<00:00:43.110> than<00:00:43.440> your<00:00:43.559> hands

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
cake with spoons rather than your hands

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.770 
cake with spoons rather than your hands
I<00:00:44.070> was<00:00:44.190> making<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.550> for<00:00:44.760> myself<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.420> wasn't

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
I was making this for myself so I wasn't

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.830 
I was making this for myself so I wasn't
really<00:00:45.930> caring<00:00:46.350> at<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.469> moment<00:00:46.860> but<00:00:47.840> then

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
really caring at the moment but then

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.319 
really caring at the moment but then
you're<00:00:48.960> gonna<00:00:49.079> get<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:50.370> spoon<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.789> pudding<00:00:51.090> if

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
you're gonna get the spoon of pudding if

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.110 
you're gonna get the spoon of pudding if
you<00:00:51.390> wanted<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.350> now's<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.100> time<00:00:53.280> I'll

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
you wanted that and now's the time I'll

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.330 
you wanted that and now's the time I'll
basically<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.780> spoon<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.140> down<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.710> get<00:00:56.219> her

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
basically just spoon it down and get her

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.090 
basically just spoon it down and get her
around<00:00:56.640> there<00:00:56.969> but<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.050> does<00:00:58.260> make<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.649> look<00:00:58.859> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
around there but it does make it look a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.060 
around there but it does make it look a
bit<00:00:59.160> messy<00:00:59.460> but<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:01.079> pudding<00:01:01.320> basically<00:01:01.920> it

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
bit messy but the pudding basically it

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.090 
bit messy but the pudding basically it
just<00:01:02.340> adds<00:01:02.550> more<00:01:02.850> flavor<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.719> it

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
just adds more flavor to it

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.620 
just adds more flavor to it
after<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.309> just<00:01:05.729> add<00:01:05.939> slices<00:01:06.330> of

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
after this just add slices of

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.179 
after this just add slices of
strawberries<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.320> didn't<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:07.710> an<00:01:07.830> exact

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
strawberries I didn't have an exact

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.700 
strawberries I didn't have an exact
measurement<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.360> added<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:10.049> much<00:01:10.530> as

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
measurement but I just added as much as

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.200 
measurement but I just added as much as
I<00:01:10.830> thought<00:01:11.010> was<00:01:11.189> okay<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:11.549> if<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.000> want<00:01:12.150> an

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
I thought was okay but if you want an

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.289 
I thought was okay but if you want an
exact<00:01:12.570> measurement<00:01:12.720> maybe<00:01:13.200> half<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.650> cup<00:01:14.299> but

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
exact measurement maybe half a cup but

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.230 
exact measurement maybe half a cup but
yeah<00:01:15.600> layer<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.110> after<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.369> add<00:01:17.640> more

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
yeah layer that after that just add more

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.570 
yeah layer that after that just add more
whipped<00:01:18.659> cream<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.500> as<00:01:19.860> much<00:01:20.009> as<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.310> want

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
whipped cream and as much as you want

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.030 
whipped cream and as much as you want
just<00:01:21.270> make<00:01:21.450> sure<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.110> even<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.590> up<00:01:22.619> and

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
just make sure that you even it up and

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.490 
just make sure that you even it up and
it<00:01:23.700> depends<00:01:24.060> how<00:01:24.180> much<00:01:24.299> you're<00:01:24.509> making<00:01:24.900> but

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
it depends how much you're making but

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.080 
it depends how much you're making but
basically<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.220> repeat<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.700> steps<00:01:26.939> until

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
basically just repeat the steps until

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.060 
basically just repeat the steps until
the<00:01:27.450> base<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.750> jar<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.020> nearly<00:01:28.290> full<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:28.920> you're

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the base of jar is nearly full so you're

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.930 
the base of jar is nearly full so you're
able<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.369> close<00:01:29.729> it

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
able to close it

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.850 
able to close it
after<00:01:32.940> that<00:01:33.180> now<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.870> add<00:01:34.110> your<00:01:34.409> personal

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.090 
after that now you can add your personal
toppings<00:01:35.430> we<00:01:36.390> put<00:01:36.720> crushed<00:01:37.440> almonds

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.500 
personally I'm not a big fan of them but
they<00:01:40.470> tasted<00:01:40.770> pretty<00:01:40.950> good<00:01:41.210> like<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.330> said<00:01:42.479> I
