00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.930
 after the successes of the sloop knowing that the government today in the national market 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:24.520
 another version of the compact pickup truck 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.909
 every few places 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:28.909
 to sailboat cross 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.250
 The wedding stands out because it allied with a wallet. 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.910
 tender in addition to quality comfort equipment in the finish 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.910
 unusual in this segment 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.970
 the pickup was developed in parallel with the new sloop 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.340
 a work that involved hundreds of engineers 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.780
 technicians and said that 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.550
 as with all the products of volkswagen there was a deep 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.590
 concern about the accuracy of adjustments between the components of the 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.720
 bodywork effort result integrated engineering departments 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.820
 of production 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.960
 following the same characteristics adopted in the SUVs of the 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.310
 brand produced in europe 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.310
 the details of varzim powder from Brazil were concerned with units 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.360
 the work took several months involved dozens of people in Brazil 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.000
 and in germany 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.130
 the sloop cross was created to serve a consumer 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.509
 lifestyle and differentiated behaviors 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.800
 looking for a vehicle 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.810
 practical at the same time comfort sophistication 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.600
 your audience is predominantly young 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.600
 passionate about staying 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.140
 the photo is offered only with extended cabin 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.620
 allowing greater comfort to the occupants 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.730
 and the possibility of carrying luggage and inside 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.580
 characterized by the exclusive finish 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.770
 where high quality materials were used 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.769
 the concern with ergonomics and the pianist of passengers also noted 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.559
 chem 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:21.749
 but beyond the next Sunday 16 due to violent foul 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:26.219
 mounted cross-sectional which ensures you get rich 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.129
 hear agility here 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.540
 the two work together with an average manual transmission of 200 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.150
 of five gears recognized by the precision and smoothness of the inserts as 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.290
 everyone already felt horsepower when fueled with gasoline and 104 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.290
 horsepower fueled with ethanol 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:53.619
 as an actor and transmission allied to the suspension ensure an excellent level 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:56.619
 of performance and handling the load capacity 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.190
 and high reliability 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.709
 a characteristic of the sloop cross as the whole sloop line 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.989
 is the reduced front balance that combined with great distance 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.469
 between axles provides a better distribution of weight and allows 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.469
 obstacles more easily. 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:22.519
 in the same way the rear balance contributes to the agility of the VIP track 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.519
 in its stability 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:31.000
 with the use of tires for mixed use makes the vehicle larger 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:36.209
 adhesion on soil floors and provide greater control in the sand in 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.089
 mud 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:43.979
 in the same way as the other versions of the new sloop to cross sloop I understand that 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:47.689
 the vocation being built for work and the blazers 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:51.699
 check out 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.389
 - with extended cab 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.490
 the sabesp provide us with driver and passenger 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.409
 with excellent comfort level 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:03.219
 and has easy access through the large doors that can be 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:06.219
 available in three different years 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.299
 the version comes equipped as standard with the new sliding back leg 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.690
 all components 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.010
 aligned on a single surface when closed 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.639
 one of them civilian seven color options 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.409
 two of them in italy 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:24.029
 in the spirit of the world 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.969
 the orange
