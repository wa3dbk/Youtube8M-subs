00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.650
 buondÃ¬ ragazzuoli today we talk about blood 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.079
 borno maybe what the title most 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.430
 expected for playstation 4 and for a lot 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.140
 of very good reasons 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.000
 as you see non stop was in this video 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.399
 also because of the preview of blood bourne 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.899
 we did it after I saw that when 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:33.329
 we went to the passion xperience a 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.989
 london at the playstation pre event 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.719
 experience 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.300
 we could not get our hands on 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.519
 build of the cialis dungeon that was 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.839
 shown but gameplay is released then 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.749
 we'll use that to make the video 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:48.570
 preview is a truly remarkable gameplay 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:50.309
 because why the cialis dungeon this 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.070
 something that was just revealed in blood 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.359
 board is actually a dungeon 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.629
 procedural what it means means that 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:00.839
 the dungeon is randomly generated 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.809
 from an internal game algorithm and 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.460
 so each time it's different with different ones 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.920
 enemies different positioning of the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.440
 same different different setting 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.090
 map structure and so on 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.010
 map shown everyone saw it 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.690
 during playstation experience was 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.730
 rather simple but it was still up 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.940
 three levels that are then connected 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.440
 it means that the most used algorithm 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.120
 allows the title to be created anyway 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.150
 quite complex maps though 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.430
 not huge and in general this cialis 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.440
 dungeon is just a piece of blood board 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.590
 but everything else is similar to the old ones 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.660
 source in the fact that it is anyway 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.420
 of very elaborate maps created by from 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.040
 inch by inch but these 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.380
 procedural maps increase enormously 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.719
 the contents 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.549
 and not just because it is once 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:48.979
 generated begins lisangela not this 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.130
 can be blocked by player for 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.789
 how much he wants and can be tightened with i 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.700
 his friends 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.679
 which means that you can do it at all 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.720
 the effects complete charlize dungeon 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.729
 in the company of friends in multiplayer 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.799
 unfortunately it cannot be invited 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.509
 directly a friend because 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.549
 a structure is still used 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.920
 match making similar to that of the old ones 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.510
 members where the player level 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.360
 too high can not play with 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.549
 however, players of too low a level are 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.620
 as easily as possible 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.000
 complete this kind of dungeon in 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.040
 company of their own friends 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.739
 the friend list is a great idea 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.060
 and the sky cannot be influenced 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.190
 in its partially training 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.310
 doing a ritual to that 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.209
 goblet in fact that gives its name to the dungeon 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.519
 using objects no better 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.500
 not specified yet is not clear 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.180
 what they really wanted to explain 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.760
 do these things on the glass thing 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.290
 there was no face in this ritual 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.140
 again explained if the bosses are 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.370
 randomized each time or however yes 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.170
 This is a selection of bosses 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.700
 preexisting they didn't want to reveal us 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.160
 some wanted to keep a certain 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.780
 halo of mystery but the basic idea is 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
 really very interesting for how much 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.889
 it's about everything else it's always 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.109
 very solid atmosphere to sell enemies 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.900
 very bad gameplay much faster 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.980
 compared to souls improved 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.019
 exceptionally in certain elements in 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.299
 particular for the fact of the weapons and 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.700
 box sets that vary during the combo 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.470
 because in Rome it turns really is a 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.819
 game and promising for the moment is 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.100
 what we want most for 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.840
 playstation 4 and at the moment it seems the 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.950
 most solid product coming for the 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.209
 sony console 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.340
 at least with regard to ours 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.590
 tastes nothing we want to play 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.950
 will arrive in March we hope for good 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.950
 to the next
