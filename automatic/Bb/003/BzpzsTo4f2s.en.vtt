 the staff even more in the video next to the top hat in Brazil 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.820
 by law companies have greatly improved in the process how to register their number 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.300
 server goals 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.309
 this lot is included in the website of the program called for the US 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:16.109
 the comprehensive 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.070
 to another team www pucpr br the deputy 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.140
 and is that we have no one on the site of the telegraph line to publish the 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.140
 chronic 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:31.390
 here and there 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.470
 I said it was owned in the community 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.890
 the neck is in the right moment 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.800
 focused other technology 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.590
 right 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.330
 Besides that 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.330
 We'll put food in a brief 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.000
 because 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.330
 Tokyo 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.190
 with category tricolor will need to change technology 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.890
 according to the mayor 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.380
 geek 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.820
 state that you agree with the terms of the foreign service 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.220
 then work out 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.590
 here congratulations if the ones you receive on your site 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.620
 the question is whether many years ago 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.800
 servers this time that is with the poor people for me and so 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.590
 collaborated for the program 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.590
 production was reduced 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.400
 what a creative horror of password manager 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.520
 here who is who on the new site 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.520
 while at maturity 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.270
 I will not take you will put what is different from perfect rental and with 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.270
 What would he do to the poor people? 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.659
 apparently small dishes have to be stopped 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.230
 thiago heleno can get it wrong 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.230
 he stayed at all times 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.030
 8 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.390
 Yet 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.670
 this way 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.329
 click here 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.179
 everything everything everything everything 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:14.749
 while he is now for 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:18.160
 those of power that have got index html 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.160
 right click on it that you delete 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:26.259
 and it's just that you are and you are what you think on the right side of the attack and yet 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:30.819
 have your computer and the right side is the remote control that is your website 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.840
 to which you can navigate with the folders and here for example that the files are 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.309
 of matches 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:40.309
 that you access the website 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:44.209
 let's assume that what the files of the actions actions 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.719
 you select 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.719
 right-click via 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.619
 will upload the files from the site you created 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:59.039
 I preferred to be interested in being humiliated and these things 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:00.969
 and when you have it 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.199
 she says that for him it is all in secret another attraction aside 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:09.589
 to know your site will be your friend the pilot was gathered close 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.480
 little different from direct confrontation 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:25.239
 in case of cancel 15 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.059
 ae - you can see 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:30.999
 It's him I'm working without understanding why. 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:34.339
 because there was no thump to get out of here 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.729
 who implied that we here 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:40.619
 are not valid for the whole of Brazil but it was a demonstration show 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:42.539
 change that your site 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:46.049
 with this was another technological victory any doubt in 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.259
 any video player at 40min from the first time click to see more of 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:53.549
 near the olympic with battery that imitated a dead pig 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:56.079

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.589
