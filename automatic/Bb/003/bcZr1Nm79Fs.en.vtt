00:00:01.416 --> 00:00:04.574
 The relationship and significance of animal testing and REACH regulations 

00:00:04.853 --> 00:00:13.003
 According to the European REACH Regulation, if you are a producer and importer of any chemical products, your existing new regulations need to be implemented. 

00:00:14.095 --> 00:00:21.827
 First, you must register with REACH in accordance with the product category. REACH is the current European Chemicals Agency and its headquarters is located in Helsinki, Finland. 

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:36.240
 Whether you are using old ingredients for many years or new ingredients that are newly developed, you must register and provide a series of safety data files about the ingredients. 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.189
 The following example will give you a better understanding of how it works. 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:54.660
 Suppose you are a manufacturer of vanillin chemicals. (It is a common food chemical and will be used in the universally synthesized Yunnela perfume.) 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.325
 You must register with REACH as a producer of vanillin. 

00:01:01.138 --> 00:01:09.730
 The agency then organizes companies that register the same component into a common group called SIEF. 

00:01:10.194 --> 00:01:13.747
 This is an interoperable platform and forum for information exchange. 

00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:27.284
 In your vanillin SIEF, there are large capital-rich companies and small-scale companies, including some small suppliers of LUSH raw materials. 

00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:36.595
 Each SIEF group must provide all safety data files for this component to REACH. 

00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:43.240
 To do this, you must collect all the data to complete the entire data file. 

00:01:43.863 --> 00:01:48.690
 Maybe you will find that some data is missing, but you still need to fill all the files. 

00:01:50.388 --> 00:02:01.200
 Suppose we lack some data on vanillin, such as melting temperature flare points or flammable eye irritation test 

00:02:02.578 --> 00:02:11.660
 You must work with the companies in the group to find out the missing data. If you can't find out the data, it represents the component test. 

00:02:12.238 --> 00:02:18.070
 Who can contribute money to test the ingredients? 

00:02:18.507 --> 00:02:31.950
 This may be the cost shared by the companies in the group, or the company that only agrees to the test. Individual SIEF groups will make individual debates and decide on their own solutions. 

00:02:32.462 --> 00:02:40.360
 You can test the melting temperature, burst point and flammability of the ingredients in the laboratory. 

00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:44.560
 But eye irritation tests are relatively tricky. 

00:02:44.815 --> 00:02:52.380
 As there is no complete replacement test, the chances of animal testing are very high. 

00:02:54.266 --> 00:03:02.360
 Finally, your SIEF group will need to apply to the European Chemicals Agency for an animal test to complete the entire data file. 

00:03:03.763 --> 00:03:06.020
 This is LUSH's concern about REACH. 

00:03:06.224 --> 00:03:09.720
 LUSH suppliers have the opportunity to conduct animal testing. 

00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:18.110
 For many years, LUSH has been strictly implementing anti-animal testing policies, and all suppliers will not conduct any animal testing at all. 

00:03:18.786 --> 00:03:24.920
 Our policy does not purify suppliers who have any animal ingredients and animal testing. 

00:03:26.054 --> 00:03:38.690
 Under the REACH regulation, some suppliers who have promised no animal testing have the opportunity to complete the animal data test through the SIEF community due to regulatory requirements to complete the entire data file. 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.240
 Such regulations really make us very sad! 

00:03:42.215 --> 00:03:46.980
 Our successful adherence to the 17-year conscience rule is being seriously trampled! 

00:03:49.506 --> 00:03:56.590
 The existence of law is to lead people to do the right thing, not to force us to do something very stupid and wrong. 

00:03:56.913 --> 00:04:03.530
 LUSH will never compromise the REACH regulations until the animal test is completely removed from the regulations.
