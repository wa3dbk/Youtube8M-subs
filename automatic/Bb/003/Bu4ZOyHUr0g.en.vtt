all right so one thing I noticed while I
was<00:02:20.819> playing<00:02:21.209> around<00:02:21.359> with<00:02:21.510> these<00:02:21.719> pills

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
was playing around with these pills

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.259 
was playing around with these pills
earlier<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.469> that<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:23.370> volume<00:02:23.760> knob<00:02:23.969> on<00:02:24.150> the

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
earlier is that the volume knob on the

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:30.410 
earlier is that the volume knob on the
big<00:02:24.510> muff<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:27.109> what's<00:02:28.670> much<00:02:29.670> more<00:02:29.700> sensitive

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
big muff is what's much more sensitive

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.030 
big muff is what's much more sensitive
than<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.689> volume<00:02:30.930> knob<00:02:31.109> on<00:02:31.200> here<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:31.709> like<00:02:31.859> if

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
than the volume knob on here so like if

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.360 
than the volume knob on here so like if
I<00:02:32.129> go<00:02:32.780> thumb<00:02:33.780> all<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:33.989> way<00:02:34.109> down<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.099> bring

not<00:02:48.409> much<00:02:48.620> volume<00:02:48.980> change<00:02:49.250> from<00:02:49.579> here<00:02:49.819> to<00:02:49.909> here

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
not much volume change from here to here

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.970 
not much volume change from here to here
but<00:02:51.109> on<00:02:51.230> this<00:02:51.439> one

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980
