about<00:02:43.989> four<00:02:44.290> bucks<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:45.070> mean<00:02:45.820> it's<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.239> solid

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
about four bucks I mean it's a solid

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.500 
about four bucks I mean it's a solid
uncommon<00:02:47.410> so<00:02:48.280> it's<00:02:48.850> definitely<00:02:49.330> going<00:02:49.450> to

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
uncommon so it's definitely going to

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.509 
uncommon so it's definitely going to
hold<00:02:49.720> its<00:02:49.870> value<00:02:49.959> around<00:02:50.530> four<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:50.980> five<00:02:51.190> I

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
hold its value around four to five I

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.100 
hold its value around four to five I
would<00:02:52.300> I<00:02:52.570> would<00:02:52.630> suspect<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:54.209> however<00:02:55.209> 12<00:02:55.690> is

number nine we have mills from pulse
this<00:03:15.850> is<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.060> really<00:03:16.510> good<00:03:16.840> rare<00:03:17.610> as<00:03:18.610> it<00:03:18.670> was

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
this is a really good rare as it was

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.380 
this is a really good rare as it was
rare<00:03:19.299> before<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:21.280> expected<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.910> its<00:03:22.030> value

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
rare before so I expected a its value

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.270 
rare before so I expected a its value
dropped<00:03:22.750> by<00:03:22.959> about<00:03:22.989> half<00:03:23.230> from<00:03:23.829> its<00:03:24.100> current

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
dropped by about half from its current

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.940 
dropped by about half from its current
value<00:03:24.430> being<00:03:24.820> a<00:03:24.940> 15<00:03:25.299> to<00:03:26.110> eight<00:03:26.320> dollars<00:03:26.769> the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
value being a 15 to eight dollars the

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.470 
value being a 15 to eight dollars the
fact<00:03:27.160> that<00:03:27.280> they<00:03:27.489> will<00:03:27.610> be<00:03:27.640> open<00:03:27.880> you'll<00:03:28.299> be<00:03:28.420> in

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
fact that they will be open you'll be in

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.789 
fact that they will be open you'll be in
the<00:03:28.540> rare<00:03:28.720> slot<00:03:29.049> will<00:03:29.260> make<00:03:29.410> it<00:03:29.560> a<00:03:29.620> lot<00:03:29.739> more

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
the rare slot will make it a lot more

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.979 
the rare slot will make it a lot more
common<00:03:30.430> so<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.150> would<00:03:31.299> suspect<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.780> see<00:03:31.959> a

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
common so I would suspect to see a

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.110 
common so I would suspect to see a
50-percent<00:03:32.829> process<00:03:33.190> all<00:03:33.579> right<00:03:33.670> next<00:03:33.790> up<00:03:33.970> we

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
50-percent process all right next up we

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.789 
50-percent process all right next up we
got<00:03:34.150> doubling<00:03:34.660> season<00:03:34.870> I'm<00:03:35.200> really<00:03:35.440> expecting

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
got doubling season I'm really expecting

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.420 
got doubling season I'm really expecting
this<00:03:36.040> cord<00:03:36.310> to<00:03:36.549> drop<00:03:37.450> dramatically<00:03:37.989> in<00:03:38.170> price

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
this cord to drop dramatically in price

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.590 
this cord to drop dramatically in price
they're<00:03:39.430> really<00:03:39.579> really<00:03:39.880> hard<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.180> find<00:03:40.420> but

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
they're really really hard to find but

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.569 
they're really really hard to find but
it<00:03:40.720> will<00:03:40.870> be<00:03:40.900> in<00:03:41.049> that<00:03:41.170> rear<00:03:41.440> slot<00:03:41.769> so<00:03:42.220> I'm

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
it will be in that rear slot so I'm

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.350 
it will be in that rear slot so I'm
suspecting<00:03:43.890> $35<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:45.160> be<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.549> little<00:03:45.940> bit<00:03:46.120> much

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
suspecting $35 to be a little bit much

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.930 
suspecting $35 to be a little bit much
so<00:03:47.260> you<00:03:47.320> could<00:03:47.680> expect<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.250> see<00:03:48.459> that<00:03:48.670> coming

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
so you could expect to see that coming

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.509 
so you could expect to see that coming
in<00:03:49.030> around<00:03:49.150> 12<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.810> 15<00:03:50.230> dollar<00:03:50.470> next<00:03:51.250> up<00:03:51.370> at

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
in around 12 to 15 dollar next up at

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.430 
in around 12 to 15 dollar next up at
number<00:03:51.760> 7<00:03:52.090> we<00:03:52.120> got<00:03:52.359> our<00:03:52.510> cabal<00:03:52.750> ravager<00:03:53.260> this

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
number 7 we got our cabal ravager this

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.770 
number 7 we got our cabal ravager this
has<00:03:53.620> been<00:03:54.160> one<00:03:54.340> of<00:03:54.370> those<00:03:54.519> solid<00:03:55.030> 20<00:03:55.329> to<00:03:55.420> 25

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
has been one of those solid 20 to 25

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.870 
has been one of those solid 20 to 25
dollar<00:03:56.019> cards<00:03:56.350> for<00:03:56.560> quite<00:03:56.769> some<00:03:57.100> time<00:03:57.130> now<00:03:57.370> I

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
dollar cards for quite some time now I

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.400 
dollar cards for quite some time now I
suspect<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:58.840> sit<00:03:59.049> around<00:03:59.170> 10<00:03:59.560> bucks<00:03:59.799> maybe<00:04:00.220> 15

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
suspect to sit around 10 bucks maybe 15

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.810 
suspect to sit around 10 bucks maybe 15
but<00:04:01.530> I'm<00:04:01.620> thinking<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.130> tins<00:04:02.430> probably

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
but I'm thinking that tins probably

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.640 
but I'm thinking that tins probably
where<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.030> belongs<00:04:03.330> so<00:04:04.140> that's<00:04:04.290> number<00:04:04.380> seven

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
where it belongs so that's number seven

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.190 
where it belongs so that's number seven
