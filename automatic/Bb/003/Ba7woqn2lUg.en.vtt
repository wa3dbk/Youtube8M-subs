00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.649
 good people here in the snot is not a 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.500
 magic trick but how to make an effect 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.120
 what does dynamo do if you already come 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.740
 mind and the video 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.470
 that was a deck of cards or something like that but 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.349
 if I do not hide the truth I just do 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.939
 half but same looks good 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.939
 then it leaves me 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.150
 something will grab me with others 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.770
 or this way 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:42.310
 the fingers to each and the other field 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.310
 then with this 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.690
 how 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:50.540
 with 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.720
 this finger 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:57.560
 they are going to pose with the glass next to the 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.290
 mini than with this video with the first 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.300
 we grab a little bit with the one in the middle 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:08.740
 we grab another little 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.820
 and now we have two and with this one 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.820
 we just get up 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.040
 with my weight and we raise 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.440
 then they will be three now 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.440
 we simply lower it 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.250
 and with these two fingers we grabbed here in 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.670
 the middle we let go and there we have it 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.170
 with this 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.320
 we grabbed it and put it here and ready 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.320
 then a childhood 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:46.360
 a mallet two glasses three mallets 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.880
 we went down in the middle we grabbed it with the 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.070
 with the middle one and with the thumb 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.520
 the middle finger and with the thumb 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:58.800
 we grabbed the middle mallet 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.800
 and we put it 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.570
 at the beginning of the couples and I want 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.570
 demonstrate one more time 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.180
 and ready and have it 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.710
 and the good thing about this is that if they want 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.900
 do a trick I do not know if you love him 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.990
 guess the letter to someone and you put it 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.300
 up if you realize the deck this 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.910
 deck to stay up will never change 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.910
 position and I think it's going to change 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.210
 position is the last of the last 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.340
 you will be sobering with the one in the middle, it's almost you 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.620
 letter then it's a good effect for 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.620
 do then is to say if I'm going to mix 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.569
 so you can see that right in that here 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.780
 is your letter there is not something like that I do not know but 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:55.370
 no it is not is not the complete shuffle of 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.950
 dynamo only half and if that's that is 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.610
 all 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:06.330
 the author is easy to seduce his 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.330
 clients I like and comment chau
