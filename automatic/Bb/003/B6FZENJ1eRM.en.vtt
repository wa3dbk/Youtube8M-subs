you the max in the minimum and that's

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.280 
you the max in the minimum and that's
about<00:03:32.320> it<00:03:32.470> so<00:03:33.010> that's<00:03:33.250> our<00:03:33.459> new<00:03:33.730> product<00:03:34.299> from

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
about it so that's our new product from

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.789 
about it so that's our new product from
here<00:03:35.590> on<00:03:35.739> out<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:37.019> one<00:03:38.019> of<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.200> reasons<00:03:38.590> I

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
here on out and one of the reasons I

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.330 
here on out and one of the reasons I
wanted<00:03:38.980> it<00:03:39.280> to<00:03:39.459> be<00:03:39.640> painted<00:03:40.030> red<00:03:41.070> red<00:03:42.070> like

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
wanted it to be painted red red like

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.160 
wanted it to be painted red red like
this<00:03:42.780> is<00:03:43.780> because<00:03:45.269> nobody<00:03:46.269> else<00:03:46.450> has<00:03:46.720> got<00:03:46.959> that

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
this is because nobody else has got that

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.349 
this is because nobody else has got that
color<00:03:47.519> so<00:03:49.200> if<00:03:50.200> you<00:03:50.920> do<00:03:51.160> see<00:03:51.459> a<00:03:51.489> picture<00:03:51.819> of<00:03:52.000> this

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
color so if you do see a picture of this

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.920 
color so if you do see a picture of this
