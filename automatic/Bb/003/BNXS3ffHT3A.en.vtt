we're<00:00:15.259> going<00:00:15.410> to<00:00:15.469> look<00:00:15.590> at<00:00:15.710> a<00:00:15.880> pressing<00:00:16.880> motion

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
we're going to look at a pressing motion

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.720 
we're going to look at a pressing motion
with<00:00:18.290> a<00:00:18.320> little<00:00:18.590> bit<00:00:18.680> of<00:00:18.770> rotation<00:00:18.920> add<00:00:19.460> it<00:00:19.609> in

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
with a little bit of rotation add it in

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.820 
with a little bit of rotation add it in
and<00:00:20.060> the<00:00:20.750> first<00:00:21.050> variation<00:00:21.440> I'm<00:00:21.650> going<00:00:21.770> to

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
and the first variation I'm going to

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.019 
and the first variation I'm going to
show<00:00:21.949> will<00:00:22.070> be<00:00:22.160> more<00:00:22.310> of<00:00:22.369> a<00:00:22.430> slow<00:00:22.730> controlled

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.230 
show will be more of a slow controlled
variation<00:00:23.900> that<00:00:24.410> works<00:00:24.619> on<00:00:25.210> finding<00:00:26.210> that

start<00:00:47.360> with<00:00:47.450> a<00:00:47.510> lower<00:00:47.719> load<00:00:48.460> probably

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
start with a lower load probably

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.010 
start with a lower load probably
initially<00:00:49.879> you'll<00:00:50.030> start<00:00:50.300> just<00:00:50.539> with<00:00:50.690> a<00:00:50.719> bar

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
initially you'll start just with a bar

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.229 
initially you'll start just with a bar
with<00:00:51.379> your<00:00:51.590> clients<00:00:52.010> but<00:00:52.850> make<00:00:53.000> sure<00:00:53.030> that

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
with your clients but make sure that

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:54.790 
with your clients but make sure that
they<00:00:53.390> understand<00:00:53.840> how<00:00:54.020> to<00:00:54.079> move<00:00:54.260> proper<00:00:54.710> they

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
they understand how to move proper they

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.100 
they understand how to move proper they
can<00:00:54.980> move<00:00:55.129> safely<00:00:55.510> this<00:00:56.510> is<00:00:56.570> a<00:00:56.629> motion<00:00:56.989> where

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
can move safely this is a motion where

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.350 
can move safely this is a motion where
if<00:00:57.230> you<00:00:57.350> move<00:00:57.530> quickly<00:00:57.910> fast<00:00:58.910> for<00:00:59.210> those

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
if you move quickly fast for those

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.110 
if you move quickly fast for those
control<00:00:59.750> they<00:00:59.930> could<00:01:00.079> get<00:01:00.199> injured<00:01:00.379> so<00:01:01.120> I'm

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
control they could get injured so I'm

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.880 
control they could get injured so I'm
not<00:01:02.239> going<00:01:02.420> to<00:01:02.480> show<00:01:02.690> extreme<00:01:03.440> motion

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
not going to show extreme motion

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.550 
not going to show extreme motion
necessarily<00:01:04.399> but<00:01:04.759> I<00:01:04.820> want<00:01:05.030> to<00:01:05.119> show<00:01:05.560> different

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
necessarily but I want to show different

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.460 
necessarily but I want to show different
ways<00:01:06.800> in<00:01:07.130> terms<00:01:07.190> of<00:01:07.549> speed<00:01:07.880> that<00:01:08.869> you<00:01:09.080> can<00:01:09.260> use

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
ways in terms of speed that you can use

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.370 
ways in terms of speed that you can use
to<00:01:10.130> use<00:01:10.310> it's<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.549> application<00:01:11.150> so<00:01:11.390> great<00:01:12.260> way

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
to use it's the application so great way

00:01:12.380 --> 00:02:07.600 
to use it's the application so great way
to<00:01:12.409> build<00:01:12.560> some<00:01:12.710> stability<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:13.700> strength

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.520 

so<00:02:08.119> that'll<00:02:08.330> give<00:02:08.450> you<00:02:08.540> a<00:02:08.600> couple<00:02:08.840> ways<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.110> use

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
so that'll give you a couple ways to use

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.950 
so that'll give you a couple ways to use
this<00:02:09.710> I<00:02:10.060> think<00:02:11.060> you'll<00:02:11.180> find<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.540> handlebars

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
this I think you'll find the handlebars

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.040 
this I think you'll find the handlebars
really<00:02:12.260> nice<00:02:12.440> way<00:02:12.710> is<00:02:13.280> in<00:02:13.430> both<00:02:13.580> hands<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:14.870> kind

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
really nice way is in both hands to kind

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.340 
really nice way is in both hands to kind
of<00:02:15.110> gain<00:02:15.320> comfort<00:02:15.710> level<00:02:16.160> using<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.550> landmine

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
of gain comfort level using the landmine

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.410 
of gain comfort level using the landmine
clients<00:02:18.350> can<00:02:18.500> work<00:02:18.770> on<00:02:18.980> subtle<00:02:19.430> motion<00:02:19.610> even

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
clients can work on subtle motion even

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.270 
clients can work on subtle motion even
if<00:02:20.480> they<00:02:20.630> can't<00:02:20.810> fully<00:02:21.050> lock<00:02:21.320> out<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:22.130> can

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
if they can't fully lock out you can

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.310 
if they can't fully lock out you can
work<00:02:22.400> on<00:02:22.550> a<00:02:22.580> modified<00:02:22.880> motion<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.630> way<00:02:23.810> and

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
work on a modified motion that way and

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.380 
work on a modified motion that way and
then<00:02:24.500> I'll<00:02:25.310> usually<00:02:25.520> do<00:02:25.730> five<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.210> eight

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
then I'll usually do five to eight

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.840 
then I'll usually do five to eight
repetitions<00:02:26.690> each<00:02:27.320> side<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:28.430> work<00:02:28.610> on

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
repetitions each side and work on

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.660 
repetitions each side and work on
increasing<00:02:29.840> that<00:02:30.140> load<00:02:30.470> gradually<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.550> for

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
increasing that load gradually and for

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.580 
increasing that load gradually and for
mentally<00:02:31.940> when<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:32.900> feel<00:02:33.080> they're<00:02:33.230> ready<00:02:33.440> if

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
mentally when you feel they're ready if

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.800 
mentally when you feel they're ready if
it's<00:02:33.770> applicable<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.040> work<00:02:34.790> more<00:02:35.000> explosive

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
it's applicable to work more explosive

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.600 
it's applicable to work more explosive
you've<00:02:36.560> got<00:02:36.710> an<00:02:36.800> athlete<00:02:37.160> or<00:02:37.280> somebody

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
you've got an athlete or somebody

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.700 
you've got an athlete or somebody
training<00:02:37.970> for<00:02:38.150> power<00:02:38.540> it's<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.290> great<00:02:39.560> way<00:02:39.680> to

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
training for power it's a great way to

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.740 
training for power it's a great way to
do<00:02:39.860> that<00:02:40.010> as<00:02:40.130> well<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:41.000> then<00:02:41.180> moving<00:02:41.390> down<00:02:41.510> the

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
do that as well and then moving down the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.360 
do that as well and then moving down the
