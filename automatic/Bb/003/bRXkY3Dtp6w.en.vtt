00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.769
 Hello, still a little reviewer 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.089
 such 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:19.670
 means feather protection two such 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.930
 naborchik there they are very poorly distinguishable 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:28.950
 since very little did not expect 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:34.980
 anyone consider this 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:39.030
 here are such things here are 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.970
 so they dress on feather bed 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.970
 has cut into 4 pieces 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:58.920
 and now we will try and want on our 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.920
 vendetta like 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:09.640
 comes tight enough 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:12.960
 here on tightly tight enough wring 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.090
 such a thing turned into us 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:21.420
 plumage protection 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:23.759
 that is, it seems like we are not afraid 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.330
 hit 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.330
 other darts 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.600
 then these three things took on 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.280
 sample 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.530
 It means a little bit of a different form, that is, in 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.300
 this form 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:47.700
 conical such a thing 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:47.700
 conic taken out strutto 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.700
 has passed 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:02.110
 it will become her steel 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:18.220
 another form a little bit 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:20.840
 she has a burr on the end to 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.290
 maybe here on his take out you now 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:30.560
 look how comfortable it is 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:37.120
 such three things I have here a burr 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:44.800
 this will put them here separately and such 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:51.760
 nail burr puts on 4 slots too 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.760
 this whole thing is plumage 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:03:03.220
 tight enough here worn keeps 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:09.790
 form and such 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:12.730
 wants to be removed at the ends due to 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.060
 This is something easier than a protrusion 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.230
 a little bit 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.840
 doing a little easier 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:25.960
 It means it is increased in the form now I tell you this 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:32.730
 all show well in the grief of personal video 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:38.610
 See these things on the ad 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:41.600
 small enough children if i take 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:46.190
 now ticker 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:51.750
 appreciate their skin they are sized 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:54.050
 eat that is they actually and how much 7 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:04:00.000
 millimeters 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:04.940
 then it's a form of protection in the tail 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.710
 Here is such a protrusion for his nail 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.990
 convenient to cling and let's remove 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:14.990
 pacification well let's say let's get it 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.990
 will dress 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:30.900
 change how he 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:34.700
 walks fairly dense until the end 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.910
 I won't push him well enough 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.910
 and then 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.720
 children have such protection 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:56.980
 Yes, I picked up a nail, it means 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:59.020
 next next thing is also protection on 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.860
 Perine such see this has 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.860
 conical shape 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.340
 function also try and fasten 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.470
 that's all kind of like your 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:31.070
 denser does not want to capture 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.210
 but 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:41.499
 know and not really want 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:06:00.480
 Here is such a thing 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:05.580
 here compare these two for protection 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:10.440
 the wind is different as well and protection which 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:12.090
 walked along with the unicorn darts black 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.270
 star that is she 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:18.270
 see what form it has not 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:21.090
 cut into four pieces cut 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:24.330
 only 2 has such a bit 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:27.720
 the conical form of two sides 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:31.770
 that is, she clings to this 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:34.850
 diagonally so here he 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:39.180
 send goes here and the second goes 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:43.080
 the opposite part and more comfortable to wear 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.030
 this protection when the plumage is still complex and 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:49.290
 then here 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:52.710
 here you take this protection here 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:57.110
 center time the plumage straightened and 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:59.540
 word and so here are three different kinds 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:04.790
 showed 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.790
 rate what you like best 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:13.830
 here it is with a ledge in order to nail 

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:23.820
 well extract it turns out so 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:25.740
 how conical at the end is this protection 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:31.490
 on plumage from unicorn 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:31.490
 she, too, well enough removed 

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.790
 here you are 

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:41.469
 like if you liked this video and 

00:07:38.619 --> 00:07:44.709
