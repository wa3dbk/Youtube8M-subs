 weather effects 

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:40.610
 Rotterdam insured 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.170
 added together 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.170
 it becomes easier 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.960
 lots of photos 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.890
 we go 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.890
 thus suffered more than 4 percent in the third quarter 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.780
 about half of it back to we cover 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.280
 there was some fighting back killed by the army and horses 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.380
 dozens of customers 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.380
 proceed carefully 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.700
 such equipment control also applies here also that I know 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.040

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.320
 that irritates under pressure 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.310
 hats off for the inconvenience 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.310

 the security of the debate 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.700
 but at the same time their motto is part of that, of course it is about it 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.960
 speculate about going on a bit quietly 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.960
 Mayor Marc Caprasse 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.020

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.189
 we have made it easier on 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.529
 we expected it to be bigger 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:25.579

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:36.029
 to save 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:38.939
