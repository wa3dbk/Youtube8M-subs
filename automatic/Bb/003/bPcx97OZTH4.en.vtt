started mixing me the finishing coat
first<00:01:43.180> thing<00:01:43.510> then<00:01:44.439> that<00:01:44.470> way<00:01:44.860> that'll<00:01:45.159> dry

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
first thing then that way that'll dry

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.480 
first thing then that way that'll dry
even<00:01:45.670> quicker<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:47.350> I've<00:01:47.770> just<00:01:47.830> left<00:01:48.100> that<00:01:48.280> and

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
even quicker so I've just left that and

even quicker so I've just left that and
clean<00:01:48.760> waters<00:01:49.090> leave<00:01:49.360> up<00:01:49.570> for<00:01:50.470> about<00:01:50.619> two

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
clean waters leave up for about two

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.800 
clean waters leave up for about two
hours<00:01:50.890> and<00:01:51.430> I'm<00:01:51.670> gonna<00:01:51.820> do<00:01:52.060> come<00:01:52.270> to<00:01:52.420> skim<00:01:52.689> it

hours and I'm gonna do come to skim it

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.469 
hours and I'm gonna do come to skim it
it'll<00:01:53.619> make<00:01:53.770> that<00:01:54.400> even<00:01:54.670> quicker<00:01:54.970> slapping

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
it'll make that even quicker slapping

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:56.609 
it'll make that even quicker slapping
