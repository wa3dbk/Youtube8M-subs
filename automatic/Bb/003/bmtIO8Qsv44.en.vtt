2013 458 as opposed to the 12 450 the
airport<00:00:37.120> it's<00:00:38.120> springless<00:00:38.680> and<00:00:40.570> super

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
airport it's springless and super

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.960 
airport it's springless and super
adjustable<00:00:42.080> so<00:00:42.380> you<00:00:42.620> can<00:00:43.370> adjust<00:00:43.460> it<00:00:43.760> on<00:00:43.880> the

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
adjustable so you can adjust it on the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.390 
adjustable so you can adjust it on the
fly<00:00:44.150> it's<00:00:44.900> like<00:00:45.370> revolving<00:00:46.370> your<00:00:46.790> forks<00:00:48.400> re

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
fly it's like revolving your forks re

fly it's like revolving your forks re
springing<00:00:49.850> your<00:00:50.000> Forks<00:00:50.270> I<00:00:50.360> should<00:00:50.540> say<00:00:50.750> yeah

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
springing your Forks I should say yeah

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.380 
springing your Forks I should say yeah
after<00:00:51.980> moto<00:00:52.250> one<00:00:52.520> if<00:00:52.670> you<00:00:52.760> feel<00:00:52.970> like<00:00:53.000> it<00:00:53.150> needs

after moto one if you feel like it needs

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.510 
after moto one if you feel like it needs
a<00:00:53.570> change<00:00:53.960> then<00:00:54.320> you<00:00:54.680> can<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:55.160> can<00:00:55.280> do<00:00:55.370> it<00:00:55.460> on

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
a change then you can you can do it on

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.670 
a change then you can you can do it on
the<00:00:55.610> fly<00:00:55.730> which<00:00:56.030> is<00:00:56.180> a<00:00:56.210> i<00:00:56.629> think<00:00:57.140> a<00:00:57.410> huge

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
the fly which is a i think a huge

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.060 
the fly which is a i think a huge
benefit<00:00:58.100> over<00:00:58.989> conventional<00:00:59.989> Forks<00:01:00.290> so<00:01:00.739> out

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
benefit over conventional Forks so out

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.340 
benefit over conventional Forks so out
on<00:01:01.220> the<00:01:01.309> track<00:01:01.580> I<00:01:02.120> actually<00:01:02.660> was<00:01:02.960> really

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
on the track I actually was really

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.650 
on the track I actually was really
comfortable<00:01:03.680> I'm<00:01:03.860> a<00:01:04.309> Kawasaki<00:01:04.730> rider<00:01:04.850> already

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
comfortable I'm a Kawasaki rider already

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.710 
comfortable I'm a Kawasaki rider already

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
so I'm used to the 2012 model and then I

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.030 
so I'm used to the 2012 model and then I
was<00:01:08.840> comfortable<00:01:09.230> immediately<00:01:09.710> get<00:01:09.830> on<00:01:09.920> the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
was comfortable immediately get on the

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.470 
was comfortable immediately get on the
bike<00:01:10.159> with<00:01:10.370> the<00:01:10.430> whole<00:01:10.550> chassis<00:01:10.730> setup<00:01:11.090> and

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
bike with the whole chassis setup and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.510 
bike with the whole chassis setup and
then<00:01:12.080> again<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:12.710> just<00:01:12.740> affirms<00:01:13.220> that<00:01:13.370> the

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
then again it just affirms that the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.310 
then again it just affirms that the
reason<00:01:14.000> I<00:01:14.060> got<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.480> Kawasaki<00:01:14.870> in<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.110> first

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
reason I got the Kawasaki in the first

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.470 
reason I got the Kawasaki in the first
place<00:01:15.440> it's<00:01:15.710> such<00:01:16.040> an<00:01:16.220> easy<00:01:16.460> bike<00:01:16.760> to<00:01:16.970> ride<00:01:17.120> and

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
place it's such an easy bike to ride and

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.200 
place it's such an easy bike to ride and
and<00:01:18.260> the<00:01:18.680> to<00:01:19.159> me<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.490> biggest<00:01:19.760> thing<00:01:20.060> about

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
and the to me the biggest thing about

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.010 
and the to me the biggest thing about
the<00:01:20.330> Kawasaki<00:01:20.900> is<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.110> adjustability<00:01:21.590> of<00:01:21.800> the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
the Kawasaki is the adjustability of the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.140 
the Kawasaki is the adjustability of the
handlebar<00:01:24.020> positioning<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:25.150> prototype

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
handlebar positioning the prototype

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.070 
handlebar positioning the prototype
positioning<00:01:26.690> and<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.610> ability<00:01:28.610> to<00:01:28.930> to<00:01:29.930> make

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
positioning and the ability to to make

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.859 
positioning and the ability to to make
the<00:01:30.320> bike<00:01:30.530> customizable<00:01:31.460> to<00:01:31.580> you<00:01:31.790> is<00:01:32.060> this<00:01:32.360> to

the bike customizable to you is this to

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.209 
the bike customizable to you is this to
me<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:32.990> huge<00:01:33.200> advantage<00:01:33.320> I<00:01:33.740> was<00:01:33.890> really

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
me a huge advantage I was really

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:35.319 
me a huge advantage I was really
comfortable<00:01:34.520> on<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.729> track<00:01:34.939> with<00:01:35.090> it<00:01:35.180> right

there<00:01:55.130> they're<00:01:55.570> really<00:01:56.570> really<00:01:56.899> good<00:01:57.049> motors

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
there they're really really good motors

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.889 
there they're really really good motors
there's<00:01:57.680> such<00:01:57.829> a<00:01:57.859> good<00:01:58.159> range<00:01:58.460> of<00:01:58.789> power<00:01:59.060> all

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
there's such a good range of power all

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
another thing is the Kawasaki changed

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.040 
another thing is the Kawasaki changed
the<00:02:28.220> rotor<00:02:28.670> on<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:28.940> bike<00:02:29.120> at<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.570> rear<00:02:29.840> rotor

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
the rotor on the bike at the rear rotor

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.850 
the rotor on the bike at the rear rotor
and

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
and

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.700 
and
I<00:02:30.920> mean<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:31.610> braking<00:02:31.970> is<00:02:32.200> as<00:02:33.200> good<00:02:33.440> as<00:02:33.590> you

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
I mean the braking is as good as you

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.470 
I mean the braking is as good as you
could<00:02:33.830> ask<00:02:33.980> for<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.340> i<00:02:34.370> mean<00:02:34.490> this<00:02:35.060> bike<00:02:35.270> will

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
could ask for it i mean this bike will

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.770 
could ask for it i mean this bike will
