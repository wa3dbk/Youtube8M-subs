00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
signs and then there's one space in the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.750 
signs and then there's one space in the

to make that a little bit easier you can

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.609 
to make that a little bit easier you can
just<00:01:51.509> kind<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.689> expand<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.200> out<00:01:52.290> with<00:01:52.439> more

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
whatever you want start by placing

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.920 
whatever you want start by placing
stairs<00:02:14.980> like<00:02:15.280> this<00:02:15.340> on<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.300> top<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.720> bottom

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
stairs like this on the top and bottom

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.110 
stairs like this on the top and bottom
and<00:02:17.890> then<00:02:18.069> make<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.280> go<00:02:18.430> all<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.910> way<00:02:18.940> around

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
and then make you go all the way around

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.730 
and then make you go all the way around
like<00:02:19.600> that<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.020> same<00:02:20.950> with<00:02:21.130> these<00:02:21.250> stairs<00:02:21.670> and

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
like that and same with these stairs and

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.310 
like that and same with these stairs and
with<00:02:23.740> these<00:02:23.920> stairs<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.870> right<00:02:25.870> here<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.260> can

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
with these stairs and right here you can

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.440 
with these stairs and right here you can
just<00:02:26.530> kind<00:02:26.680> of<00:02:26.740> leave<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:27.040> open<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.790> I'd

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
just kind of leave that open and I'd

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.360 
just kind of leave that open and I'd
recommend<00:02:28.660> leaving<00:02:29.020> that<00:02:29.230> open<00:02:29.290> too<00:02:29.740> and<00:02:30.250> then

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
recommend leaving that open too and then

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.790 
recommend leaving that open too and then
go<00:02:30.459> ahead<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:30.610> place<00:02:30.730> stone<00:02:31.120> brick<00:02:31.800> wherever

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
go ahead and place stone brick wherever

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.699 
go ahead and place stone brick wherever
you<00:02:33.040> can<00:02:33.160> see<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:34.570> stone<00:02:35.020> like<00:02:35.680> this<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.470> just

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
you can see the stone like this so just

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.360 
you can see the stone like this so just
in<00:02:38.890> all<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.190> walls<00:02:39.430> in<00:02:39.790> this<00:02:39.970> instance<00:02:41.370> not

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
in all the walls in this instance not

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.590 
in all the walls in this instance not
sure<00:02:42.610> how<00:02:42.790> I'm<00:02:42.910> doing<00:02:43.270> this<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:44.940> on<00:02:45.940> the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
sure how I'm doing this and on the

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.009 
sure how I'm doing this and on the
ceiling<00:02:47.050> we<00:02:47.260> will<00:02:47.410> leave<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:49.120> future

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
ceiling we will leave that to a future

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.680 
ceiling we will leave that to a future
job<00:02:50.410> in<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.650> moment<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.190> so<00:02:51.700> on<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:51.970> corners<00:02:52.390> go

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
job in a moment and so on the corners go

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.750 
job in a moment and so on the corners go
ahead<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:52.900> do<00:02:52.959> your<00:02:53.050> oak<00:02:53.290> logs<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:54.459> that<00:02:54.610> they

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
ahead and do your oak logs so that they

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.460 
ahead and do your oak logs so that they
kind<00:02:55.030> of<00:02:55.180> feel<00:02:55.510> like<00:02:55.540> they<00:02:55.810> flow<00:02:56.140> with<00:02:56.350> the

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
kind of feel like they flow with the

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.720 
kind of feel like they flow with the
whole<00:02:56.620> design<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.340> give<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.390> structure<00:02:58.720> some

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
whole design and give the structure some

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.130 
whole design and give the structure some
support<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:01.030> it<00:03:01.150> doesn't<00:03:01.420> collapse<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:02.019> on

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
support so it doesn't collapse it on

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.100 
support so it doesn't collapse it on
itself<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.860> kill<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.459> user<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:04.110> wouldn't

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
itself and kill the user I wouldn't

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.690 
itself and kill the user I wouldn't
really<00:03:05.200> happen<00:03:05.650> this<00:03:05.739> isn't<00:03:06.070> that<00:03:06.190> realistic

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
really happen this isn't that realistic

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.729 
really happen this isn't that realistic
and<00:03:06.910> on<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.840> ground<00:03:08.110> you<00:03:08.410> could<00:03:08.530> do<00:03:08.709> a

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
and on the ground you could do a

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.770 
and on the ground you could do a
whatever<00:03:09.550> kind<00:03:09.820> of<00:03:09.880> flooring<00:03:10.269> I<00:03:10.390> guess<00:03:10.570> I'm

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
whatever kind of flooring I guess I'm

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.920 
whatever kind of flooring I guess I'm
gonna<00:03:10.989> go<00:03:11.200> with<00:03:12.239> let's<00:03:13.239> actually<00:03:13.420> do<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:13.660> wood

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
in here you can go with the stone brick

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.319 
in here you can go with the stone brick
floor<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:23.110> could<00:03:23.200> do<00:03:23.320> like<00:03:23.440> a<00:03:24.030> could<00:03:25.030> do<00:03:25.180> like

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
that and then make it where the

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.130 
that and then make it where the
jack-o'-lanterns<00:04:09.940> are<00:04:10.090> sideways<00:04:10.630> and<00:04:11.019> then

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
jack-o'-lanterns are sideways and then

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.380 
jack-o'-lanterns are sideways and then
go<00:04:11.320> and<00:04:11.470> just<00:04:11.620> place<00:04:11.799> your<00:04:12.010> blocks<00:04:12.370> back<00:04:12.670> and

go and just place your blocks back and

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.059 
go and just place your blocks back and
then<00:04:13.480> add<00:04:13.630> your<00:04:13.660> leaves<00:04:13.989> gives<00:04:14.739> kind<00:04:14.920> of<00:04:14.980> a

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
then add your leaves gives kind of a

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.009 
then add your leaves gives kind of a
covered<00:04:15.400> light<00:04:15.610> source<00:04:15.910> and<00:04:16.570> it<00:04:16.660> gives<00:04:16.840> off<00:04:16.989> a

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
covered light source and it gives off a

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.270 
covered light source and it gives off a
decent<00:04:17.440> amount<00:04:17.500> of<00:04:17.620> light<00:04:17.799> so<00:04:17.950> I<00:04:18.039> just<00:04:18.160> go

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
decent amount of light so I just go

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.129 
decent amount of light so I just go
