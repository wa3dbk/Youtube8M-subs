I put a good shot in him but just so
here's<00:06:53.680> what<00:06:53.830> I'm<00:06:53.950> thinking<00:06:54.280> heat<00:06:54.490> I<00:06:54.670> know<00:06:54.820> he

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
here's what I'm thinking heat I know he

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.330 
here's what I'm thinking heat I know he
has<00:06:55.240> like<00:06:55.450> a<00:06:55.480> three<00:06:56.020> shot<00:06:56.410> clip<00:06:56.830> and<00:06:57.070> he's

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
has like a three shot clip and he's

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.180 
has like a three shot clip and he's
reloading<00:06:58.170> and<00:06:59.170> i<00:06:59.560> know<00:06:59.710> theres<00:06:59.950> a<00:07:00.040> river

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190

reloading and i know theres a river
right<00:07:00.490> here<00:07:00.520> so<00:07:01.360> what<00:07:01.750> I'm<00:07:01.900> thinking<00:07:01.930> is<00:07:02.590> if<00:07:03.160> I

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:03.370 
right here so what I'm thinking is if I

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.660 
right here so what I'm thinking is if I
can<00:07:03.610> get<00:07:03.790> him<00:07:03.940> to<00:07:04.360> go<00:07:04.570> over<00:07:05.080> the<00:07:05.650> cliff<00:07:05.860> then

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:06.670 
can get him to go over the cliff then

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.850 
can get him to go over the cliff then
he'll<00:07:06.910> be<00:07:06.940> like<00:07:07.120> stuck<00:07:07.870> there<00:07:08.110> the<00:07:08.500> rest<00:07:08.710> of

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:08.860 
he'll be like stuck there the rest of

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.430 
he'll be like stuck there the rest of
the<00:07:08.950> game<00:07:09.130> so<00:07:10.090> I<00:07:10.120> awkwardly<00:07:10.630> put<00:07:10.930> myself<00:07:11.140> here

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 
the game so I awkwardly put myself here

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.060 
the game so I awkwardly put myself here
now<00:07:12.430> he<00:07:12.490> sees<00:07:13.390> he's<00:07:13.990> trying<00:07:14.350> to<00:07:14.560> shoot<00:07:14.740> me<00:07:14.920> he

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.070 
now he sees he's trying to shoot me he

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.300
