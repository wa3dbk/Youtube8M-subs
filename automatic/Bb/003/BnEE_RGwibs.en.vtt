bit more strength of voo-doom and stress

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.860 
bit more strength of voo-doom and stress
ball<00:01:32.610> Yuman<00:01:32.880> strength<00:01:33.270> exactly<00:01:33.690> so<00:01:33.780> what

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
ball Yuman strength exactly so what

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:40.460 
ball Yuman strength exactly so what
makes<00:01:34.110> everything<00:01:34.409> mix<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.040> together<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:40.350> you

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
sort of an elect is we can actually go

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.400 
sort of an elect is we can actually go
in<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.200> get<00:02:24.100> in<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.660> little<00:02:25.660> bit<00:02:25.900> more<00:02:26.080> a
