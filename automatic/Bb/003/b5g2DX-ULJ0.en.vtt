00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
now this is kind of kind of complicated

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.459 
now this is kind of kind of complicated
but<00:01:29.090> also<00:01:29.270> quite<00:01:29.570> simple<00:01:29.990> if<00:01:30.079> you<00:01:30.170> think<00:01:30.380> about

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
but also quite simple if you think about

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.249 
but also quite simple if you think about
