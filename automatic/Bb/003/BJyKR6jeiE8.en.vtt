00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.460
 hello very good to all how is 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.040
 everything is perfect I'm from catv mv and 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.140
 here I bring you one more part of this 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.080
 wonderful guide of the sea ego of the super 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.240
 heroes nothing less than to get one of 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.890
 the characters that we already have visible 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.460
 in the frame and it's about the mini 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.100
 Sentinel nothing less is as easy as 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.300
 give a bottle to a good child before 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.430
 say that all these 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.430
 I'm going to do all these missions 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.840
 clearly but blocks are needed 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.720
 golden I will block you actions in the 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.800
 map of the characters and thus get 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.739
 a little bit what is the 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.980
 the golden blocks and be able to do all 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.700
 those side missions those phases 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.960
 new ones that we have in free mode 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.390
 Well, the sentry is already marked 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:16.869
 It's there in the plaza down there and let's go 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:18.940
 to fly for we have two activated and 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.350
 we go down there and I said it was so 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.850
 easy as giving a bottle to a child is 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.280
 who does not 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.770
 until it would have been you 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.030
 taking the bottle 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.670
 yes man yes even if enough of one 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.230
 have consciousness here we come to the 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.360
 placita 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.640
 we can always defeat them in the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.940
 Sometimes we wish we once 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.440
 got clear we can follow 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.440
 bursting and here comes 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.439
 the director note 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.670
 if we do not go important I have a 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.840
 armor 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.810
 well then we give to my god now 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.600
 here we are going to demonstrate the attacks 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.000
 making a pisotÃ³n I think it has made me 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.430
 squats has not made me spit we have 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.660
 that freeze that golden plate there 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.790
 there but good I'll see a bit with the 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.660
 tell what a villain of the x-men is 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.180
 in fact now later on now when 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.880
 finish with him then count a little 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.390
 porter a little bit of that waste 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:37.740
 and we have defeated the part of we have 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:43.470
 removed the golden part and it is 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:45.810
 hitting I have the transfer hammer 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.340
 in the back and loading of coins 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.150
 let's welcome them 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.150
 for me 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:01.390
 it's finished we've defeated the robot 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.650
 and where is the robot 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.650
 because they name the robot 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.030
 not like it but we have it here 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.730
 it would have been a failure of mine 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.620
 well it's already bought and here we have it 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.530
 to tell you a little about him 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.680
 these sentinels or a fictional robot the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.330
 marvel comic universe more frequently 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.940
 associated with the team of mutants 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.430
 known as the x-men were created 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.020
 by the writer stanley and of course 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.750
 the artist 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.730
 the writer jack kirby and his first 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.750
 appearances on x-men was at number 14 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:41.280
 in the no in November 1965 they were 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.050
 invented by doctor bolÃ­var tracks 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.330
 the interns are perhaps the worst 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.120
 enemies of the x-men of all the rest 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.850
 mutants are programmed to capture 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.850
 and kill mutants these sentinels have 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.319
 appeared over several years 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.140
 built by certain private groups 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.569
 and paramilitaries but the typical sentinel 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.730
 is the three meters high has the 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.620
 ability to fly lightning bolts 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.560
 energy and able to detect mutants 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.360
 but in the case of the ego it does not fly and 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.310
 before ending with such that one of 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.950
 the famous appearances of these 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.540
 sentinels was in days of the future past 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.610
