00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.420
 hey ho and welcome to another 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:14.190
 info video it my chair complains hey ho 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.740
 and welcome to another info 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.210
 video the last one is something 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.160
 and therefore we have not now time for 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.869
 important to make a new one 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.980
 because now again a few topics 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.269
 have emerged 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.519
 yes we make known to the general mass 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.030
 want and in this case we catch 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.710
 just with the first topic 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.210
 an important topic is the project 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.710
 emerald what we do with minecraft 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.690
 budget 5 and one more person 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.579
 do 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.469
 There was often the question lately 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.300
 wander again new videos come 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.550
 or even the status of this 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.800
 adventure map is here we have to first 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.829
 say that we of us first no 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.940
 they will do videos because they are like that 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.579
 a little bit reliant on that for 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.739
 get material from minecraft pb5 and 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.480
 unfortunately we have not got much time right now 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.910
 to give us material 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.379
 so of course we will become something 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.970
 if something comes back but 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.420
 as long as nothing comes it is with us 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.990
 first on break and should there also the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.570
 info be that first time of it no new 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.860
 material is published then want 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.390
 we still announce what a project 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.409
 where we have been for several months 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.390
 participate 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.159
 this is about the stranded project 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.189
 there the koran and i have now 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.400
 that's what we decided to do so far 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.750
 quit and get out has 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.570
 another reason that we have such a 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.460
 have noticed a bit that the calls 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.210
 pay and interest in these 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.470
 Stranded videos were not that high 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.630
 as we expect over the period 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.950
 Of course, it's clear that it's over 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.509
 a longer period always something 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.670
 offside and the interest wears off and 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.619
 we have now decided that 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.780
 this time actually came 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.399
 so that was a good thing 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.149
 to have been there also with 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.570
 but others should now first 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.820
 take distance and get back on your own 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.590
 projects a bit more on ours 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.619
 to focus on servers because there have 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.840
 We also noticed that videos too 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.000
 it's totally the making-of or now 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.150
 any tours a bit too short 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.629
 have come and it will certainly 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.670
 again videos with a few of the people 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.739
 from the gamestar network where we give 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.890
 play with the mini games or other 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.650
 Things just do that to the extent that 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.390
 Project but in the past 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.790
 also arrived well and what we on 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.560
 want to definitely be back are the 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.049
 so-called adventure maps us one 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.690
 can send ahead and I will do that 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:45.290
 can deny in the team and you 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.590
 you then send us your maps 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.180
 can 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.349
 that is to but now no calling 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.760
 be that you do what we are there 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.299
 Definitely a separate video 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.060
 close 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.900
 but that's what we're fond of 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.340
 Completed things you once 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.909
 can record in a session or 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.290
 also has two and by and large 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.609
 We used to have a lot of fun in the past as well 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.129
 and that should be done again 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.659
 I would like to come back last time 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.090
 a little hint regarding ours 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.590
 blogs or last minecraft de give 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.629
 Since then we have decided the 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.680
 slightly more minimalist side 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.660
 shape and a bit 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.739
 restructuring and that will be 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.319
 take a little longer 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.230
 but that again as a hint that 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.060
 there will be a bit of construction work 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.349
 that was it again I wish 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.329
 have fun with others 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.329
 videos from us until next time 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.989
 b 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.989
