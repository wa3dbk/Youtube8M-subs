00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
stuck together because what makes them

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.770 
stuck together because what makes them
get<00:01:36.270> stuck<00:01:36.509> together<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.439> fluid<00:01:37.680> that

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
get stuck together is the fluid that

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.780 
get stuck together is the fluid that
helps<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.930> eggs<00:01:40.079> pass<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.400> female

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
helps the eggs pass out of the female

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.139 
helps the eggs pass out of the female
that<00:01:42.780> fluid<00:01:43.079> dries<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.799> hardens<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.670> it's

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
that fluid dries and hardens and it's

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.380 
that fluid dries and hardens and it's
almost<00:01:45.390> like<00:01:45.600> glue<00:01:45.899> okay<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.909> it<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.090> be<00:01:48.210> very

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
almost like glue okay and it can be very

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.560 
almost like glue okay and it can be very
difficult<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:50.070> separate<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:51.060> let<00:01:51.240> me<00:01:51.299> explain

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570

have to do it like say one of the egg is
bit<00:02:12.510> one<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.840> eggs<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.110> bad

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
bit one of the eggs is bad

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.619 
bit one of the eggs is bad
maybe<00:02:14.769> it's<00:02:14.950> molding<00:02:15.430> or<00:02:15.819> there's<00:02:15.999> something

basically<00:03:40.509> just<00:03:41.049> feather<00:03:41.349> the<00:03:41.590> tool<00:03:41.829> using

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
basically just feather the tool using

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.099 
basically just feather the tool using
its<00:03:42.400> using<00:03:42.939> gravity<00:03:43.359> using<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.780> weight<00:03:43.989> of

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
its using gravity using the weight of

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.409 
its using gravity using the weight of
the<00:03:44.169> tool<00:03:44.459> okay<00:03:45.459> and<00:03:45.669> I'm<00:03:45.729> just<00:03:45.939> basically

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
the tool okay and I'm just basically

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.210 
the tool okay and I'm just basically
kind<00:03:47.019> of<00:03:47.049> just<00:03:47.259> scoring<00:03:47.590> it<00:03:47.829> a<00:03:47.889> little<00:03:48.069> bit

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
kind of just scoring it a little bit

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.490 
kind of just scoring it a little bit
okay<00:03:48.669> and<00:03:48.939> what<00:03:49.389> that's<00:03:49.540> doing<00:03:49.780> is<00:03:50.079> it's

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
okay and what that's doing is it's

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.390 
okay and what that's doing is it's
working<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:51.009> water<00:03:51.870> into<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:52.900> crease<00:03:53.400> little

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
working the water into the crease little

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.379 
working the water into the crease little
by<00:03:54.879> little

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
by little
