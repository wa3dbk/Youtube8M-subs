00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.500
 very good to all people I am a machine and 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.900
 welcome to the first video the elder 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.180
 scrolls online and first of all clarify 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.830
 that the nba of the game is still valid 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.570
 In operation, you can not upload 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.699
 public platforms or videos nor 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.500
 images or comments on everything 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.970
 that you have seen inside the beta but 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.830
 What has been done is to give permission 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.480
 to the press so they can upload videos 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.999
 comments and their opinions on the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.679
 beta and so from the hand of me meo zone rps 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.720
 puntocom that if you do not know it is the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.360
 website in Spanish number one 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.370
 multiplayer games in mmd pg and like 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.960
 you'll also know I'm in charge of 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.730
 all the audiovisual content in this 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.590
 Well, I'll be able to bring you 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.030
 several videos about the aspects more 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.250
 important that I have been able to play in 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.149
 beta creation of first characters 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.789
 missions in a brief look at the section 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.629
 of crafting time let's see the 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.149
 personalization of the character 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.429
 good skills the whole system of 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.050
 weapons and armor skills and some 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.059
 little things more than I considered 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.920
 significant to let you know the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.140
 game and so you can see everything that is going to 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.820
 offer so nothing after this 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.620
 explanation somewhat boring but very 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.240
 important that I had to do let's 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.659
 start with the creation of characters from 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.790
 heroes 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.320
 on-line 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.420
 the first thing we find in the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.490
 creation of characters are these four 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.320
 eyelashes the eyelash of the race the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.630
 tab of the class the tab of the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.070
 body and the eyelash of the face with these 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.000
 four tabs let's create our 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.880
 unique character 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.530
 the first thing is to choose the race we are going to 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.440
 be able to choose between male and female 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.190
 and we have to know that there are nine 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.260
 races but they are grouped into three 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.150
 alliances three races for each of the 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.040
 alliances of three people in the first 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.950
 alliance the pact of dag the folk we have 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.540
 to the protons to the orcs and the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.430
 red guards in the domains of 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.650
 almería we have in the first place the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.350
 high elves second to elves 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.600
 of the forest and thirdly to the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.460
 gallitos 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.670
 and finally in the women's pact 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.090
 we have the Segovians in the first place 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.510
 dark elves 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.850
 and lastly the Nordic 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.220
 once our our alliance is chosen 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.720
 and our race we will go to the election 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.100
 of our class one of the most 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.050
 important characteristics of 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.850
 directors online is that we choose the 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.620
 class that we choose we will be able to equip 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.960
 our character with any weapon and 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.160
 with any type of armor this 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.930
 that gives us is the freedom of power 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.300
 choose the type of character we want 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.890
 and that although we choose the sorcerer class 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.870
 At first it has to be 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.550
 a kind of magician but we can equip 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.250
 with a two-handed ax and with armor 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.170
 heavy to create our magician let's say 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.720
 out of the ordinary the choice of our 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.340
 class gives us three branches of skills to 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.810
 our character however in the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.550
 right are lan there are a lot of 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.680
 skill branches by almost any 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.840
 thing what we are going to find is with 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.240
 a wide range of skills of all 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.560
 kind of way we can give him the role 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.360
 that we want to our to our 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.550
 character whatever the class that 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.320
 we have chosen at first what 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.520
 yes that is true is that in the election 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.709
 of the class we are going to have a 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.060
 description of each of them and with 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.790
 this description we will be able to understand 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.640
 we will be able to get clues about the 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.870
 role easier to obtain with that class 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.640
 for example the dragon knight is the 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.990
 master of weapons is the one who has 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.520
 battle spirit 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.530
 to select it, it appears with 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.900
 sword and shield and that already gives us 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.240
 understand that the role of tank is going to be very 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.340
 easy to get with the dragon class 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.930
 knight because his skills or some 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.280
 of your class skill branches going 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.410
 to enhance everything that is mitigation 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.330
 of damage and control of the characters 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.490
 the same happens with the rest of classes 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.290
 for example the sorcerer we can read that 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.890
 is the master of magic is going to be able 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.660
 even invoke demons behind his to 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.920
 his disposition so we are already given to 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.800
 understand that he is a kind of sorcerer of 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.630
 magician with the typical cane not and his 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.070
 cloth armor logically then this 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.780
 we will be able to change our best 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.450
 magician we put a two-handed sword 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.130
 and we put heavy armor on him 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.040
 plan a warrior to mel with spells 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.810
 magical invoking back out there from the 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.550
 night play tells us that he is the killer 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.570
 of the online les flors is the one that goes to 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.370
 use stealth skills the one that goes 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.530
 to play with the shadows to 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.390
 surprise your enemies to enter 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.700
 fast combat do great damage and get out 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.030
 from him as soon as possible so he does not stop 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.070
 not receive a lot of damage 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.900
 and finally the Templar is a kind 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.760
 warrior but more focused on magic 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.920
 as well as the dragon knight as it is more 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.310
 melee more than sword and shield 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.540
 the temper is a warrior also that 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.030
 we can focus it on the melee 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.830
 but that we will be able to have our 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.680
 disposition plus magic skills 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.330
 even healing skills 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.419
 well chosen from our class 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.830
 we go to the body tab that 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.330
 we are going to touch up all the parts of the 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.639
 body from the neck to the feet 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.970
 one by one and when giving it the form that 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.970
 we want 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.039
 and finally we have the tab of the 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:54.180
 face where we will be able to retouch all 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:58.050
 the face parts of our 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.330
 character eyes eyebrows nose mouth even 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.039
 the forehead the chin all the parts 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.229
 of our face to be able to create 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.699
 our completely different character 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.569
 of the rest and well then once 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.729
 chosen our face 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.229
 we simply choose a name and we 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.460
 We give to create once created no longer 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.349
 will come out in our selection of 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.969
 characters and we can enter with him at 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:17.749
 world to start raising it up to level 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:17.749
 fifty 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.530
 and nothing else for now people this is the 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.789
 creation of characters in the of them 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.229
 online corts I leave the following 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.759
 question to be answered by the 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.039

 and then nothing more if you want to know more 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:36.169
 about the online corts we are 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:37.909
