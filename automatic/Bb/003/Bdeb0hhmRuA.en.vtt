this with a laser engraver that I was

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.280 
this with a laser engraver that I was
lucky<00:00:31.019> enough<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.349> have<00:00:31.439> access<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.809> and<00:00:33.809> on

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
eyes forever Galileo it is a working

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.080 
eyes forever Galileo it is a working
cryptex<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.609> can<00:01:00.050> turn<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.260> dials<00:01:02.090> but

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
cryptex and you can turn the dials but

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.260 
cryptex and you can turn the dials but
it's<00:01:03.960> not<00:01:04.290> fully<00:01:04.650> assembled<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.150> can

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
it's not fully assembled so that I can

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.100 
it's not fully assembled so that I can
take<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.570> apart<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:07.200> everyone<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:09.750> answer<00:01:10.080> to

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
take it apart for everyone the answer to

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.910 
take it apart for everyone the answer to
the<00:01:10.470> riddle<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:11.090> riddle<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.299> picked<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.049> for

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the riddle is riddle I picked it for

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.590 
the riddle is riddle I picked it for
that<00:01:14.040> reason<00:01:14.100> really<00:01:15.680> so<00:01:16.850> you<00:01:17.850> open<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.450> like

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
that reason really so you open it like

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.210 
that reason really so you open it like
this<00:01:19.700> these<00:01:20.700> are<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> pins<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:22.040> keep<00:01:23.040> it

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
this these are the pins that keep it

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.490 
this these are the pins that keep it
locked<00:01:23.549> they're<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.390> nailed<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.140> cut<00:01:25.350> off

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
locked they're just nailed and I cut off

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.850 
locked they're just nailed and I cut off
the<00:01:25.710> heads<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.159> then<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:28.049> reason<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:28.710> it

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the heads and then the reason I have it

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.160 
the heads and then the reason I have it
fully<00:01:29.070> assembled<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:30.030> also<00:01:30.689> because<00:01:31.079> I

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
fully assembled it is also because I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.950 
fully assembled it is also because I
wanted<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.650> make<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> new<00:01:32.509> inside<00:01:33.509> chamber

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
wanted to make a new inside chamber

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.959 
wanted to make a new inside chamber
because<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:34.500> came<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.890> pretty<00:01:35.670> bad

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.429 

so<00:01:42.969> this<00:01:43.240> is<00:01:43.270> what<00:01:43.810> it<00:01:43.899> looks<00:01:44.079> like<00:01:44.229> on<00:01:44.380> the

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
so this is what it looks like on the

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:58.050 
so this is what it looks like on the
inside<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:50.110> take<00:01:50.320> this<00:01:50.500> up<00:01:56.490> these<00:01:57.490> are<00:01:57.880> the

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
inside and take this up these are the

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.279 
inside and take this up these are the
dials<00:01:58.479> this<00:01:58.780> is<00:01:58.929> the<00:01:59.490> top<00:02:00.490> dial<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.209> each<00:02:01.929> dial

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
dials this is the top dial and each dial

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.809 
dials this is the top dial and each dial
has<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.770> notch<00:02:03.369> cut<00:02:03.700> out<00:02:03.850> on<00:02:04.539> the<00:02:04.750> jigsaw<00:02:05.229> and

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
has the notch cut out on the jigsaw and

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.729 
has the notch cut out on the jigsaw and
when<00:02:06.819> the<00:02:06.969> the<00:02:07.479> notches<00:02:07.750> match<00:02:08.259> up<00:02:08.470> with<00:02:08.590> these

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
when the the notches match up with these

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.640 
when the the notches match up with these
pins<00:02:09.209> then<00:02:10.209> that's<00:02:10.929> when<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:11.200> can<00:02:11.290> pull<00:02:11.500> this

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
pins then that's when you can pull this

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.970 
pins then that's when you can pull this
out<00:02:13.829> here's<00:02:14.829> next<00:02:15.280> one<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.620> i<00:02:17.739> had<00:02:17.860> to

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
out here's next one and i had to

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.819 
out here's next one and i had to
woodburn<00:02:18.370> these<00:02:18.579> letters<00:02:18.910> on<00:02:19.090> because<00:02:19.829> the

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
woodburn these letters on because the

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.600 
woodburn these letters on because the
jig<00:02:21.130> for<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.930> laser<00:02:22.930> engraver<00:02:23.410> just<00:02:23.799> wasn't

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
jig for the laser engraver just wasn't

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.120 
jig for the laser engraver just wasn't
going<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.790> fit<00:02:25.000> right<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.860> was<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:26.980> little

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
going to fit right so that was a little

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.710 
going to fit right so that was a little
bit<00:02:27.310> of<00:02:27.430> pain<00:02:28.349> um<00:02:29.349> this<00:02:30.010> part<00:02:30.819> that<00:02:31.360> you<00:02:31.480> see

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
bit of pain um this part that you see

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.300 
bit of pain um this part that you see
was<00:02:32.620> actually<00:02:32.950> done<00:02:33.069> on<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.280> router<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:34.780> was

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
was actually done on a router it was

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.550 
was actually done on a router it was
insanely<00:02:36.310> dangerous<00:02:36.700> because<00:02:37.299> you<00:02:38.200> have<00:02:38.349> to

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
insanely dangerous because you have to

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.900 
insanely dangerous because you have to
use<00:02:38.829> a<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:41.680> was<00:02:41.920> like<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.129> pad<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.700> have<00:02:42.819> to

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
use a it was like a pad and you have to

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.199 
use a it was like a pad and you have to
hold<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.299> and<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.660> covered<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:45.370> entire<00:02:45.489> piece

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
hold it and it covered the entire piece

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.059 
hold it and it covered the entire piece
including<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.049> bit<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:47.709> couldn't<00:02:47.950> really

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
including the bit so you couldn't really

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.879 
including the bit so you couldn't really
see<00:02:48.370> what<00:02:48.519> you<00:02:48.579> were<00:02:48.700> doing<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.329> you<00:02:49.799> have<00:02:50.799> to

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
see what you were doing and you have to

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.460 
see what you were doing and you have to
get<00:02:51.040> really<00:02:51.819> close<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.389> the<00:02:52.420> router<00:02:52.660> bit<00:02:52.930> which

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
get really close to the router bit which

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.949 
get really close to the router bit which
is<00:02:53.500> never<00:02:53.829> great<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:58.150> reason<00:02:58.329> the<00:02:58.810> way

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
is never great and the reason the way

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.140 
is never great and the reason the way
they<00:02:59.109> fit<00:02:59.470> into<00:02:59.620> each<00:02:59.829> other<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.910> there<00:03:01.060> are

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
they fit into each other that there are

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.190 
they fit into each other that there are
holes<00:03:02.190> drilled<00:03:03.190> on<00:03:03.400> both<00:03:03.670> sides<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.720> bottom

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
holes drilled on both sides the bottom

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.900 
holes drilled on both sides the bottom
hole<00:03:05.440> is<00:03:06.600> always<00:03:07.829> bigger<00:03:08.829> than<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.400> top<00:03:09.609> one

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
hole is always bigger than the top one

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.229 
hole is always bigger than the top one
so<00:03:10.630> that's<00:03:11.500> how<00:03:11.620> they<00:03:11.799> fit<00:03:12.069> like<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:15.239> other

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
so that's how they fit like so other

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.080 
so that's how they fit like so other
than<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.900> router<00:03:17.170> part<00:03:17.650> of<00:03:17.769> it<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.579> project

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
than the router part of it the project

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.870 
than the router part of it the project
was<00:03:19.269> pretty<00:03:19.780> easy<00:03:19.840> i<00:03:20.200> would<00:03:20.560> say<00:03:20.769> because<00:03:21.730> it

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
was pretty easy i would say because it

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.849 
was pretty easy i would say because it
was<00:03:21.970> just<00:03:22.000> cutting<00:03:22.480> circles<00:03:23.139> and<00:03:23.410> drilling

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
was just cutting circles and drilling

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:31.690 
was just cutting circles and drilling
holes<00:03:25.590> so

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.009 

that's<00:03:32.330> pretty<00:03:32.660> much<00:03:32.780> it<00:03:32.930> i<00:03:34.629> also<00:03:35.629> have<00:03:35.900> to

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
that's pretty much it i also have to

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.040 
that's pretty much it i also have to
spend<00:03:36.290> a<00:03:36.349> decent<00:03:36.530> amount<00:03:36.830> of<00:03:37.069> time<00:03:37.310> sanding

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
spend a decent amount of time sanding

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:48.100 
spend a decent amount of time sanding
just<00:03:39.050> to<00:03:39.140> make<00:03:39.319> everything<00:03:39.470> fit<00:03:40.069> right<00:03:47.110> that's

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
just to make everything fit right that's

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.830 
just to make everything fit right that's
all<00:03:48.319> thanks<00:03:48.709> for<00:03:48.800> watching
