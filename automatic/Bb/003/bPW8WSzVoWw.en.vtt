why<00:00:26.260> did<00:00:26.470> first<00:00:26.710> I<00:00:26.920> roughed<00:00:27.460> the<00:00:28.000> hair

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
why did first I roughed the hair

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.599 
why did first I roughed the hair
probably<00:00:28.720> like<00:00:28.930> 75<00:00:29.619> percent<00:00:29.650> of<00:00:30.100> the<00:00:30.279> wetness

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
probably like 75 percent of the wetness

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.779 
probably like 75 percent of the wetness
and<00:00:30.820> then<00:00:31.689> I<00:00:32.019> devised<00:00:32.469> heading<00:00:32.890> sections<00:00:33.430> and

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:33.789 
and then I devised heading sections and

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:36.600 
and then I devised heading sections and
one<00:00:34.000> section<00:00:34.989> from<00:00:35.350> the<00:00:35.530> top<00:00:35.559> of<00:00:35.829> the<00:00:35.980> head<00:00:36.160> to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
one section from the top of the head to

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.549 
one section from the top of the head to
behind<00:00:36.940> the<00:00:37.090> ear<00:00:37.239> and<00:00:37.420> that<00:00:37.780> exactly<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:38.380> same

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
behind the ear and that exactly the same

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.620 
behind the ear and that exactly the same
on<00:00:38.680> the<00:00:38.770> other<00:00:38.800> side<00:00:39.190> and<00:00:39.489> another<00:00:40.360> section

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
on the other side and another section

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.350 
on the other side and another section
across<00:00:41.200> behind<00:00:41.890> I<00:00:42.370> always<00:00:42.850> sucked<00:00:43.000> from<00:00:43.180> the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
across behind I always sucked from the

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.600 
across behind I always sucked from the
back<00:00:43.540> and<00:00:43.750> what<00:00:44.230> I<00:00:44.290> do<00:00:44.350> is<00:00:44.680> I<00:00:44.890> take<00:00:45.430> small

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
back and what I do is I take small

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.530

leave a little bit of wetness on the

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.450 
leave a little bit of wetness on the
root<00:00:55.450> that<00:00:55.750> will<00:00:56.260> make<00:00:56.469> sure<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:57.070> blow<00:00:57.219> dry

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
root that will make sure the blow dry

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.299 
root that will make sure the blow dry
goes<00:00:57.670> flat<00:00:58.000> and<00:00:58.300> then<00:00:58.690> I<00:00:58.899> just<00:00:59.230> smooth<00:00:59.680> to<00:01:00.190> the
