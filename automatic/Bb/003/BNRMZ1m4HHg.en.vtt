00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
now I think that's pretty cool and this

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.310 
now I think that's pretty cool and this
is<00:01:33.600> his<00:01:34.110> weapon<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.310> little<00:01:35.520> hammer<00:01:36.320> ice

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
is his weapon just a little hammer ice

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.010 
is his weapon just a little hammer ice
hammer<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.979> guess<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.840> pretty

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.740 
hammer and I guess and it's a pretty
simple<00:01:40.259> hamoed<00:01:40.950> ability<00:01:41.399> I<00:01:41.580> think<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.569> could

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
simple hamoed ability I think I could
