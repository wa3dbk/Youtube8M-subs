00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:07.279
 [Music] 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:09.500
 then the team sports in two 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.110
 benefits firstly it's the 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.290
 physical and operational preparation 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:19.490
 military preparations 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:22.310
 physical that also includes the mind the 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.140
 psychological and the second the second 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.320
 fundamental point that's it allows to 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.869
 create cohesion and the link between 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.820
 between men when in the 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.249
 difficulty in adversity and then 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.069
 this is the human adventure 

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:38.390
 to be more successful in our 

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:40.999
 everyday work that one is 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.039
 in behind a desk or so so on 

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:51.379
 the ground especially in this period 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:53.389
 current where where it's very difficult so 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.909
 it mixes the old ones 

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:57.589
 young people experience the new ones from 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.469
 homogeneous power and all that is actually 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.940
 the hierarchy is different 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.190
 we are more in the hierarchy 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.239
 military so a story degrades that 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.009
 more in the skills of the 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.329
 people is so this cohesion allows 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.020
 to use the qualities of everyone 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:14.450
 to revive for the same purpose the sport 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.180
 collective develops cohesion and 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.420
 mutual help since we can not succeed in 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.649
 sport if you go by yourself what what 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.010
 looks back at the military values we 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:28.909
 can find ambitions 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:31.630
 [Applause] 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:36.159
 in Afghanistan we had regular 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.750
 feedback on rugby type activities 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.119
 touched rugby that was done between 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.079
 the French army the New Zealanders the 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.390
 American and English 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.899
 and when we are far from families 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.990
 allows to keep a little more cost 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.359
 and then and then maintain very 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.719
 good relations with with weapons 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:55.719
 Foreign
