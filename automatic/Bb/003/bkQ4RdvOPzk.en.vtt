00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 what happened I told him we removed a new one from 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.299
 minecraft and we are that the new mode of 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.919
 make unions for version 1.8 and 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.469
 later clear I'll put the 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.660
 description and how do you see this mode 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.490
 what it does is that it makes us see a 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.560
 bar is good that they come out in the part 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.130
 from above to the left that the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.230
 the name of the character mode 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.470
 we are seeing that we have the view and 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.630
 It also puts your life and your type of 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.710
 species species as you see has there 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.869
 as a kind of helmet that 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.660
 means that of human species so 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.880
 say it then for example if we see a 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.950
 cow puts cow 10 life on is what 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.690
 that has and as you see aleix the footprint and 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.329
 green which means that a hostile animal 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.670
 good peaceful hostile better said and 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.770
 then for example if we see a clip it comes out 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.289
 kripper 20 of life what has life in 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.350
 truth and as you can see the brand comes out of that 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.640
 red because this one is useful and good 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.989
 let's move on to the installation 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.190
 well the first thing we have to do 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.379
 is to download the file worth we go to 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.850
