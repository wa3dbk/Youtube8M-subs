00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.930
 check the performance of the sensor 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.980
 mass air flow on nissan 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.299
 maxima a33 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:17.820
 for this we need a multimeter 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.720
 Naturally the mass flow sensor itself 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.880
 of air 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.490
 We first check the performance 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:30.660
 chips off the floor on it and take it off 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:32.579
 chip and connect in extreme red 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.280
 This connector is red black 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.329
 red black connector 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:46.800
 power can be seen here it is extremely before 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:48.750
 a yellow cap on his 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.070
 surely removed the chip to nothing 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.910
 there is not a short sensor tea 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.910
 plus multimeter probe 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:09.780
 deeper and look at the tension here we are 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.880
 stuck look voltage on 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:18.020
 a multimeter i.e. it must match 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:22.340
 with battery voltage i.e. 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:26.880
 the voltage of the car is now 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.580
 detach the probe we catch and look at 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.470
 positive terminal 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.720
 that is, we see that approximately the voltage 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.400
 equally 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:41.250
 that means everything is normal voltage on 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:48.560
 Mafia meets the standard now 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:52.280
 put the chip back on us from and 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.369
 special equipment watch the signal itself with the maho 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.000
 for this we stick the red probe in the extreme 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:05.310
 white wire so then do it goes 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.380
 signal from the mass flow sensor 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.380
 air out to computer 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:19.310
 Here we see that the voltage is 1 volt 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:37.200
 10101 jumps but I forgot to show here 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:41.670
 black mass is closed that's just a bolt 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.530
 on any principle come off any bolt from 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.000
 paints 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.800
 here that is indications from the sensor 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.270
 mass air flow at 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:57.240
 engine off 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:03:01.790
 should be 10 to 10 2 volts which is 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:04.170
 principle corresponds to the evidence 2 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.600
 Now we are trying to start the engines 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:12.380
 let's see what testimony will be on 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:18.750
 single according to the standard should be one and 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:23.510
 2-1 and 6 volts at idle 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.510
 but 18 there even let's say 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.620
 engine engine must be warm 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:47.390
 in tibet launched here a little bit 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.390
 subsided of course now warm 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.730
 turnovers 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.040
 a little bounce back 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:13.480
 move on to see 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:13.480
 Well, you and who turns but these are 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.709
 eight 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.709
 and do mormon 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.740
 with increasing speed 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.770
 Neighing must increase 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.770
 I try 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.980
 I will try accordingly 2 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.430
 by open up and see 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.430
 who is me 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.610
 increase opening beautiful 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.580
 air flow increases 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.319
 signal 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.319
 grease increases too 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.630
 im gate panda 1 and 2 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.440
 Yes, but a lot of me bought a new one 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.830
 recently like this 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.830
 old 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.319
 also still working 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.370
 it is said on our machines always better 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:27.370
 have a spare 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:52.990
 but all the momentum is almost out 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.710
 on a normal working on working momentum 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:06:01.090
 idle move 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:01.090
 i.e. around 650 now they are 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.300
 and 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.930
 knitting 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.930
 bridge 127 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.910
 shut off 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:26.490
 we will check just in case 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.490
 Accumulator charging 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:30.219
 my people cough 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:37.350
 14 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.890
 14 2 turned out 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.890
 operating voltage 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.480
 idle 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:50.040
 I love the music though the charge for which 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:54.830
 now 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.830
 generating a little gun 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.860
 all with butter
