00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello pokémon rods and mans so 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.530
 today I will not explain to you a 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.820
 little like first starts a game of 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.490
 photo cards 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.109
 so here I am mixing a deck and I 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.550
 will show you how we do the 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.710
 know since what is called the top 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.490
 this is the location of the cards beginning of 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:30.179
 the part here I let go of my beak 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.440
 60 cards neither more nor less and jeans 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.239
 pick 7 then and on the seven 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.969
 I look if I have a basic pokemon 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.579
 in my hand in this case elderly 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.770
 viridian so jeridi handed a pokemon of 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.110
 I leave base face hidden my little my 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.989
 active 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.399
 then I look at my hand a little and I 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.550
 place six awards 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:01:02.250
 then the six rewards in both 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:05.159
 contest here next to your clown 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.170
 assets and the purpose of pokemon is to 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.240
 draw just these six rewards 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.220
 so for the prisres it is necessary to put 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.380
 the pokemon of the opponent ko when we 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.380
 is a small normal word of the opponent 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.780
 a normal but a pokémon better with this 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.479
 where we shoot at the compensations by 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.229
 against if marco simone ex laser by ko 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.560
 we draw two there are six 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.140
 so basically you say cunning if pokemon 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.259
 normalizers it does not play ex or 30 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.500
 rock is good ex only circuit 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.820
 exercising a juke and so then you 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.710
 can you if you have other small 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.939
 basics you can also the past on the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.380
 bench it's bath it's a little bit the ones 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.570
 who do not hear fighters 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.090
 does that's what the opponent is from 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:57.540
 same and like you and you launch a 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.070
 zapping passes you hear where is the 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.719
 more winners in any case winners 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:08.539
 starts breton and you optimal and the 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:10.159
 part as a little how to do so 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.439
 in a tour what can we do 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:17.680
 by pulling a card 2 we attach a 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:23.420
 energy by turn all the beauty 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:26.810
 I attach to with jarden 3 I can play 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.879
 10 and objects there in this case I 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.700
 can play the four objects are worth a 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.379
 very good at madball level 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.810
 good so we'll say that I play them and 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.409
 we will shelter the facts 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.099
 gold at the base ball I'm going to look 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:45.069
 stenting I can not the ultra theft 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.299
 succumbs 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.530
 so I know how then you 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:53.989
 think a little you do not do 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.790
 like me of course I filed two 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.819
 beautiful pursuits ultra beautiful ball level 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.319
 so with ball level and looking for a 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:08.180
 mystery and with a trackball go 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:11.260
 to look for a sulphurous then I 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.489
 will make the library 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.780
 so so your turn you can 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.430
 the other so many objects that you want 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.979
 but you are only entitled to 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.370
 a single Lorraine fans the occurrence 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:24.409
 and hub in building French what me 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.909
 I most of my of their account in 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:31.459
 English and that's my hand so with 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.079
 hugues with baptize or did it take 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.659
 you have a total of 5 boxes - 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.489
 Here fans in June I played 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.379
 trainers god my energy 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.180
 and to finish my back I can 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.079
 attack so the cow who laughs yellow I 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.060
 can do pin attack 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.060
 I am double pick so with age has 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.010
 stung do you stink so guard 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.540
 then it's up to your opponent so he 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.540
 will do the same steps as you 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:05.940
 so here's next to attack see 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.710
 the pokemon in front of the damage 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.440
 via 2009 then to attack it takes 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.730
 have the energy or name roast 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.310
 indicated on the map to be able to 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.720
 attack in the instance for recall 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.550
 of facts it takes a twenty energy 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.070
 swimmers color to be able to use 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:24.130
 this attack therefore low energy terminal 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.410
 basic energy and imagine them colorless 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.790
 and any one you can 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.240
 consider it's important to us 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.240
 energy 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:38.320
 you can all here no matter what not 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:39.970
 the quantity demanded therefore follows 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.920
 of course you can make it beat in 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.780
 retreat your pokemon then for good 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.290
 to make defeat retreat if 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.570
 my energy 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:54.190
 then to your faults this magical world he 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:55.900
 there are colorless energies so that's where 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.080
 in this case an energy alone does 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.240
 two it's ok after 3,4 that 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.700
 becomes a lot that already a huge 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.220
 default these breaks suddenly energy all 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:10.530
 what we know that 120 cons in joy 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:13.780
 that frenzen it's almost a quarter of 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.970
 d energy by this volume is wrong is worth 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.560
 better use of e-cards 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.920
 it allows to exchange any 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.170
 pokemon like those see it 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.410
 precisely this foot of arrest what 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:30.740
 is very convenient 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:32.509
 so that's so 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.210
 I think it's pretty much all told 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:41.210
 it is also the basis of the rules of 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:45.349
 pokemon and so that was the goal think that 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.910
 I have almost everything I will do 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:48.729
 birdies in love well i will make a 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:53.270
 second video 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:59.960
 but for now I do not vote the 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:06:01.849
 not too much that I forgot so well 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.000
 sure do not forget that we count 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:05.720
 jokes inheriting the enemy pokémon this 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 following 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.710
 here is for example I have a structure 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.280
 to a wine resistance to his lease 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.360
 septet 2 x 2 then there even the weakness 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.009
 from his world 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.919
 multiply the damage that may be 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:21.380
 by two and the resistance have reduced by 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:24.400
 20 the cakes that day are so it's 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.419
 the resistance is fighting this moment she 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.039
 correct when we know that there is a 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:29.569
 sure of emitters os x that's pretty 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.759
 played he has his pieces up and very 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:36.199
 bad caravel of which Oblates 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:38.360
 web some writers tank that makes 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:40.880
 ravages in tournament and there you will do is 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.699
 It not very advisable in both cases 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:48.289
 currently so I like to have fun 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:50.360
 that day So here is what is 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:53.169
 all for this little video 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.169
 go ciao
