00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
level performance as once again I said

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.589 
level performance as once again I said
with<00:00:27.189> a<00:00:27.220> little<00:00:27.399> bit<00:00:27.640> lower<00:00:27.849> of<00:00:27.939> a<00:00:28.090> price<00:00:28.329> tag

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
with a little bit lower of a price tag

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.450 
with a little bit lower of a price tag
starting<00:00:29.500> on<00:00:29.559> the<00:00:29.619> bottom<00:00:29.739> as<00:00:29.980> far<00:00:30.040> as<00:00:30.250> wheels

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
starting on the bottom as far as wheels

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.190 
starting on the bottom as far as wheels
using<00:00:30.849> their<00:00:30.970> using<00:00:31.239> the<00:00:31.300> labayda<00:00:31.599> dynasty

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
using their using the labayda dynasty

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.170 
using their using the labayda dynasty
wheels<00:00:32.410> so<00:00:32.980> it's<00:00:33.100> a<00:00:33.190> nice<00:00:33.489> high-end<00:00:33.790> wheel

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
wheels so it's a nice high-end wheel

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.760 
wheels so it's a nice high-end wheel
it's<00:00:34.360> going<00:00:34.480> to<00:00:34.540> give<00:00:34.660> a<00:00:34.690> great<00:00:34.930> level<00:00:35.230> grip<00:00:35.590> as

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
it's going to give a great level grip as

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.040 
it's going to give a great level grip as
well<00:00:35.950> as<00:00:36.040> speed<00:00:36.400> as<00:00:37.120> far<00:00:37.330> as<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.540> bearings<00:00:37.870> go

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
well as speed as far as the bearings go

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.900 
well as speed as far as the bearings go
on<00:00:38.170> it<00:00:38.320> they're<00:00:38.650> actually<00:00:39.010> using<00:00:39.340> a<00:00:39.460> micro

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
on it they're actually using a micro

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.970 
on it they're actually using a micro
bearing<00:00:40.240> although<00:00:40.870> they<00:00:41.080> do<00:00:41.140> offer<00:00:41.440> a<00:00:41.560> free

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
bearing although they do offer a free

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.490 
bearing although they do offer a free
set<00:00:42.250> of<00:00:42.490> six<00:00:42.970> eight<00:00:43.210> oh<00:00:43.510> eight<00:00:43.600> bearings<00:00:44.320> so

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
set of six eight oh eight bearings so

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.110 
set of six eight oh eight bearings so
you<00:00:44.560> have<00:00:44.770> the<00:00:45.010> six<00:00:45.370> eighty<00:00:45.670> eight's<00:00:45.910> which

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
you have the six eighty eight's which

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.940 
you have the six eighty eight's which
are<00:00:46.270> the<00:00:46.360> microbes<00:00:46.720> that<00:00:46.810> are<00:00:46.900> in<00:00:47.020> it<00:00:47.320> as<00:00:47.440> well

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
are the microbes that are in it as well

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.530 
are the microbes that are in it as well
as<00:00:48.040> a<00:00:48.070> free<00:00:48.340> set<00:00:48.579> of<00:00:48.610> the<00:00:48.760> standard<00:00:49.210> bearings

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
as a free set of the standard bearings

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.270 
as a free set of the standard bearings
so<00:00:49.690> it's<00:00:49.810> a<00:00:49.870> nice<00:00:50.050> feature<00:00:50.320> especially<00:00:50.770> if

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
so it's a nice feature especially if

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.740 
so it's a nice feature especially if
there's<00:00:51.460> a<00:00:51.550> particular<00:00:52.000> wheel<00:00:52.210> that<00:00:52.450> you<00:00:52.540> want

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
there's a particular wheel that you want

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.170 
there's a particular wheel that you want
that's<00:00:53.170> not<00:00:53.410> available<00:00:53.829> in<00:00:53.920> a<00:00:53.950> micro<00:00:54.280> hub<00:00:54.520> so

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
that's not available in a micro hub so

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.060 
that's not available in a micro hub so
it's<00:00:55.329> always<00:00:55.510> great<00:00:55.720> to<00:00:55.750> see<00:00:56.050> going<00:00:56.620> onto<00:00:56.860> the

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
it's always great to see going onto the

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.590 
it's always great to see going onto the
frame<00:00:57.460> that's<00:00:57.670> gonna<00:00:57.850> be<00:00:57.970> the<00:00:58.060> same<00:00:58.210> way<00:00:58.420> Beta

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
frame that's gonna be the same way Beta

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.120 
frame that's gonna be the same way Beta
Hummer<00:00:58.870> frame<00:00:59.200> so<00:00:59.380> it<00:00:59.500> has<00:00:59.590> a<00:00:59.620> nice<00:00:59.770> thin

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
Hummer frame so it has a nice thin

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.190 
Hummer frame so it has a nice thin
profile<00:01:00.610> to<00:01:00.760> be<00:01:00.850> a<00:01:00.880> light<00:01:01.149> frame<00:01:01.480> as<00:01:01.660> well<00:01:02.110> as

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
profile to be a light frame as well as

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.259 
profile to be a light frame as well as
accounting<00:01:02.680> for<00:01:02.890> those<00:01:03.190> all<00:01:03.489> one<00:01:03.790> size<00:01:04.030> wheels

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
accounting for those all one size wheels

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.060 
accounting for those all one size wheels
across<00:01:04.449> it<00:01:04.839> so<00:01:04.960> on<00:01:05.049> those<00:01:05.140> adult<00:01:05.530> sizes<00:01:05.920> it's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
across it so on those adult sizes it's

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.790 
across it so on those adult sizes it's
gonna<00:01:06.220> be<00:01:06.310> all<00:01:06.490> 80s<00:01:07.060> giving<00:01:07.659> maximum<00:01:08.080> speed<00:01:08.560> as

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
gonna be all 80s giving maximum speed as

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.130 
gonna be all 80s giving maximum speed as
well<00:01:09.040> as<00:01:09.100> grip<00:01:09.550> and<00:01:09.729> turning<00:01:10.120> on<00:01:10.270> it<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.600> as

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
well as grip and turning on it and as

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.260 
well as grip and turning on it and as
well<00:01:11.350> as<00:01:11.409> stopping<00:01:11.710> goes<00:01:12.040> and<00:01:12.310> then<00:01:12.880> going<00:01:13.150> on

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
well as stopping goes and then going on

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.360 
well as stopping goes and then going on
and<00:01:13.540> how<00:01:13.990> they're<00:01:14.170> able<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.470> achieve<00:01:14.680> having

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
and how they're able to achieve having

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.490 
and how they're able to achieve having
that<00:01:15.520> 80<00:01:15.790> millimeter<00:01:16.180> as<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.630> DPS<00:01:17.110> system

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
that 80 millimeter as the DPS system

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.080 
that 80 millimeter as the DPS system
which<00:01:17.620> is<00:01:17.740> that<00:01:17.890> indentation<00:01:18.220> underneath<00:01:18.970> the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
which is that indentation underneath the

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.880 
which is that indentation underneath the
forefoot<00:01:19.600> so<00:01:20.110> it<00:01:20.229> really<00:01:20.409> allows<00:01:20.620> those

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
forefoot so it really allows those

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.410 
forefoot so it really allows those
larger<00:01:21.310> wheels<00:01:21.460> in<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:21.640> front<00:01:21.909> to<00:01:22.060> recess

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
larger wheels in the front to recess

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.830 
larger wheels in the front to recess
into<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:22.990> skate<00:01:23.290> I'm<00:01:23.470> giving<00:01:24.250> you<00:01:24.400> a<00:01:24.430> nice

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
into the skate I'm giving you a nice

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.820 
into the skate I'm giving you a nice
overall<00:01:25.840> feel<00:01:26.080> to<00:01:26.260> it<00:01:26.350> so<00:01:26.440> you're<00:01:26.560> not<00:01:26.590> any

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
overall feel to it so you're not any

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.350 
overall feel to it so you're not any
higher<00:01:27.130> off<00:01:27.370> the<00:01:27.549> rink<00:01:27.729> than<00:01:27.909> you<00:01:27.970> would<00:01:28.120> be<00:01:28.240> on

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360
