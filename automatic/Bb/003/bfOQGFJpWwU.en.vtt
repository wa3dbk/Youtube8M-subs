00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.979
 here before you 

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:10.209
 the new 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:11.749
 the palm pixi 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:14.749
 which is actually the second team 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:18.590
 deepak with that active web man like that 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.730
 currently marketed spring 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.269
 and this is the team 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.269
 the physical mind live 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:33.819
 as you can see it is an extremely thin design 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.750
 this is the room that opens to connect it to the electric current 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.579
 ideal but after all this from the computer 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.780
 volume control 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.760
 the little psycho piece 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.760
 to put it in vibrator mode 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.850
 handset 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 the button that activates and deactivates the screen 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.490
 the back part that is a success that is made of material 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.870
 rumboso what will totally avoid 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.970
 discomfort fingerprints the 2 megapixel camera 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.210
 com can see their designs pretty pretty 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.240
 attractive 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.900
 this is the physical keyboard of the palm pixi 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.400
 the prices are small however 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.240
 Beijing in no sensibility 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.240
 to the pact and allow to write fairly quickly 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.960
 wake 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.520
 the pearl screen 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.520
 -of two points- and hung 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.710
 so that they give an idea a bit of the size 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
 this is a black berry 83 30 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.850
 I am not less 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.850
 they can give an idea 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.650
 of the thickness of the equipment 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:13.510
 as you can see that slightly higher but much thinner 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.339
 it's amazing that the phone weighs 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.759
 approximately 100 grams 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:24.759
 and despite its lightness it does not feel cheap 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.119
 it feels pretty good with your freedom 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:29.699
 which is 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.699
 it is a success 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.319
 after a point uvini 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.989
 in important operatives we are going to make him the bat by the screen 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:47.759
 you press ambient matic 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.429
 appears 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:54.189
 the citizenship 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.539
 the sale and prepare the screen so that the locks and phone 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:00.489
 there's even I have a notification 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.559
 to unlock the rental phone 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:06.559
 if they are or not and dragged it and this is what there 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.669
 and this is the superlative level 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.489
 webÃ³ s 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.489
 here we can see the applications 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.959
 believes that there is one of the three other cultures of the bases 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.779
 the electronic messaging system that is very interesting how to put together 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.969
 all mail accounts 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:32.969
 automatically in a single interface 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.989
 The Chinese contracts the results too 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.049
 pretty comfortable 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.049
 the level of severity is very high 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:53.220
 I do not have this at this time, this is what I have 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.279
 it's a landslide in cdma 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:04:00.359
 that I commercialize sprint in the United States I do not defend working with 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:01.379
 what 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.379
 It happened to him in Mexico 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:04.219
 each 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:06.629
 sail very fast 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.809
 that is operational 

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:13.059
 in this phone it performs well however you have to accept that they do not lend 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:14.039
 Murcia 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:17.039
 I feel like 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.430
 therefore having more than three applications open at the same time 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.990
 may cause you to continue with the same 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.690
 the webkit browser and it's based on a story here and it's pretty pretty 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.759
 Quick 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.759
 on the other side of the phone I'm very good here 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:46.629
 position on the screen 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:49.629
 the pages that visit a full format 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.580
 and if everything goes as it is loading 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.580
 wallander 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:59.009
 maybe by the ife 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.710
 the same jaguar that it takes 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.710
 That's why I can 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.669
 photo orlando connection 3g suddenly some pages to win with loads 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.669
 but one that make up the league we load them wallflex 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.559
 you can navigate 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:19.559
 without any trouble 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.720
 the screen is smaller than many other more backgrounds then weight of 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.389
 Suddenly you can make it 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.139
 not complicated to give to the people 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.689
 like 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:34.029
 yes 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:36.589
 the iphone is this 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:39.589
 efe can be expanded 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:46.050
 the app store 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.370
 heether de palm 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.810
 it is rather rather that it is quite limited with respect to 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.870
 the reason for polio 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.560
 even leandro smart market can still be done without problems 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:01.839
 i buenos aires - some applications 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.629
 this time that promote it 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:06.879
 in fact 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:09.939
 here we got into a fault of the purchasing system 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.710
 up to here that of the version when it was explained how much it weighs 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.159
 the qualification of the users 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:21.039
 the cost in this case says that you can 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.279
 download for free 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:26.729
 we have a short description and some days 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:29.479
 to download an application 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:31.889
 this simple as 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:33.029
 take away 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:36.779
 there he tells us that he is going to use the gps functions we tell him that we do not 

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:39.779
 import 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.550
 the discharge 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:55.939
 finished the download we can fight to retire everything we can even access 

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:56.520
 since 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.409
 the only doubt for its application 

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:00.189
 and there we have it
