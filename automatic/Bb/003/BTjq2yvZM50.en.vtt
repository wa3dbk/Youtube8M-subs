00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
didn't really bother me at all because

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.700 
didn't really bother me at all because
it<00:00:47.910> was<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> only<00:00:48.149> way<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.539> had<00:00:48.780> seen<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.170> what<00:00:49.680> I

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
it was the only way I had seen it what I

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.740 
it was the only way I had seen it what I
do<00:00:49.829> remember<00:00:50.489> distinctly<00:00:50.700> however<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.719> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
do remember distinctly however is that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.670 
do remember distinctly however is that
the<00:00:52.050> music<00:00:52.410> kicked<00:00:53.070> ass<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:54.079> particular<00:00:55.079> when

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the music kicked ass in particular when

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.529 
the music kicked ass in particular when
they<00:00:55.800> finally<00:00:56.070> got<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.610> stuff<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
Bruce Faulkner is kind of really what

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.469 
Bruce Faulkner is kind of really what
divided<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.310> entire<00:01:26.670> series<00:01:27.150> down<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
divided the entire series down the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.510 
divided the entire series down the
middle<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.840> what<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.049> mean<00:01:28.259> by<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.920> now

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
middle and what I mean by that is now

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.429 
middle and what I mean by that is now
that<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.729> finally<00:01:30.090> watched<00:01:30.450> Dragon<00:01:30.930> Ball<00:01:31.079> Z<00:01:31.259> and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
and Japanese and in English they really

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.800 
and Japanese and in English they really
are<00:01:36.450> two<00:01:36.960> completely<00:01:37.439> different<00:01:37.590> shows<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
are two completely different shows and

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.810 
are two completely different shows and
and<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.200> music<00:01:40.530> really<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.070> big<00:01:41.400> part<00:01:41.700> of

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
and the music really is a big part of

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.030 
and the music really is a big part of
that<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.840> voice<00:01:42.990> acting<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.829> course

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
that but the voice acting and of course

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.620 
that but the voice acting and of course
the<00:01:44.159> translations<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> stories<00:01:45.450> also

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the translations of the stories also

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.480 
the translations of the stories also
play<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> big<00:01:45.990> role<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.350> there<00:01:46.590> as<00:01:46.680> well<00:01:46.860> now

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
play a big role in there as well now

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.280 
play a big role in there as well now
obviously<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.270> just<00:01:48.540> want<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.750> talk<00:01:48.899> about<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
obviously I just want to talk about the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.080 
obviously I just want to talk about the
big<00:01:49.590> differences<00:01:50.130> here<00:01:50.340> first<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.729> foremost

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
big differences here first and foremost

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.060 
big differences here first and foremost
the<00:01:51.210> Japanese<00:01:51.630> version<00:01:52.049> some<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
the Japanese version some of the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.010 
the Japanese version some of the
characters<00:01:53.490> are<00:01:53.700> pretty<00:01:54.180> different<00:01:54.600> but

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
characters are pretty different but

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.899 
characters are pretty different but
again<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.439> lot<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.920> comes<00:01:56.219> down<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
again a lot of it comes down to the

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.399 
again a lot of it comes down to the
music<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.600> lot<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> times<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
music and a lot of the times the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.319 
music and a lot of the times the
narration<00:01:59.100> there<00:01:59.729> are<00:01:59.790> times<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
narration there are times in the

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.789 
narration there are times in the
Japanese<00:02:00.750> version<00:02:00.780> when<00:02:01.320> there's<00:02:01.469> pretty

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
Japanese version when there's pretty

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.889 
Japanese version when there's pretty
much<00:02:01.860> no<00:02:02.280> music<00:02:02.759> at<00:02:02.909> all<00:02:03.060> or<00:02:03.299> no<00:02:03.479> narration

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
much no music at all or no narration

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.260 
much no music at all or no narration
going<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.500> at<00:02:04.619> all<00:02:04.770> where<00:02:05.009> in<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.759> American

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
going on at all where in the American

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.880 
going on at all where in the American
version<00:02:06.420> there's<00:02:06.810> gonna<00:02:06.899> be<00:02:07.079> music<00:02:07.259> blaring

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
version there's gonna be music blaring

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.529 
version there's gonna be music blaring
constantly<00:02:08.789> there's<00:02:08.970> going<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.119> be<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.300> guy

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
constantly there's going to be a guy

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.180 
constantly there's going to be a guy
talking<00:02:10.110> about<00:02:10.289> something<00:02:10.590> all<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.160> time

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
talking about something all the time

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.970 
talking about something all the time
there<00:02:12.150> are<00:02:12.180> little<00:02:12.510> different

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
there are little different

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.260 
there are little different
here<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:13.340> there<00:02:13.430> but<00:02:13.550> I<00:02:13.610> really<00:02:13.670> think<00:02:14.060> it's

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
here and there but I really think it's

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.910 
here and there but I really think it's
down<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.810> music<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.290> really<00:02:15.470> divides

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
down to the music that really divides

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.520 
down to the music that really divides
the<00:02:16.220> dub<00:02:16.430> in<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.640> sub<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.209> I<00:02:17.870> actually<00:02:18.140> like

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
the dub in the sub and I actually like

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.619 
the dub in the sub and I actually like
the<00:02:18.680> Japanese<00:02:19.129> music<00:02:19.489> a<00:02:19.580> lot<00:02:19.760> it<00:02:19.970> took<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.269> long

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
the Japanese music a lot it took a long

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.710 
the Japanese music a lot it took a long
time<00:02:20.660> for<00:02:20.959> it<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.319> grow<00:02:21.560> on<00:02:21.769> me<00:02:21.920> however<00:02:22.129> and

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
time for it to grow on me however and

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.910 
time for it to grow on me however and
and<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.900> makes<00:02:24.080> sense<00:02:24.230> because<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:24.620> started

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
and it makes sense because I started

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.350 
and it makes sense because I started
watching<00:02:25.099> all<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.580> Bruce<00:02:25.760> Faulkner<00:02:26.150> stuff

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
watching all the Bruce Faulkner stuff

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.540 
watching all the Bruce Faulkner stuff
first<00:02:26.599> and<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.110> music<00:02:27.290> is<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:27.560> cool<00:02:28.129> and<00:02:28.370> so

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
first and that music is so cool and so

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.059 
first and that music is so cool and so
amped<00:02:28.970> up<00:02:29.090> however<00:02:29.840> there<00:02:30.110> are<00:02:30.319> times<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.709> can

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
amped up however there are times it can

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.009 
amped up however there are times it can
be<00:02:31.280> used<00:02:31.599> inappropriately<00:02:32.599> and<00:02:32.780> there<00:02:32.930> are

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
be used inappropriately and there are

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.410 
be used inappropriately and there are
times<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.590> little<00:02:33.890> goofy<00:02:34.430> but<00:02:34.640> for<00:02:35.330> the

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
times it is a little goofy but for the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.120 
times it is a little goofy but for the
most<00:02:35.690> part<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.110> Bruce<00:02:36.319> Faulkner<00:02:36.680> music<00:02:37.010> is

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
most part the Bruce Faulkner music is

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.949 
most part the Bruce Faulkner music is
pretty<00:02:37.370> damn<00:02:37.670> badass<00:02:38.180> but<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.540> Japanese

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
pretty damn badass but the Japanese

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.390 
pretty damn badass but the Japanese
music<00:02:39.349> at<00:02:39.440> first<00:02:39.650> when<00:02:39.769> I<00:02:39.799> heard<00:02:40.010> it<00:02:40.160> I<00:02:40.280> was

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
music at first when I heard it I was

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.699 
music at first when I heard it I was
like<00:02:40.489> oh<00:02:40.640> my<00:02:40.849> god<00:02:41.299> this<00:02:41.540> is<00:02:41.720> so<00:02:41.930> grating<00:02:42.590> and

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
like oh my god this is so grating and

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.370 
like oh my god this is so grating and
awful<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.519> just<00:02:43.760> cannot<00:02:43.970> stand<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.660> but<00:02:45.260> the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
awful I just cannot stand it but the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.839 
awful I just cannot stand it but the
more<00:02:45.590> I<00:02:45.650> watched<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.459> more<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:46.819> more

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
more I watched it and the more and more

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.550 
more I watched it and the more and more
I<00:02:46.970> began<00:02:47.330> to<00:02:47.390> really<00:02:47.690> understand<00:02:48.319> what<00:02:48.470> they

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
I began to really understand what they

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.530 
I began to really understand what they
were<00:02:48.620> going<00:02:48.860> for<00:02:49.010> not<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.790> mention<00:02:50.000> this<00:02:50.330> is<00:02:50.510> a

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
were going for not to mention this is a

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.350 
were going for not to mention this is a
show<00:02:50.810> that<00:02:50.840> started<00:02:51.440> in<00:02:51.730> 1985<00:02:52.730> or<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.060> think<00:02:53.269> it

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
show that started in 1985 or I think it
