that's why when this car was redesigned

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.850 
that's why when this car was redesigned
in<00:02:59.090> 67<00:03:00.090> they<00:03:00.840> were<00:03:00.900> actually<00:03:01.380> able<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.680> go

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
in 67 they were actually able to go

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.080 
in 67 they were actually able to go
ahead<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.130> put<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.340> bigger<00:03:02.520> engine<00:03:02.910> in<00:03:03.030> it

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
ahead and put the bigger engine in it

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.310
