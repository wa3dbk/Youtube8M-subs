 vilela 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:12.379
 at the parade 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.390
 3 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
 pili 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.530
 Since I was six and six years ago 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.630
 g only with children and that was dreaming makes things different things are local 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.560
 I really like ventriloquism 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.560
 then it is the person who speaks with some characters 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.140
 There are those like tintín azores 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.350
 it's very cool and what's 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.350
 that he 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.549
 of ogival door to the people for which he made me propose to study the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.819
 technique prepare me and nominated 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.609
 so the pc is a character 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:21.320
 the one that is apron 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.580
 e psa ahmadi and apart there are two other boys who are pancho hitchens 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.910
 churches 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.790
 hard 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.790
 muniain 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.190
 because the children that what the hotel children is the public most 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:14.559
 difficult if you manage to demand 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:16.449
 instigate children 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:20.089
 I tried scenically wants more of you wants 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.020
 more than a thousand songs more expression 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.680
 much quality because in shows for children without income to 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.930
 those particularities much color many things that I know many of them have 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.060
 the potential 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.850
 but in many of our Latin American countries 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.030
 they grow no culture where they are told they are not good at all they are fools 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.110
 they do not work 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.369
 my dad does not have money the pope then three in three the congress 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:47.699
 i think it should not be like that 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:52.109
 I believe that in the partnership to form a new generation of saying goodbye to 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.009
 what it is worth is what they are and what they really can become is what 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:59.930
 it motivates me to have different messages from the bible 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.750
 positive messages and that's why in my job 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.750
 You have searched in many partner countries 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:11.019
 video 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.509
 edison 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:16.509
 if the government 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:19.299
 He tells 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.499
 it's hard 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.240
 some cases of Argentina passed from 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.690
 dn that enriched me suddenly they have told me 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.430
 nor in this one is your grief 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.499
 something 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:34.869
 because yes but in the end look I am very bad in that sense I like this what I 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:35.989
 does it increase 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.170
 but no doubt some light in some case they tell me 'you can not' because we try to 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.279
 entente be a little more about franchi that yes a dress pants 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:49.530
 It touched me once the goal was one hundred percent with the micaela way 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.739
 for a good boy 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.889
 p the arnao mine but yes but good boy 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.340
 jonathan mr to the adult 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.469
 but among those activities 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:03.819
 because in the end who what they make me of an artist or a minister of God not in 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.719
 the hairstyle or the clothes or the brand or what bush or 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.070
 but the essence the god's motion 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.760
 and the presence of issues from people who see my eyes and have had 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.409
 opportunity that this one has to be with me in some event 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.980
 they realize that this is secondary 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.980
 that the main thing is that Indians this month presentation 

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.629
 hard 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.900
 the leader of the zetas 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:38.030
 For example day is a comic and gray hair in Mexico 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.039
 he is the most recent 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.960
 while they made the most recent acquisition because chés pancho by 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.849
 example 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:45.880
 they do have 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.759
 16 years of working with him 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:50.189
 I paint and with an ace 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:51.190
 they are born 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.300
 there must be situations born of seeing characters for example and it's a little 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.379
 distracted a little bit the how 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:00.909
 to direct is to administer and 2 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:05.089
 and it took them very interactive but at the same time as the hotel gets on the plane 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:08.970
 in things very fast the pancho is more sober more 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.970
 for 100 more than god has 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.470
 because I understand that he has 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.280
 a quality and it is that it does not have feet then I was going to reach children people 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.400
 they have chance that they have AIDS children burned children 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.930
 who have some difficulty 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.919
 giving him in his testimony chávez is a little bit more the crazy one who more 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.300
 extroverted anv or purple 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.060
 this human action being 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.050
 different needs of the tic and cover to some extent still uncertain 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.949
 pl 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.080
 percent for that instant 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.789
 and where people are interested in some things among what they like 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.150
 Some light wine that does not like other people but depends on the 

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:51.819
 person and that is when they click with some character of the children of 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:52.450
 so 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.610
 that's why the three characters and that way safer 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:16.029
 she 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:21.800
