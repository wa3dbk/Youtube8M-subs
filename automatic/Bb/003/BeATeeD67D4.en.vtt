00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
sort of go ghostly you know translucent

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.370 
sort of go ghostly you know translucent
if<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.860> will<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.360> that<00:00:36.360> way<00:00:36.510> then<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.200> can

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
if you will and that way then you can

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.110 
if you will and that way then you can
get<00:00:37.530> past<00:00:37.800> all<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.309> block<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.760> you'll<00:00:38.910> see<00:00:39.090> I

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
get past all the block so you'll see I

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.990 
get past all the block so you'll see I
jump<00:00:39.450> here<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.840> nightshade<00:00:40.290> mode<00:00:40.969> so<00:00:41.969> i

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
jump here in the nightshade mode so i

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.299 
jump here in the nightshade mode so i
can<00:00:42.300> go<00:00:42.450> through<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> blue<00:00:43.050> ones<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.559> directly

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
can go through the blue ones in directly

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.700 
can go through the blue ones in directly
into<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.120> orange<00:00:45.690> one<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.469> orange

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
into the orange one and so the orange

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.959 
into the orange one and so the orange
ones<00:00:46.860> at<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.039> end<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.309> green<00:00:47.489> was<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.789> only

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
ones at the end the green was the only

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.810 
ones at the end the green was the only
ones<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.390> are<00:00:48.480> solid<00:00:48.989> at<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.260> point<00:00:49.820> and

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
ones that are solid at this point and

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.380 
ones that are solid at this point and
ian<00:00:51.570> even<00:00:52.170> brings<00:00:52.590> remnants<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.520> blue<00:00:54.120> ones

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
ian even brings remnants of blue ones

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.420 
ian even brings remnants of blue ones
that<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.780> blew<00:00:55.199> pegs<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.100> have<00:00:56.190> already

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
that you blew pegs that you have already

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.819 
that you blew pegs that you have already
hit<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.629> can<00:00:57.780> actually<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.199> extra<00:00:58.620> points

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
hit so you can actually get extra points

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.330 
hit so you can actually get extra points
that<00:00:59.219> way<00:00:59.780> it<00:01:00.780> really<00:01:01.379> works<00:01:01.649> well<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:02.190> in

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
that way it really works well here in

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.119 
that way it really works well here in
levels<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:03.059> where<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:04.320> know<00:01:04.830> some<00:01:05.100> of

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
levels like this where you know some of

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.710 
levels like this where you know some of
the<00:01:05.280> orange<00:01:05.549> ones<00:01:05.760> are<00:01:05.880> blocked<00:01:06.180> way<00:01:06.450> at<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the orange ones are blocked way at the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.620 
the orange ones are blocked way at the
bottom<00:01:07.790> so<00:01:08.790> I'm<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.090> try<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.299> go<00:01:09.510> ahead

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
bottom so I'm going to try to go ahead

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.630 
bottom so I'm going to try to go ahead
and<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.990> name<00:01:10.590> for<00:01:10.890> something<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.250> little<00:01:11.369> lower

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
and a name for something a little lower

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.390 
and a name for something a little lower
in<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.960> you<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:13.049> go<00:01:13.260> through<00:01:13.530> what<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.250> blue

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
in the you know go through what the blue

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.429 
in the you know go through what the blue
pegs<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.850> may<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.210> there<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.780> get<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> free

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
pegs that may be there and get a free

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.710 
pegs that may be there and get a free
ball<00:01:16.650> while<00:01:16.890> I'm<00:01:17.040> at<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.420> just<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
ball while I'm at it just like the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.609 
ball while I'm at it just like the
regular<00:01:18.869> first<00:01:19.380> Pecola<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> basic<00:01:20.790> rules<00:01:21.000> apply

your<00:01:22.619> job<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.159> aim<00:01:23.729> your<00:01:25.670> little<00:01:26.670> ball

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
your job is to aim your little ball

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.719 
your job is to aim your little ball
shooter<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.840> at<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.890> pace<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.250> want<00:01:29.490> and

shooter and at the pace you want and
then<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.240> know<00:01:30.360> physics<00:01:30.960> itself<00:01:31.409> takes<00:01:31.650> over

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
then you know physics itself takes over

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.550 
then you know physics itself takes over
and<00:01:32.270> we<00:01:33.270> get<00:01:34.070> basically<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.659> smash<00:01:36.659> hit<00:01:36.689> that

I<00:01:43.650> guess<00:01:44.280> for<00:01:44.610> twelve<00:01:44.880> dollars<00:01:45.300> it<00:01:45.570> seems<00:01:45.870> a

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
I guess for twelve dollars it seems a

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.390 
I guess for twelve dollars it seems a
little<00:01:46.430> a<00:01:47.430> little<00:01:47.880> light<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.870> me<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
little a little light to me but on the

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.910 
little a little light to me but on the
other<00:01:50.520> hand<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:51.330> must<00:01:52.260> have<00:01:52.350> played<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.710> for<00:01:52.740> a

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
other hand I must have played it for a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.010 
other hand I must have played it for a
good<00:01:53.100> three<00:01:53.880> or<00:01:53.910> four<00:01:54.180> hours<00:01:54.480> already<00:01:54.660> today

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
good three or four hours already today

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.780 
good three or four hours already today
so<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:56.820> know<00:01:56.910> especially<00:01:57.180> here<00:01:57.780> at<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.990> end

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
once i get the exchange or you know go

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.570 
once i get the exchange or you know go
to<00:02:05.670> extreme<00:02:06.120> fever<00:02:06.890> you<00:02:07.890> know<00:02:07.979> i<00:02:08.009> still<00:02:08.399> get

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
to extreme fever you know i still get

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.070 
to extreme fever you know i still get
that<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.910> still<00:02:09.149> get<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.330> rush<00:02:09.780> that's
