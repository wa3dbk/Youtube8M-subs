00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
gave it a very sort of weak look but now

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.430 
gave it a very sort of weak look but now
what<00:02:15.330> they've<00:02:15.480> done<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.840> they've<00:02:16.019> kept<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.319> lot

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
what they've done is they've kept a lot

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.080 
what they've done is they've kept a lot
of<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.680> wood<00:02:16.860> they're<00:02:17.100> still<00:02:17.760> kept<00:02:17.970> the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
of the wood they're still kept the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.610 
of the wood they're still kept the
weight<00:02:18.240> down<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.510> mean<00:02:18.750> both<00:02:18.900> these<00:02:19.140> bats<00:02:19.410> pick

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
weight down I mean both these bats pick

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.070 
weight down I mean both these bats pick
up<00:02:19.770> really<00:02:20.250> really<00:02:20.580> well

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
up really really well

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.860 
up really really well
and<00:02:21.200> they're<00:02:21.500> very<00:02:21.530> light<00:02:21.950> but<00:02:22.570> they<00:02:23.570> still

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
and they're very light but they still

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.620 
and they're very light but they still
retained<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.710> lot<00:02:25.100> of<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.730> wood<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.150> the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
retained a lot of the the wood to the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.660 
retained a lot of the the wood to the
back<00:02:26.930> we<00:02:27.350> still<00:02:27.560> gives<00:02:27.740> it<00:02:27.830> a<00:02:27.920> powerful<00:02:28.100> feel

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
back we still gives it a powerful feel

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.410 
back we still gives it a powerful feel
and<00:02:29.000> look<00:02:29.980> now<00:02:30.980> from<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.790> distance<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:32.240> can<00:02:32.360> see

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
and look now from a distance you can see

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.030 
and look now from a distance you can see
that<00:02:32.660> these<00:02:32.720> are<00:02:32.900> really<00:02:33.170> smart<00:02:33.470> looking<00:02:33.740> bats

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
that these are really smart looking bats

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.150 
that these are really smart looking bats
they<00:02:34.220> look<00:02:34.370> great<00:02:38.590> now<00:02:39.590> for<00:02:39.770> someone<00:02:40.040> just

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
they look great now for someone just

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.030 
they look great now for someone just
moving<00:02:40.550> up<00:02:40.640> from<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.970> Harrow<00:02:41.240> and<00:02:42.110> coming<00:02:42.770> on<00:02:42.890> to

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
moving up from a Harrow and coming on to

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.550 
moving up from a Harrow and coming on to
a<00:02:43.070> full-size<00:02:43.550> bad<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.820> think<00:02:44.090> these<00:02:44.180> are<00:02:44.560> an

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
a full-size bad I think these are an

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.650 
a full-size bad I think these are an
excellent<00:02:46.100> choice<00:02:46.430> because<00:02:47.120> they<00:02:47.240> do<00:02:47.300> pick<00:02:47.540> up

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
excellent choice because they do pick up

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.480 
excellent choice because they do pick up
very<00:02:47.870> well<00:02:47.930> they're<00:02:48.290> very<00:02:48.320> nice<00:02:48.620> they're
