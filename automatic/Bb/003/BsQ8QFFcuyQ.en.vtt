highly biological or highly a by-product
meal<00:02:16.120> we<00:02:17.120> believe<00:02:17.629> it's<00:02:17.930> best<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.099> store<00:02:19.400> both

meal we believe it's best to store both
quantities<00:02:20.390> in<00:02:20.540> open<00:02:20.840> air<00:02:20.989> not<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.650> seal<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.099> up

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
quantities in open air not to seal it up

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.190 
quantities in open air not to seal it up
so<00:02:22.519> it<00:02:22.790> does<00:02:23.090> not<00:02:23.209> get<00:02:23.450> sealed<00:02:23.720> up<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:23.989> shipped

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
so it does not get sealed up and shipped
