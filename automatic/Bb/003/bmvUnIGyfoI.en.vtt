00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 we already have in the previous videos 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.240
 seen as an action potential 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.950
 is formed and spreads but 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.990
 how does a nerve cell manage that? 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.700
 signal on a muscle fiber or one 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.070
 to transfer the other nerve cell to the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.480
 The process takes place at the synapses and 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.480
 how it works you can see now 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.680
 a synapse provides the connection 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.480
 between a nerve cell and one 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.670
 other nerve cell or his cell 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.140
 muscle cell or a glandular cell 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.000
 on one side we have one 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.710
 offshoot of the action of the excited 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.820
 Nerve cells also and button or 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.920
 called a button 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.050
 the membrane becomes this cent button 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.629
 practically called prix means so much 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.850
 I still present so hot nothing 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.160
 other than before the synapse the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.129
 opposite membrane becomes postina 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.170
 called table post stands for behind 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.300
 east from table means after 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.519
 synapse this membrane belongs to a 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.350
 because treat another nerve cell it 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.180
 But it can also be a part of a 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.979
 muscle cell of a sensory cell or 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.750
 a gland Zeller act between 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.970
 two membranes is the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.710
 debilitating synaptic cleft 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.740
 There are many small bubbles 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.490
 so-called vesicles with 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.920
 are filled with neurotransmitters 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.200
 neurotransmitters act as messengers 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.280
 between the two cells more later 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.650
 Now we have the framework 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.409
 clarified and show you now how the 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.610
 Stimulation proceeds on dmax the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.500
 excited cell is yes 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.009
 action potential hiked along 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.060
 that comes now at the end of the button to the 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.189
 Action potential shifts the membrane 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.840
 potential for the positive and thus ensures 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.399
 for that voltage-dependent 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.890
 open calcium channels 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.960
 So now first 2 plus flow 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.759
 From the outside, the rise of the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.799
 Calcium concentration in the end button 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.990
 causes some synaptic 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.070
 bubbles vesicles to the membrane 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.350
 move towards 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.170
 Once there, they connect with each other 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.850
 the membrane and pour their content 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.439
 neurotransmitters from the messengers 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.070
 were in the synaptic cleft 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.259
 set free and cross it in about 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.880
 0.1 milliseconds in the press 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.320
 now the high potential again 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.479
 Made and the calcium channels 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.490
 now they will join as well 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.590
 Calcium ions from the club 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.020
 pumped and it connects accordingly 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.700
 no more risks with the membrane because 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.100
 he just proved the calcium that they 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.170
 no calcium does not fuse vesicles 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.420
 at the cell membrane the messengers in the 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.580
 synaptic cleft attach in 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.440
 the time at special receptors of 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.300
 post kinetic membrane these 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.610
 receptors are so special and 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.930
 unique because they have ion channels 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.879
 are connected 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.010
 one forms and neurotransmitter so 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.170
 a receptor then simply opens 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.000
 of the channel and the ion flow a 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.730
 these are for example 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.739
 potassium and sodium channels as well 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.150
 at the emergence of a 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.639
 action potential following ions now 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.859
 So their chemical gradients are pouring 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:52.379
 there where fewer of them are the 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:54.389
 is called a plus ion pure and 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.340
 k plus johnen out I could do that now 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:58.290
 balance and do not mind for that 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.750
 with brat potential but is only flowing 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.209
 times more sodium ions than potassium 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.010
 I also get out of it because of ma addition 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.930
 because it can flow in where it is negative 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.239
 must have a positive charge yes 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.579
 This reverses the membrane potential 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.709
 at the post in optical membrane around and 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.840
 the mail dumps him the polarized 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.450
 exceeds this polarization the 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.439
 Threshold, it comes to a 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.419
 muscle contraction to form a 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:23.969
 new action potentials to hormone or 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:25.739
 secretly distributing and so on the 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:27.930
 but depends on what kind of 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.819
 cell the synapse belongs to the muscle cell 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.560
 Nerve cell sensory cells or glands 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.879
 Zell was just shown here 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.010
 exciting signal 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.930
 but there are also inhibitory signals there 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.060
 then the neurotransmitter only opens 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.979
 potassium or chloride channels and the post 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.169
 it drowns hyper polarized so 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:45.239
 even more negatively charged the 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:47.489
 But polarization can not be one too 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.049
 One in an action potential contraction 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.180
 and so on 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.280
 First, all incoming signal 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.379
 processed in the cell body so to speak 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.569
 just adds the hyper 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.340
 polarizing fans which gives like that 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.750
 works exactly see you the next 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.259
 videos of these plans is so tuned 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.639
 stay 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:04.079
 So we come back to the 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.030
 neurotransmitters in the 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.590
 synaptic cleft move back and forth 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.870
 and thus several channels 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.790
 they can open one after the other 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.859
 so long until she either completely recovered 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.019
 to be recorded by the press or 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.489
 split by a specific enzyme 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.470
 Be like the deactivation 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.430
 works and what an enzyme it is 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.530
 to act depends on 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.750
 neurotransmitter from this process is 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.729
 very important because without resumption 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.409
 or degradation, the messengers would be much 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.970
 too long in the synaptic cleft space 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.949
 wander and never stop 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.110
 ion channels to open it's me then 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.090
 to a so-called permanent excitement 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.470
 Items of messengers can then 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.060
 again in saint buttons 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.469
 taken and then back to 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.090
 complete neurotransmitters 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:42.840
 put together and in a like her 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.070
 packed 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.810
 Naturally, that will be the case too 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.699
 Bosniak calm potential again 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.800
 made and then the fun of 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.570
 going ahead depending on the synapse is there 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.760
 different neurotransmitters and 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.470
 receptors for this the more messengers 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.500
 there are the more diverse 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.889
 are the possibilities of the 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.510
 exchange of information between the 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.729
 By the way, there are also two cells 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.220
 receptors which are not directly ion channels 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.050
 open but the other signal chains 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.760
 in the cell push that can to 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.310
 example cause the synapse 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.650
 changed how it becomes more efficient 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.479
 Such receptors are often next to the 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.889
 others are not just different 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.930
 neurotransmitter but also 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.520
 Nerve drugs or drugs can 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.290
 Sexy transmission at the synapse 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.000
 affect how that works and 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.919
 what kind of effects that have on us 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.389
 you can see in this video soon 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.560
 video of this playlist you can see how 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.360
 previously mentioned like that 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.070
 Information processing in the cell body 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.660
 this video works so well 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.180
 just keep walking without clicking away 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.860
 and automatically gets to the video 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.930
 would you still have so many videos about 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.520
 the nervous system want because the topic 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.270
 there is no video writes us in the 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.530
 Comments 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.970
 when I liked the video and 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.740
 helped us thumbs down 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.630
 above and shows your classmates 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.500
 I'm sure you're grateful as well as three 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.500
 people until then and
