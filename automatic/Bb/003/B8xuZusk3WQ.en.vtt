00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.100 
the roms out then you take the two
wrongs<00:04:48.370> out<00:04:48.640> here<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.210> this<00:04:49.300> plugs<00:04:49.660> into<00:04:49.900> the

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
wrongs out here and this plugs into the

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.080 
wrongs out here and this plugs into the
two<00:04:50.290> rom<00:04:50.560> socket<00:04:51.220> that's<00:04:51.430> why<00:04:51.640> it<00:04:51.700> says<00:04:51.880> the

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
two rom socket that's why it says the

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.480 
two rom socket that's why it says the
socket<00:04:52.540> empty<00:04:52.840> and<00:04:52.990> there's<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:53.980> character

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
socket empty and there's the character

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.790 
socket empty and there's the character
ROM<00:04:54.700> and<00:04:54.910> then<00:04:55.090> this<00:04:55.270> connection<00:04:55.870> look<00:04:56.650> at

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
ROM and then this connection look at

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.470 
ROM and then this connection look at
that<00:04:56.980> nice<00:04:57.790> and<00:04:59.340> small<00:05:00.340> and<00:05:01.000> it<00:05:01.120> works

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
that nice and small and it works

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.010 
that nice and small and it works
terrific<00:05:02.040> this<00:05:03.040> chip<00:05:03.490> here<00:05:04.000> holds<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:04.810> high

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
terrific this chip here holds the high

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.950 
terrific this chip here holds the high
scores<00:05:05.530> and<00:05:05.710> lets<00:05:06.070> you<00:05:06.220> continue<00:05:06.700> so<00:05:07.690> even

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
scores and lets you continue so even

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.810 
scores and lets you continue so even
when<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.140> game<00:05:08.440> turns<00:05:08.770> off<00:05:09.010> that<00:05:09.250> chip<00:05:09.550> it's<00:05:09.730> a

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
when the game turns off that chip it's a

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.270 
when the game turns off that chip it's a
custom<00:05:10.240> chip<00:05:10.510> though<00:05:10.750> if<00:05:11.260> that<00:05:11.500> ship<00:05:11.740> goes<00:05:11.980> bad

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
custom chip though if that ship goes bad

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.090 
custom chip though if that ship goes bad
that's<00:05:12.669> the<00:05:12.940> end<00:05:13.120> of<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.450> board

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
that's the end of the board

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.190 
that's the end of the board
but<00:05:15.100> that<00:05:15.700> chip<00:05:16.030> holds<00:05:16.330> all<00:05:16.450> the<00:05:16.540> custom<00:05:16.930> stuff

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
but that chip holds all the custom stuff

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.680 
but that chip holds all the custom stuff
and<00:05:17.380> now<00:05:17.470> we<00:05:17.620> also<00:05:17.830> changed<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.690> capacitors

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
and now we also changed the capacitors

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.320 
and now we also changed the capacitors
on<00:05:19.840> the<00:05:19.960> board<00:05:20.200> the<00:05:20.560> high-voltage<00:05:20.890> capacitors

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
on the board the high-voltage capacitors

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.450 
on the board the high-voltage capacitors
and<00:05:22.330> I<00:05:22.419> thought<00:05:22.630> 5<00:05:22.930> volt<00:05:23.169> capacitors<00:05:23.830> in<00:05:24.340> the

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
and I thought 5 volt capacitors in the

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.120 
and I thought 5 volt capacitors in the
12<00:05:24.730> volt<00:05:24.910> capacitor<00:05:25.060> so<00:05:25.780> this<00:05:26.500> board<00:05:26.800> will<00:05:26.950> run

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
12 volt capacitor so this board will run

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.460 
12 volt capacitor so this board will run
for<00:05:27.400> another<00:05:27.490> hundred<00:05:27.910> and<00:05:28.060> fifty<00:05:28.480> years<00:05:28.780> it's

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
for another hundred and fifty years it's

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.570 
for another hundred and fifty years it's
got<00:05:29.740> a<00:05:30.210> 4900<00:05:31.210> a<00:05:31.480> wells<00:05:32.350> corner<00:05:32.830> that<00:05:33.400> we've

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
got a 4900 a wells corner that we've

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.870 
got a 4900 a wells corner that we've
also<00:05:33.790> put<00:05:34.120> new<00:05:34.240> caps<00:05:34.570> in<00:05:35.160> this<00:05:36.160> baby<00:05:36.430> is<00:05:36.669> ready

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880
