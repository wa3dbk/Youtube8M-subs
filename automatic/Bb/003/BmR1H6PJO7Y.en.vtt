can I see improvement and can we learn
from<00:01:32.250> our<00:01:32.399> mistakes<00:01:32.460> not<00:01:33.390> continue<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.929> make

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
from our mistakes not continue to make

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.410 
really looking for yeah we'd like to go
nuts<00:02:10.679> we'll<00:02:11.579> figure<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:11.910> out<00:02:11.970> as<00:02:12.180> we<00:02:12.299> go

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
nuts we'll figure that out as we go

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.780 
nuts we'll figure that out as we go
hopefully<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.200> weather<00:02:13.350> cooperated<00:02:14.069> at<00:02:14.549> some

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
hopefully the weather cooperated at some

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.160 
hopefully the weather cooperated at some
point<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.060> time<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:15.390> year<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:15.930> know<00:02:16.019> we

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
point in time this year you know we

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.240 
point in time this year you know we
could<00:02:16.319> we'll<00:02:16.440> get<00:02:16.590> some<00:02:16.739> nice<00:02:16.859> days<00:02:17.010> out<00:02:17.220> here

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
could we'll get some nice days out here

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.120 
could we'll get some nice days out here
so<00:02:17.579> I<00:02:18.450> think<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:19.049> get<00:02:19.200> X<00:02:19.440> amount<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.799> rain<00:02:19.950> days

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
so I think you get X amount of rain days

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.590 
so I think you get X amount of rain days
here<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.549> we've<00:02:20.730> had<00:02:20.760> them<00:02:21.030> all<00:02:21.120> so<00:02:21.329> I<00:02:21.359> would

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
here and we've had them all so I would

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.849 
here and we've had them all so I would
imagine<00:02:21.959> it's<00:02:22.230> got<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.410> be<00:02:22.470> sunny<00:02:22.680> for<00:02:22.829> the

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
imagine it's got to be sunny for the

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.650 
imagine it's got to be sunny for the
rest<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:23.130> time<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:23.579> we'll<00:02:24.030> figure<00:02:24.239> out<00:02:24.359> figure

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
rest of time so we'll figure out figure

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:33.720 
rest of time so we'll figure out figure
out<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> time<00:02:25.049> we<00:02:25.200> get<00:02:25.290> out<00:02:25.410> in<00:02:25.530> there

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
close to the same amount of reps you

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.800 
close to the same amount of reps you
know<00:02:47.920> when<00:02:48.040> you<00:02:48.129> get<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.459> season<00:02:48.879> our

rotations<00:02:50.349> a<00:02:50.410> little<00:02:50.590> bit<00:02:50.709> different<00:02:51.010> the

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
rotations a little bit different the

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.259 
rotations a little bit different the
ones<00:02:51.280> are<00:02:51.400> in<00:02:51.489> a<00:02:51.519> little<00:02:51.730> bit<00:02:51.849> longer<00:02:52.030> but

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
ones are in a little bit longer but

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.369 
ones are in a little bit longer but
they're<00:02:52.390> in<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.569> spring<00:02:52.810> we've<00:02:52.959> always<00:02:53.140> gone

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
they're in the spring we've always gone

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.680 
they're in the spring we've always gone
you<00:02:54.099> know<00:02:54.220> sets<00:02:54.819> a<00:02:54.910> four<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:55.360> four<00:02:55.569> were<00:02:55.629> the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
you know sets a four so four were the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.970 
you know sets a four so four were the
ones<00:02:55.900> forward<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.260> twos<00:02:56.410> for<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.739> threes<00:02:56.950> and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
ones forward the twos for the threes and

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.780 
ones forward the twos for the threes and
it<00:02:57.190> doesn't<00:02:57.400> matter<00:02:57.549> who's<00:02:57.700> playing

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
it doesn't matter who's playing

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.640 
it doesn't matter who's playing
quarterback<00:02:58.269> so<00:02:58.510> it's<00:02:58.959> really<00:02:59.140> no<00:02:59.319> different

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
quarterback so it's really no different

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.960 
quarterback so it's really no different
than<00:02:59.709> it<00:02:59.829> was<00:02:59.920> last<00:03:00.129> spring<00:03:00.340> or<00:03:00.579> any<00:03:00.700> spring

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
we happen to January before it's all

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:40.140 
we happen to January before it's all
about<00:05:34.000> moving<00:05:34.240> forward<00:05:34.630> so<00:05:38.370> it<00:05:39.370> it's<00:05:39.909> all

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
about moving forward so it it's all

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.459 
about moving forward so it it's all
built<00:05:40.389> in<00:05:40.539> within<00:05:40.719> the<00:05:40.870> good<00:05:41.080> question<00:05:41.349> I'll

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:41.469 
built in within the good question I'll

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:42.540 
built in within the good question I'll
built<00:05:41.650> them<00:05:41.800> within<00:05:41.949> the<00:05:42.069> practice<00:05:42.430> so

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
built them within the practice so

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.189 
built them within the practice so
there's<00:05:42.729> certainly<00:05:43.389> competition<00:05:43.900> periods

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 
there's certainly competition periods

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:45.390 
there's certainly competition periods
within<00:05:44.349> there<00:05:44.500> but<00:05:44.650> there's<00:05:44.830> also<00:05:44.889> teaching

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
within there but there's also teaching

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.860 
within there but there's also teaching
opportunities<00:05:45.969> within<00:05:46.270> the<00:05:46.330> practice<00:05:46.690> so

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
opportunities within the practice so

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.839 
opportunities within the practice so
every<00:05:47.560> practice<00:05:47.740> has<00:05:48.099> a<00:05:48.130> combination<00:05:48.729> of

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 
every practice has a combination of

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.080 
every practice has a combination of
teaching<00:05:49.300> and<00:05:50.310> competition<00:05:51.310> so<00:05:51.490> you<00:05:51.940> know<00:05:52.029> if

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
teaching and competition so you know if

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.399 
teaching and competition so you know if
we're<00:05:52.210> doing<00:05:52.300> one-on-ones<00:05:52.810> or<00:05:52.960> three<00:05:53.110> on<00:05:53.199> twos

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:53.409 
we're doing one-on-ones or three on twos

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:55.110 
we're doing one-on-ones or three on twos
with<00:05:53.680> its<00:05:53.860> old<00:05:53.979> line<00:05:54.130> versus<00:05:54.460> D<00:05:54.610> line<00:05:54.789> or<00:05:54.969> wide

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
with its old line versus D line or wide

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.029 
with its old line versus D line or wide
outs<00:05:55.300> versus<00:05:55.690> D<00:05:56.289> B's<00:05:56.469> that's<00:05:56.710> a<00:05:56.770> competitive

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 
outs versus D B's that's a competitive

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:59.369 
outs versus D B's that's a competitive
period<00:05:57.550> but<00:05:58.449> there's<00:05:58.599> also<00:05:58.779> schemes<00:05:59.229> that

00:05:59.369 --> 00:05:59.379 
period but there's also schemes that

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:01.320 
period but there's also schemes that
have<00:05:59.440> to<00:05:59.650> be<00:05:59.680> taught<00:05:59.979> so<00:06:00.279> there's<00:06:01.180> different

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
have to be taught so there's different

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.670 
have to be taught so there's different
segments<00:06:01.840> of<00:06:01.900> practice<00:06:02.229> that<00:06:02.379> are<00:06:02.469> teaching

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
segments of practice that are teaching

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.689 
segments of practice that are teaching
opportunities<00:06:03.340> and<00:06:03.400> there's<00:06:03.580> different

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
opportunities and there's different

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:04.619 
opportunities and there's different
segments<00:06:04.120> of<00:06:04.180> practice<00:06:04.449> that<00:06:04.479> our

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:04.629 
segments of practice that our

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:07.830 
segments of practice that our
competition<00:06:05.110> opportunities
