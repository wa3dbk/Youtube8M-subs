00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.440
 hello my name is rina I'm doing 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.929
 mutually engaged in promotion 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.160
 given franchise for the regions of Russia and so 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.289
 how are you one of the first 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.779
 partners who was running this 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.580
 direction would you like 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.800
 shared with potential franchises 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.250
 experience told how it all goes with you 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.220
 and I think it will help 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.109
 additional pool of partners if we 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.790
 write the record will be posted on the Internet to 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.550
 other partners also saw I think not 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.460
 mind you fly 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.770
 please when you started as you found 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.480
 In general, this company started when 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.590
 how much time do you have? 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.050
 work on time we work 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.289
 about a year in August about 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.270
 quick start 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.010
 I met my future partners 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.250
 completely different business 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.559
 I used to work in another field in 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.660
 this was mainly due to the market 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.369
 goods that is buying sale and so 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.790
 here is the standard for traditional business 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.950
 my partner who sold me a franchise 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.610
 offered me this kind of business let's say 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.159
 so a little non-standard but connected 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.720
 which service sector is first of all what 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.729
 I was interested in what this market 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.259
 services 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.470
 because in my opinion today the market 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.270
 services more promising than goods but 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.500
 again in my opinion you are judging by 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:39.479
 statistics here again drew this 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.640
 business that it seemed to me like 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.290
 to say it is difficult to say that 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.380
 Does it seem at first glance because I 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.600
 I think that you need to work areas that 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.380
 seem complicated because there are fewer 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.240
 competition like nick and and more money 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.219
 because people are usually afraid 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.140
 mess with some weird 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.909
 things it seems at first glance 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.439
 complicated 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.730
 here it is worth a little just to study 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.100
 grasp pick up sit down correctly 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.600
 in the approach the most important thing and everything in 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.030
 principle, you can work on the thumb 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.420
 here and made my partner he gave me 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.330
 a system that is, that did not go according 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.570
 means the franchise flutters passed 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.670
 training during the year that is every 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.770
 day, every day, eat there at least 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.480
 of necessity we call up 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.210
 questions ie permanent audit 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.800
 consulting and so on that is all 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.890
 works fine that is, support is on 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.650
 permanent questions in principle which 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.300
 you arise you are discussing promptly 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.550
 until perfect because not put 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.590
 on the man who sold the franchise too 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.980
 interested in developing additional 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.480
 offices and in unwinding your brahm 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.430
 as I understand you from the beginning, experience is not 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.300
 metrology and certification was not 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.710
 Essentially you're more salesman than metrologist 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.180
 absolutely no experience 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.440
 was again a game for me it seemed 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.200
 everything is very difficult 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.450
 when my partner explained everything to me 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.210
 Basically, I decided to try again. 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.030
 why I was inspired by that business because 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.280
 what is the minimum investment needed and 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.340
 minimum risk zone as opposed to 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.890
 the market for goods seven customers 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.420
 how do they come to you internet themselves 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.870
 there is this can tell a little bit 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.450
 that is, we try to be placed in all 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.880
 the media that is the usual cold market 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.580
 sales let's say yes cold calls 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.739
 meeting calls 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.370
 some kind of warm internet contacts in 1 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.260
 page 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.459
 this again is all in this franchise in 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.140
 learning that is directly giving 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.060
 working methods 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:46.310
 step-by-step actions to direct 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.320
 sell a franchise and if a person is looking 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.100
 do it till if he will 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.380
 step by step perform all stages of the franchise then 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.540
 profit guaranteed one hundred percent here 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.510
 if we talk about profits if not a secret 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.890
 at least in general figures having already worked 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.370
 there about 8 months 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.290
 which example is the opposite you achieved it 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.180
 what do you see potential when we what 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.110
 still so well and the potential to speak 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.970
 complicated there is all for 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.820
 it's from how to work of course so 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.370
 that is, they say that as soon as immediately 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.610
 immediately opened the roller and immediately went 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.600
 An example of course was needed 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.090
 let's say to turn out the market 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.830
 turn out customers to look for their 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.750
 the audience let's say it's all to spend 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.760
 time she is right and we went out literally 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.590
 in three months, that's because 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.840
 there is almost no payback here 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.270
 no buy let's say so little that's not 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:43.550
 need to invest a lot of money here 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:45.800
 but a profit personal order may 200 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.800
 thousand rubles 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:53.480
 it all depends on how intense 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:56.240
 work but essentially if you opened up 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:00.110
 under the new year there is a sin in the fall 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:03.320
 last year and go out on such on there 34 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.570
 months for and if you compare trading I 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.150
 for a long time even this looks very much 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.919
 very bad for sure but that's why we we 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.300
 moving forward samurai going 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.169
 open additional offices 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.970
 that is, it is such a market demand for services 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.490
 which will try a permanent mouth 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.510
 actual here we have a growing number 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.990
 manufacturers 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.640
 a growing number of importers and permanent here 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.700
 this all requires documentation 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.169
 what are we actually doing noisy you 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.510
 the city is a small half million 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.860
 half a million people 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.140
 but we have a lot of manufacturers 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.979
 so this city on interested us 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:41.479
 basically all work on those 720 leagues 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.390
 play with the regulations this machines and 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.950
 equipments here are 70 percent eight 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.680
 percent production therefore here 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.790
 a lot of big concentration 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.880
 manufacturer so we are here tight 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.560
 works great 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.390
 salesmen how much salespeople 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.669
 read 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:01.130
 sales manager we have in the state 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.300
 one salesman of this is quite enough in 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.970
 principle but now we are going 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.480
 hire more employees here because 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.580
 we can not cope 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.530
 with the current volume, you need to expand 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.750
 staff and build momentum 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.370
 Excellent Timur I think this information 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.680
 will be enough for people who 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.510
 just starting thank you very much in 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.910
 further if you will not mind here 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.710
 It is this format that we endure so as not to 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.780
 transfer your contacts let's say so 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.880
 you are constantly disturbed and when will we 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.800
 you will have time to interview you 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.050
 your some news and spread them 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.750
 On the Internet, good problems are always 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.750
 please big meeting all good
