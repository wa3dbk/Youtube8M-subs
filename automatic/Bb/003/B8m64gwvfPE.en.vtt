00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.330 
that just peels right off and we've got
the<00:02:37.980> case<00:02:39.560> it's<00:02:40.560> actually<00:02:40.650> heavier<00:02:41.130> than<00:02:41.250> I

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
the case it's actually heavier than I

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.620 
the case it's actually heavier than I
thought<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.520> would<00:02:41.610> be<00:02:41.790> start<00:02:42.180> with<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.420> case

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
thought it would be start with the case

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.180 
thought it would be start with the case
so<00:02:43.170> I'm<00:02:43.260> going<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.440> take<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:43.740> little<00:02:44.010> clip

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
so I'm going to take this little clip

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.210 
so I'm going to take this little clip
thing<00:02:44.490> anyhow<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.420> loop<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.890> guess<00:02:47.070> you

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
thing anyhow the loop and I guess you

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.020 
thing anyhow the loop and I guess you
can<00:02:47.340> basically<00:02:47.520> get<00:02:48.450> on<00:02:48.600> there<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:50.000> it's<00:02:51.000> a

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
can basically get on there so it's a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.000 
can basically get on there so it's a
nice<00:02:51.120> hard<00:02:51.390> case<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.930> don't<00:02:52.530> think<00:02:52.740> you<00:02:52.860> can

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
nice hard case I don't think you can

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.730 
nice hard case I don't think you can
keep<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.580> wires<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:55.640> na<00:02:56.640> padded<00:02:57.540> nice

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
keep the wires and the na padded nice

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.530 
keep the wires and the na padded nice
okay<00:02:58.740> now<00:02:59.070> I<00:02:59.100> like<00:02:59.370> basically<00:03:00.060> just<00:03:00.209> go<00:03:00.360> into

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
okay now I like basically just go into

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.260 
okay now I like basically just go into
the<00:03:00.630> pill<00:03:00.780> comes<00:03:01.770> in<00:03:01.920> black<00:03:02.100> red<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.790> white

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
the pill comes in black red and white

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.970 
the pill comes in black red and white
first<00:03:04.230> when<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.530> get<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:04.740> get<00:03:04.860> the

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
first when you get it you get the

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.220 
first when you get it you get the
sticker<00:03:05.480> basically<00:03:06.480> just<00:03:06.630> how<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.840> use<00:03:07.050> it

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
sticker basically just how to use it

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.960

take<00:03:07.830> on<00:03:07.950> my<00:03:08.040> phone<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.220> compare<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.610> the

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
take on my phone and compare it the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.460 
take on my phone and compare it the
sizes<00:03:09.560> that's<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.709> iphone<00:03:10.980> 5<00:03:11.780> vs<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.900> pill
