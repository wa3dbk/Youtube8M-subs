basic problems first problem is that the

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.399 
basic problems first problem is that the

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
heel is too far forward this is the case

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.039 
heel is too far forward this is the case
the<00:02:39.340> line<00:02:39.609> of<00:02:39.849> the<00:02:39.939> kink<00:02:40.209> will<00:02:40.420> not<00:02:40.629> travel

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
the line of the kink will not travel

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.309 
the line of the kink will not travel
this<00:02:41.889> way<00:02:42.129> it<00:02:42.370> will<00:02:42.519> travel<00:02:42.879> this<00:02:43.750> way<00:02:43.989> because

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
this way it will travel this way because

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.860 
this way it will travel this way because
the<00:02:44.439> target<00:02:44.680> is<00:02:44.980> here<00:02:45.310> or<00:02:45.879> the<00:02:46.000> kick<00:02:46.329> will

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
out in straight line the way to do that

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.089 
out in straight line the way to do that
is<00:03:15.400> not<00:03:15.609> to<00:03:15.819> start<00:03:16.060> with<00:03:16.150> a<00:03:16.299> chamber<00:03:16.859> and<00:03:17.859> I

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
is not to start with a chamber and I

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.979 
is not to start with a chamber and I
have<00:03:18.310> never<00:03:18.519> seen<00:03:18.790> anybody<00:03:19.000> perform<00:03:19.629> the<00:03:19.840> way

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
opinion this is the most correct way to

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.240 
opinion this is the most correct way to
learn<00:03:23.949> inside<00:03:24.280> them<00:03:25.560> what<00:03:26.560> most<00:03:26.799> people<00:03:27.159> would

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
learn inside them what most people would

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.659 
learn inside them what most people would
do<00:03:27.430> is<00:03:27.579> I<00:03:27.699> would<00:03:27.729> show<00:03:28.060> your<00:03:28.299> chamber<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.669> they

do is I would show your chamber and they
would<00:03:30.819> hope<00:03:31.150> I'm<00:03:31.959> talking<00:03:32.439> that<00:03:32.590> most<00:03:32.889> doctors

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
would hope I'm talking that most doctors

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.210 
would hope I'm talking that most doctors
that<00:03:34.359> decide<00:03:34.840> it<00:03:35.139> will<00:03:35.349> come<00:03:35.620> out<00:03:35.799> and

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220

straight<00:03:37.209> line<00:03:38.129> okay

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
straight line okay

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.869 
straight line okay
the<00:03:41.409> other<00:03:41.620> way<00:03:41.859> to<00:03:41.919> do<00:03:42.220> it<00:03:42.250> is<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.699> use<00:03:42.849> a

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
the other way to do it is to use a

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.960 
the other way to do it is to use a
little<00:03:43.150> device<00:03:43.419> I<00:03:43.659> have<00:03:43.840> here<00:03:44.229> and<00:03:44.819> start<00:03:45.819> with

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
little device I have here and start with

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.099 
little device I have here and start with
a<00:03:46.000> straight<00:03:46.359> leg<00:03:46.689> and<00:03:47.069> then<00:03:48.069> pull<00:03:48.400> it<00:03:48.519> in<00:03:49.109> and

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
a straight leg and then pull it in and

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.860 
a straight leg and then pull it in and
so<00:03:50.319> what<00:03:50.470> I<00:03:50.500> have<00:03:50.769> here<00:03:51.040> basically<00:03:51.280> in<00:03:52.150> the

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
so what I have here basically in the

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.920 
so what I have here basically in the
political<00:03:53.229> line<00:03:53.739> it<00:03:54.180> could<00:03:55.180> be<00:03:55.269> drawn<00:03:55.599> on<00:03:55.840> the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
political line it could be drawn on the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.559 
political line it could be drawn on the
wall<00:03:56.340> its<00:03:57.340> longest<00:03:57.729> measured<00:03:58.299> to<00:03:58.449> be

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
wall its longest measured to be

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.319 
wall its longest measured to be
perfectly<00:03:59.199> vertical<00:03:59.769> it<00:03:59.979> could<00:04:00.729> be<00:04:00.879> a<00:04:00.909> stripe

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
perfectly vertical it could be a stripe

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.050 
perfectly vertical it could be a stripe
like<00:04:01.540> I<00:04:01.599> have<00:04:01.930> here<00:04:02.290> could<00:04:02.739> be<00:04:02.889> a<00:04:02.919> good<00:04:03.639> mansion

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060
