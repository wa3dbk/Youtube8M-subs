00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.600
 9 minutes 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:14.869
 It's a lonely island Today is a ball on a ball 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:17.049
 How to hit home run Deliver points by learning this from Hiroshi Osamu 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.049
 I will 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:29.230
 But I was the saying goes Uchikata if its because if You're way that the secret to carry the ball 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.039
 This is the thought that I think we fall in full and well get to image the Uchikata of Ochiai's 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.690
 But 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:39.649
 First of all it is a feature of Softball ball I This intends Well soft as a ball of everyone you Zonchi 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.670
 It's when you hit it If the swing speed is increased to a certain extent, it will still be a great deal of crushing 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:46.850
 Right 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:52.670
 It is assumed that there are many pop fries where power can not be transmitted firmly because of being crushed . 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:55.680
 This is the feature of a softball, but to overcome this feature 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.980
 It is a ball and the bat of contact time 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:04.070
 This kind of swing image is needed to make this longer 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:10.510
 That's why the bat's trajectory is very important. 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:16.330
 It is almost the same kind of fatigue with the trajectory of the ball is to say that the trajectory of the bat 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:18.710
 Still the same straight line above but I'm not a straight line of large, such Te collinear Well swing 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.830
 It's been a long time 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:29.010
 I think that I need to do something like that 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:33.430
 Well, as a contradictory way of hitting it, for example, in an extremely large downswing like radish cutting 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:37.690
 After Toka Toka or an upper swing of extreme customer Attari Is It 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:42.210
 So I am batting follow-through is small Pattsun that would exceed the wrist 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:47.670
 I believe in the wind called undesirable as the trajectory of the bat used to go 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:51.150
 Point of him to please take a look so I will explain in a blog about 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:56.009
