00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.799
 new video of how they saw it in the 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.440
 title 20 things that maybe you did not know about 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.719
 new grand theft auto 5 at number 1 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.969
 we have the neuquinos who are now 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.160
 These new modifications of the vehicle 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.410
 which lets us attach in about 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.109
 small under close just below the 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.560
 vehicle which releases luminosity the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.510
 number 2 is the kinematics button that 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.570
 now it's going to be the b button in case of 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.660
 be in xbox one and circle in case of 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.120
 be in playstation 4 number 3 has been 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.059
 added that neither smoking and famous 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.090
 danielson which is a new station of 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.829
 radios and welcomes the radio of the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.329
 Saints number 4 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.670
 the vehicles that came out of the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.010
 past celestial are back and they are going to 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.280
 be located where you had them 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.260
 regularity number 5 the game menu is 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.350
 totally different from the one we had 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.070
 previously and it was greatly improved number 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.860
 6 when our character 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.710
 and some glasses a helmet or anything 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.860
 that can change our view you 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.500
 you may notice that the view is going to 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.420
 modify how the lenses are 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.430
 suppose we have some lenses that 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.100
 the glasses as orange we 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.410
 we will see through the lenses with that 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.540
 orange tint as if it were a helmet 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.580
 real in case they have a helmet they go 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.270
 to see the edges milestones and many things 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.940
 plus number 7 there are new shares of 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.259
 regeneration as it were, suppose 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.910
 now how is the first mode 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.250
 person let's see as if it were a 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.759
 type of shooter which is pretty 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.710
 good number 8 this new great car 5 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.320
 with has many new songs 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.020
 to give a better touch to the game and 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.869
 give a fashionable touch number 9 the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.899
 protagonists of the story mode now in 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.910
 the minimap radar is going to appear 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.680
 vehicle as we have it today 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.320
 in big roll 25 online 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.080
 suppose when this trevor is what 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.640
 I know in the puticlub right on the radar 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.320
 your vehicle that is the 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.970
 red truck and I think that these 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.680
 There is something that 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.530
 pretty good since these characters 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.740
 they have their own vehicles number 10 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.050
 the map radar of big auto 5 the 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.170
 which is just below the screen is going to 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.030
 have a remastering totally in 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.100
 good because because now instead of that 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.410
 let's see it as a type of base square 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.240
 a 3d type square which is going to 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.610
 allow to see just as if we 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.620
 we were moving with him and he's going to 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.860
 have a small transparency which 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.990
 you are quite well No. 11 all 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.150
 what is doing of nature such 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.700
 How can the grass be the sand? 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.190
 asphalt and many more things are going to have 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.320
 a totally remastered touch in 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.170
 special the desert since the textures 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.750
 they are completely different and the truth 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.850
 now they look much more realistic 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.240
 it means that the graphics have improved 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.580
 in a 100% number 12 the form of 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.800
 shoot through the windshield in 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.360
 first person is totally different from 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.830
 what we have today because I eat 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.810
 they will know now we can only 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.190
 shoot through the windows and now already 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.900
 we can shoot for what they are being 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.240
 the windshield which I see is 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.950
 perfect and is pretty well I do not know 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.990
 if we can shoot for part of the 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.310
 rear windshield but I guess that 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.460
 it must also be able and must be seen 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.830
 spectacular number 13 the doge the 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.810
 stallion and the plis is compact are 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.490
 totally back and I think it 's 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.170
 something that is pretty good since here 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.540
 we are realizing that rockstar 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.160
 games is giving us back vehicles that 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.020
 we had in previous rooms and you have to 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.240
 expect other vehicles to want 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.490
 include this with the time that I eat 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.640
 they will know they will be taking new ones of leces but 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.830
 it will only be a matter of waiting number 14 the 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.990
 protagonist characters when they are not 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.610
 doing nothing and are partners are going to 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.490
 make new actions because as you 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.260
 you can remember in a big way 4 niko 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.820
 bellic when he did nothing he scratched 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.800
 the eggs what gave me a lot 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.870
 laughter and the characters were doing 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.510
 many things you have to wait to see what 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.030
 will make these new characters when not 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.580
 they are doing absolutely nothing number 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.770
 15 the damage to the vehicles has been 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:14.000
 completely modified and are now 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.380
 pretty good numbers 16 the focus effect 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.959
 of sight be 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.720
 has added to this game room 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.880
 number 17 the phones of the 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.800
 protagonists have been totally 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.840
 remastered and now we can use 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.000
 as if we saw through the 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.500
 hand so to speak and now our 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.170
 characters we can see how they are going 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.910
 moving the thumbs and now it looks like 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.070
 if they were truly totally 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.260
 first person which is pretty 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.210
 well since if we will see the touches that 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.030
 They give and give a touch much more 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.320
 realistic as if it were the telephone 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.270
 truly our plus that 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.610
 they have new detailed things like that 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.050
 they can have starry taps and 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.320
 some things more than the truth are left 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.120
 pretty good number 18 new fences 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.280
 roads for which they should 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.200
 They enjoy walking on the road and 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.450
 feel a much more realistic touch 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.390
 then we already have like new roads 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.680
 new things and this has been totally 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.600
 remastered more than anything are the 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.420
 small details which are going to 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.870
 give a better gaming experience 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:16.310
 number 19 the snap matic is totally 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.610
 remastered because now when 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.780
 our character takes a selfie 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.800
 we will see through what he is doing 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.900
 the screen 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.900
 cellular as if it were truly a 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.000
 true self and and number 20 the 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.340
 flags as we have today the one of 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.560
 countries have been added for the 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.389
 personalization of the vehicle and these 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.340
 were the 20 things I wanted to tell you 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.659
 Anyway, I know that a lot of people 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.479
 will be asking where he got 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:42.800
 all this and it was from a network forum and that 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.569
 the truth to me liked me enough 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.340
 I wanted to tell you these things 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:48.530
 tell me what do you think about all this 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.900
 what they expect from this game just missing 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.310
 just a few hours to have it and I 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.199
 I wanted to bring the ones for you 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.729
 they could appreciate and they could know of 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:57.500
 some little things I do not even now 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.569
 I could play but these from someone 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.949
 who already played it and wanted to write their 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:02.210
 anecdotes in the same way in the 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.590
