 Well that praise them second 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.780
 well that always some kind of reason 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.320
 we like a video audio quality 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.030
 video channel from time to 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.399
 I play anything anything 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.890
 Anybody, please, please leave us 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.990
 here in dissidence that then in the one of 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.479
 pinch of guilt absolutely nothing by 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.520
 parents for my channel there and in the first 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.320
 video that you see then you give the nonsense 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.450
 that you want the truth because to me I do not 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.729
 matter since the theme of light 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.229
 I have quite overcome but not 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.479
 It would be someone to eat tell them 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.039
 because of another person and well, because 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.119
 leaving a little aside the subject this 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.979
 initial 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.569
 we went on to comment a little bit what is 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.819
 this game that you are in our 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.740
 screens you are seeing a nuclear with 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.810
 the urban sniper in the canon 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.480
 what you have with you but the nuclear zone 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.190
 anyone 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.140
 the main data of this nuclear 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.150
 that make it a good game is 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.250
 good if what I am is with a 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.750
 sniper a weapon not easy to 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.570
 use and that the truth then requires 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.100
 of a minimum skill the second then 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.500
 which is a pretty fast time for 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.620
 make this type of weapon 3 minutes 45 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.210
 seconds and has the most characteristics 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.040
 that the truth makes it quite special 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:30.170
 and that is because 29 of the 30 casualties are with 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.240
 the barista and the other is with the knife 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.540
 combat since put in this game 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.520
 I was not using neither secondary nor c4 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.800
 which adds a lot of increase in 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.090
 the nuclear ones know continuators and 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.430
 one you see that is frantic what 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.230
 they cut not a single low because that 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.270
 I did not need the truth I'm all 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.670
 the non-stop time of killing those who 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.260
 respond and c's and then the star is 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.120
 departure is that then I at the beginning 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.190
 had put the 27 since it was a room 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.580
 pretty white but there was an uncle 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.630
 It was good and well 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.560
 I killed myself with a run of 24 97 I told him that 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.570
 let's play a little with the 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.160
 sniper and suddenly I put myself 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.500
 in nothing move connection I said 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.380
 let's go for this nuclear that the 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.990
 true then if I take it from my mother that 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.630
 comes very fast as a difficult weapon 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.050
 without blade and without secondary forgiveness 15 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.880
 4 and well then that and already leaving a 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.650
 little on the sidelines the game we will spend 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.210
 the theme of my channel that I upload to my channel 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.100
 I upload call of duty 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.140
 the main caprotti who seek me and 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.300
 who like a thousand subscribers is the 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.790
 call of duty black 2 of which is the 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.770
 more entertaining under my point of view 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.810
 but me what we are variety of call of 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.610
 duty and right now I'll start to climb 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.880
 something battlefield variety something 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.560
 fifa 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.450
 and good for various games that 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.580
 minecraft to the best you can like 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.210
 but the main thing in this channel 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.660
 call of duty and because that is what I 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.130
 like 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.310
 and it's what I like to see 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.890
 subscribers and well the truth is you go 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.210
 to see some pretty strange detail the 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.880
 heading then that will call you a little 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.190
 attention 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.660
 and well then that tell you that what 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.510
 was saying that every time he uses 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.740
 what I go up and then the income is 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.270
 character and variety Hague 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.300
 fish farming water afternoon to be 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.920
 current you and well then you see that no 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.440
 Kills us from an assault on a medal 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.070
 nuclear and that's why the video is 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.210
 It lasts about 20 seconds 15 more and it's because 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.310
 Well now I'm going to show you 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.140
 I really do not know to nuclear and I'm going to 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.520
 teach the medals and then pretty 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.520
 luck the truth is recording in that 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.110
 precise moment and good because 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.670
