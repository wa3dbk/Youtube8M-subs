better look so as you can see we have

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.620 
better look so as you can see we have
the<00:02:37.190> pattern<00:02:37.459> a<00:02:37.760> machine<00:02:38.090> that's<00:02:38.420> why<00:02:38.569> these

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
the pattern a machine that's why these

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.660 
the pattern a machine that's why these

back got button a very kind of cheap
chain<00:02:53.750> which<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.500> probably<00:02:55.280> replace<00:02:55.730> if<00:02:56.030> I'm

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
chain which I probably replace if I'm

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.470 
chain which I probably replace if I'm
honest<00:02:56.560> all<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.769> way<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.600> end<00:02:59.720> there<00:03:00.019> and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
honest all the way to the end there and

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.740 
honest all the way to the end there and
mechanism<00:03:02.480> opens<00:03:02.840> okay<00:03:03.970> now<00:03:04.970> parently<00:03:05.569> is<00:03:05.720> a

that<00:03:11.900> I'll<00:03:12.079> be<00:03:12.260> honest<00:03:12.530> it<00:03:12.769> does<00:03:13.010> have

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
that I'll be honest it does have

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.699 
that I'll be honest it does have
engraving<00:03:14.269> on<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.600> edges<00:03:14.870> there<00:03:15.170> don't<00:03:15.590> if

engraving on the edges there don't if

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.410 
engraving on the edges there don't if
