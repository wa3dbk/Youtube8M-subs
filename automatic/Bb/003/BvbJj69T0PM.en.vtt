quick<00:04:14.340> process<00:04:14.519> after<00:04:14.970> this<00:04:15.470> should<00:04:16.470> only

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
quick process after this should only

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.370

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
take a few minutes now this whole

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.730

process<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:19.799> very<00:04:20.070> quick<00:04:20.609> easy<00:04:20.940> simple<00:04:21.599> and<00:04:22.169> I'm

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
process a very quick easy simple and I'm

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.660 
process a very quick easy simple and I'm
very<00:04:23.400> useful<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:23.880> know<00:04:24.029> just<00:04:24.360> in<00:04:24.450> case<00:04:24.510> no

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
very useful to know just in case no

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.840 
very useful to know just in case no
so<00:04:26.450> let's<00:04:26.690> just<00:04:26.840> wait<00:04:26.990> till<00:04:27.020> it<00:04:27.200> starts<00:04:27.500> up<00:04:30.850> and

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
so let's just wait till it starts up and

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.930 
so let's just wait till it starts up and
when<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:32.960> does<00:04:33.200> start<00:04:33.410> up<00:04:33.860> um<00:04:34.190> it<00:04:34.520> should<00:04:34.910> be

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
when it does start up um it should be

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.880 
when it does start up um it should be
like<00:04:35.120> when<00:04:35.690> you<00:04:35.720> first<00:04:36.080> bought<00:04:36.290> it<00:04:36.350> all<00:04:36.650> the
