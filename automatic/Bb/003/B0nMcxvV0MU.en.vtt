though<00:01:20.700> i<00:01:21.000> mean<00:01:21.240> i<00:01:21.619> guess<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.799> works<00:01:23.040> but

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
though i mean i guess it works but

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.810 
though i mean i guess it works but
there's<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:24.840> much<00:01:25.640> features<00:01:26.640> to

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
there's so much features to

there's so much features to
start<00:01:27.119> with<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:28.229> know<00:01:28.320> there's<00:01:28.560> even

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
start with but you know there's even

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.219 
start with but you know there's even
matter<00:01:29.009> anymore<00:01:29.130> really<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:30.060> haven't<00:01:30.990> tried

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
matter anymore really I haven't tried

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.100 
matter anymore really I haven't tried
without<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.100> can't<00:01:32.369> recall<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.880> but

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
without it so I can't recall it but

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.249 
without it so I can't recall it but
anyway<00:01:34.400> that's<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.030> as<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:36.930> see<00:01:36.990> I'm

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
anyway that's it and as you can see I'm

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.280 
anyway that's it and as you can see I'm
running<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:38.119> four<00:01:39.119> hundred<00:01:39.270> strap<00:01:39.780> instead

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
running on a four hundred strap instead

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.530 
running on a four hundred strap instead
of<00:01:40.409> 333<00:01:41.030> when<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.060> flashed<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.750> O<00:01:42.950> 906<00:01:44.240> BIOS<00:01:45.240> I

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
of 333 when I flashed the O 906 BIOS I

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.749 
of 333 when I flashed the O 906 BIOS I
found<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.200> had<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.470> four<00:01:46.770> hundred<00:01:46.890> strap<00:01:47.750> so

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
found that I had a four hundred strap so

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.760 
found that I had a four hundred strap so
if<00:01:50.759> I'm<00:01:50.939> thinking<00:01:51.299> correctly<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.170> believe<00:01:52.259> that

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
if I'm thinking correctly I believe that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.090 
if I'm thinking correctly I believe that
gives<00:01:53.040> me<00:01:53.479> I'm<00:01:54.479> thinking<00:01:55.140> looser<00:01:55.560> Northbridge

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
gives me I'm thinking looser Northbridge

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.569 
gives me I'm thinking looser Northbridge

and<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.200> like<00:02:54.379> how<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:54.590> uh<00:02:54.769> manually<00:02:55.760> into<00:02:56.120> your

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
and I like how you uh manually into your

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.509 
and I like how you uh manually into your
ratio<00:02:56.659> so<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.319> CPM<00:02:57.859> 0.0<00:02:59.379> nice<00:03:00.409> you<00:03:00.920> can<00:03:01.129> enter

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
ratio so the CPM 0.0 nice you can enter

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.940 
ratio so the CPM 0.0 nice you can enter
a<00:03:01.700> half<00:03:01.969> and<00:03:02.359> I<00:03:02.480> don't<00:03:02.659> know<00:03:02.780> let<00:03:03.650> me<00:03:03.680> let<00:03:03.920> me

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
know like now run seven and a half eight

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.259 
know like now run seven and a half eight
and<00:03:06.140> a<00:03:06.170> half<00:03:06.200> I<00:03:06.739> don't<00:03:07.430> know<00:03:07.489> why<00:03:07.640> I'd<00:03:07.790> need<00:03:07.969> to

watching that respects next video will
be<00:03:19.840> hopefully<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:21.079> stable<00:03:21.590> three<00:03:21.829> point<00:03:22.099> eight

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
be hopefully a stable three point eight

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.690 
be hopefully a stable three point eight
that'd<00:03:22.849> be<00:03:22.969> nice<00:03:23.150> but<00:03:23.510> uh<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:24.620> know<00:03:25.370> I<00:03:25.400> kind<00:03:25.670> of

want<00:03:25.879> to<00:03:25.909> see<00:03:26.120> if<00:03:26.180> I<00:03:26.299> can<00:03:26.450> push<00:03:26.689> it<00:03:26.720> but<00:03:27.220> I'd

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
want to see if I can push it but I'd

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.550 
want to see if I can push it but I'd
rather<00:03:28.400> see<00:03:28.700> I<00:03:28.879> think<00:03:28.939> this<00:03:29.180> might<00:03:29.389> be<00:03:29.420> my<00:03:29.689> 24/7

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
rather see I think this might be my 24/7

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.229 
rather see I think this might be my 24/7
overclock<00:03:30.980> that<00:03:31.189> he's<00:03:31.400> running<00:03:31.730> this<00:03:31.939> all<00:03:32.120> the

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
overclock that he's running this all the

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.330 
overclock that he's running this all the
time<00:03:32.480> because<00:03:32.980> temperature<00:03:33.980> is<00:03:34.010> not<00:03:34.280> a

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
time because temperature is not a

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.960 
time because temperature is not a
problem

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
problem

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.979 
problem
I<00:03:35.209> mean<00:03:35.620> I'm<00:03:36.620> running<00:03:36.980> like<00:03:37.129> 44<00:03:37.730> or<00:03:37.909> 45<00:03:38.209> Celsius

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
I mean I'm running like 44 or 45 Celsius

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.559 
I mean I'm running like 44 or 45 Celsius
low<00:03:39.200> you<00:03:39.769> know<00:03:39.859> it's<00:03:40.010> 75<00:03:40.609> degrees<00:03:40.639> Fahrenheit

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
low you know it's 75 degrees Fahrenheit

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.949 
low you know it's 75 degrees Fahrenheit
so<00:03:41.950> not<00:03:42.950> bad<00:03:43.159> but<00:03:43.639> uh<00:03:43.669> you<00:03:44.389> guys<00:03:44.510> have<00:03:44.569> a<00:03:44.840> good
