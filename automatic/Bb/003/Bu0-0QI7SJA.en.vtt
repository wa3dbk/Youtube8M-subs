00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
game ghost you know that didn't do these

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.160 
game ghost you know that didn't do these
in<00:00:08.610> black<00:00:08.790> ops<00:00:09.000> much<00:00:09.300> because<00:00:09.660> most<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:10.019> them

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
in black ops much because most of them

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.839 
in black ops much because most of them
were<00:00:10.290> already<00:00:10.650> done<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.340> there<00:00:11.700> wasn't

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
were already done and there wasn't

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.129 
were already done and there wasn't
really<00:00:12.030> much<00:00:12.150> in<00:00:12.389> black<00:00:12.540> ops<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:12.870> could<00:00:13.019> do

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
really much in black ops you could do

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.690 
really much in black ops you could do
but<00:00:13.440> on<00:00:13.679> today<00:00:14.009> we're<00:00:14.250> going<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.519> do<00:00:14.670> a

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
but on today we're going to do a

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.550 
but on today we're going to do a
trickshot<00:00:15.030> tutorial<00:00:15.210> called<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.080> floating

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
trickshot tutorial called the floating

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.040 
trickshot tutorial called the floating
gunshot<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.369> pretty<00:00:18.060> much<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.480> looks<00:00:18.750> really

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
gunshot and pretty much it looks really

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.689 
gunshot and pretty much it looks really
cool<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.680> can<00:00:19.890> only<00:00:19.920> do<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.310> at<00:00:20.580> the

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
cool but you can only do it at the

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.300 
cool but you can only do it at the
beginning<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.300> each<00:00:21.630> round<00:00:21.890> so<00:00:22.890> let's<00:00:23.189> go

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
beginning of each round so let's go

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.670 
beginning of each round so let's go
ahead<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.580> start<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.480> up<00:00:24.660> here<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.439> gut

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
ahead and start this up here this gut

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.470 
ahead and start this up here this gut
this<00:00:25.920> um<00:00:26.279> trickshot<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.910> really<00:00:27.180> unique

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
this um trickshot is really unique

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.599 
this um trickshot is really unique
because<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:28.320> don't<00:00:28.470> see<00:00:28.619> anyone<00:00:28.890> doing<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.460> on

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
because you don't see anyone doing it on

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.389 
because you don't see anyone doing it on
the<00:00:30.539> only<00:00:30.810> downside<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.710> trick<00:00:31.980> shot<00:00:32.219> is

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
the only downside to this trick shot is

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.150 
the only downside to this trick shot is
when<00:00:32.460> it's<00:00:32.880> floating<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:34.079> can't<00:00:34.440> sprint<00:00:34.920> you

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
when it's floating you can't sprint you

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.400 
when it's floating you can't sprint you
can't<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.700> equipment<00:00:36.450> cancel<00:00:36.840> or<00:00:36.960> do<00:00:37.110> any<00:00:37.290> of

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
can't I equipment cancel or do any of

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.470 
can't I equipment cancel or do any of
that<00:00:37.469> or<00:00:37.770> you're<00:00:37.920> loose<00:00:38.219> gun<00:00:38.790> animation<00:00:39.360> so

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
that or you're loose gun animation so

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.670 
that or you're loose gun animation so
you're<00:00:39.629> only<00:00:39.750> going<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:40.140> one<00:00:40.410> try<00:00:40.620> at

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
you're only going to have one try at

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.560 
you're only going to have one try at
this<00:00:40.890> when<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.129> go<00:00:41.280> for<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.700> but<00:00:42.210> if<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.329> hit

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
this when you go for it but if you hit

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.840 
this when you go for it but if you hit
it<00:00:42.660> you'll<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:43.079> unique<00:00:43.500> creative<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.309> really

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
it you'll be unique creative and really

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.660 
it you'll be unique creative and really
good<00:00:45.170> in<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.260> eyes<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.530> some<00:00:46.739> people<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.309> let's

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
good in the eyes of some people so let's

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.790 
good in the eyes of some people so let's
go<00:00:47.789> ahead<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.000> start<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.170> um<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.710> don't

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
go ahead and start this so um you don't

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.950 
go ahead and start this so um you don't
need<00:00:50.250> anything<00:00:50.550> specific<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.480> need<00:00:51.660> one

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
class on on multiple classes of

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.729 
class on on multiple classes of
trickshotting<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.199> start<00:00:55.530> out<00:00:55.620> with<00:00:55.680> a

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
trickshotting so you start out with a

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.290 
trickshotting so you start out with a
class<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.219> don't<00:00:56.399> want<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.640> trick<00:00:56.850> shot<00:00:57.059> with

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
class you don't want a trick shot with

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.110 
class you don't want a trick shot with
and<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:58.230> all<00:00:58.649> we<00:00:58.859> need<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.039> do<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.879> truck

second like I said you can only do it at

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.969 
second like I said you can only do it at
the<00:01:59.820> beginning<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.180> each<00:02:00.420> round<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.829> you

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
the beginning of each round and if you

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.289 
the beginning of each round and if you
try<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:02.280> do<00:02:02.430> what<00:02:02.579> any<00:02:02.729> other<00:02:02.820> time<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
try and do what any other time of the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.539 
try and do what any other time of the
game<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.689> will<00:02:03.810> not<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.409> because<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:05.250> have

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
game it will not do it because you have

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.880 
game it will not do it because you have
to<00:02:05.850> have<00:02:06.240> your<00:02:06.450> classes<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.439> where<00:02:07.710> to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
to have your classes like where to

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.859 
to have your classes like where to
switch<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.459> first<00:02:08.640> 15<00:02:08.849> seconds<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.539> around

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
switch in the first 15 seconds of around

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.630 
switch in the first 15 seconds of around
so<00:02:10.500> we're<00:02:10.619> going<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.800> do<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.009> one<00:02:11.190> more<00:02:11.310> time
