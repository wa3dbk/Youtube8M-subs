00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.030
 following the tractor with two types 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.090
 milling links from me and classic frieze 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.770
 right side of me topcutter 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.930
 classic fear that runs in the 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.699
 direction of the tractor and who how it 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.160
 actual ground equal water 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.590
 The disadvantage will be that the picking is so 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.080
 have them and there scattered sit in 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.760
 it and the dreaded around at one 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.800
 top cutter that runs in the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.809
 opposite direction 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.829
 and he actually throws the ground first 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.660
 one schedules 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.790
 which means that the picking will be on first 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.370
 fall to the ground and then be covered 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.190
 finer crumble the soil with a 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.750
 supercutter every and much finer fear 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.160
 picture afterwards 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.260
 Moreover, there is also immediately all 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.129
 level sheet on the machine and there the and 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.480
 pinch roller 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.219
 which paul the ground remains a bit stuck 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.059
 causing that to rotten rows 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.059
 becomes superfluous 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.020
 of linking the tool once efkes 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.880
 Ideas have been a number of points 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.069
 must be connected to press through 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.969
 always start with your wounds first 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:29.100
 kardan 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.929
 your nightlife was each card 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.280
 connection is provided with a 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:33.899
 safety pin 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.020
 digitus must kill one and busy while 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.750
 bye the cart then the drive shaft writes and 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.509
 that clicks in position 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.159
 Then we put on the tractor at 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.569
 the control we then set the cart free 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.399
 such that they can be done by hand 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.299
 twist and then we go to the other 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.789
 side 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.520
 so again do the cardan shaft the 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.989
 how do we finally move on 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.759
 connect the 3 points 

00:01:54.989 --> 00:02:00.360
 we always start with the two lower ones 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.920
 points so the right hand one can possibly 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.420
 some with enough one hears height 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.640
 they slide or are locked 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.090
 with a pen and is and then the top one 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.760
 point becomes verbal with this one 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.349
 and can also add here some 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.489
 to be arranged 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.959
 so important that the height good 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.390
 for example, relinquishes fear and then 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.980
 the inlet of the milling work must be one 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.269
 kind of open so take good care of you 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.340
 fear a little backwards 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.890
 it now becomes another plate with 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.780
 who could have raspberry 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.130
 we assemble beautiful but sometimes play 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.870
 a little bit ahead little bit 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.280
 reverse and possibly the three 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.130
 raise or lower points 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.480
 and that is possible with the levers there after it 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.980
 park 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.569
 we just got the job to go and 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.950
 links one of the controls that we have 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.750
 We certainly have now is the 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.890
 height control of the three points that we 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.750
 also going to use it on it 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.610
 implement off the ground and later 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.230
 to put it back in 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.240
 furthermore we all have one 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.950
 number of metal families brake pedal or so 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.480
 the two axes are in the two areas 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.239
 brake separately to possibly 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.150
 to run extra short then we have one 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.860
 forward and backward pda so it's one 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.290
 hydrostatic drive 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.080
 so the deeper you put in the faster the 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.060
 tractor will drive but very important 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.769
 is an u speed control 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.250
 so with the orange handle, the had 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.110
 regulated and the engine speed 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.200
 then all tools fall 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.180
 have to work on 540 touring and see where 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.610
 you do that on the tachometer 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.590
 is tired of your mark on 540 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.239
 so we have to do all of this too often 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.220
 and so long as all the work that 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.549
 engine 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.600
 that the rev counter is at that position 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.420
 and we have two on the left 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.950
 controls for the PTO the stairs 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.540
 is equipped with 2 PTO shafts 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.430
 at the bottom of the machine to resolve any might 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.269
 he can buy and in the back of the machine 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.019
 that we use for ours 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:49.079
 we have just started tillage 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.340
 the cart then want to buy on the PTO and 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.709
 Then it is handy that power take-offs 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.690
 therefore free link and then 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.390
 we switch the rear PTO shafts 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.980
 free and we set the lower PTO 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.269
 powered 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.070
 if we want to work we do of course 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.660
 back the reverse we ensure that the 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.850
 rear PTO 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.019
 have concluded to life on 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.910
 the orange lever 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.730
 where we select three driving speeds 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.530
 are low marks with high and 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.049
 depending on which position it is 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.970
 you will make another trip to i agree it 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.340
 we always work with a tool 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.380
 in the lowest price speed the medium 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.030
 and the angle is for movement on it 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.930
 the road or in the field 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.930
 without work 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:55.430
 I just heard it with the soil cutter 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.800
 feared the terrible around in you loose 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.590
 night theo and airy open 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.509
 quite ideal for wasteland 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.710
 entered green a clear good at it 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.270
 to mix 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.370
 because the ground solo is a few bad 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.560
 after necessary to go own and who can 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.300
 to roll up to beautiful lawn 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.860
 able to finish 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.080
 Success here with the machine that we so 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.069
 have lived towards it as you see 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.960
 can be found in our store 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:20.029
 about the extensive range machine 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.949
 his briefcase there that each coast 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:22.909
 child's play 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:27.229
 I also like to refer to our 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:29.539
 website www.shurgard.nl the complete 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.770
 range worked out in every detail 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.469
 moreover we have for you that 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.330
 ready-made projects worked out and up to 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:37.219
 Finally you can immediately make your reservation 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.529
 through so that the machine for humor and 

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:41.330
 available so much success with 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:45.279
 your job your project or whatever it may be 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.279
 his and collisions
