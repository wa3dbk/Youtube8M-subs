00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.180
 hello here for another video 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.490
 tutorial here with me on my blog 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.880
 I want you in photoshop today 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.100
 show how to enlarge the eyes 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.360
 the model has now been very nice 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.340
 big eyes and she really has it 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.170
 not necessary that my eyes 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.480
 but I would like to enlarge it 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.510
 very briefly show what possibilities it 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.910
 here in photoshop there are some 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.350
 I the possibility that over the filter 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.870
 to do liquefaction 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.660
 I'll lie here now one time 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:55.489
 copy the background layer to with 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:58.030
 command j now here on filter and then 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.170
 to liquefy 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.420
 so now opens a new window 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.610
 and I am here now in the liquefy 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.840
 filder in it 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.580
 It is very important for me to be here 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.710
 make a few settings and that 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.080
 The brush size should be about as big 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.060
 that it covered the eye very well 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.280
 will and the brush speed 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.510
 should thus be in the range of 10 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.729
 so that the magnification is not very good now 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.280
 fast or too fast 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.850
 and then I choose the tool here 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.700
 I always think about it 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.520
 eye to the right now click here 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.840
 take a look and she already what happens 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:42.070
 Eye is inflated or enlarged 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.070
 between on the left side 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.299
 I do not want to do more 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.780
 So it's not too big and too 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.650
 The whole thing looks unnatural 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.000
 with ok 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.260
 So now let's take a look at the one before 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.729
 after that effect then before after that 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.270
 was now too much for my taste 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.050
 a lot of 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.150
 the problem is the tool or 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.429
 I liquefy the filder here 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.840
 no direct control how much i do 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.030
 now do or 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.800
 I can not even 100 percent now 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.860
 say the left eye and the right eye is 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.080
 the same size therefore exists for 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.610
 one missing me in the other solution I 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.410
 now here this level and indeed 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.800
 I do that very different summer 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.160
 photo pure am now times each 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:37.410
 polygons lasso to choose from 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:42.360
 here is a selection around the eye 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.360
 it can be stolen very big 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:54.299
 copy this selection with command 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.299
 j or stollen is on a new level 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:03:00.870
 so now I have the level with the 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.870
 In the eye you jump out of the background 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:11.670
 and now i want to go with command in 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.670
 the transformer pure your tool 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.819
 Now I have the journey here and me 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.439
 could now basically in the eye with 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.180
 larger touch which I do 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:21.760
 but not now but I go directly 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.519
 above in the values â€‹â€‹for the broad and the 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:29.319
 height sometimes only a width of 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:33.189
 three percent and a height of 105 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:35.099
 percent and confirm the whole here 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:38.049
 top with the hook 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:41.680
 now i have my eye here in principle 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:44.739
 but before that I see enlarged 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.150
 that I have edges in here I have 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.209
 that still has to be taxed now 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.470
 simply just hits me one 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:58.000
 plane mask over this plane take me 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:03.819
 my brush and paint with black 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.269
 paint over these countries over it and see 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.269
 me that these countries are here now 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.269
 disappear 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.200
 I can also briefly the background 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.620
 hide 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:27.760
 I can still see that around the rest have 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:32.410
 The market is simply gone and so is 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:36.070
 the now blended clean makes so 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.640
 to the second eye also I would 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.640
 that way 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.080
 pull my pick and eye around 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.590
 that does not matter now either 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.919
 now the hair is there when we are 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.139
 now you can see that this is not 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.930
 difference makes you choose 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:02.979
 again with command jbz worth on one 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:07.229
 new level is different 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.229
 Transform tool with command t 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:19.180
 wide and the 305 confirms the whole 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.630
 Now I have another edge here 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.330
 in it 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:29.430
 that makes nothing as I said just a mask 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:29.430
 black color brush provider that would be 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:38.610
 that look at the reason anyway anyway 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:47.289
 I can still following so not 

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:49.589
 grasp the two levels with your eyes 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:52.479
 times together in a group 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:55.349
 I like here are the two failed in 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.580
 pressed shift button on a group 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.449
 I have the two eyes here in 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.959
 the group in it 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:09.749
 then you can now before afterwards 

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:13.539
 Watch it around here sometimes quite out previously 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:15.669
 now I know that too 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:19.779
 in both eyes the percent equal 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:22.169
 been increased in size those are was 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:24.309
 what I wanted to show you very briefly 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:27.159
 I hope you could do something again 

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:27.909
 Thank you very much for your visit and 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:31.110
 for listening 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:31.110
 Servus take care
