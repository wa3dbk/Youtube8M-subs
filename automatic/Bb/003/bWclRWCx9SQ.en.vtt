00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.440
 we just converted ours 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.400

 copy our file to ours and all 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.450
 device and for that we have to go to 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.859
 aytyuns program that works with 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:18.190
 all with devices and then connect our 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:20.569
 device via cable and go to 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.019
 video library movies on aytyuns 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.730
 and so here move our 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:30.139
 converted file to this one 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:33.769
 the video library of the movie we copied it and he 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:38.959
 should appear in our films section 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:42.980
 and tunes and defined it as a file 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.310
 home video that is, he defined it 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.699
 as 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.120
 unusual film and how home video 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:53.180
 but so be it okay now our 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.000
 The file is in the anti- antis library and we 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.849
 it can copy our now we we 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.349
 we can copy it to our iphone 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:06.069
 ipad or ipod touch 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:09.799
 So go to the movie and then click 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:12.530
 tick synchronize movies and on 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:16.160
 we if we have a tick here then we 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.949
 disconnect her like this and then 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.020
 choose our file which we need 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:25.500
 there is the file that we just 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:28.780
 converted we choose it and it 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.509
 We press the button to synchronize but in 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.319
 my case here was a button 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.379
 apply 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:37.650
 Well, let it be applied in your 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:39.490
 maybe either apply either 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.500
 sync but it doesn't have 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.229
 values 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.110
 to our synchronized and so everything 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:50.289
 just our file was copied to 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.259
 our and I crash now you can 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:57.400
 play it on your device on 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:05:00.550
 my device and i think this is it 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.330
 the instruction was very helpful for those 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:07.120
 people who love converting 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.639
 copy your video clips from 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.699
 some weddings or for example day 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:16.569
 births on your iphone and ipad or ipod 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:18.819
 touch and that is on ios devices and I helped 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:21.669
 you convert your videos with 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:26.020
 some kind of avi or flv format 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:29.650
 or is there still some other format and 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:32.409
 I think that in this video I told you 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.529
 everything is clear to you then everything is clear 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:38.110
 and you understand how to do it all and how 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:41.130
 does this process happen so 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.509
