00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 tea is our extension we need first 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.820
 stage is to check how much hair 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.849
 really natural why we 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.179
 one strand is twisted because we have it 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:17.970
 tested for the presence of artificial 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.330
 hair since we have a strand 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.420
 great so we don't have artificial 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:31.849
 hair in this cut and we can start 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.849
 our preparation capsule Rowan 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.500
 take a small weave 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.000
 hold so that the hair does not 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.000
 tangled 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.740
 the strand should not be too thick but 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.740
 and should not be too thing 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.180
 doing business 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.500
 and soak keratin completely 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.500
 the whole strand 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.140
 each hair should be soaked 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.880
 keratin to keep the volume 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.880
 the maximum in the entire capsule 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:27.210
 usually there are about 3 peas per 1 5 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.750
 we press in order to be later 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.080
 it is convenient for you to substitute strands when 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.080
 building up 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.690
 and cut off 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:59.280
 all the irregularities would she look like 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.280
 neat everything will come he
