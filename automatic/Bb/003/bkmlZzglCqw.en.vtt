hold it you can see at this point that

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:28.520 
hold it you can see at this point that
her<00:01:22.320> post<00:01:23.320> your<00:01:23.590> teeth<00:01:23.890> are<00:01:24.160> making<00:01:24.490> contact

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.360 

and<00:01:28.950> notice<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.640> facet<00:01:30.210> aware<00:01:30.650> on<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.890> distal

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
and notice the facet aware on the distal

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.170 
and notice the facet aware on the distal
buccal<00:01:32.520> cusp<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.260> distal<00:01:34.680> cusp<00:01:34.980> of<00:01:35.340> the

buccal cusp and the distal cusp of the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.160 
buccal cusp and the distal cusp of the
first<00:01:36.450> molar<00:01:38.000> there's<00:01:39.000> still<00:01:39.300> contact<00:01:39.930> when

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
first molar there's still contact when

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.120 
first molar there's still contact when
she<00:01:40.380> goes<00:01:40.820> further<00:01:41.820> lateral<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:45.240> then<00:01:46.130> we

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
she goes further lateral and then we

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.430 
she goes further lateral and then we
lose<00:01:47.340> contact<00:01:47.930> in<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.710> very<00:01:49.920> posterior<00:01:50.550> teeth

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
lose contact in the very posterior teeth

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.590 
lose contact in the very posterior teeth
still<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.740> patient<00:01:53.190> has<00:01:56.060> faster<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.180> wear<00:01:57.360> on

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
still the patient has faster the wear on

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.230 
still the patient has faster the wear on
that<00:01:57.780> lower<00:01:58.020> cusps<00:01:58.380> attend<00:01:58.830> maxillary<00:01:59.670> cuspid

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
that lower cusps attend maxillary cuspid

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.020 
that lower cusps attend maxillary cuspid
as<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.470> can<00:02:01.650> see<00:02:01.890> when<00:02:02.100> she<00:02:02.130> moves<00:02:02.580> back

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
as you can see when she moves back

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.710 
as you can see when she moves back
towards<00:02:03.600> centric<00:02:04.229> occlusion<00:02:05.540> notice<00:02:06.540> that

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
towards centric occlusion notice that

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.590 
towards centric occlusion notice that
little<00:02:07.080> opening<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:08.780> occurs<00:02:11.330> back<00:02:12.330> out

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
little opening that occurs back out

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.750 
little opening that occurs back out
again<00:02:14.120> no<00:02:15.120> set<00:02:15.450> little<00:02:15.750> tripping<00:02:16.170> there<00:02:16.890> and

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
again no set little tripping there and

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.270 
again no set little tripping there and
that's<00:02:18.390> due<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> balancing<00:02:19.650> interference

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
that's due to a balancing interference

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.060 
that's due to a balancing interference
on<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.300> left<00:02:21.540> side<00:02:21.810> which<00:02:22.110> you'll<00:02:22.350> now<00:02:22.740> show

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
on the left side which you'll now show

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:34.480 
on the left side which you'll now show
you

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.410 

this<00:02:35.120> is<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.510> balancing<00:02:36.140> side<00:02:36.470> interference

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
this is the balancing side interference

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.900 
this is the balancing side interference
the<00:02:38.420> lingual<00:02:38.810> cusp<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.860> maxillary<00:02:40.340> second

the lingual cusp of the maxillary second
molar<00:02:43.030> see<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.210> cusp<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:44.750> making<00:02:45.140> contact

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
back again back out it's at this point

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.730 
back again back out it's at this point
that<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:18.510> teeth<00:03:19.510> on<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.840> working<00:03:20.170> side<00:03:20.410> come

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
that the teeth on the working side come

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.790 
that the teeth on the working side come

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
out of contact and that's why this is a

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.380 
out of contact and that's why this is a
balancing<00:03:24.310> interference<00:03:25.770> and<00:03:26.940> may<00:03:27.940> well<00:03:28.180> be
