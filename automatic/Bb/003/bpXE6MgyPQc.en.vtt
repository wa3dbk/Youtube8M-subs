going to do is I'm going to show you the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.280 
going to do is I'm going to show you the
project<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.100> we're<00:01:11.220> running<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.140> I'm<00:01:13.140> going

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
project that we're running and I'm going

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.490 
project that we're running and I'm going
to<00:01:13.350> be<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> colonel<00:01:13.619> viewer<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:15.200> there<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.350> is

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
to be a colonel viewer and there it is

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.920 
to be a colonel viewer and there it is
and<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> file<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.810> main

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
and so this is the file this is the main

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.910 
and so this is the file this is the main
that<00:01:19.049> Lua<00:01:19.200> file<00:01:19.409> that's<00:01:19.590> actually

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
that Lua file that's actually

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.460 
that Lua file that's actually
synchronizing<00:01:20.580> with<00:01:21.150> your<00:01:21.600> loofah<00:01:21.780> with

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
synchronizing with your loofah with

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.050 
synchronizing with your loofah with
crown<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.950> your<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.250> your<00:01:23.340> device<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:23.970> I

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
crown of your on your device so if I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.050 
crown of your on your device so if I
actually<00:01:24.210> change<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.990> height<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:26.130> 2<00:01:26.280> 45<00:01:26.520> so

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
actually change the height to 2 45 so

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.260 
actually change the height to 2 45 so
the<00:01:27.119> ground<00:01:27.500> down<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:28.979> moves<00:01:29.909> up<00:01:30.030> halfway

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
the ground down here moves up halfway

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.490 
the ground down here moves up halfway
and<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:31.140> hit<00:01:31.290> save<00:01:35.270> you'll<00:01:36.270> see<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.600> move<00:01:37.229> and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
and I hit save you'll see it move and

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.590 
and I hit save you'll see it move and
pop<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:37.890> instantaneously<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:39.299> let's<00:01:39.450> just

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
pop up instantaneously so let's just

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.200 
pop up instantaneously so let's just
undo<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.900> really<00:01:40.110> quick<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:41.000> so<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.119> in

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
undo that really quick and so it's in

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.520 
undo that really quick and so it's in
taste<00:01:42.390> lee<00:01:42.509> saying<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:42.869> as<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.140> see<00:01:43.350> you

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
taste lee saying so as you can see you

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.010 
taste lee saying so as you can see you
can<00:01:43.710> really<00:01:44.040> really<00:01:44.159> quickly<00:01:44.460> iterate

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
can really really quickly iterate

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.670 
can really really quickly iterate
