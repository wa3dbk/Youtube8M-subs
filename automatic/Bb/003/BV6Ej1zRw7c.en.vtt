00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.560
 height will be 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.560
 700 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:15.849
 in this project 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.309
 performed directly 

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:19.749
 weather intelligence 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:21.669
 flying 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.909
 is dedicated to weather intelligence wind on 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:26.619
 heights 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.019
 as well as carried away communication salute and the EU before the flight 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.009
 that is, all the data as we work 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.660
 radio equipment 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.400
 and also nosova half a year 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.030
 like we have 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.570
 environment around 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.170
 everyone is watching the weather as to him 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.360
 just the weather 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.570
 at the airfield wind height 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.310
 different and what temperature 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.970
 us 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.460
 for this she has weather intelligence with for 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.550
 by course 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.870
 which one is better 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.140
 right now for this summer 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.680
 shifts I'm scout maybe not even 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.490
 flies if and very strong wind 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.810
 unfavourable conditions 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.810
 view of rain thunderstorm 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.260
 in different from beer increased by 5 meters with 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.439
 flight connected this first 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:10.589
 having gotten a lot of tasks 

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:12.010
 who need to perform war 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.439
 transport aviation 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:16.019
 this is due to her increase in pensions 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.929
 Nasty combat training 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.169
 first preparation 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.459
 when interacting with the supply of troops and 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.249
 other tasks that we have almost 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:27.370
 all white light yes if you believe stagnant 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:29.529
 times the pilot raid the shaft 10 15 what 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.579
 there were such times a hour less than 120 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.069
 hours of such a decision 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.329
 superior 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.540
 rises the task for themselves to grow 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.679
 the number of years is growing 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:42.079
 the pilots 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.159
 demand so big 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.480
 the pilots will fly even more and will 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.659
 increased aircraft 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.109
 go kapaz yes it is more than ours 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.519
 misfortune grief 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.119
 with practically 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:56.409
 three Molotov crews stopped 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.159
 two aircraft 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.839
 sent to repair the flashlight repair 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:04.159
 factories one plane 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.829
 blond fly without 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.930
 restrictions and basically respect about 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.169
 Difficulties tipanova was the entire park 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:12.389
 invited restored 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.579
 completely and that's what i am saying loss 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.559
 for these positions training 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:19.159
 consistently 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.159
 there are young hamas not always have a reserve 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.949
 assign from our ranks 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.929
