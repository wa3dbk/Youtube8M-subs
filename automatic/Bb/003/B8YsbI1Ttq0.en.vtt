00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
much today obviously because this is the

much today obviously because this is the
video<00:00:36.930> format<00:00:37.380> doesn't<00:00:37.770> really<00:00:37.890> matter<00:00:38.040> me

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.420 
saying that but it's gonna say that
things<00:00:39.690> will<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:39.870> different<00:00:40.140> slightly<00:00:40.680> but

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
things will be different slightly but

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.530 
things will be different slightly but
I'm<00:00:41.550> wondering<00:00:41.730> what<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.000> should<00:00:42.180> do<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.300> believe

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
I'm wondering what I should do I believe

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.790 
I'm wondering what I should do I believe
you<00:00:42.660> such<00:00:42.780> like<00:00:42.989> double<00:00:43.230> fishing<00:00:43.500> as<00:00:43.590> pillow

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800

you such like double fishing as pillow
so<00:00:44.010> I'm<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.219> fish<00:00:44.489> you're<00:00:44.670> doing<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.030> like

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
so I'm I just fish you're doing it like

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.760 
so I'm I just fish you're doing it like
I<00:00:45.420> don't<00:00:45.570> know<00:00:45.780> what<00:00:45.930> fish<00:00:46.110> level<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.559> high<00:00:46.710> as

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
I don't know what fish level as high as

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.470 
I don't know what fish level as high as
I<00:00:46.890> possibly<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.579> get<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:47.940> miss<00:00:48.059> out<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.420> a

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
I possibly can get and I miss out on a

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.090 
I possibly can get and I miss out on a
stream<00:00:48.690> fishing<00:00:48.899> for<00:00:49.230> like<00:00:49.379> eight<00:00:49.920> hours

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
stream fishing for like eight hours

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.380 
stream fishing for like eight hours
depending<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.640> line<00:00:50.760> actually<00:00:50.879> play<00:00:51.120> forward

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
depending on line actually play forward

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.639 
depending on line actually play forward
today<00:00:51.480> yeah<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.110> reckon<00:00:52.379> it'd<00:00:52.469> be<00:00:52.530> pretty

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
today yeah I reckon it'd be pretty

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.779 
today yeah I reckon it'd be pretty
boring<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:52.949> I'll<00:00:53.070> probably<00:00:53.160> turn<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.610> later

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
boring but I'll probably turn on later

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.260 
boring but I'll probably turn on later
on<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.140> something<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.610> sit<00:00:56.610> ups<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:56.910> probably

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
on it's something so sit ups so probably

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.310 
on it's something so sit ups so probably
won't<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.449> an<00:00:57.539> interesting<00:00:57.719> absolutely<00:00:58.170> some

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
won't be an interesting absolutely some

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.720 
won't be an interesting absolutely some
to<00:00:58.379> see<00:00:58.469> might<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> three<00:00:59.190> minute<00:00:59.340> episode

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
go train some fishing and I might try

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.630 
go train some fishing and I might try
get<00:01:05.610> some<00:01:05.729> agility<00:01:05.909> done<00:01:06.180> as<00:01:06.299> well<00:01:07.220> right

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
get some agility done as well right

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.100 
get some agility done as well right
oh<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:09.240> knew<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.450> I've<00:01:09.659> been<00:01:09.780> around<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.049> I

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
oh I knew that I've been around but I

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.510 
oh I knew that I've been around but I
buy<00:01:10.439> all<00:01:10.619> my<00:01:10.650> favorites<00:01:11.070> from<00:01:11.130> my<00:01:11.310> daily

buy all my favorites from my daily
places<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.090> reckon<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> could<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.570> do<00:01:12.689> that

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
places I reckon I could just do that

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.969 
places I reckon I could just do that
today<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.170> probably<00:01:13.500> do<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:13.830> where<00:01:13.920> I

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
today and probably do it's where I

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.130 
today and probably do it's where I
thought<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> codfish<00:01:14.490> mullet

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
thought the codfish mullet

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.469 
thought the codfish mullet

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
3000 things in a day I'm not too sure

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.679 
3000 things in a day I'm not too sure

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
but odd a gander so far these flaws are

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.090 
but odd a gander so far these flaws are
going<00:01:21.869> great<00:01:22.049> I'm<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.290> four<00:01:22.500> thousand<00:01:22.890> pairs

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
activity bar a bit simpler because I

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.720 
activity bar a bit simpler because I
just<00:02:18.750> never<00:02:19.170> really<00:02:19.590> get<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.950> use<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.340> if<00:02:20.520> I

about 22 maybe 30 minutes so this is
really<00:02:41.640> good<00:02:41.910> experience<00:02:42.510> okay<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:43.470> there's

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
really good experience okay so there's

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.590 
really good experience okay so there's
50<00:02:44.190> fishing<00:02:44.520> so<00:02:44.850> I<00:02:44.880> believe<00:02:45.180> that's<00:02:45.360> kind<00:02:45.570> of

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
50 fishing so I believe that's kind of

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.670 
50 fishing so I believe that's kind of
like<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.810> main<00:02:45.930> level<00:02:46.110> like<00:02:46.290> kind<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.530> me

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
like the main level like kind of me

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.840 
like the main level like kind of me
because<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:46.950> gets<00:02:47.130> me<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.280> hero's<00:02:47.730> quest

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
because that gets me the hero's quest

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.550 
because that gets me the hero's quest
doing<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.240> lot<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.480> sub<00:02:48.690> questions<00:02:48.930> really<00:02:49.380> but

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
doing a lot of sub questions really but

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.199 
doing a lot of sub questions really but
also<00:02:49.650> gets<00:02:49.950> me<00:02:50.100> a<00:02:50.130> little<00:02:50.730> question<00:02:50.940> because<00:02:51.120> I

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
also gets me a little question because I

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.400 
also gets me a little question because I
fought<00:02:51.450> yet<00:02:51.630> fishing<00:02:51.959> but<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.230> might

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
fought yet fishing but that might

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.440 
fought yet fishing but that might
actually<00:02:52.500> be<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.800> heroes<00:02:53.130> where<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.459> eat<00:02:54.360> the

days<00:02:59.820> I<00:02:59.970> reckon<00:03:00.240> I<00:03:00.300> might<00:03:00.480> actually<00:03:00.660> try<00:03:00.959> and

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
days I reckon I might actually try and

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.270 
days I reckon I might actually try and
do<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.290> however<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.650> don't<00:03:01.950> think<00:03:02.160> that's

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
do that however I don't think that's

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.040 
do that however I don't think that's
possible<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:02.760> might<00:03:03.060> easy<00:03:03.240> better<00:03:03.450> at<00:03:03.600> seven<00:03:03.930> to

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
possible I might easy better at seven to

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.240 
possible I might easy better at seven to
them<00:03:04.170> which<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.410> quite<00:03:04.680> good<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:05.040> I'm<00:03:05.160> gonna

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250
