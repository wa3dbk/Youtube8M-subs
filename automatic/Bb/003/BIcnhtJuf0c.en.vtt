00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.470 
bag and I got them from petsmart and
there<00:00:27.480> they<00:00:27.630> are<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.939> can't<00:00:29.939> really<00:00:30.000> see<00:00:30.300> them

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
there they are and can't really see them

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.150 
there they are and can't really see them
but<00:00:30.779> i'm<00:00:30.929> pretty<00:00:31.199> sure<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.560> i'm<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.070> to

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
but i'm pretty sure that i'm going to

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.700 
but i'm pretty sure that i'm going to
put<00:00:32.309> them<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.840> Sammy's<00:00:33.840> tank<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:34.590> they

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
put them in Sammy's tank but they

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.740 
put them in Sammy's tank but they
they're<00:00:35.190> really<00:00:35.460> small<00:00:35.790> right<00:00:36.000> now<00:00:36.059> then<00:00:36.630> I

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
they're really small right now then I

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.020 
they're really small right now then I
pretty<00:00:37.170> sure<00:00:37.380> they're<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.559> babies<00:00:38.000> so<00:00:39.000> I

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
pretty sure they're just babies so I

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.060 
pretty sure they're just babies so I
might<00:00:39.300> end<00:00:39.510> up<00:00:39.629> separating<00:00:40.500> them<00:00:40.649> until

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
might end up separating them until

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.130 
might end up separating them until
they're<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.219> little<00:00:41.370> bit<00:00:41.550> bigger<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.540> second

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
they're a little bit bigger the second

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.920 
they're a little bit bigger the second
thing<00:00:43.230> i<00:00:43.350> got<00:00:43.530> was<00:00:43.590> from<00:00:43.890> ikea<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:45.420> was<00:00:45.719> a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
thing i got was from ikea and it was a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.490 
thing i got was from ikea and it was a
cactus<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.070> was<00:00:47.190> 299<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.230> I've<00:00:49.230> always

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
cactus and it was 299 and I've always

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.910 
cactus and it was 299 and I've always
wanted<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.980> cactus<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.620> what<00:00:52.829> it

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
wanted a cactus and so this is what it

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.939 
wanted a cactus and so this is what it
looks<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.809> reap<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.469> have<00:00:55.860> to

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
looks like and I have to reap I have to

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.700 
looks like and I have to reap I have to
put<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.309> new<00:00:56.460> pot<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:58.199> dirt<00:00:58.500> is

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
put it in a new pot and the dirt is

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.670 
put it in a new pot and the dirt is
leaking<00:00:59.250> out<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.440> figure

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
leaking out of it so I have to figure

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.630 
leaking out of it so I have to figure
something<00:01:01.829> out<00:01:02.190> for<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.640> that's

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
something out for that but it is that's

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.149 
something out for that but it is that's
what<00:01:05.880> it's<00:01:06.030> called<00:01:06.270> at<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.570> bottom<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.170> I

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
what it's called at the bottom and I

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.310 
what it's called at the bottom and I
can't<00:01:08.460> really<00:01:08.640> pronounce<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.020> I'm<00:01:10.110> not

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
can't really pronounce that so I'm not

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.149 
can't really pronounce that so I'm not
going<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.799> say<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:12.170> yeah<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.530> also<00:01:13.920> got<00:01:14.130> this

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
going to say but yeah I also got this

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.780 
going to say but yeah I also got this
little<00:01:14.430> timer<00:01:14.850> from<00:01:15.360> Ikea<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:17.100> was<00:01:19.790> well

little timer from Ikea and it was well

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.390 
little timer from Ikea and it was well
I'm<00:01:20.880> pretty<00:01:21.000> sure<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.450> was<00:01:21.600> 99<00:01:22.140> cents<00:01:22.680> and

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
I'm pretty sure it was 99 cents and

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.679 
I'm pretty sure it was 99 cents and
again<00:01:23.729> I'm<00:01:23.850> not<00:01:23.880> really<00:01:24.090> sure<00:01:24.210> what<00:01:24.509> I'm<00:01:24.600> going
