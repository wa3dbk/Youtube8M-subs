00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:11.450
 hello everyone we meet today 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.370
 for a new video presentation 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.080
 and to change we will be interested 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.180
 small accessory for smartphones 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.400
 china tech crisis to interest some 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.340
 since it is a card reader 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.020
 memory and a usb hub to see this 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.680
 match for your smartphone or your 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.110
 Tablet 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.360
 so we're talking about a tablet from 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.820
 kick under android or windows 8 points 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.100
 there is no mention of windows phone and 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.530
 so you'll be able to plug in thanks to 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.350
 the standard usb otg keys usb cards 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.730
 memories mouse keyboards and so on but 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.350
 we will look a little later 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.930
 how does it work we will start 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.450
 by the tibet in mourning then it is limited 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.710
 or just a small cable 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.150
 Power to for cap 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.690
 feeding it will serve you if you 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.160
 connected them for example a hard drive 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.720
 since he must be fed into this 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.970
 case on the other hand for all the rest has 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.030
 no need for high level power 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.280
 of the small accessory in itself it is 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.189
 small enough size very well finished 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.570
 softouch plastic to its purposes and so 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.649
 on this one you will find really 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.319
 all the plans you need 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.990
 three usb ports and sd card reader 

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:16.520
 it really is of any micro sd sd 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.310
 So here we have to just limited ourselves 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.869
 to sdhc so that go up to 32 gigas 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.130
 and actually at the level of operation 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.079
 it is very simple since it is enough 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.909
 plug her into your phone and a 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.469
 small red led that lights up and you 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.109
 So go to the example blow 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:32.810
 tight here a sd card and or a usb key 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:34.429
 is directly reading its content since 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.429
 phone with an app a 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:40.189
 application like es explore that allows 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:41.420
 to access that stuff and after 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.310
 you can really read old banks 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.689
 tested with videos that kind of 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.340
 things and it really works great 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.810
 well and the other example is by 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.310
 example using a mouse then 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.899
 knowing more where all rotten big 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.789
 tablet does it all for a phone 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.109
 this not very useful but the mouse is 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.999
 perfectly managed for example by 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:58.099
 android and it works great and 

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:59.569
 no need for additional power 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:01.639
 that was really a short video 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:03.079
 presentation for pressing for 

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:05.029
 present this little accessory 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.409
 I hope you enjoyed this video
