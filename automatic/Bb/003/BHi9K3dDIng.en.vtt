here is very thick it's proximately 18

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.190 
here is very thick it's proximately 18
inches<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.280> 2<00:02:23.459> foot<00:02:23.640> thick<00:02:23.970> if<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.660> do<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:24.900> on

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
inches to 2 foot thick if you do this on

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.680 
inches to 2 foot thick if you do this on
a<00:02:25.440> stream<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.400> ice<00:02:26.489> may<00:02:26.730> be<00:02:26.790> very<00:02:27.030> thin<00:02:27.360> the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
a stream the ice may be very thin the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.620 
a stream the ice may be very thin the
idea<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.680> spread<00:02:29.160> your<00:02:29.489> bodyweight<00:02:29.970> as<00:02:30.390> low

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
idea is to spread your bodyweight as low

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.360 
idea is to spread your bodyweight as low
and<00:02:30.900> that's<00:02:31.020> why<00:02:31.170> that's<00:02:31.410> possible<00:02:31.860> if<00:02:32.280> you

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
and that's why that's possible if you

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.920 
and that's why that's possible if you
don't<00:02:32.610> do<00:02:32.730> right<00:02:32.760> you'll<00:02:33.390> be<00:02:33.420> in<00:02:33.600> there<00:02:33.780> and

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
don't do right you'll be in there and

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.150 
don't do right you'll be in there and
you'll<00:02:34.050> stay<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.320> there<00:02:34.500> too<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.739> do<00:02:34.860> get<00:02:35.070> it

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
you'll stay in there too you do get it

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.680 
you'll stay in there too you do get it
right<00:02:35.280> once<00:02:35.700> you've<00:02:35.850> gone<00:02:35.970> in<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.209> Lake<00:02:36.420> you

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
right once you've gone in that Lake you

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.259 
right once you've gone in that Lake you
will<00:02:37.110> find<00:02:37.830> that<00:02:38.160> within<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.549> very<00:02:38.580> short<00:02:38.850> space

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
will find that within a very short space

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.259 
will find that within a very short space
of<00:02:39.330> time<00:02:39.590> your<00:02:40.590> body<00:02:40.830> stops<00:02:41.370> working<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:42.030> your

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
of time your body stops working and your

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.320 
of time your body stops working and your
brain<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:42.780> becomes<00:02:43.049> very<00:02:43.230> none<00:02:44.030> these<00:02:45.030> drills

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
brain it becomes very none these drills

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.580 
brain it becomes very none these drills
need<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.630> be<00:02:45.720> instinctive<00:02:46.200> what<00:02:46.440> are<00:02:46.530> you

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
doing the first 30 seconds that water

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.430 
doing the first 30 seconds that water
it's<00:02:48.420> basically<00:02:48.690> going<00:02:48.840> decide<00:02:49.140> where<00:02:49.350> you're
