00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.030
 that was giving a great color 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:31.630
 Something missed it has something 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:34.169
 Especially there you go 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.169
 marry 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:54.489
 this is a wedding dress for getting married 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.040
 It's not a sport like that 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.079
 getting married is when you are married 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.940

 I think you need someone like that 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:39.170
 It's a bit cozy for someone 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:46.489
 not in a hurry but always knows where it is 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:48.500
 For example, go for a long time and if you realize that it is 

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:49.520
 yes, that's more than friendship 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.289

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.939
