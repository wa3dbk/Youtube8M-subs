00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
your marble and I'm going to take the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.140 
your marble and I'm going to take the
marble<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.240> just<00:02:12.510> slide<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.990> up<00:02:13.140> inside<00:02:14.150> into

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
marble and just slide it up inside into

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.440 
marble and just slide it up inside into
the<00:02:15.180> center<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.250> loosen<00:02:17.459> these<00:02:17.700> up<00:02:17.760> just<00:02:18.270> a

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
the center and to loosen these up just a

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.600 
the center and to loosen these up just a
little<00:02:18.480> bit<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.959> get<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:19.319> there<00:02:20.450> perfect

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
little bit to get it in there perfect

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.580 
little bit to get it in there perfect
and<00:02:23.610> if<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.880> isn't<00:02:24.240> absolutely<00:02:24.590> centered

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
and if it isn't absolutely centered

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.170 
and if it isn't absolutely centered
that's<00:02:25.830> okay<00:02:26.250> because<00:02:26.400> it's<00:02:26.700> going<00:02:26.940> to

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
that's okay because it's going to

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.350 
that's okay because it's going to
eventually<00:02:27.450> be<00:02:27.720> wrapped<00:02:28.080> again<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.150> just

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
eventually be wrapped again so I just

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.860 
eventually be wrapped again so I just
make<00:02:30.540> sure<00:02:30.720> you've<00:02:30.870> got<00:02:30.900> your<00:02:31.080> three<00:02:31.819> and<00:02:32.870> your

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
end of my rope and go around through

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.690 
end of my rope and go around through
these<00:02:42.180> holes<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:42.959> down<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:44.010> side<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.880> now<00:02:45.630> up

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.780 
these holes so down that side and now up
through<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.820> hole<00:02:48.090> this<00:02:48.600> way<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.730> will

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
through the hole this way and it will

00:02:50.790 --> 00:03:01.530 
through the hole this way and it will
pull<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.480> tight<00:02:52.580> so<00:02:53.580> again<00:02:53.880> three<00:02:54.209> times<00:02:54.390> one

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.590 

and<00:03:08.709> this<00:03:09.099> will<00:03:09.310> be<00:03:09.490> the<00:03:09.640> third

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.010 

okay<00:03:19.000> again<00:03:20.000> just<00:03:20.270> take<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.480> look<00:03:20.660> at<00:03:20.900> either

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
okay again just take a look at either

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.770 
okay again just take a look at either
side<00:03:21.350> make<00:03:21.620> sure<00:03:21.680> you've<00:03:22.010> got<00:03:22.040> three<00:03:22.780> and

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
side make sure you've got three and

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.600 
side make sure you've got three and

going<00:03:27.800> to<00:03:27.920> do<00:03:28.130> is<00:03:29.060> you've<00:03:29.330> got<00:03:29.360> your<00:03:29.540> end<00:03:29.990> piece

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
going to do is you've got your end piece

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.400 
going to do is you've got your end piece
right<00:03:30.590> here<00:03:31.300> I'm<00:03:32.300> going<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:32.630> take<00:03:32.840> that<00:03:33.110> and

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
right here I'm going to take that and

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.010 
right here I'm going to take that and
just<00:03:33.590> kind<00:03:33.800> of<00:03:33.860> tuck<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:34.250> back<00:03:34.700> in<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.360> I'm

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
just kind of tuck it back in and I'm

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.540 
just kind of tuck it back in and I'm
going<00:03:36.170> to<00:03:36.230> follow<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.650> around<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:37.430> so

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
going to follow that around and so

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.180 
going to follow that around and so
you're<00:03:37.700> actually<00:03:37.820> going<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.270> be<00:03:38.360> working

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
you're actually going to be working

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.950 
you're actually going to be working
backwards<00:03:40.190> so<00:03:40.550> though<00:03:40.940> it's<00:03:41.210> connected<00:03:41.750> just

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
backwards so though it's connected just

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.350 
backwards so though it's connected just
tuck<00:03:42.260> that<00:03:42.290> in<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:43.190> here<00:03:43.640> it<00:03:43.730> is<00:03:43.820> here<00:03:44.090> now

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
tuck that in and here it is here now

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.420 
tuck that in and here it is here now
what<00:03:44.510> I'm<00:03:44.600> going<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.780> do<00:03:45.020> is<00:03:45.470> just<00:03:46.250> keep

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
what I'm going to do is just keep

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.300 
what I'm going to do is just keep
following<00:03:47.000> it<00:03:47.120> around<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:48.410> pulling<00:03:48.920> it<00:03:49.070> tight

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
following it around and pulling it tight

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.130 
following it around and pulling it tight
so<00:03:50.860> there<00:03:51.860> it's<00:03:52.130> coming<00:03:52.550> here<00:03:52.970> go<00:03:53.870> through

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
so there it's coming here go through

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.680 
so there it's coming here go through
pull<00:03:54.440> out<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.770> slack<00:03:55.040> here

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.250 

and<00:04:01.110> go<00:04:01.320> back<00:04:01.590> around

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.040 

and<00:04:06.220> so<00:04:06.400> you're<00:04:06.550> gonna<00:04:06.610> see<00:04:07.030> as<00:04:07.420> you're<00:04:07.720> doing

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
and so you're gonna see as you're doing

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.470 
and so you're gonna see as you're doing
this<00:04:08.459> it's<00:04:09.459> gonna<00:04:09.580> start<00:04:09.909> getting<00:04:09.970> tighter

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
this it's gonna start getting tighter

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.020 
this it's gonna start getting tighter
and<00:04:11.670> that's<00:04:12.670> absolutely<00:04:12.940> what<00:04:13.629> we<00:04:13.780> want<00:04:14.019> so

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
and that's absolutely what we want so

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.810 
and that's absolutely what we want so
just<00:04:16.030> follow<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:16.510> around<00:04:16.739> if<00:04:17.739> you<00:04:18.459> get<00:04:18.609> lost

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
just follow it around if you get lost

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.610 
just follow it around if you get lost
you<00:04:19.120> can<00:04:19.180> always<00:04:19.359> backtrack<00:04:20.049> a<00:04:20.079> little<00:04:20.470> bit

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
you can always backtrack a little bit

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.600 
you can always backtrack a little bit
but<00:04:21.810> here<00:04:22.810> I<00:04:22.870> am<00:04:22.960> just<00:04:23.080> pulling<00:04:23.740> out<00:04:24.280> all<00:04:24.550> of

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
but here I am just pulling out all of

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:31.590 
but here I am just pulling out all of
the<00:04:25.000> slack<00:04:28.320> and<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:30.370> tighter<00:04:30.669> that<00:04:30.820> you<00:04:31.210> pull

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
the slack and the tighter that you pull

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.379 
the slack and the tighter that you pull
it<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:33.040> tighter<00:04:33.310> your<00:04:33.550> monkey's<00:04:33.910> fist<00:04:34.150> is

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
it the tighter your monkey's fist is

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:43.879 
it the tighter your monkey's fist is
going<00:04:34.630> to<00:04:34.750> be

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:05:06.200 

you

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:13.930 

and<00:05:07.210> there<00:05:07.870> we<00:05:07.990> go<00:05:10.440> so<00:05:11.440> now<00:05:11.590> just<00:05:11.830> go<00:05:12.039> through

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
and there we go so now just go through

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.060 
and there we go so now just go through
and<00:05:14.450> again<00:05:14.780> that's<00:05:14.990> just<00:05:15.170> a<00:05:15.470> little<00:05:15.650> bit<00:05:15.770> loose

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
and again that's just a little bit loose

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.100 
and again that's just a little bit loose
but<00:05:16.490> you<00:05:16.520> can<00:05:16.790> go<00:05:16.940> through<00:05:17.240> again<00:05:17.480> a<00:05:17.540> second

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
but you can go through again a second

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.290 
but you can go through again a second
time<00:05:18.140> and<00:05:18.470> really<00:05:18.740> tighten<00:05:18.950> them<00:05:19.160> up<00:05:19.310> but

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
time and really tighten them up but

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.420 
time and really tighten them up but
after<00:05:20.450> you're<00:05:20.810> all<00:05:20.930> done<00:05:24.100> and<00:05:25.100> that's<00:05:25.190> what

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
after you're all done and that's what

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.210 
after you're all done and that's what
its<00:05:25.610> gonna<00:05:25.670> look<00:05:25.790> like<00:05:26.560> so<00:05:27.560> again<00:05:27.860> this<00:05:28.040> is

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
its gonna look like so again this is
