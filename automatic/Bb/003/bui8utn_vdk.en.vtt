00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
you've got a throttle on a cage then you

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.990 
you've got a throttle on a cage then you
have<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.870> flick<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.230> regular<00:02:27.500> on<00:02:27.620> elevator<00:02:28.490> so

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
have to flick to regular on elevator so

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.670 
have to flick to regular on elevator so
you<00:02:29.060> don't<00:02:29.270> you<00:02:29.540> can't<00:02:29.750> easily<00:02:30.050> look<00:02:30.380> at<00:02:30.530> all

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
you don't you can't easily look at all

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.470 
you don't you can't easily look at all
your<00:02:30.860> settings<00:02:31.070> which<00:02:31.730> is<00:02:31.880> a<00:02:32.060> little<00:02:32.390> bit

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
your settings which is a little bit

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.640 
your settings which is a little bit
annoying<00:02:32.830> it's<00:02:33.830> not<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:33.980> big<00:02:34.160> deal<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:35.410> it's<00:02:36.410> a

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
annoying it's not a big deal and it's a

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.260 
annoying it's not a big deal and it's a
being<00:02:37.070> a<00:02:37.100> good<00:02:37.220> radio<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.700> other<00:02:37.850> thing<00:02:38.120> is

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
being a good radio the other thing is

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.270 
being a good radio the other thing is
that<00:02:38.480> when<00:02:39.050> you<00:02:39.200> start<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.680> run<00:02:39.860> our<00:02:40.040> model

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
that when you start to run our model

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.130 
that when you start to run our model
memories<00:02:40.580> swapping<00:02:41.540> them<00:02:41.630> around<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:41.930> really

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
memories swapping them around is really

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.590 
memories swapping them around is really
awkward<00:02:42.260> because<00:02:42.790> when<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:43.880> copy<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.240> model

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
awkward because when you copy a model

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.230 
awkward because when you copy a model
from<00:02:44.750> say<00:02:45.020> slot<00:02:45.530> 20<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.040> slot<00:02:46.250> 21<00:02:46.700> you're

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
from say slot 20 to slot 21 you're

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.030 
from say slot 20 to slot 21 you're
changing<00:02:47.690> its<00:02:47.810> bind<00:02:48.050> setting<00:02:48.530> so<00:02:48.740> you<00:02:48.770> then

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
changing its bind setting so you then

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.550 
changing its bind setting so you then
have<00:02:49.070> to<00:02:49.310> rebind<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.850> model<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:50.660> when<00:02:51.080> i<00:02:51.290> least

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
have to rebind the model so when i least

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.260 
have to rebind the model so when i least
I'd<00:02:51.740> like<00:02:51.770> to<00:02:51.890> sort<00:02:52.220> my<00:02:52.400> my<00:02:52.730> helicopters<00:02:53.210> at

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
I'd like to sort my my helicopters at

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.760 
I'd like to sort my my helicopters at
the<00:02:53.360> bottom<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:53.870> then<00:02:53.960> planes<00:02:54.260> at<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.590> top

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
the bottom and then planes at the top

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.850 
the bottom and then planes at the top
and<00:02:55.090> odds<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.330> ends<00:02:56.420> at<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.720> very<00:02:56.930> top<00:02:57.230> so

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
and odds and ends at the very top so

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.170 
and odds and ends at the very top so
every<00:02:58.130> time<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.430> added<00:02:58.550> a<00:02:58.700> model<00:02:58.940> it<00:02:59.060> was

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
every time I added a model it was

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.540 
every time I added a model it was
awkward<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.720> also<00:03:00.050> 30<00:03:00.290> models<00:03:00.680> I<00:03:00.770> ran<00:03:00.950> out<00:03:01.100> so

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
awkward and also 30 models I ran out so

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.400 
awkward and also 30 models I ran out so
I<00:03:01.580> decided<00:03:02.210> swapping<00:03:02.810> back<00:03:02.960> and<00:03:03.110> forth<00:03:03.290> with

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
I decided swapping back and forth with

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.080 
I decided swapping back and forth with
the<00:03:03.470> SD<00:03:03.770> card<00:03:04.010> but<00:03:04.250> every<00:03:04.640> time<00:03:04.790> you<00:03:04.850> import

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
the SD card but every time you import

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.060 
the SD card but every time you import
one<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.990> have<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.230> rebind<00:03:06.560> unless<00:03:06.860> you've

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
one you have to rebind unless you've

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.770 
one you have to rebind unless you've
imported<00:03:07.310> it<00:03:07.580> into<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.880> same<00:03:08.090> slot<00:03:08.390> which<00:03:08.600> is

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
imported it into the same slot which is

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.830 
imported it into the same slot which is
hard<00:03:09.110> to<00:03:09.290> keep<00:03:09.410> track<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.830> so<00:03:10.760> yeah<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.330> DX<00:03:11.570> 6

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
hard to keep track of so yeah the DX 6

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.890 
hard to keep track of so yeah the DX 6
and<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.680> real<00:03:13.130> bonus<00:03:13.760> for<00:03:14.120> me<00:03:14.240> with<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.660> was

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
and the real bonus for me with it was

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.680 
and the real bonus for me with it was
the<00:03:15.170> voice<00:03:15.560> because<00:03:16.550> for<00:03:16.790> fpv<00:03:17.180> with<00:03:17.330> goggles

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
the voice because for fpv with goggles

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
a beautiful backlit screen it's much

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.220 
a beautiful backlit screen it's much
high<00:03:40.640> resolution<00:03:41.360> than<00:03:42.080> the<00:03:43.030> than<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.239> DX<00:03:44.930> 6

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
high resolution than the than the DX 6

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.060 
high resolution than the than the DX 6
there<00:03:45.770> DX<00:03:46.040> 8<00:03:46.220> so<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:48.290> get<00:03:48.440> a<00:03:48.470> lot<00:03:48.709> more<00:03:48.739> on<00:03:48.980> the

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
there DX 8 so you get a lot more on the

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.620 
there DX 8 so you get a lot more on the
screen<00:03:49.220> at<00:03:49.370> once<00:03:49.550> so<00:03:49.760> for<00:03:49.940> example<00:03:50.300> with<00:03:50.420> your

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
screen at once so for example with your

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.290 
screen at once so for example with your
throttle<00:03:51.110> settings<00:03:51.610> you've<00:03:52.610> got<00:03:52.760> all<00:03:52.970> your

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
throttle settings you've got all your

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.410 
throttle settings you've got all your
channels<00:03:53.570> in<00:03:53.930> one<00:03:54.709> screen<00:03:55.130> you<00:03:55.400> know<00:03:55.820> a<00:03:56.000> TV

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
channels in one screen you know a TV

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.710 
channels in one screen you know a TV
that<00:03:56.600> is<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:57.910> then<00:03:58.910> sub<00:03:59.150> trim<00:03:59.360> the<00:03:59.480> same

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
that is and and then sub trim the same

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.740 
that is and and then sub trim the same
and<00:04:00.080> then<00:04:00.350> server<00:04:01.250> reverse<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.610> same<00:04:01.820> so<00:04:02.360> you

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
and then server reverse the same so you

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.440 
and then server reverse the same so you
can<00:04:03.230> just<00:04:03.440> quickly<00:04:03.860> glance<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:04.550> see<00:04:04.850> where

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
can just quickly glance and see where

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.240 
can just quickly glance and see where
you<00:04:05.600> are<00:04:05.630> with<00:04:05.780> everything<00:04:06.350> also<00:04:07.100> you've

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
you are with everything also you've

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.770 
you are with everything also you've
still<00:04:07.459> got<00:04:07.580> your<00:04:07.730> monitor<00:04:08.300> screen<00:04:08.540> on<00:04:08.690> the

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
still got your monitor screen on the

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.970 
still got your monitor screen on the
left<00:04:08.959> so<00:04:09.140> it<00:04:09.230> shows<00:04:09.410> all<00:04:09.590> your<00:04:09.709> output

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
left so it shows all your output

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.340 
left so it shows all your output
positions<00:04:10.340> which<00:04:10.489> is<00:04:10.640> really<00:04:10.850> nice<00:04:11.000> and<00:04:11.720> the

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
positions which is really nice and the

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.500 
positions which is really nice and the
other<00:04:12.620> thing<00:04:13.010> that's<00:04:13.160> really<00:04:13.280> good<00:04:13.910> is<00:04:14.090> that

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
other thing that's really good is that

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.479 
other thing that's really good is that
you<00:04:14.870> can<00:04:15.020> manage<00:04:15.320> more<00:04:15.530> models<00:04:15.920> so<00:04:16.130> it's<00:04:16.310> got<00:04:16.459> a

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
you can manage more models so it's got a

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.120 
you can manage more models so it's got a
250<00:04:17.239> model<00:04:17.480> memory<00:04:17.750> it's<00:04:18.260> got<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.620> SD<00:04:18.890> card

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
250 model memory it's got the SD card

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.860 
250 model memory it's got the SD card
slot<00:04:19.400> so<00:04:19.549> you<00:04:19.580> can<00:04:19.700> import<00:04:20.060> an<00:04:20.239> export

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
slot so you can import an export

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.990 
slot so you can import an export
and<00:04:21.410> the<00:04:21.799> model<00:04:22.070> names<00:04:22.280> can<00:04:22.550> be<00:04:22.580> longer<00:04:22.970> so

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
and the model names can be longer so

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.640 
and the model names can be longer so
with<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:23.420> dx8<00:04:23.810> I<00:04:23.870> think<00:04:24.110> you're<00:04:24.200> limited<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.620> a

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
with the dx8 I think you're limited to a

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.960 
with the dx8 I think you're limited to a
character's<00:04:25.190> four<00:04:25.370> model<00:04:25.550> names<00:04:25.700> it<00:04:25.910> was

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
character's four model names it was

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.820 
character's four model names it was
quite<00:04:26.150> short<00:04:26.390> so<00:04:26.690> it<00:04:27.170> used<00:04:27.440> to<00:04:27.590> be<00:04:27.770> quite

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
quite short so it used to be quite

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.370 
quite short so it used to be quite
annoying<00:04:28.160> with<00:04:29.120> this<00:04:29.270> you<00:04:29.480> can<00:04:29.660> have<00:04:30.050> much

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
annoying with this you can have much

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.960 
annoying with this you can have much
longer<00:04:30.620> name<00:04:30.950> so<00:04:31.250> I<00:04:31.280> think<00:04:31.580> it's<00:04:31.820> something

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
longer name so I think it's something

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.690 
longer name so I think it's something
like<00:04:32.090> 20<00:04:32.840> or<00:04:32.900> 30<00:04:33.080> characters<00:04:33.410> also<00:04:34.250> because

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
like 20 or 30 characters also because

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.460 
like 20 or 30 characters also because
you've<00:04:34.820> got<00:04:35.000> a<00:04:35.030> much<00:04:35.270> bigger<00:04:35.480> list<00:04:35.840> which<00:04:36.290> is

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
you've got a much bigger list which is

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.980 
you've got a much bigger list which is
really<00:04:36.740> nice<00:04:36.890> to<00:04:37.220> switch<00:04:37.700> select<00:04:38.180> from<00:04:38.450> you

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
really nice to switch select from you

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.340 
really nice to switch select from you
also<00:04:39.230> have<00:04:39.710> an<00:04:40.480> assault<00:04:41.480> facility<00:04:41.990> so<00:04:42.170> you<00:04:42.230> can

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
also have an assault facility so you can

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.440 
also have an assault facility so you can
go<00:04:42.470> to<00:04:42.530> model<00:04:42.920> utilities<00:04:43.430> and<00:04:43.730> then<00:04:43.940> sort<00:04:44.300> what

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
go to model utilities and then sort what

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.120 
go to model utilities and then sort what
a<00:04:44.480> list<00:04:44.690> and<00:04:44.990> then<00:04:45.440> you<00:04:45.500> can<00:04:45.620> just<00:04:45.920> pick<00:04:46.100> a

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
a list and then you can just pick a

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.490 
a list and then you can just pick a
model<00:04:46.370> from<00:04:46.670> this<00:04:46.790> list<00:04:47.060> and<00:04:47.300> move<00:04:47.960> it<00:04:48.170> up<00:04:48.290> and

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
model from this list and move it up and

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.080 
model from this list and move it up and
down<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:48.710> list<00:04:48.860> so<00:04:48.980> if<00:04:49.100> I<00:04:49.220> played<00:04:49.520> James<00:04:49.730> test

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
down the list so if I played James test

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.460 
down the list so if I played James test
I<00:04:50.300> can<00:04:50.480> just<00:04:50.630> pop<00:04:50.750> out<00:04:50.900> at<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.140> top<00:04:51.290> of<00:04:51.320> the

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
I can just pop out at the top of the

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.200 
I can just pop out at the top of the
list<00:04:51.590> and<00:04:52.310> what's<00:04:52.520> lovely<00:04:52.760> is<00:04:52.880> it<00:04:53.060> doesn't

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
list and what's lovely is it doesn't

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.610 
list and what's lovely is it doesn't
alter<00:04:53.510> its<00:04:53.720> buying<00:04:53.930> settings<00:04:54.320> so<00:04:54.470> you<00:04:54.500> can

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
alter its buying settings so you can

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.670 
alter its buying settings so you can
still<00:04:55.090> you<00:04:56.090> can<00:04:56.240> sort<00:04:56.510> the<00:04:56.600> list<00:04:56.630> and<00:04:57.020> and<00:04:57.380> not

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
still you can sort the list and and not

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.100 
still you can sort the list and and not
have<00:04:57.919> to<00:04:58.040> rebind<00:04:58.340> each<00:04:58.490> model<00:04:58.870> the<00:04:59.870> big

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
feature with vx6

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.870 
feature with vx6
is<00:05:01.700> the<00:05:01.910> voice<00:05:02.060> so<00:05:03.020> if<00:05:03.290> I<00:05:03.530> if<00:05:04.040> I<00:05:04.190> select<00:05:04.520> a<00:05:04.640> model

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
is the voice so if I if I select a model

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:14.730 
is the voice so if I if I select a model
which<00:05:04.970> is<00:05:05.000> got<00:05:05.270> a<00:05:05.300> set<00:05:05.570> up<00:05:05.660> on<00:05:10.060> up<00:05:13.090> so<00:05:14.090> I've<00:05:14.360> got

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
which is got a set up on up so I've got

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.890 
which is got a set up on up so I've got
flight<00:05:15.740> mode<00:05:17.260> and<00:05:19.000> then<00:05:20.000> I've<00:05:20.120> got<00:05:20.270> timers<00:05:20.720> so

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
flight mode and then I've got timers so

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.810 
flight mode and then I've got timers so
you<00:05:20.960> you<00:05:21.440> have<00:05:21.590> your<00:05:21.740> you've<00:05:22.220> got<00:05:22.550> a<00:05:22.580> flight

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
you you have your you've got a flight

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.880 
you you have your you've got a flight
time<00:05:23.030> on<00:05:23.210> throttle<00:05:23.419> position<00:05:23.660> and<00:05:24.140> then<00:05:24.770> I've

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
time on throttle position and then I've

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.159 
time on throttle position and then I've
got<00:05:25.130> a<00:05:25.160> second<00:05:25.580> stopwatch<00:05:25.940> timer<00:05:26.240> which<00:05:26.990> is

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
got a second stopwatch timer which is

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.020 
got a second stopwatch timer which is
the<00:05:27.830> only<00:05:27.950> issue<00:05:28.160> with<00:05:28.280> the<00:05:28.490> time<00:05:28.669> is<00:05:28.820> is<00:05:28.910> you

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
the only issue with the time is is you

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.430 
the only issue with the time is is you
can't<00:05:29.240> clear<00:05:29.479> them<00:05:29.660> separately<00:05:30.110> which<00:05:30.290> is

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
can't clear them separately which is

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.110 
can't clear them separately which is
really<00:05:30.770> frustrating<00:05:30.950> I'm<00:05:31.610> sure<00:05:31.880> that's

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
really frustrating I'm sure that's

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.280 
really frustrating I'm sure that's
something<00:05:32.150> spectrum<00:05:32.810> will<00:05:32.900> fix<00:05:33.110> in<00:05:33.229> a

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
something spectrum will fix in a

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.590 
something spectrum will fix in a
firmware<00:05:33.530> update<00:05:33.970> but<00:05:34.970> then<00:05:35.150> you<00:05:35.300> can<00:05:35.450> have<00:05:35.479> a

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
firmware update but then you can have a

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:42.130 
firmware update but then you can have a
switch<00:05:35.900> a<00:05:40.030> switch<00:05:41.030> to<00:05:41.450> announce<00:05:41.720> the<00:05:41.900> timer

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
switch a switch to announce the timer

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.420 
switch a switch to announce the timer
which<00:05:42.350> is<00:05:42.500> lovely<00:05:42.680> when<00:05:42.919> you're<00:05:43.010> flying<00:05:43.220> with

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
which is lovely when you're flying with

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.969 
which is lovely when you're flying with
goggles<00:05:43.580> on<00:05:44.140> again<00:05:45.140> it'd<00:05:45.410> be<00:05:45.530> nice<00:05:45.680> if<00:05:45.710> you

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
goggles on again it'd be nice if you

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:47.230 
goggles on again it'd be nice if you
could<00:05:46.100> announce<00:05:46.340> just<00:05:46.729> one<00:05:46.910> of<00:05:47.000> the<00:05:47.090> two

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
could announce just one of the two

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.500 
could announce just one of the two
timers<00:05:47.630> so<00:05:47.840> only<00:05:48.620> look<00:05:48.919> I<00:05:49.400> only<00:05:50.210> want<00:05:50.419> the

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
timers so only look I only want the

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.690 
timers so only look I only want the
stopwatch<00:05:50.750> time<00:05:51.169> for<00:05:51.380> example<00:05:51.500> but<00:05:52.220> that's

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
stopwatch time for example but that's

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.520 
stopwatch time for example but that's
not<00:05:52.910> an<00:05:53.000> option<00:05:53.150> so<00:05:53.540> but<00:05:54.110> I'm<00:05:54.200> sure<00:05:54.229> that's

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
not an option so but I'm sure that's

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.080 
not an option so but I'm sure that's
something<00:05:54.680> that'll<00:05:54.950> fix<00:05:55.220> with<00:05:55.460> the<00:05:55.490> with<00:05:56.060> a

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
something that'll fix with the with a

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.900 
something that'll fix with the with a
firmware<00:05:56.360> update<00:05:56.570> and<00:05:56.990> the<00:05:57.830> the<00:05:58.280> main<00:05:58.580> thing

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
firmware update and the the main thing

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.659 
firmware update and the the main thing
is<00:05:59.060> the<00:05:59.330> the<00:05:59.570> stick<00:06:00.410> feel<00:06:00.620> is<00:06:00.770> lovely<00:06:01.190> the

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
is the the stick feel is lovely the

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.390 
is the the stick feel is lovely the
three<00:06:02.120> position<00:06:02.450> switches<00:06:02.930> the<00:06:03.890> backlit

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
three position switches the backlit

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.909 
three position switches the backlit
screen<00:06:04.669> is<00:06:04.820> really<00:06:05.060> nice<00:06:05.210> and<00:06:05.479> the<00:06:06.320> I<00:06:06.620> can't

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
screen is really nice and the I can't

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:08.440 
screen is really nice and the I can't
really<00:06:07.190> the<00:06:07.580> only<00:06:07.700> thing<00:06:07.820> I<00:06:07.850> can't<00:06:08.090> understand

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
really the only thing I can't understand

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.940 
really the only thing I can't understand
is<00:06:08.600> that<00:06:08.660> the<00:06:08.960> X<00:06:09.080> line<00:06:09.229> pricing<00:06:09.530> doesn't<00:06:09.860> make

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
is that the X line pricing doesn't make

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:10.780 
is that the X line pricing doesn't make
any<00:06:10.130> sense<00:06:10.310> anymore

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
any sense anymore

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.210 
any sense anymore
the<00:06:11.240> current<00:06:11.810> price<00:06:11.930> on<00:06:12.140> a<00:06:12.169> Dex<00:06:12.470> line<00:06:12.620> is<00:06:12.770> more

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
the current price on a Dex line is more

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.920 
the current price on a Dex line is more
than<00:06:13.340> double<00:06:13.640> the<00:06:13.729> price<00:06:13.910> of<00:06:14.090> this<00:06:14.210> DX<00:06:14.510> X<00:06:14.720> and

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
than double the price of this DX X and

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.780 
than double the price of this DX X and
the<00:06:15.229> features<00:06:15.560> are<00:06:15.590> really<00:06:15.710> similar<00:06:16.250> that

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:16.790 
the features are really similar that

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.490 
the features are really similar that
very<00:06:17.300> few<00:06:17.540> people<00:06:17.600> need<00:06:17.930> the<00:06:18.050> extra<00:06:18.290> three

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
very few people need the extra three

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.409 
very few people need the extra three
channels<00:06:18.860> of<00:06:19.430> all<00:06:19.580> the<00:06:19.790> models<00:06:20.060> I've<00:06:20.180> got

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419 
channels of all the models I've got

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.620 
channels of all the models I've got
planes<00:06:20.960> gliders<00:06:21.590> helicopters<00:06:22.520> quads<00:06:22.970> I<00:06:23.240> have

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
planes gliders helicopters quads I have

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.270 
planes gliders helicopters quads I have
one<00:06:23.960> that<00:06:24.169> needs<00:06:24.350> seven<00:06:24.680> channels<00:06:24.890> and<00:06:25.160> that's

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
one that needs seven channels and that's

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.520 
one that needs seven channels and that's
the<00:06:25.460> Phantom<00:06:25.850> with<00:06:25.970> the<00:06:26.090> gimbal<00:06:26.390> all<00:06:27.200> the

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
the Phantom with the gimbal all the

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.890 
the Phantom with the gimbal all the
others<00:06:27.800> you<00:06:28.310> can<00:06:28.550> you<00:06:29.120> can<00:06:29.270> flip<00:06:29.510> that<00:06:29.690> they

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
others you can you can flip that they

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.529 
others you can you can flip that they
need<00:06:30.050> six<00:06:30.349> channels<00:06:30.560> so<00:06:31.310> to<00:06:31.669> me<00:06:31.880> I<00:06:32.060> think<00:06:32.180> that

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
need six channels so to me I think that

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:34.040 
need six channels so to me I think that
the<00:06:32.810> x9<00:06:33.080> price<00:06:33.289> has<00:06:33.500> to<00:06:33.650> come<00:06:33.800> down

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
the x9 price has to come down

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.800 
the x9 price has to come down
a<00:06:34.080> bit<00:06:34.319> because<00:06:34.500> it's<00:06:35.039> just<00:06:35.280> such<00:06:36.090> crazy<00:06:36.449> jump

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
a bit because it's just such crazy jump

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.680 
a bit because it's just such crazy jump
and<00:06:37.770> I<00:06:37.949> appreciate<00:06:38.310> the<00:06:38.400> 2x18<00:06:38.789> is<00:06:39.090> a<00:06:39.120> huge<00:06:39.449> jump

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
and I appreciate the 2x18 is a huge jump

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.779 
and I appreciate the 2x18 is a huge jump
up<00:06:39.840> again<00:06:40.139> but<00:06:40.710> that<00:06:40.860> is<00:06:41.190> the<00:06:41.520> sort<00:06:41.729> of

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:41.789 
up again but that is the sort of

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:43.369 
up again but that is the sort of
flagship<00:06:42.090> radio<00:06:42.240> and<00:06:42.569> people<00:06:42.840> I<00:06:42.870> think<00:06:42.930> paying

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:43.379 
flagship radio and people I think paying

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:46.760 
flagship radio and people I think paying
for<00:06:43.770> their<00:06:43.949> for<00:06:44.669> that<00:06:44.789> status<00:06:45.150> um<00:06:45.990> so<00:06:46.500> anyway<00:06:46.740> I

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
for their for that status um so anyway I

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.399 
for their for that status um so anyway I
hope<00:06:46.919> that's<00:06:47.129> useful<00:06:47.340> um<00:06:47.789> hopefully<00:06:48.780> with<00:06:49.379> a

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:49.409 
hope that's useful um hopefully with a

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:52.129 
hope that's useful um hopefully with a
firmware<00:06:49.830> update<00:06:50.039> to<00:06:50.490> sort<00:06:50.729> out<00:06:50.879> the<00:06:51.090> timer<00:06:51.449> to

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:52.139 
firmware update to sort out the timer to

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:52.289 
position switches and it's got lovely

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:55.490 
position switches and it's got lovely
sticks<00:07:52.800> that's<00:07:53.610> really<00:07:54.360> the<00:07:54.509> that<00:07:54.870> has<00:07:55.319> always

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:55.500

been the differentiator with the high
end<00:07:56.819> spectrum<00:07:57.270> radios<00:07:57.569> in<00:07:57.750> the<00:07:57.840> past<00:07:58.080> so<00:07:58.469> the

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:58.650 
end spectrum radios in the past so the

00:07:58.650 --> 00:07:59.740 
end spectrum radios in the past so the
fact<00:07:58.800> they've<00:07:58.919> brought<00:07:59.099> them<00:07:59.250> into<00:07:59.400> their

00:07:59.740 --> 00:07:59.750 
fact they've brought them into their

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.909 
fact they've brought them into their
effectively<00:08:00.750> their<00:08:00.870> entry-level<00:08:01.169> radio<00:08:01.620> now

00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 
effectively their entry-level radio now

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:03.890 
effectively their entry-level radio now
is<00:08:02.219> amazing<00:08:02.879> so<00:08:03.270> anyway<00:08:03.569> I<00:08:03.599> hope<00:08:03.690> that's

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:03.900 
is amazing so anyway I hope that's

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:13.060 
is amazing so anyway I hope that's
useful<00:08:04.050> and<00:08:04.379> not<00:08:04.500> too<00:08:04.650> long
