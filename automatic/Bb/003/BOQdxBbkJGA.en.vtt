that it comes in two types of
thicknesses<00:00:16.560> you've<00:00:16.800> got<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.160> 32<00:00:17.789> version

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210

you have the 43 version they're
identical<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:20.910> construction<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.570> difference

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
identical in construction the difference

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.560 
identical in construction the difference
is<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.260> thickness<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.039> neoprene<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:24.000> 32

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
that this like a one is actually famous

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.479 
that this like a one is actually famous
for<00:00:45.149> its<00:00:45.329> minimal<00:00:45.829> seem<00:00:46.829> design<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.399> that

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
for its minimal seem design and that

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.860 
for its minimal seem design and that
means<00:00:47.700> if<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.850> look<00:00:48.000> at<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.180> long<00:00:48.450> panel

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
means if you look at this long panel

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.959 
means if you look at this long panel
here<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> front<00:00:49.590> going<00:00:50.370> down<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.550> suit

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
here on the front going down the suit

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.139 
here on the front going down the suit
there<00:00:51.329> are<00:00:51.510> no<00:00:51.750> scenes<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.590> fact<00:00:53.070> there's<00:00:53.969> not

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
there are no scenes in fact there's not

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.529 
there are no scenes in fact there's not
even<00:00:54.180> any<00:00:55.340> there's<00:00:56.340> actually<00:00:56.789> all<00:00:57.000> nylon

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
even any there's actually all nylon

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.110 
even any there's actually all nylon
covered<00:00:57.960> coated<00:00:58.550> neoprene<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.789> there's<00:00:59.940> none

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
covered coated neoprene so there's none

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.160 
covered coated neoprene so there's none
of<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.270> type<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.140> neoprene<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:03.140> like<00:01:04.140> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
of that type of neoprene that is like a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.770 
of that type of neoprene that is like a
shark<00:01:04.500> skin<00:01:04.710> material<00:01:05.360> if<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.450> look<00:01:06.570> at<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
shark skin material if you look at the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.230 
shark skin material if you look at the
back<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.229> suit<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.189> also<00:01:08.369> see<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
back of the suit you can also see the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.510 
back of the suit you can also see the
minimal<00:01:09.689> same<00:01:10.170> design<00:01:10.530> here<00:01:10.770> as<00:01:10.830> well<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
minimal same design here as well the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.390 
minimal same design here as well the
lower<00:01:11.760> lumbar<00:01:12.030> has<00:01:12.720> no<00:01:12.990> seams<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:14.159> actually

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
lower lumbar has no seams this actually

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.100 
lower lumbar has no seams this actually
helps<00:01:14.820> prevent<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> suit<00:01:15.570> from<00:01:15.659> splitting

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
helps prevent the suit from splitting

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.990 
helps prevent the suit from splitting
when<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.860> actually<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.520> straddle<00:01:17.909> a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
when you actually have to straddle a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.789 
when you actually have to straddle a
board<00:01:18.299> or<00:01:18.509> jet<00:01:18.900> ski<00:01:19.200> or<00:01:19.290> whatever<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
board or jet ski or whatever it is the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.800 
board or jet ski or whatever it is the
sport<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.189> you're<00:01:20.340> doing<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.210> actually

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
sport that you're doing so it's actually

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.660 
sport that you're doing so it's actually
really<00:01:21.990> nice<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.530> contour<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.549> an

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
really nice and contour this is an

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.520 
really nice and contour this is an
anatomically<00:01:24.299> cut<00:01:24.600> wetsuit<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.290> already

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
anatomically cut wetsuit so it's already

body of what you'll also see here in the
minimal<00:01:34.350> seem<00:01:34.829> designers<00:01:35.220> you'll<00:01:35.340> see<00:01:35.460> a

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
minimal seem designers you'll see a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.359 
minimal seem designers you'll see a
short<00:01:36.000> zip<00:01:36.360> here<00:01:36.720> shorts<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.590> wet<00:01:37.829> suits<00:01:38.130> give

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
short zip here shorts it wet suits give

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.429 
short zip here shorts it wet suits give
you<00:01:38.520> more<00:01:38.790> flexibility<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.600> more<00:01:39.810> stretch<00:01:40.170> so

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
you more flexibility and more stretch so

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.710 
you more flexibility and more stretch so
this<00:01:40.829> like<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> one<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.549> actually<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.939> short<00:01:42.509> bit

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
this like a one is actually a short bit

this like a one is actually a short bit
wet<00:01:42.930> suit<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.770> take<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> look<00:01:44.100> at<00:01:44.220> that
