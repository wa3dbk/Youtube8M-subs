words and understand just exactly what I

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.039 
words and understand just exactly what I
meant<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:14.400> two<00:00:14.610> pieces<00:00:14.849> are<00:00:15.240> fairly<00:00:15.690> simply

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
meant the two pieces are fairly simply

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.960 
meant the two pieces are fairly simply
simple<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.710> knit<00:00:16.890> they're<00:00:17.220> basically<00:00:17.609> two

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
simple to knit they're basically two

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.990 
simple to knit they're basically two
large<00:00:18.359> rectangles<00:00:19.109> this<00:00:19.920> large<00:00:20.250> piece<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.789> the

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
large rectangles this large piece is the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.420 
large rectangles this large piece is the
back<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.689> sleeves<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.830> start<00:00:23.189> by

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
back and the sleeves and you start by

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.540 
back and the sleeves and you start by
placing<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.240> with<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.720> right<00:00:24.900> side<00:00:25.230> up<00:00:25.619> on<00:00:25.920> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
placing it with the right side up on the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.080 
placing it with the right side up on the
table<00:00:26.900> then<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.320> measure<00:00:29.130> from<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.880> top

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
table then you measure from the top

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.049 
table then you measure from the top
corner<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:31.199> towards<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.920> center<00:00:32.279> neck<00:00:32.520> 10

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:42.459 
corner in towards the center neck 10
inches<00:00:35.360> and<00:00:36.360> place<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.140> pin<00:00:40.520> fold<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.940> corner

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
inches and place a pin fold that corner

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.950 
inches and place a pin fold that corner
into<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.500> pin<00:00:44.030> turning<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> piece<00:00:45.329> slightly

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
into the pin turning the piece slightly

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.540 
into the pin turning the piece slightly
so<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.840> this<00:00:48.840> long<00:00:49.140> edge<00:00:49.469> will<00:00:49.950> match<00:00:50.160> this

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
so that this long edge will match this

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.880 
so that this long edge will match this
long<00:00:50.879> edge<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.480> pin<00:00:52.140> those<00:00:52.379> two<00:00:52.680> pieces

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
long edge and pin those two pieces

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.790 
long edge and pin those two pieces
together<00:00:53.539> this<00:00:54.539> opening<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.170> going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.559> form

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
together this opening is going to form

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.860 
together this opening is going to form
the<00:00:55.980> cuff<00:00:56.190> if<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:57.090> want<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> little

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.860 
the cuff if you want it to be a little
smaller<00:00:58.199> then<00:00:58.920> only<00:00:59.399> measure<00:00:59.609> 8<00:01:00.000> or<00:01:00.239> 9<00:01:00.449> inches
