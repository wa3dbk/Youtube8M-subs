00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:08.639
 who andrich thesis - since he signed the 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.920
 success of the excellent pace was all that 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.990
 the most wanted was to launch a new 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.120
 project that fell in the public's taste 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.580
 as happened to the killer 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.410
 The bald professional was the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.199
 Great idea to ask for the same 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.150
 Danish and or interactive studio 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.490
 I believed that in English 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.109
 the idea behind the initiative was 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.330
 through two protagonists 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.910
 politically incorrect and violent 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.160
 create an amazing game capable of 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.710
 leave everyone jaw dropped 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.170
 The result however is a game that does not 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.559
 half of its promises and 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.969
 annoys due to its numerous failures 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.489
 without a doubt one of the only 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.100
 high points of who lens is the plot 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.039
 very violent that connects kenny a 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.649
 mercenary in trouble with his bosses 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.680
 besides a schizophrenic psychopath 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.320
 accused of murdering his wife 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.149
 the pair meet on the death row 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.220
 just before being rescued by the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.920
 mysterious group known as the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.540
 seven formed by executives with parents 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.470
 they do not share the past 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.510
 friendly 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.060
 the faction demands his that employee 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.640
 a fortune in diamonds that the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.200
 face he had previously stolen to 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.570
 ensure that whoever stays in the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.600
 the organization places garbage in its 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.830
 glue kills his wife and kidnaps 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.350
 his daughter 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.750
 well, each character contributes 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.049
 significant way for the dialogues 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.869
 throughout the game be assiduous 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.030
 allowed and why not funny 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.000
 this is due in large part to the charism 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.610
 of lynch that has memory lapses 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.860
 usually as fatal as when he kills the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.790
 hostage who should protect ge oil race 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.299
 hehe man 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.500
 renan made tel the discharge escapes the 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.810
 focus on label 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.180
 even being inspired by ritzmann the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.360
 game achieves the feat of displaying one of 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.280
 worst mechanics of recent times 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.270
 and look what spoils a game in third 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.179
 person 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.670
 not a relatively easy task 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.200
 It happens that whoever issues a system 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.020
 look 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.140
 used and prevents the player from 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.640
 than half the shots 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.400
 consequently to use pistols 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.379
 shotguns and machine guns turns up 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.040
 in a real torture 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:30.470
 plot shootings are frustrating 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.420
 in combat there is still an option to leave 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.030
 the guns aside and leave for the 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.430
 only that it is not a 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.870
 very smart idea and much less 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.209
 nice to see 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.970
 just press a button so that who 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.580
 he descends the batten into an enemy but the 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.519
 movements are so weak that the sound is 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.660
 so poorly cared for and discourage 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.299
 the joke 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.480
 to make enemies worse are slightly 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.340
 hard even after hit 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.190
 the chest of a soldier with a 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.130
 Shotgun shot for example is common see 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.079
 to continue defiantly standing 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.410
 It's like you 're fighting 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:11.510
 jack bauer you 're unlikely to die 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.220
 before even hurting him 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.890
 the explanation could be in the 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.989
 difficulty chosen by the player but 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.079
 impression is that the options are there 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.329
 only to embellish who has a link 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.560
 good lay-offs and is able to 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.989
 yield a good broth 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.959
 but the truth is that the game comes down to 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.950
 two moments from the beginning to the mission in 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.480
 nightclub 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.630
 Are you able to play without any 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.430
 annoying the problem is that from the 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.709
 emission located in havana 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.579
 makes it practically impossible to follow 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.700
 forward 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:46.160
 the look is equally uninspired 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.870
 with the exception of one moment or another as 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.579
 internship at the club 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.590
 the amount of people on the trail of 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:55.430
 dance is impressive and there is no 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.560
 in the flow of the screen but in general the 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.450
 games of the previous generation much more 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.060
 beautiful than this 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.500
 What bothers you most is the lack of life. 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.220
 two scenarios 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.910
 everything is too pale when it comes to 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.450
 sound 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.459
 just say that who signs 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.349
 the island is the same as the franchises 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.810
 responsible for the bands and effects 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.579
 sound of the series starring 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.459
 agent 47 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.049
 the songs are cool and the dubbing is not 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.960
 comes to disappoint 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.090
 indeed the most sensible recommendation in 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.220
 if it is a question of who is not you 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.860
 game to be enjoyed at cheat 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.020
 In this case the control of me jumps from the 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.930
 computer for the closest control 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.880
 connected to the console or pcc 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.490
 there is no possibility to do this 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.830
 online what a shame but the screen 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.250
 divided is still a good option 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:50.430
 after all you do not suffer alone and well or 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.740
 Ill end up having fun with it. 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.840
 it's a theory but it's very likely 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.300
 who has not yet announced a 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.580
 sequence for anyone who invents a towel 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.650
 it is disappointing to think that the 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.110
 producer turned a blind eye to so many 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.210
 errors with the intention of launching the 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.160
 game but hurry and profit from 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.340
 continuations and adaptations 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.380
 films that could not even be 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.440
 an excellent look that dozens of 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.990
 online options and still continue 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.180
 in the same precarious situation if 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.729
 keep the gameplay frustrating 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.870
 inexact and is part of this first 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.180
 episode 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.990
 if you want to honor the work of the 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.479
 intellect 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.750
 the four editions of victims are more 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.750
 that enough 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.269
