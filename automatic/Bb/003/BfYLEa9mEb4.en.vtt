00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 do not 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:21.130
 welcome to millennium zero 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.210
 in today's program we're going to know the 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.810
 most dangerous object in the world 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.539
 For this we are going to travel towards one of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.140
 the most unusual corners of our 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.860
 planet 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:40.580
 It is a place of free and very chilling 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:44.270
 this site could well be said to 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.940
 constitutes a regional warning of what 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.950
 large scale could happen to our 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.890
 advanced and technological civilization 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:59.920
 we are referring to the central 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:03.580
 nuclear of Chernobyl place that was 26 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.130
 April 1986 worst scenario 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.310
 nuclear accident of the history of the 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.210
 humanity after overheating and 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.630
 the explosion of reactor number 4 that 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.760
 issued 500 times more radiation than the 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:24.050
 atomic bomb that was thrown on 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:26.920
 Hiroshima in the year 1945 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:31.280
 very close to this central was 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.460
 founded the city of Pripyat 4 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.040
 February 1970 with the sole purpose 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.100
 of giving home to the workers of the 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.350
 nuclear power plant and their families 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.830
 and that because of its geographical position 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.770
 with a temperate climate with a rich soil 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.299
 In addition fertile near station 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:57.140
 train of the highway and the river prípiat 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:59.150
 it happened in just 16 years to have 40 thousand 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.610
 population 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.400
 however the day of the explosion of 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.340
 reactor four of Chernobyl the Great 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.400
 amount of radiation emitted affected 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.760
 this city and had to be evacuated 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.849
 the Red Army 36 hours after 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.610
 this accident evacuates most of 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:25.489
 the inhabitants of the locality for 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.489
 protect them from this huge radiation 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.890
 both livestock and animals 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.069
 domestic, however, were left behind 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.950
 abandoned 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.079
 but finally they were slaughtered with 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.560
 the objective of avoiding alterations 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.560
 genetic 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.610
 an abandoned city where the plants 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:52.700
 grow unimpeded 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:56.180
 where schools houses were left behind 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.319
 amusement park swimming pools and everything 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.319
 type of facilities 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.830
 but the object that we seek the 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.500
 most dangerous in the world is very 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.700
 near this city 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.670
 It is the product of this fatal accident 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.640
 It has been called elephant's foot or 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.390
 of jellyfish by the way it has and is 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:26.200
 it's about a macabre accumulation of 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.010
 remains solidified by the reactor 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.530
 Chernobyl 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.120
 when on April 26 of the year 86 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.189
 this reactor was melted the fuel 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.920
 nuclear and the material of the vessel and its 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:44.670
 different components went 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:47.640
 mixing resulting in a liquid mass 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.190
 that was very similar to lava this mass 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.780
 it was flowing to the floors below 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:57.090
 the central one and when it cooled down and it 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.540
 solidified resulted in different 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.510
 structures becoming a 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.020
 species of stalactites and stalagmites 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:09.070
 radioactive 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:12.850
 the result an object of apotheosics 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:15.600
 dimensions and become the object 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.360
 most dangerous on our planet 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.150
 Well, if a person is in his 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.730
 range of scope 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.030
 he will not be able to live more than six months 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.370
 if one decides to approach a little more 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.289
 your life expectancy will be limited to so 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.479
 only seven days 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.939
 and if it is in front of it 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:41.139
 object no matter how protected you 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:44.639
 go or the suit you wear will not last 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.639
 more than 48 hours 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:51.100
 according to the measurements made 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:56.370
 by the workers at the time of 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.370
 discovery of elephant foot 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.009
 it emitted so much radiation that only one 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.780
 tenth of that amount would 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:09.270
 enough to kill a person 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:12.660
 to get an idea of ​​this mass 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:16.220
 they emit an hour the equivalent of 45 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.220
 millions of chest x-rays 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:22.659
 and wearing a special suit allows for 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:25.539
 both approach the object but only 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:27.969
 earn hours of life because nobody can 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:30.520
 survive the large radiation 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:32.610
 issued by the most dangerous object in the 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.610
 world
