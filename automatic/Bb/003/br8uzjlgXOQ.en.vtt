years of therapy that he decided to come

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.779 
years of therapy that he decided to come
out<00:04:41.009> and<00:04:41.879> I<00:04:42.389> did<00:04:43.110> some<00:04:43.139> research<00:04:43.529> and<00:04:44.129> I<00:04:44.549> looked

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
out and I did some research and I looked

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.519 
out and I did some research and I looked
into<00:04:44.999> things<00:04:45.329> and<00:04:45.599> I<00:04:45.689> realized<00:04:46.139> that<00:04:46.199> people

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:46.529 
into things and I realized that people

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:49.369 
into things and I realized that people
don't<00:04:46.739> really<00:04:47.089> with<00:04:48.089> these<00:04:48.179> programs<00:04:48.659> is<00:04:48.989> a

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:49.379 
don't really with these programs is a

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:51.679 
don't really with these programs is a
statistic<00:04:50.219> it<00:04:50.339> out<00:04:50.429> there<00:04:50.639> and<00:04:51.059> this<00:04:51.299> is<00:04:51.539> that

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:51.689 
statistic it out there and this is that

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:52.850 
statistic it out there and this is that
only<00:04:51.779> six<00:04:52.110> percent<00:04:52.259> of<00:04:52.499> people<00:04:52.589> on<00:04:52.769> this

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
only six percent of people on this

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.069 
only six percent of people on this
program<00:04:53.009> change<00:04:53.539> those<00:04:54.539> six<00:04:54.779> percent<00:04:55.019> of

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:55.079 
program change those six percent of

00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:56.739 
program change those six percent of
people<00:04:55.199> are<00:04:55.409> employed<00:04:55.589> by<00:04:55.709> the<00:04:55.889> church<00:04:56.189> and<00:04:56.489> so

people are employed by the church and so

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:59.209 
people are employed by the church and so
if<00:04:57.749> you<00:04:57.809> look<00:04:57.989> at<00:04:58.110> that<00:04:58.289> and<00:04:58.559> then<00:04:58.829> really<00:04:59.069> does

00:04:59.209 --> 00:04:59.219 
if you look at that and then really does

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:03.469 
if you look at that and then really does
anybody<00:04:59.519> change<00:04:59.729> at<00:04:59.849> all<00:05:02.179> and<00:05:03.179> while<00:05:03.329> there

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
anybody change at all and while there

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.719 
anybody change at all and while there
has<00:05:03.569> been<00:05:03.749> progress<00:05:04.019> Ben<00:05:04.979> is<00:05:05.099> now<00:05:05.249> one<00:05:05.429> of<00:05:05.459> five

has been progress Ben is now one of five

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.179 
has been progress Ben is now one of five
openly<00:05:06.089> gay<00:05:06.299> Hillsong<00:05:06.749> members<00:05:07.079> he<00:05:07.860> believes

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:08.189 
openly gay Hillsong members he believes

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:09.529 
openly gay Hillsong members he believes
there's<00:05:08.459> still<00:05:08.669> much<00:05:08.819> to<00:05:08.999> be<00:05:09.029> done<00:05:09.119> for<00:05:09.449> the

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
there's still much to be done for the

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.779 
there's still much to be done for the
rights<00:05:09.749> of<00:05:09.899> homosexuals<00:05:10.129> both<00:05:11.129> in<00:05:11.399> and<00:05:11.579> out<00:05:11.759> of

rights of homosexuals both in and out of
the<00:05:11.999> church<00:05:12.709> and<00:05:13.709> I<00:05:13.799> think<00:05:14.099> you<00:05:14.219> know<00:05:14.309> as<00:05:14.429> well

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:14.579 
the church and I think you know as well

00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:18.019 
the church and I think you know as well
one<00:05:14.759> of<00:05:14.849> the<00:05:14.939> biggest<00:05:16.399> kind<00:05:17.399> of<00:05:17.489> causes<00:05:17.999> and

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:18.029 
one of the biggest kind of causes and

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:19.729 
one of the biggest kind of causes and
one<00:05:18.389> of<00:05:18.449> the<00:05:18.539> biggest<00:05:18.719> kind<00:05:19.049> of<00:05:19.139> pressures<00:05:19.499> of

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:19.739 
one of the biggest kind of pressures of

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:23.059 
one of the biggest kind of pressures of
and<00:05:20.329> influences<00:05:21.329> on<00:05:21.539> current<00:05:22.469> discrimination

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:23.069 
and influences on current discrimination

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:24.139 
and influences on current discrimination
against<00:05:23.279> gay<00:05:23.429> and<00:05:23.549> lesbian<00:05:23.819> people<00:05:23.909> is

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:24.149 
against gay and lesbian people is

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:26.089 
against gay and lesbian people is
definitely<00:05:24.299> the<00:05:24.689> change<00:05:24.929> I<00:05:25.169> think<00:05:25.799> that's

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
definitely the change I think that's

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.100 
definitely the change I think that's
probably<00:05:26.969> because<00:05:27.329> the<00:05:27.569> church<00:05:27.809> as<00:05:27.989> a<00:05:28.019> whole

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
probably because the church as a whole

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.269 
probably because the church as a whole
doesn't<00:05:28.529> really<00:05:28.679> understand<00:05:29.129> what's

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:29.279 
doesn't really understand what's

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:32.389 
doesn't really understand what's
happening<00:05:29.639> and<00:05:29.809> so<00:05:30.809> you<00:05:31.739> know<00:05:31.799> if<00:05:32.069> we<00:05:32.249> can

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:32.399 
happening and so you know if we can

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:34.309 
happening and so you know if we can
prevent<00:05:32.549> one<00:05:33.209> suicide<00:05:33.569> if<00:05:33.929> we<00:05:34.049> can<00:05:34.199> prevent

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319 
prevent one suicide if we can prevent

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.169 
prevent one suicide if we can prevent
one<00:05:34.649> person<00:05:35.009> from<00:05:35.099> harming<00:05:35.669> themselves<00:05:35.819> or

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:36.179 
one person from harming themselves or

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:38.629 
one person from harming themselves or
feeling<00:05:37.139> like<00:05:37.319> they're<00:05:37.559> a<00:05:37.589> mistake<00:05:37.949> and<00:05:38.279> it

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
feeling like they're a mistake and it

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.219 
feeling like they're a mistake and it
will<00:05:38.759> make<00:05:38.909> it<00:05:39.029> all<00:05:39.119> worth<00:05:39.269> it<00:05:39.509> I<00:05:39.689> think<00:05:40.019> at<00:05:40.110> the

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
will make it all worth it I think at the

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.049 
will make it all worth it I think at the
end<00:05:40.259> that's<00:05:40.499> what<00:05:40.679> me<00:05:41.369> and<00:05:41.399> that's<00:05:41.849> what

00:05:42.049 --> 00:05:42.059 
end that's what me and that's what

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:43.819 
end that's what me and that's what
