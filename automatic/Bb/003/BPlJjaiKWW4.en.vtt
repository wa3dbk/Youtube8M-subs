00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.650
 he reports of this shoe's 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.170
 at adidas lazio this boost a little 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.700
 wonder that I tried on a 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.589
 hundred kilometers 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.750
 first of all some weighty arguments 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:20.420
 his weight precisely he weighs on the 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.260
 balance 2 136 g so what makes a 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:28.210
 extremely lightweight shoe and at 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:31.670
 dynamic profile to review it 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.290
 a slipper that is really very 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:38.930
 nice with a wick that adidas knew 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:44.300
 work properly so hamas very 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:48.190
 inspiring very light inside 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.960
 actually sees adidas proust 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.760
 I am breathable 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.190
 besides at the level of death which so 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.989
 a shoe that incorporates technology 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.000
 technology boost two chairs 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.969
 empty to what we had already tested 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.119
 on the energy boost that brings 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.070
 comfort and increased dynamism to 7 to 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.490
 this shoe we can notice that 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:15.860
 the cushioning is really minimalist this 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:18.439
 either on the heel or on the front I 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.950
 would say that this shoe is rather 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:25.189
 made for light runners on 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.540
 distances from 10 km to the marathon 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:33.020
 I will go with your performance in below 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.670
 within 3 hours of shoes that 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.130
 also has the advantages that had 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:42.200
 not the booster to integrate at its level 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.590
 sole the continental grip that provides 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.020
 a grip on the shoe really 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.909
 really undeniable especially on ground 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.860
 so wet a technological that does not 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:57.050
 did not show the energy 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:00.140
 boost to its original aso what about 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.820
 this shoe in summary papa dad 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.770
 it's the spider man shoe but we 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:10.220
 can say a little bit about it 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:11.840
 through the look or through the 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.280
 characteristics of the shoe with 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.300
 extremely lightweight shoes 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.880
 dynamic with stone media support 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.950
 in the foot which is that boosts the 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.260
 shoe so that good luck bo 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:29.959
 adidas 2013 gives us beautiful opus of 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.040
 nice things about me that was not very 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.600
 adidas before I start to really 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.360
 be seduced by this brand 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.239
 I look forward to the integration 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.600
 boost you know about what about 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.570

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.580
 mark sees the bales the shoe of
