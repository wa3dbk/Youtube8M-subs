sticking to this we were saying februari
or<00:02:18.150> march<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.810> our<00:02:19.050> view<00:02:19.620> was<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.460> more

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
or march and our view was that is more

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.000 
or march and our view was that is more
likely<00:02:21.090> at<00:02:21.390> late<00:02:21.600> march<00:02:21.930> than<00:02:22.230> early<00:02:22.500> februari

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
likely at late march than early februari

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.550 
likely at late march than early februari
you<00:02:23.940> could<00:02:24.180> see<00:02:24.360> some<00:02:24.570> follow<00:02:24.840> through<00:02:25.230> buying

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
you could see some follow through buying

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.950 
you could see some follow through buying
into<00:02:25.890> early<00:02:26.160> februari<00:02:26.640> if<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.450> price<00:02:27.690> gets

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
into early februari if the price gets

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.530 
into early februari if the price gets
over<00:02:28.290> 1280<00:02:28.830> again<00:02:29.280> as<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.700> did<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.090> think<00:02:30.300> about

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
over 1280 again as it did I think about

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.630 
over 1280 again as it did I think about
a<00:02:30.570> week<00:02:30.810> ago<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.650> could<00:02:31.920> see<00:02:32.130> some<00:02:32.340> fresh

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
a week ago you could see some fresh

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.400 
a week ago you could see some fresh
buying<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.240> some<00:02:33.360> short<00:02:33.630> covering<00:02:34.020> take<00:02:34.260> it

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
buying and some short covering take it

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.280 
buying and some short covering take it
up<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.650> 13<00:02:35.040> 20<00:02:35.400> on<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.520> very<00:02:35.790> brief<00:02:36.060> basis<00:02:36.570> but<00:02:37.170> we

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
up to 13 20 on a very brief basis but we

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.140 
up to 13 20 on a very brief basis but we
think<00:02:37.470> we've<00:02:37.680> probably<00:02:37.890> seen<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.520> high<00:02:38.790> in

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
think we've probably seen the high in

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.860 
think we've probably seen the high in
January<00:02:39.840> around<00:02:40.200> 12<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.860> know<00:02:40.950> 1280<00:02:41.370> 1290<00:02:42.060> and

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
January around 12 you know 1280 1290 and

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.540 
January around 12 you know 1280 1290 and
the<00:02:43.020> price<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.260> more<00:02:43.620> likely<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.070> come<00:02:44.340> back

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
the price is more likely to come back

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.330 
the price is more likely to come back
off<00:02:44.820> we<00:02:45.270> do<00:02:45.480> think<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.810> we'll<00:02:46.110> see<00:02:46.320> 1320<00:02:47.160> but

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
off we do think that we'll see 1320 but

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.950 
off we do think that we'll see 1320 but
it's<00:02:47.460> probably<00:02:47.700> more<00:02:47.940> likely<00:02:48.240> late<00:02:48.630> March

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
it's probably more likely late March

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.110 
it's probably more likely late March

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.110 
course of 2014 is this ongoing dealing
with<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.860> international<00:03:41.520> monetary<00:03:41.970> system

with the international monetary system

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.510 
with the international monetary system

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
and the fact that you do have these

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.580 
and the fact that you do have these

think that you will see problems more so
in<00:03:59.310> Europe<00:03:59.700> than<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.030> united<00:04:00.300> states<00:04:00.600> or

Japan in the United States and but i

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.900 
Japan in the United States and but i

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.170
