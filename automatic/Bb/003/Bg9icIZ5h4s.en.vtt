00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
after he planted them it then took them

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.100 
after he planted them it then took them
four<00:00:36.680> years<00:00:37.100> to<00:00:37.460> grow<00:00:37.670> up<00:00:37.910> and<00:00:38.180> to<00:00:38.600> be<00:00:38.780> trained

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
this original vineyard we also pull

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.869 
this original vineyard we also pull
aside<00:01:00.200> a<00:01:00.680> little<00:01:01.010> bit<00:01:01.129> of<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:01.309> produce<00:01:01.640> from

aside a little bit of the produce from

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.270 
aside a little bit of the produce from
these<00:01:02.059> from<00:01:02.570> these<00:01:02.719> older<00:01:02.989> vines<00:01:03.199> to<00:01:03.829> put<00:01:04.039> into

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
these from these older vines to put into

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.490 
these from these older vines to put into
our<00:01:04.430> state<00:01:04.699> wines<00:01:04.910> our<00:01:05.690> lower<00:01:05.899> priced<00:01:06.229> wines

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
our state wines our lower priced wines

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.889 
our state wines our lower priced wines
and<00:01:06.770> that<00:01:07.100> is<00:01:07.220> because<00:01:07.490> these<00:01:07.610> vines<00:01:07.910> they're

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
and that is because these vines they're

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.840 
and that is because these vines they're
really<00:01:09.080> part<00:01:09.319> of<00:01:09.380> irie<00:01:09.679> they<00:01:10.490> really<00:01:10.700> have<00:01:10.819> a

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
really part of irie they really have a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.870 
really part of irie they really have a
strong<00:01:11.090> statement<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:12.399> it's<00:01:13.399> really<00:01:13.640> not<00:01:13.819> I

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
strong statement and it's really not I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.340 
strong statement and it's really not I
rien<00:01:14.270> less<00:01:14.420> there's<00:01:14.600> a<00:01:14.660> component<00:01:15.170> in<00:01:15.229> every

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
rien less there's a component in every

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.699 
rien less there's a component in every
one<00:01:15.590> of<00:01:15.619> our<00:01:15.800> wines<00:01:16.009> and<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:17.200> this<00:01:18.200> vineyard<00:01:18.560> is

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:18.709 
one of our wines and so this vineyard is

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:20.260 
one of our wines and so this vineyard is
is<00:01:19.009> really<00:01:19.429> the<00:01:19.520> heart<00:01:19.700> it's<00:01:19.910> the<00:01:19.970> core<00:01:20.240> of

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
is really the heart it's the core of

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.499 
is really the heart it's the core of
what<00:01:20.539> we<00:01:20.630> do<00:01:20.720> here<00:01:20.899> at<00:01:20.990> Irie<00:01:22.090> grape<00:01:23.090> vines<00:01:23.330> are

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
what we do here at Irie grape vines are

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.889 
what we do here at Irie grape vines are
a<00:01:23.539> little<00:01:23.660> bit<00:01:23.840> like<00:01:23.990> people<00:01:24.670> as<00:01:25.690> they<00:01:26.690> grow

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
a little bit like people as they grow

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.219 
a little bit like people as they grow
older<00:01:27.099> their<00:01:28.099> productivity<00:01:28.849> decreases<00:01:29.479> they

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
older their productivity decreases they

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.889 
older their productivity decreases they
stop<00:01:30.500> yielding<00:01:30.950> so<00:01:31.190> much<00:01:31.429> but<00:01:32.300> the<00:01:32.390> quality<00:01:32.810> of

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
stop yielding so much but the quality of

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.260 
stop yielding so much but the quality of
what<00:01:33.050> they<00:01:33.170> do<00:01:33.229> increases<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:35.000> vines

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
what they do increases the vines

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.719 
what they do increases the vines
naturally<00:01:35.990> produce<00:01:36.619> fewer<00:01:37.009> clusters<00:01:37.490> and

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
naturally produce fewer clusters and

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.260 
naturally produce fewer clusters and
those<00:01:38.060> clusters<00:01:38.270> have<00:01:38.599> smaller<00:01:38.959> berries<00:01:40.270> but

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
those clusters have smaller berries but

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.809 
those clusters have smaller berries but
the<00:01:42.140> quality<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:42.770> intensity<00:01:43.340> of<00:01:43.429> the<00:01:43.490> flavors

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
the quality the intensity of the flavors

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:45.010 
the quality the intensity of the flavors
from<00:01:43.910> those<00:01:44.119> smaller<00:01:44.360> berries<00:01:44.720> is<00:01:44.869> much

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
from those smaller berries is much

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.109 
from those smaller berries is much
greater<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:45.520> we'll<00:01:46.520> keep<00:01:46.670> farming<00:01:47.030> these

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
greater and we'll keep farming these

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.490 
greater and we'll keep farming these
vines<00:01:47.390> for<00:01:47.630> as<00:01:47.720> long<00:01:47.840> as<00:01:47.899> they<00:01:48.080> continue<00:01:48.229> to

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
vines for as long as they continue to

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.059 
vines for as long as they continue to
give<00:01:48.649> us<00:01:48.770> fruit<00:01:50.319> when<00:01:51.319> I<00:01:51.349> look<00:01:51.590> at<00:01:51.679> these<00:01:51.800> grape

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
give us fruit when I look at these grape

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:56.770 
give us fruit when I look at these grape
vines<00:01:54.640> they're<00:01:55.640> kind<00:01:55.910> of<00:01:55.970> like<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.300> siblings

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
vines they're kind of like the siblings

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.650 
vines they're kind of like the siblings
in<00:01:57.289> my<00:01:57.590> family<00:01:57.979> they're<00:01:58.130> like<00:01:58.280> my

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
in my family they're like my

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.770 
in my family they're like my
stepbrothers<00:01:59.660> and<00:02:00.020> stepsisters<00:02:00.489> and<00:02:01.780> there

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
stepbrothers and stepsisters and there

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.419 
stepbrothers and stepsisters and there
really<00:02:02.929> is<00:02:03.110> a<00:02:03.140> family<00:02:03.950> bond<00:02:04.310> with<00:02:04.970> Divine's<00:02:06.429> we

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
really is a family bond with Divine's we

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.639 
really is a family bond with Divine's we
certainly<00:02:07.759> rely<00:02:08.030> on<00:02:08.060> them<00:02:08.360> for<00:02:08.390> our<00:02:08.929> economic

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
certainly rely on them for our economic

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.030 
certainly rely on them for our economic
sustenance<00:02:10.090> but<00:02:11.090> we<00:02:11.989> also<00:02:12.140> feel<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.680> need<00:02:12.860> to

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
sustenance but we also feel the need to

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.350 
sustenance but we also feel the need to
pay<00:02:13.549> it<00:02:13.670> back<00:02:13.879> and<00:02:14.200> so

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
pay it back and so

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.270 
pay it back and so
even<00:02:17.230> though<00:02:17.320> this<00:02:17.470> vineyard<00:02:17.830> doesn't

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
even though this vineyard doesn't

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.550 
even though this vineyard doesn't
produce<00:02:18.460> the<00:02:19.000> yields<00:02:19.720> that<00:02:19.780> an<00:02:20.110> accountant
