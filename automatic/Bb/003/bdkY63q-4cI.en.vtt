00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.150
 simple mode on which to add 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.640
 our games 53 new as you can 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.320
 see we get the copper the zinc the me 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.360
 thrill the adamantium 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.289
 and the unics by the latter what 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.849
 we will get on the level 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.079
 It should be noted that from these 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.750
 five new minerals because we can 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.719
 create the 5 new types of armors 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.180
 tools and five new swords as well 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.410
 as well as two arcs as you can see 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.960
 I have here what had been the 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.560
 copper or cooper tool with your 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.290
 respective sword 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.960
 and tools and armors here we have 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.490
 the team armor as you can see here 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.350
 we have the sword and tim 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.190
 tools here we have the mitri and 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.160
 the armor and the sword and tools 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.019
 here here we will have the adamantium 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.940
 swords and the tools here we will have 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.070
 the onyx the sword and the tools 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.380
 to take out that to traffic us 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.040
 any of the swords armor 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.070
 we just have to follow the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.720
 basic characters of minecraft ie 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.790
 that are treated in the same way as a 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.310
 good traditional armor as you can 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.090
 see below 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.090
 how can you see 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.670
 as you can see it is activated from the same 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.840
 way that a traditional armor of 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.910
 village that would also be the 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.280
 materials if this salamantino we want 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.990
 one to issue as we put the meter if 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.050
 we want one of cooper we place of the 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.760
 cooper etcetera 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.560
 the truth that they also added us 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.810
 directing the onyx matures as they can 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.210
 see here the onyx sword 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.550
 and the onyx tools and these 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.200
 they exist in the same way as 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.789
 traditional minecraft armor 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.850
 It should be noted that he has also added 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.250
 with 302 new arcs the first one gives us 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:03.140
 efficiency so we can get a 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:06.140
 little more than what gives us a how can 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.990
 see three chops 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.720
 and kills in one fell swoop and the second 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.640
 what it does 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.630
 What knicks do is what 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.280
 here fires you learn fire for 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.230
 classify these arcs because we are going to 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.180
 need an iron ingot for the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.700
 of or for the thrill me issue road 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.230
 repeatedly of rope to get the 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.489
 metro and steal so let's try two 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.510
 ingots 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.220
 in this way and it will give us the inside 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.980
 in the same way for captured of the 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.560
 knicks we're going to need onÃ­s rocks that 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.659
 get character with two say and two 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.080
 pizzas of a google mix in this way 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:50.330
 will give us control 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.330
 and a diamond a lighter and rope 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.030
 besides adding these armor and 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:57.799
 these new bows also add us what 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:03.760
 what is this kind of fence 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.760
 of yes so a little more decorative 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:12.030
 as you can see it is now copper up 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.030
 the labels here we have the one of you 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.840
 as you can see here we have me thrill 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.540
 here the adamantium 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.590
 it's a little colorful and here onyx 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.840
 in the same way he also adds what 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.450
 that will be two new doors 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.959
 to grow what is being the 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.800
 bars so we're going to need to place 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.420
 the bars 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.670
 likewise terms added by 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.220
 the new one copper and one onyx 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.170
 as you can see below and these are 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.210
 character as a basic ripple of a 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.680
 minecraft door but changing the 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.890
 material 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.170
 if that later we hang or nicks and if it is 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.659
 super we put cooper the truth that the 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.549
 mod these tools the module then 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:00.790
 they are pretty good has a little more 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:04.160
 of damage than the normal ones at least 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:08.510
 it has more damage than those of onyx 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.550
 we have the demand and 71 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.700
 diamonds we have the one to issue that has 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.430
 plus 7 that same has a diamond spa 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.560
 we have the 55 and we will have the 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.680
 cooper that has a damage of more 5 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.070
 as well 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.289
 which the one that harms the most is the 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.539
 onyx that as you know this material what 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.199
 we will get in the same way 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:34.470
 terms added by two new ones one of 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.470
 let's say d 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.500
 demetrio and another one of onyx that fits 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.670
 emphasize that these are removed from the 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.500
 next way placing 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.790
 at least we want it to be broadcast 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.300
 we put me thrill and a monkey 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.150
 traditional and if we want the onyx 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.660
 we put onix and an oven 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.430
 traditional 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.380
 It should be noted that the latter goes more 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.920
 faster than 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.690
 I thrill and it's much faster than 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.950
 of traditional oven in the same way 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.720
 Motril is much faster than 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.090
 traditional but slower than that of 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.010
 onyx 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.300
 I hope that the motion of your liking does not 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.220
 forget that comment and thank not 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.220
 it costs nothing until the next and greetings
