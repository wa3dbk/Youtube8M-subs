00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.430
 we welcome you to our 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.589
 the channel on our site today I want 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.309
 tell how to connect the camera 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.639
 analog to dvr for sure 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.109
 eat analog camera standard well 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:22.230
 In this case, the camera was saved by technology 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:23.539
 if thousands of 1 2 gasoline connector 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.699
 will need 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:33.660
 we use screw connectors so 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:39.090
 more convenient power connector cable 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:44.149
 combined whom to myself 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.149
 DVR blackeye only 4 floor 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.280
 mean to start 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:01:00.040
 cable must be stripped from both sides 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.320
 if such convenient tools can 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.320
 use a regular stationery knife 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.100
 glad 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.100
 we clean the video cable we put on the cap 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.010
 if connector 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.659
 foil too unravel 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.619
 behind the ball center 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:46.040
 slightly unbend on the tile clip 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:51.480
 it will take more so thin 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:54.320
 Phillips screwdriver down the center 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.320
 bolt 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.420
 overdone 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.200
 this place 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.200
 there will not be such a bend 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.190
 we clamp the center 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.550
 now press the braid 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:46.830
 check that the sheath is nowhere 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:51.120
 touched the center close zucchini the same 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:55.370
 repeat the procedure with the second end 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.370
 that is, too, to bring their unbuckle 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:05.520
 so now it means protecting as if 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:10.700
 food in this case whom to 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.700
 but everyone was looking for a tight cable 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:25.650
 leave no order there four or five 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:29.650
 millimeters and we take we take the connector 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.069
 also screw connector power here 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.030
 signed plus or minus 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.030
 under the Phillips screwdriver 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.880
 we are determined that is, if we have 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:51.490
 red wire plus positive then he her on 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:59.340
 power unit is also a plus punch must 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:04:06.150
 first come, first let let go 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.150
 We are about to insert the cable and fix it 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.270
 harak 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.650
 the result should be like this 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:47.289
 here is the cable from the camera side 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.289
 benz and connector included 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:57.430
 food comes to the registrar 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.950
 Quincy connector is also compressed too 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.800
 connected and vodka vodka 2 supply 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.140
 standard 12 volt hazardous ie 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.640
 plus went to minus minus everything 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.400
 there is this outlet fotka it in 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.050
 the recorder is like this 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:16.050
 fly away 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:19.050
 4 entries in one of the codes will refuse 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.050
 camcorders 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:34.740
 this connects the camcorder question itself 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.270
 if it means cameras about internal then 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.700
 there is consumption they have enough 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:44.190
 a small this 150 200 milliamps is not 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:46.890
 more in this case is the power cable 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.960
 and how much can be reduced in principle to one 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:52.740
 here it is more convenient for you 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.080
 you can pull the wire there more 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.270
 cross-section to build up the cream already to fight 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.360
 solder it is a cable that anyone 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:03.330
 to here that is, on one unit you can 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:07.170
 cameras on the 2nd first hang in there yes there 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:09.570
 5 8 pieces it should not be heated well, too 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.830
 depends on the length of the line itself 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.630
 So tnank you 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.630
