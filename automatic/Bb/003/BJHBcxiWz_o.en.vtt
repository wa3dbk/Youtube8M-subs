earth colors are not really vital on the

earth colors are not really vital on the
palette<00:00:26.519> as<00:00:26.670> they<00:00:27.180> can<00:00:27.359> be<00:00:27.480> mixed<00:00:27.660> via<00:00:28.080> various

but having certain earth colors in the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.240 
but having certain earth colors in the
paint<00:00:33.450> collection<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.110> really<00:00:34.250> time-saving

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
paint collection is really time-saving

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.220 
paint collection is really time-saving
for<00:00:35.489> mixing<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.000> same<00:00:36.239> earth<00:00:36.600> color<00:00:36.930> from

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
for mixing the same earth color from

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.790 
for mixing the same earth color from
scratch<00:00:39.050> when<00:00:40.050> you're<00:00:40.200> starting<00:00:40.649> from

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
scratch when you're starting from

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.560 
scratch when you're starting from
scratch<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.370> have<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.640> watch<00:00:41.820> out<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.420> your

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
scratch you have to watch out that your

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.510 
scratch you have to watch out that your
color<00:00:42.809> doesn't<00:00:43.079> become<00:00:43.469> muddy<00:00:43.710> or<00:00:43.950> dull<00:00:44.219> and

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
color doesn't become muddy or dull and

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.940 
color doesn't become muddy or dull and
then<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.420> shrinker<00:00:45.840> ranges<00:00:46.320> there<00:00:46.530> are<00:00:46.680> so

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
then the shrinker ranges there are so

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.860 
then the shrinker ranges there are so
many<00:00:47.100> really<00:00:47.520> attractive<00:00:48.149> colors<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.780> you

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
many really attractive colors that you
