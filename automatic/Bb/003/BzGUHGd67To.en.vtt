00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
two regular battle droids one has this

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.490 
two regular battle droids one has this
sort<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:01.399> like<00:02:02.399> huge<00:02:02.759> gun<00:02:03.119> on<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:04.049> really

sort of like huge gun on it it's really

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.700 
sort of like huge gun on it it's really
cool<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.369> then<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.540> one<00:02:06.810> would<00:02:07.079> operate

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
cool and then this one would operate

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.969 
cool and then this one would operate
this<00:02:08.129> gun<00:02:08.750> you<00:02:09.750> would<00:02:09.869> think<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.319> clones<00:02:10.679> have

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
this gun you would think the clones have

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.160 
this gun you would think the clones have
this<00:02:11.220> but<00:02:11.459> they<00:02:11.580> don't

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
this but they don't

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.710 
this but they don't
so<00:02:12.680> this<00:02:12.950> is<00:02:13.160> this<00:02:13.460> and<00:02:13.910> that<00:02:13.940> comes<00:02:14.360> with<00:02:14.510> two

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
so this is this and that comes with two
