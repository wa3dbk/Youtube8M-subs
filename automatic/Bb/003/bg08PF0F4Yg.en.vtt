supposed to or not but I mean just a
little<00:05:08.000> tiny<00:05:08.270> problem<00:05:08.450> I<00:05:08.900> could<00:05:09.260> probably<00:05:09.440> get

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
little tiny problem I could probably get

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.000 
little tiny problem I could probably get
that<00:05:09.740> fixed<00:05:10.100> really<00:05:10.250> easily<00:05:10.670> and<00:05:11.770> that<00:05:12.770> would

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
that fixed really easily and that would

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.560 
that fixed really easily and that would
be<00:05:13.130> really<00:05:13.580> big<00:05:13.760> but<00:05:14.360> I<00:05:16.000> really<00:05:17.000> enjoy<00:05:17.390> this

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
be really big but I really enjoy this

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.660 
be really big but I really enjoy this
planet<00:05:17.990> because<00:05:18.380> I<00:05:18.950> feel<00:05:19.220> like<00:05:19.250> I'll<00:05:19.520> be<00:05:19.550> able

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
planet because I feel like I'll be able

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.630 
planet because I feel like I'll be able
to<00:05:19.850> take<00:05:20.090> another<00:05:20.300> step<00:05:20.810> up<00:05:21.350> there<00:05:21.830> whenever

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
to take another step up there whenever

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.340 
to take another step up there whenever
it<00:05:22.790> comes<00:05:22.910> to<00:05:23.210> auditioning<00:05:23.750> for<00:05:23.780> things<00:05:24.170> like

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
it comes to auditioning for things like

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.890 
it comes to auditioning for things like
what<00:05:25.040> if<00:05:25.190> I<00:05:25.340> get<00:05:25.550> first<00:05:25.790> chair<00:05:26.090> state<00:05:26.390> it

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
what if I get first chair state it

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.780 
what if I get first chair state it
probably<00:05:27.410> won't<00:05:27.590> happen<00:05:27.770> but<00:05:28.250> what<00:05:28.400> if<00:05:28.490> I<00:05:28.610> get

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
probably won't happen but what if I get

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.210 
probably won't happen but what if I get
in<00:05:28.880> like<00:05:29.000> first<00:05:29.270> row<00:05:29.600> which<00:05:30.290> might<00:05:30.770> not<00:05:30.980> happen

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
in like first row which might not happen

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
if you're to that point where you feel

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.430 
if you're to that point where you feel
like<00:06:37.180> you're<00:06:38.180> getting<00:06:38.330> as<00:06:38.539> far<00:06:38.780> as<00:06:38.990> you<00:06:39.110> can<00:06:39.259> go

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
like you're getting as far as you can go

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.430 
like you're getting as far as you can go
with<00:06:39.620> your<00:06:39.800> clarinet<00:06:40.099> and<00:06:40.870> your<00:06:41.870> tone<00:06:42.139> and

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780 
quality isn't producing enough to get

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.390 
quality isn't producing enough to get
you<00:06:44.900> further<00:06:45.199> then<00:06:45.889> you<00:06:46.099> should<00:06:46.280> definitely
