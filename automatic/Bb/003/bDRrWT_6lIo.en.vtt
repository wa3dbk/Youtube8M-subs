00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.680
 do 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.579

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.520
 to say more 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.030
 gta is just a cult so let's see 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.910
 times 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.589
 there we have the game looks too 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.549
 very nice from the way it is the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.799
 version 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.580
 that's what it looks like for you 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.900
 playstation 3 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.939
 Grand Theft Auto 5 Rockstar Games 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:19.350
 absolutely cool on the side of the whole 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.330
 looks like this and the back is so yes 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.710
 absolutely great game I can still 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.479
 do not believe that I already own 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.270
 May I just be that very me 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.970
 I know I have to live and gamble 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.460
 Above all , he was immediately present and 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.079
 I can already play that is 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.250
 unbelievably beautiful for me 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.170
 and of course you may be the first 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:46.250
 who can see here what's in it so 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:49.170
 at first glance that nothing in it 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.030
 moment which the cd maybe still 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.780
 to the envelope moment has its 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.780
 message for me 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.070
 stop gta 5 stops there and is 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.930
 there will be nothing to shake off here 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.250
 no matter if you are here or not 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:14.940
 look at the ean code if you like me 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:16.080
 So say collect here 50 26 55 54 00 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.709
 32 9 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.900
 but it is the erento of the gta 4 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.800
 international version 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.319
 I would have come to that if 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.700
 the water is crazy so I know 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.840
 not even the thing like me 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.519
 I thought no scope 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.050
 We had to notice that 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.050
 that he escapes is wrong
