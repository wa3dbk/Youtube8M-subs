daylight savings time hit the time zone
1<00:01:51.280> which<00:01:51.459> is<00:01:52.090> over<00:01:52.299> here<00:01:53.459> were<00:01:54.459> five<00:01:54.850> because

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
1 which is over here were five because

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.980 
1 which is over here were five because
we're<00:01:55.810> Pacific<00:01:56.560> Standard<00:01:56.740> Time<00:01:57.689> my<00:01:58.689> videos

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
we're Pacific Standard Time my videos

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.370 
we're Pacific Standard Time my videos
are<00:01:59.170> in<00:01:59.200> Pacific<00:01:59.770> Standard<00:01:59.920> Time<00:02:00.389> so<00:02:01.389> you<00:02:02.229> also

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
are in Pacific Standard Time so you also

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.139 
are in Pacific Standard Time so you also
could<00:02:02.590> revisit<00:02:02.829> the<00:02:03.100> manual<00:02:03.459> that<00:02:03.819> would<00:02:03.969> tell

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
could revisit the manual that would tell

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.109 
could revisit the manual that would tell
you<00:02:05.100> what<00:02:06.100> time<00:02:06.310> zone<00:02:06.340> you<00:02:06.639> will<00:02:06.729> send<00:02:06.969> out

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
you what time zone you will send out

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.690 
you what time zone you will send out
this<00:02:07.329> once<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.140> do<00:02:08.259> that<00:02:08.289> the<00:02:09.160> clock<00:02:09.429> also

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
this once you do that the clock also

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.870 
this once you do that the clock also
sets<00:02:10.209> itself<00:02:10.560> there's<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.800> built-in<00:02:12.250> batteries

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
sets itself there's a built-in batteries

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.589 
sets itself there's a built-in batteries
like<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:13.450> know<00:02:14.160> watch<00:02:15.160> type<00:02:15.459> of<00:02:15.610> battery<00:02:15.880> so

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
like a you know watch type of battery so

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.199 
like a you know watch type of battery so
if<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.780> power<00:02:16.990> goes<00:02:17.050> out<00:02:17.380> you're<00:02:17.620> protected

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
if the power goes out you're protected

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.600 
if the power goes out you're protected
so<00:02:19.209> let's<00:02:19.750> just<00:02:20.200> look<00:02:20.830> around<00:02:21.190> this<00:02:21.400> little

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
so let's just look around this little

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.290 
so let's just look around this little
unit<00:02:22.030> here

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
unit here

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.260 
unit here
so<00:02:24.050> you<00:02:24.140> will<00:02:24.410> see<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.890> alarm<00:02:25.430> volume<00:02:25.700> on<00:02:26.090> this

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
so you will see the alarm volume on this

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.260 
so you will see the alarm volume on this
left<00:02:27.020> side<00:02:27.110> you<00:02:27.860> got<00:02:28.010> high<00:02:28.190> or<00:02:28.400> low<00:02:28.580> and<00:02:29.180> you

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
left side you got high or low and you

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.580 
left side you got high or low and you
can<00:02:29.300> just<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.780> alarm<00:02:30.640> by<00:02:31.640> moving<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.030> switch

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
can just the alarm by moving the switch

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.730 
can just the alarm by moving the switch
so<00:02:33.590> if<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:33.770> move<00:02:33.950> it<00:02:34.300> move<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.450> top<00:02:35.660> one<00:02:35.900> to

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
so if you move it move the top one to

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.260 
so if you move it move the top one to
buzzer<00:02:37.100> or<00:02:37.250> or<00:02:37.670> anything<00:02:37.910> for<00:02:38.480> alarm<00:02:40.270> Chris

this<00:02:41.420> thing<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:42.920> can<00:02:43.070> set<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.400> different

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
this thing you can set the different

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.160 
this thing you can set the different
time<00:02:44.030> that<00:02:44.900> you<00:02:44.960> want<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.260> alarm<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.620> go<00:02:45.740> off<00:02:45.770> it

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.590 

let's<00:02:51.170> set<00:02:51.320> it<00:02:51.410> at<00:02:51.500> 7:15<00:02:52.160> it's<00:02:52.760> really<00:02:53.120> simple

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
let's set it at 7:15 it's really simple

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.820 
let's set it at 7:15 it's really simple
to<00:02:53.840> use<00:02:53.870> intuitive<00:02:58.300> switch<00:02:59.300> your<00:02:59.420> back<00:02:59.830> goes

need<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.810> set<00:03:06.020> both<00:03:06.610> so<00:03:07.610> you<00:03:07.670> know<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:07.850> don't

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
need to set both so you know you don't

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000 
need to set both so you know you don't
have<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.240> keep<00:03:08.360> on<00:03:08.480> changing<00:03:08.690> time<00:03:09.080> you<00:03:09.830> need

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
have to keep on changing time you need
