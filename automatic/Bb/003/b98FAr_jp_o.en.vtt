 in this epic I oppose the the 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.010
 common thread of the whole adventure is 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.539
 always the same as bad pigs 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.460
 they have eggs and it will be ours 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.350
 task to recover them by defeating i 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.829
 enemies that will try to stop us from 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.449
 do it compared to the classic girls in 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.969
 this new game is introduced one 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.859
 gdr component we are struggling with a 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.600
 turn-based combat and heroes a 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.159
 arrangement have features 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.659
 classic role-playing games 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.819
 let's go to the main page of the 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:01.199
 game that this is what you see and see 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:04.269
 what presents us at the corners we find the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.890
 these are the basic options 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.380
 settings that allow us to 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.979
 change the volumes to go to the shop 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.970
 to access the information look 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.980
 cartoons and open the keyboard 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.460
 we immediately get to the heart of the fin game 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.290
 from the first start because it is not there 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.280
 nothing else then we are ready to 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.290
 start our adventures here at the top 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.980
 you can see the models in the coins of 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.650
 exchange there are coins in gold 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:39.700
 silver and these diamonds all three 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.370
 they are acquired in game by winning the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.980
 matches and all are bought also 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.250
 on the shop yes because this game like 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:51.000
 many others and a shop entry born 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.310
 here top left green level 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.390
 it must also be reached at the bottom right 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.250
 we have our kitchen in mind 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.410
 our camp where we can 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.590
 build new weapons upgrade 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:08.050
 those we have and in general 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.450
 equip our heroes like you 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.440
 I said before this is the warrior with 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.760
 shield and sword 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:21.810
 these are the amy that I forged 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.239
 this the magician this and cleric e 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.680
 this is the pirate the other warrior 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.790
 fighter what does damage in short 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.500
 each of these has weapons and 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:37.950
 specifications that can be created 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:39.299
 through the attacking kitchen here 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.450
 then these are the weapons of attack 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.579
 these are the defensive weapons and here the 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.959
 raw materials besides this we can 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.260
 also create emotions that there 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.349
 can help in the game for example 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.760
 this is a potion that returns 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.090
 life points when ingested by 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.909
 heroes 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:02.790
 each one of them you can take for a 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:05.609
 each round is the field of 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:10.440
 battle in short the journey we have 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:16.340
 various locations that allow us to 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:23.069
 example of access to the laboratory e 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:27.180
 to the training area and other spaces a 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.680
 along the way therefore these are the 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.690
 basic features as you see i 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.160
 there are spoiled chests scattered around 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.609
 along the way to allow us these 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:40.099
 to have extra prizes 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.099
 at this point we enter a battle 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.620
 perfect, here we are on the battlefield 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.540
 ready to defeat our opponents 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.430
 therefore the turn-based game as it said 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.470
 at the beginning therefore the first to move 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.560
 it will be you after which intelligence 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.579
 artificial as it will stick to 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.980
 attack 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.099
 you have to drag your own angry 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.060
 birds towards opponents 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.659
 what you have seen is a little pope who 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.019
 I will explain to you shortly afterwards 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.019
 first attacks 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.790
 we will wait wait for the attack of the 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:17.070
 of myths every angri bers has three types of 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.169
 attacks or at least three types of powers 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.729
 first the simple attack the second 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.849
 to the special attack what is 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:26.930
 use when the chili is 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:29.389
 completely full and it happens 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:33.430
 after a number of attacks on each attack 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.430
 killed priest fills up a little more 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.780
 the third power they have is a 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.970
 spell they make on their allies 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.160
 this for example by holding here 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.470
 we get blame because you have seen it before 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.530
 which gives us information about the individual 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.410
 angry birds is this here for example 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.830
 as a spell increases the power 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:58.340
 of attack of all the friends for which 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:03.139
 we know about him and how you see sphere 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:05.419
 that is from the bars to the others this one too 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.449
 lets put that shield on 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:11.990
 all the others 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:14.570
 this one instead from a wing of strength 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:18.110
 all the agri birds suffer 25 of 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.910
 less damage if we activate these then 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.150
 on the screen here you can see three 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.800
 keys for the command below a 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.889
 right the one that allows you to send 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.370
 forward the fight automatically 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.690
 this which gives access to the potions and ai 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.970
 foods we talked about before 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.810
 this is where he pauses and does 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:42.169
 share the game now man front 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.760
 then magically this book 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.130
 in my opinion it is really very much 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.570
 cute and what i can tell you that 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.880
 for those who have also followed others 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.430
 chapters is inevitable is something that goes 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.300
 that must be played because it really is 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.550
 funny 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.590
 I would certainly recommend it to those who don't 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.990
 has ever tried to others because it is a 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.050
 a little atypical game 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:06.010
 you will not find so many so soon 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:08.260
 its from store and after the first levels after 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:12.270
 the first games that are a little bit 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:15.460
 boring earns a lot in fun 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.940
 all this for this video review 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.940
 See you next time
