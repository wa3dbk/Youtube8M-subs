take action against whoever is kind of

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.690 
take action against whoever is kind of
sabotaging<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.620> events<00:00:50.039> surely<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:50.610> gonna

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
sabotaging the events surely it's gonna

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.010 
sabotaging the events surely it's gonna
be<00:00:50.879> Tatia<00:00:51.239> because<00:00:51.570> he's<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> main<00:00:51.989> character

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
be Tatia because he's the main character

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.660 
be Tatia because he's the main character
and<00:00:52.530> whenever<00:00:52.680> stuff<00:00:53.010> like<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.250> happens

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
and whenever stuff like this happens

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
he's kind of around to like fix

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.770 
he's kind of around to like fix
everyone's<00:00:55.920> mess<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.520> enjoyed<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.210> first<00:00:57.390> arc

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
everyone's mess I enjoyed the first arc

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.299 
everyone's mess I enjoyed the first arc
for<00:00:58.079> enrollment<00:00:58.440> because<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.980> thought<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.250> was

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
for enrollment because I thought it was

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.760 
for enrollment because I thought it was
paced<00:00:59.609> fairly<00:01:00.210> well<00:01:00.449> for<00:01:01.170> an<00:01:01.320> introductory

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
paced fairly well for an introductory

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.130 
paced fairly well for an introductory
arc<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.609> expected<00:01:03.120> after<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.629> enrollment

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
arc and I expected after the enrollment

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.660 
arc and I expected after the enrollment
arc<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.589> plot<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.070> really<00:01:05.309> pick<00:01:05.519> up

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
arc for the plot to really pick up

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.690 
arc for the plot to really pick up
because<00:01:06.479> whereas<00:01:07.439> enrollment<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> bit<00:01:08.520> more

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
because whereas enrollment is a bit more

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.149 
because whereas enrollment is a bit more
slow<00:01:09.000> pace<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:09.600> given<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> luxury<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.799> be<00:01:10.890> slow

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
slow pace if given the luxury to be slow

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.410 
slow pace if given the luxury to be slow
paced<00:01:11.430> at<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.729> beginning<00:01:12.030> because<00:01:12.390> people

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
paced at the beginning because people

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.510 
paced at the beginning because people
need<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.900> catch<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.350> how<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.590> world<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
need to catch on to how the world is and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.429 
need to catch on to how the world is and
people<00:01:15.119> kind<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.390> need<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.570> settle<00:01:15.960> into<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
people kind of need to settle into the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.929 
people kind of need to settle into the
dynamics<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> characters<00:01:17.670> their

explaining<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.130> lot<00:01:29.310> more<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.759> magic<00:01:30.240> stuff

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
explaining a lot more of the magic stuff

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.749

which<00:01:30.689> I'm<00:01:30.869> really<00:01:31.170> enjoying<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.979> found<00:01:32.579> that

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
which I'm really enjoying I found that

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.310 
which I'm really enjoying I found that
like<00:01:33.030> some<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.479> high<00:01:33.630> school<00:01:33.900> scenes<00:01:34.140> I

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
like some of the high school scenes I

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.780 
like some of the high school scenes I
just<00:01:34.530> don't<00:01:34.710> want<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.950> see<00:01:35.130> maybe<00:01:35.610> it's

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
just don't want to see maybe it's

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.510 
just don't want to see maybe it's
because<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.509> magic<00:01:36.960> scenes<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.280> use<00:01:38.490> of

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
because the magic scenes and the use of

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.360 
because the magic scenes and the use of
magic<00:01:39.090> makes<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.720> students

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
magic makes the students

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.340 
magic makes the students
seem<00:01:40.610> really<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:41.210> don't<00:01:41.450> like<00:01:41.660> so<00:01:42.020> when<00:01:42.140> I<00:01:42.170> see

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
seem really and don't like so when I see

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.410 
seem really and don't like so when I see
the<00:01:42.500> collapsed<00:01:43.220> into<00:01:43.520> like<00:01:43.670> a<00:01:43.700> high<00:01:44.000> school

light novel the story is told from Tatsu
s<00:02:13.340> perspective<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.390> because<00:02:14.720> it's<00:02:14.870> Tatsuya's

inner<00:02:17.330> monologue<00:02:18.020> how<00:02:18.470> we<00:02:18.530> views<00:02:18.920> other

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
inner monologue how we views other

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.730 
inner monologue how we views other

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
students and just in general has insight

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.040 
students and just in general has insight
in<00:02:22.040> some<00:02:22.520> of<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.790> magic<00:02:23.270> or<00:02:23.450> like<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.900> other

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
in some of the magic or like the other

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.110 
in some of the magic or like the other
abilities<00:02:24.590> that<00:02:24.740> other<00:02:24.830> students<00:02:25.340> have<00:02:25.520> and<00:02:25.880> I

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
abilities that other students have and I

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.610 
abilities that other students have and I
think<00:02:26.150> this<00:02:26.390> is<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.540> really<00:02:26.780> key<00:02:27.080> point<00:02:27.350> in<00:02:27.530> the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
think this is a really key point in the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.640 
think this is a really key point in the
light<00:02:27.830> novel<00:02:28.190> because<00:02:28.940> Tatsuya<00:02:29.900> knows<00:02:30.200> what

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
light novel because Tatsuya knows what

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.480 
light novel because Tatsuya knows what
everyone<00:02:31.100> is<00:02:31.190> doing

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
everyone is doing

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.980 
everyone is doing

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
he'll never go up to someone and ask

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.350 
he'll never go up to someone and ask
them<00:02:33.260> what<00:02:33.470> are<00:02:33.500> using<00:02:33.860> what<00:02:34.610> spell<00:02:34.910> sequence

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
them what are using what spell sequence

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.360 
them what are using what spell sequence
was<00:02:35.540> that<00:02:35.720> what<00:02:36.230> activation<00:02:36.860> numbers<00:02:37.220> to

complex in the mahouka world and in the
it<00:03:43.329> just<00:03:43.510> doesn't<00:03:43.900> seem<00:03:44.290> as<00:03:44.620> complex<00:03:45.159> just

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
it just doesn't seem as complex just

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.000 
it just doesn't seem as complex just
