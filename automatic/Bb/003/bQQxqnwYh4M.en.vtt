 Aki Hiramoto is an unsuccessful car 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:19.610
 According to the author 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:25.020
 95% of people can not achieve their dreams and goals 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:30.570
 The statistics show that only a percentage can realize the dreams and goals 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:36.810
 But if you ask me, 95% of people do n't have dreams 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:44.100
 95% of people are not really found what they really want to do 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:45.010
 So in fact true but is said to say come true do it without giving up certainly not last until the end 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.760
 I do not want to 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.630

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:01.220
 If I ask you like that, I'll come 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:04.500
 I got a musician to study abroad in the United States 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.370
 I want to play on music TV 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.670

 I put on is not only go there because it is Hey again 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:46.700
 Your dream will be lowered and you will lose your motivation. 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:52.250
 What should I do with my labor? 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:57.980
 To realize the bottle with a fast and compatible director feeling to reproduce 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:02.090

 I will reproduce what comes in motion , and if I reproduce it I will not have it 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.510
 Is not that a good sense of unity that is beyond Yappa 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:36.640
 For him, he is a student or a musician 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:41.770
 This sense of unity excuse to remember the words rather than music TV 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:45.819
 Are also Yarita Itteyuu people you enjoyed the purpose of different music depending on the person 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:51.189
 But do you want to say to obtain the important is the word for him 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:57.069
 It is decided that it is because it is good, but it is not decided 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:58.140
 So it is so I asked me if no way can immediately be Kai Thats said, beyond 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:04.080
 Ne

 Because there is an international exchange hall where foreign exchange students are coming in the neighborhood, I will say it and play it 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.069
 I will 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.700

 There is a look at the relative value when you're saying you want input with Daigi members Nde interpersonal likes 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:47.900
 It's all about the percentage and he 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.250
 It sounds to join us without studying in the US 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.950
 Music is good 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.000
 The older brother who manages the diamond meeting will come 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.880
 Without such a human thing life 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.030
 A person who is said to have made a dream come true 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:12.460
 Why does he act as a tire 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:14.230
 Beyond the words, if you are in oneness music, you can taste the same sense of values 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:20.560

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:27.580
 I like coaching in such a way i What is it while reproducing the scene that was achieved 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:29.360
 It is good to draw out and say that the form changes the hope that every human being makes a dream come true 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:35.000
 Can 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:41.270
 Not only be decided first place in the child Itarubi the time of the other two people because it is sputum take the gold medal 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:45.020
 But what appearance aye-aye and its values are reproduced in humanity Museum from after the gold medal 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:48.849
 Pull them out and change their hopes 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:55.779
