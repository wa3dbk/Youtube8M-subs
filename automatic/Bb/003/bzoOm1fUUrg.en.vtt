00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.390
 If you are an implant patient, you can manage your teeth and gums well. 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.990
 I can say that you are people. 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.280
 After finishing in Finland, everything is all settled and now 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.280
 You can chew. 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:18.740
 No post-management of implants. 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.409
 It is important that Finland is big. 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:25.339
 We are daring to light up our bodies and go to the next 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.439
 To manage 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.430
 The Ministry of Environment receives the excellent crunch abuse and then 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.530
 Regular dental care through proper brushing 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.350
 What matters is very important 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.110
 So there are not many of these 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.470
 Among 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.840
 I have a medium-sized toothpaste that works against them. 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.110
 Your use will be a great help in post-implant management. 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.110
 I would 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.260
 What are the 24 features? Toothpaste with essential oils 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.250
 I will 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.720
 Essential to essential 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.560
 Although it seems to be as easy as Han Kyung Kyung 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.950
 Essential oils and anti-inflammatory effects that contain such 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.590
 The same complaint, not being repurchased at the appropriate rate 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.760
 I had it. 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.200
 Asanshi also has implants for those who have implants. 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.270
 Those who do not have good gingival care even if you do not. 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.580
 Kim's women are men and women's 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.720
 Because you are through menopause, gums 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.970
 greatly 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.060
 One of the toothpastes I would highly recommend to these people 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.010
 The gums in your dentist are not good or your face is over 0. 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.850
 For those who suffer 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.590
 We have a lot of politics in Boston 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.770
 You're having a pony. 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.770
 The people who received the money could feel the effects. 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.730
 A lot of employees 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.440
 I have an as 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.440
 Good sales. 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.050
 Previously on the Internet 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.669
 I do not want it. 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.349
 He said. 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.349
 esc 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.899
 mta 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:17.369
 I bought it from 'siz.com' 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:21.549
 There must be a lawrence. The camera is actually ge 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.999
 You should be highest at 30 mm
