 for millions of years they have 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.540
 discovered thousands and millions of species 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.879
 new around the world of the 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.519
 which only one million four hundred thousand 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:15.860
 have received a name and of which the 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.960
 70 percent of them are fatal to 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.840
 the human being as much as species 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.750
 carnivorous as poisonous 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.170
 Well in this video you will know the seven 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.760
 most poisonous species from around the world 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.760
 number 7 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.609
 the pufferfish the flesh of the wolfhound is a 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.769
 Manjar in Japan as food and korea as 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:43.620
 the focus but the problem is that in your 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.780
 skin and in some organs are 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.409
 toxins capable of killing beings 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.109
 humans 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:50.850
 this fish produces a rapid death and 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:54.030
 violent when swelling the tongue and 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.820
 lips also causes dizziness vomiting 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.729
 Tachycardia difficulty breathing and 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.039
 muscle paralysis the victims die 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.589
 by asphyxia in a maximum of 24 hours 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.890
 because the diaphragm muscles are 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.860
 paralyze there is no known antidote 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.750
 most of the deaths caused by 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.090
 their ingestion occur when they are 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.970
 untrained people who capture 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.310
 and prepare the fish statistics 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.830
 show that there were between 20 and 44 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.490
 incidents of fire poisoning 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.520
 per year between 1996 and 2006 throughout the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.049
 Japan only licensed cooks 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.049
 they are authorized for its preparation 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.369
 number 6 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.460
 frog dart these frogs are characterized 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.040
 popularly for its shiny skin and 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.680
 colored have a coloration apos 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.750
 thematic range of colors goes from 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.869
 bright orange and bluish black 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.850
 yellow and red measures 5 centimeters 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.159
 long and has enough poison to 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.850
 kill 10 human adults or 20,000 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.880
 mice 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.459
 only 2 micrograms of this lethal toxin 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.679
 the amount that fits in the head of a 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.650
 pin is able to kill a mammal 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.840
 large its toxic secretions the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.550
 Native Amerindians use to 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.710
 poison the tips of their boats 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.450
 they can make you sick or kill any 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.450
 person who touches them or eats them 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.990
 number 5 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.610
 snake taipan inside this snake 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.920
 inhabits the interior of australia and so 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.989
 only one sting contains enough 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.800
 poison to kill 100 human adults 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:50.890
 or to an army of 250 thousand mice its 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.530
 poison is approximately 200 to 400 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.540
 times more toxic than a common cobra and 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.620
 can kill an adult human being in 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.450
 only 45 minutes fortunately not 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.879
 many deaths have been documented 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.160
 for this cause because the few 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:10.290
 people who have been bitten by this 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.290
 snake are treated on time 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.379
 number 4 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.019
 Brazilian wandering spider the wandering spider 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.700
 Brazilian appears in the book of 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.980
 Guinness records as the spider more 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.010
 poisonous and responsible for as much 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.080
 of human deaths is believed to have the 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.720
 most potent neurotoxic venom 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.910
 any living spider only a minimum 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.549
 Amount of milligrams is enough 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.170
 to kill a mouse are also very 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.480
 dangerous for their ability to 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.660
 hide in highly populated areas 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.049
 inside the houses in the clothes shoes 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.180
 and cars his poisonous bite not only 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.519
 causes intense pain but that 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.980
 it can also cause an erection 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.739
 uncomfortable that lasts long hours and drives 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.019
 to impotence the most dangerous spider 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.840
 of all is not something that many 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.690
 like that's why this spider is so 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.690
 feared many people catch them and 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.459
 they kill because they do not want to take the risk 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.980
 its poison is able to paralyze the 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:18.000
 muscles of the human body causing 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.000
 a slow and painful death 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.210
 number 3 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.960
 golden scorpion contrary to the 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.630
 popular belief that most of 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.280
 the scorpions are relatively 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.680
 harmless to humans because their 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.680
 bites only produce local effects 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.810
 numbness , pain or swelling the 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.910
 golden scorpion is a kind of high 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.400
 dangerousness since its poison is a 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.800
 potent cocktail of neurotoxins that causes 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.520
 an intense and unbearable pain to which 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.950
 followed by fever, coma, seizures 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.230
 paralysis and death fortunately 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.510
 although the sting of this scorpion is 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.750
 extremely painful is unlikely 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:06.110
 that I killed a healthy adult human being the 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.630
 Elderly or sick young children with 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.480
 a heart condition if they are in a 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:15.250
 higher risk this species lives in the 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.250
 North of Africa and the Middle East 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.320
 number 2 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.320
 octopus with blue rings the octopus 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.660
 blue rings is the size of a 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.730
 golf ball , but its venom is so 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.640
 powerful that can kill a person 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.800
 It carries enough poison 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.790
 kill 26 adults in question of 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.440
 minutes and there is no anti poison 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.350
 is currently recognized as one of 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.090
 the most poisonous animals in the world its 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.370
 painless sting may seem 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.780
 harmless but neurotoxic 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.270
 mortals begin to work 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.580
 immediately and cause weakness 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.830
 muscular numbness followed by a 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.650
 cessation of breathing and finally the 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.810
 death can be found in the ocean 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.810
 pacific from japan to australia 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.890
 number 1 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.629
 the jellyfish the first place for the animal 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.810
 most poisonous in the world is for the jellyfish 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:27.099
 almost 6000 deaths have been recorded 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.870
 since 1954 his poison is one of 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:31.509
 the most deadly in the world because their 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:34.389
 toxins attack the heart the system 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:36.400
 nervous and skin cells and what 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:38.169
 worst of all is that his poison is so 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.180
 overwhelmingly painful that the 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:42.490
 human victims drown after entering 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.349
 in a state of shock from pain and this 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.169
 it prevents them from reaching the shore in time 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:49.509
 the survivors have referred pain 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:52.240
 weeks after having had contact 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:54.069
 with this marine animal if it is 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.560
 chopped by a jellyfish and get to 

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:58.780
 survive you should apply vinegar for a 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.630
 minimum of 30 seconds until reaching the 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.220
 hospital this product contains acid 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.289
 acetic which disables 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.419
 poison nematocysts that have not yet 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:10.620
 reached the bloodstream though 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:10.620
 this does not relieve the pain
