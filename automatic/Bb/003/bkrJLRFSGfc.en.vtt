00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
down on the tough like sheet I made

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.790 
down on the tough like sheet I made
about<00:01:38.270> three<00:01:38.540> pancakes<00:01:39.080> out<00:01:39.290> of<00:01:39.440> this<00:01:39.560> batter

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
but that could be more if you make

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.210 
but that could be more if you make
smaller<00:01:42.170> circles<00:01:44.229> next<00:01:45.229> we<00:01:45.380> are<00:01:45.530> going<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.830> put

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
half went by and now it's time to flip

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.960 
half went by and now it's time to flip
the<00:01:55.729> pancakes<00:01:56.240> I<00:01:57.070> flipped<00:01:58.070> my<00:01:58.160> pancakes<00:01:58.729> by

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
the pancakes I flipped my pancakes by

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.670

onto another tray with the Teflon sheet

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.510 
onto another tray with the Teflon sheet
and<00:02:03.050> then<00:02:03.950> I<00:02:04.220> gently<00:02:04.670> pull<00:02:05.300> the<00:02:05.840> sheet<00:02:06.110> off

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.210 
after that I smooth the top of the
pancakes<00:02:10.269> and<00:02:11.269> then<00:02:12.140> we<00:02:12.380> put<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.800> pancakes

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
pancakes and then we put the pancakes

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.160 
pancakes and then we put the pancakes
back<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.760> dehydrator<00:02:14.239> for<00:02:14.630> one<00:02:14.810> more<00:02:15.019> hour

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.680 
back in the dehydrator for one more hour
after<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.220> hour<00:02:16.370> is<00:02:16.670> done<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:17.180> just<00:02:17.420> leave<00:02:17.540> the
