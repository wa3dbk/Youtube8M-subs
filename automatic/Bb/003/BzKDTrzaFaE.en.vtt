00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.420
 EX-010 will now have three real sounds 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.630
 Cm7, Cm7's is 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:18.949
 At minors, I lowered some sounds half a tone 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.950
 At the time of the seventh, either string 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.569
 Lowered by 2 frets 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:25.880
 Cm 7 if you do both 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.640
 There is C 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.190
 If m and 7 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.880
 Cm7 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.239
 If you leave this ring finger 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.120
 Play all 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.160
 It will be said that 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.220
 Hey this 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.560
 Is it jazzy 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.400
 If you try to hold down Bossa Nova 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.420
 Middle finger has 6 strings 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.380
 So, hold the lower 4 with your ring finger 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.020
 Do not play 5 strings 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.790
 This is the middle finger 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:04.980
 Because I am touching the strings 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.170
 I don't hear 5 strings 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.030
 If it is in this state 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.460
 There are 5 strings in the way 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.770
 You can also press Cm7 which does not sound 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.370
 So 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.200
 Takatsu × 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.600
 It is such a thing 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.400
 Well, now 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.700
 These harmonics sounds 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.560
 It sounds with eight frets 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:55.800
 Taka × Ku 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:12.500
 Taku × Tsuku 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:19.800
 × カ

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:22.589
 This is Cm7 here 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:26.219
 Please do the same thing 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:33.100
 This is what is called basic practice, isn't it? 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:41.679
 What does it mean to do basic practice? And 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:44.279
 I think there are people who can be convinced and people who can not be convinced 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:49.469
 I also do people who can not be convinced 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:53.419
 Then I'm not doing it because I'm doing the basics 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.519
 When playing something else 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.800
 It becomes easy to play difficult songs 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.600
 It will play if it does the basics 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.600
 If you don't have the basics, it will be extremely difficult 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.800
 After all, if you are doing something like this 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.100
 Slide the code or 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:24.319
 Attack's 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.939
 Although it is misleading to say that it is not constant 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.500
 What kind of thing is 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.100
 Not playing all strings but playing strings in parts 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.870
 This will eventually play the rhythm with cutting 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.930
 Play rhythm with chords 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.020
 While moving a little 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.610
 I'm going to play 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.500
 The number is 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.979
 I'm picking six now but now 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.720
 Because it is the lead guitar that I was picking a small number 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.400
 I think that this is the lead guitar of the lead guitar, but 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:12.949
 This is also really a rhythm guitar 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.219
 Originally 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.949
 For example, 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.820
 I'm playing all strings 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:45.319
 Only one sound 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:47.629
 I can not hear you 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:50.059
 Even though we are playing six 

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:53.289
 The other five are brushed 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.159
 Only one of them is now the index finger 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:00.900
 Because only this sound is held by the index finger 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.800
 Next time I will add my ring finger 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.509
 To the extension of this 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:21.800
 There is a lead guitar 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:34.439
 I say the concept of 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:39.909
 Know that kind of heart 

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:42.559
 If you know the various know-how of playing chords, actually, at the time of lead guitar 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:44.969
 Which sound should I use? What is it? 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:47.900
 If you know the code, you can play it 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.900
 I will do my best 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.700
 First of all, such a feeling
