useful for you anyway I made this world
in<00:00:27.119> response<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.869> lot<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.289> your<00:00:28.410> suggestions

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
especially after I made a video which I

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.680 
especially after I made a video which I
introduced<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.579> test<00:00:35.820> world<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.390> was<00:00:36.540> all

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
introduced a test world that was all

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.590 
introduced a test world that was all
snow<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.730> some<00:00:38.730> people<00:00:39.030> didn't<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.360> lot<00:00:39.570> of

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
snow and some people didn't a lot of

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.350 
snow and some people didn't a lot of
people<00:00:39.750> did<00:00:40.110> like<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.370> now<00:00:41.760> realize

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
people did like that and I now realize

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.830 
people did like that and I now realize
why<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.989> was<00:00:43.379> disorienting<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.700> White<00:00:45.539> was

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
why it was disorienting the White was

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.190 
why it was disorienting the White was
hard<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.469> eyes<00:00:46.910> but<00:00:47.910> gaining<00:00:48.899> my

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
hard on the eyes but gaining my

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.990 
hard on the eyes but gaining my
knowledge<00:00:49.590> from<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.309> your<00:00:50.430> suggestions

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000

here's what I decided on I want neutral
colors<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.760> want<00:00:54.180> something<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.629> makes<00:00:54.780> it

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
colors I want something that makes it

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.340 
colors I want something that makes it
easy<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.289> tell<00:00:55.640> how<00:00:56.640> many<00:00:56.699> blocks<00:00:57.350> is

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
easy to tell how many blocks is

easy to tell how many blocks is
something<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.399> distance<00:00:59.850> I'm<00:01:00.090> going<00:01:00.390> to

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
something is in distance I'm going to

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.420 
something is in distance I'm going to

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.500 

it<00:03:33.110> took<00:03:33.319> a<00:03:33.379> while<00:03:33.590> to<00:03:33.890> figure<00:03:34.190> it<00:03:34.310> out<00:03:34.400> but<00:03:35.090> in

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
it took a while to figure it out but in

it took a while to figure it out but in
cities<00:03:35.810> in<00:03:35.989> a<00:03:36.050> button<00:03:36.410> it<00:03:36.890> uses<00:03:37.099> a<00:03:37.280> pressure

some visual artifacts here but that's

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.430 
some visual artifacts here but that's
just<00:03:49.030> because<00:03:49.150> too<00:03:49.600> much<00:03:49.720> is<00:03:49.780> going<00:03:49.959> on<00:03:50.260> at
