right<00:00:45.620> so<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.160> first<00:00:46.400> step<00:00:46.640> that<00:00:46.670> we've<00:00:46.970> done

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
right so the first step that we've done

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.440 
right so the first step that we've done
is<00:00:47.450> we've<00:00:47.930> taken<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:48.560> cable<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:49.240> I<00:00:50.240> have

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
is we've taken the cable and I have

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.840 
is we've taken the cable and I have
sliced<00:00:51.080> a<00:00:51.350> little<00:00:51.410> bit<00:00:51.800> off<00:00:51.950> of<00:00:51.980> each<00:00:52.370> end<00:00:52.670> with

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
sliced a little bit off of each end with

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.540 
sliced a little bit off of each end with
the<00:00:52.940> wire<00:00:53.120> strippers<00:00:53.630> and<00:00:54.010> separated<00:00:55.010> out<00:00:55.160> the

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
the wire strippers and separated out the

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.280 
the wire strippers and separated out the
three<00:00:55.790> sides<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.300> hot<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:56.720> cold<00:00:56.960> in<00:00:57.260> the

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
three sides the hot the cold in the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.650 
three sides the hot the cold in the
ground<00:00:57.430> you<00:00:58.430> can<00:00:58.580> see<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:58.850> piece<00:00:59.059> that<00:00:59.390> I've

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
ground you can see the piece that I've

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.680 
ground you can see the piece that I've
taken<00:01:00.020> off<00:01:00.260> right<00:01:00.530> here

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
taken off right here

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.630 
taken off right here
now<00:01:02.690> I've<00:01:03.260> already<00:01:03.620> taken<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.220> time<00:01:04.430> to<00:01:04.610> put

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
now I've already taken the time to put

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.100 
now I've already taken the time to put
the<00:01:04.879> soldering<00:01:05.210> on<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.479> tip<00:01:05.690> so<00:01:05.870> we<00:01:05.960> don't

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
the soldering on the tip so we don't

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.080 
the soldering on the tip so we don't
have<00:01:06.200> to<00:01:06.320> waste<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.680> time<00:01:06.860> there<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:07.310> I'm

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
have to waste the time there and I'm

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.510 
have to waste the time there and I'm
going<00:01:08.479> to<00:01:08.630> put<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.619> soldering<00:01:09.950> on<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:10.310> tips

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
going to put the soldering on the tips

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:28.010 
going to put the soldering on the tips
of<00:01:10.610> this<00:01:10.790> side

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.649 

okay<00:01:29.020> now<00:01:29.290> our<00:01:29.619> cable<00:01:30.610> has<00:01:31.030> solder<00:01:31.390> on<00:01:31.630> the

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
okay now our cable has solder on the

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.109 
okay now our cable has solder on the
ends<00:01:31.900> so<00:01:32.260> now<00:01:33.190> we're<00:01:33.310> going<00:01:33.400> to<00:01:33.490> get<00:01:33.580> our<00:01:33.729> piezo

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
ends so now we're going to get our piezo

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.310 
ends so now we're going to get our piezo
buzzer<00:01:34.240> element<00:01:34.960> ready

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
buzzer element ready

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.170 
buzzer element ready
I've<00:01:35.470> already<00:01:35.680> somewhat<00:01:36.490> taking<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:36.850> time<00:01:37.030> to

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
I've already somewhat taking the time to

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.719 
I've already somewhat taking the time to
do<00:01:37.300> that<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.860> buzzer<00:01:39.070> is<00:01:39.280> going<00:01:39.430> to<00:01:39.490> come

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
do that the buzzer is going to come

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.730 
do that the buzzer is going to come
intact<00:01:40.150> like<00:01:40.360> this<00:01:40.659> and<00:01:41.020> what<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.320> want<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.560> do

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
intact like this and what you want to do

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.649 
intact like this and what you want to do
is<00:01:41.950> you<00:01:42.040> want<00:01:42.190> to<00:01:42.250> pop<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.670> backside<00:01:43.210> off<00:01:43.420> like

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
is you want to pop the backside off like

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.660 
is you want to pop the backside off like
this<00:01:43.930> being<00:01:44.259> careful<00:01:44.710> not<00:01:44.740> to<00:01:45.190> actually

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
this being careful not to actually

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.230 
this being careful not to actually
damage<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.450> piezo<00:01:46.990> element<00:01:47.820> which<00:01:48.820> is<00:01:49.000> this

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
damage the piezo element which is this

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.010 
damage the piezo element which is this
right<00:01:49.509> here<00:01:49.780> and<00:01:49.930> you<00:01:50.050> can<00:01:50.170> see<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.470> brass<00:01:52.020> and

right here and you can see the brass and

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.330 
right here and you can see the brass and
then<00:01:53.140> you've<00:01:53.259> got<00:01:53.409> this<00:01:53.560> other<00:01:53.740> little<00:01:54.070> metal

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
then you've got this other little metal

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.920 
then you've got this other little metal
side<00:01:54.550> with<00:01:54.790> these<00:01:54.940> soldering<00:01:55.300> points<00:01:55.780> right

here<00:01:56.940> so<00:01:57.940> what<00:01:58.090> we're<00:01:58.210> going<00:01:58.300> to<00:01:58.360> do<00:01:58.540> is<00:01:58.750> we're

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
here so what we're going to do is we're

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.450 
here so what we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:59.050> to<00:01:59.110> take<00:01:59.320> our<00:01:59.500> cable<00:01:59.710> and<00:02:00.100> we're<00:02:00.310> going

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
going to take our cable and we're going

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.850 
going to take our cable and we're going
to<00:02:00.490> install<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.539> piezo<00:02:01.960> element<00:02:02.440> now
