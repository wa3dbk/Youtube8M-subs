battery it comes with inside is a 96
twelve<00:01:47.159> hundred<00:01:47.280> milliamps<00:01:47.790> on<00:01:48.619> I<00:01:49.619> mean<00:01:49.860> nap<00:01:50.070> i

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
twelve hundred milliamps on I mean nap i

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.460 
twelve hundred milliamps on I mean nap i
could<00:01:50.340> buy<00:01:50.520> another<00:01:50.790> one<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.689> make<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.960> like

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
could buy another one to make it like

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.899 
could buy another one to make it like
more<00:01:52.770> battery<00:01:53.100> life<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.549> that's<00:01:53.670> like

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
more battery life and so that's like

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.690 
more battery life and so that's like
twelve<00:01:54.689> hundred<00:01:54.780> milliamps<00:01:55.200> 96<00:01:55.920> custom<00:01:56.490> peck

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700
