00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.940
 the black spoon collar is a particularly effective detector for the 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.379
 looking for small ssii of a difficult terrain 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.790
 thanks to its frequency of 18 kilos alert 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.420
 he has great sensitivity then but also to the world is not in 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.420
 precious alloy and more generally to small objects 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.989
 you will find in the box 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:26.929
 can in three parts 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.259
 basketball section fiberglass 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.079
 the rest three that will have to put on the water beyond canes and that will host 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:33.909
 The box 

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:36.909
 thanks to a rail system that seemed a little light 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.370
 an accessory will allow you to fix the case is under the grip 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.940
 this position is the one that seduced our testers 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.850
 who finds the machine better balance the site 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.190
 a bag of protection against the rain 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.890
 and projections 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.540
 the disk of 22 elected five centimeters w comes with a guard 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.530
 disk 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.760
 the cable is well made and long enough to carry the 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.220
 case on the belt 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.950
 this is an advantage for the long hours of detection 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.950
 although the device is very light and well balanced 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.240
 almost too light even according to some prospects hours that finds that the 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.550
 disc tends to get up after a few hours if the aca is not 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.000
 weighted by the casing 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.340
 You will also find 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.700
 a sticker facade with the name of the French commanders 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.620
 for a French brand it might have been wise to do the 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.880
 opposite 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.840
 you can buy them separately a wireless headset we advise you 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.020
 deeply 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.440
 because it is really very efficient 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.939
 the aesthetics is successful 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.010
 the device is a beautiful look with a modern and dynamic look 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.510
 the system the driver station by direct connection is a big advantage 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.960
 even if you have to pay close attention to the direction of insertion 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.940
 the identification of polarities is not so obvious 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.050
 the device that is powered by a late 2005 volte battery of titanium to 6 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.800
 the staging during the potentiometer stages his voice to the right 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.970
 m 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.330
 it will take a few seconds before starting to detect 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.330
 good since that time you live at the hips you can go there 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.479
 during the tests we received many parasitic awards 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.369
 to discharge we were not in a favorable environment 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.959
 to eliminate them you have to play with the sensitivity and the switch if it has 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.119
 a sister 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.889
 given its power of gaulle maxter very sensitive to external disturbances 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.479
 in the open field away from power lines you can go up the 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:25.969
 sensitivity to get the most out of its performance 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.089
 one of the strengths of this detector besides its power 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:32.579
 and no doubt his ability to differentiate a good target very 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.719
 close to the ferrule oussou wanted more mineralized 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.049
 you will get two are distinct 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.609
 the two solitaries are frank and clear 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.829
 during the scan the reactivity of the device is excellent 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.569
 readjustments very quickly in real time 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.509
 on the other hand we have the impression that once the target is spotted but it is safer 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.929
 for a second 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:57.379
 on the facade you will also find 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.799
 volume make that adjusts the sound level of the iron's grave tone 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.569
 at the mini the detection of the iron is deactivated 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.450
 at the maximum the level of the bass volume will be as loud 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.589
 than the other two tones 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:11.999
 the ferrous threshold 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:15.439
 it is a second discrimination that only concerns farms 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.469
 deeper places little more sense of fairing becomes serious 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:22.139
 with a little habit you can eliminate small nails for example 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.659
 keep them ferrous 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.279
 the best in the beginning 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:27.779
 and stay in auto mode 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.559
 otherness so the bce 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:31.989
 you will reduce noise 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.989
 on 0 the silencer totally disabled 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:37.230
 the ground effect potentiometer 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.110
 not much to say we have to keep it at the lower limit of the 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.559
 red zone modulate their settings according to the soil prospecting 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.879
 you can correct the effects of soil but also eliminate the blame 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.679
 and pottery loaded with wire 

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:53.449
 the frequency shift switch to work with a 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.449
 partner with the same device 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:58.680
 this switch that also serves to attract the wireless headset 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:02.650
 on the pickguard grip grape handle classic helmet 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.629
 yes the already djaedje that makes the loudspeaker muller when 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.399
 the use of the wireless headset 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:11.919
 in the field the 18 losses of the collar of max for the hour proves formidable 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.770
 it's a surgical device that have very fast response times 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.719
 short while scanning 

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:21.429
 thanks to these three bulls you will distinguish with the habit the fans 

00:04:21.429 --> 00:04:24.699
 more noble metals but it would have to spend a few hours 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.410
 it's worth it for a confirmed prospector for novices I'll be more 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:29.879
 reserved 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:33.080
 anyway the max ball for their part its price is rather for 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.099
 roadside detection that will find there a device without compromises drawn up 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.099
 to search and it is above all what is expected of a detector 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.669
 to sum up the game for the rest the powerful device 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.449
 has many settings that multiplies its possibilities but not 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.710
 reserved in preference to experienced prospectors who visit 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.520
 at the quintessence
