00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.490
 Well, you yourself saw really in the first 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.219
 half before the deletions played worthy scored 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.200
 balls or more moments but then to 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.529
 Unfortunately, I, I do not want to speak for 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.529
 judges well what did Andrei Yarmolenko 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.240
 he probably saw his friend 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.220
 teammate he lies expires 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.750
 blood from an open wound it probably is 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.730
 saw the side judge who stood 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.859
 football players probably saw it 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.050
 gain gamma but they have absolutely no effect on it 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.000
 did not react continued attack I 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.190
 I understand if a football player is lying 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.140
 pretends if he has an open wound 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.719
 he is bleeding this is probably I do not know 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.850
 ether file like this how to call it if 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.100
 no judge nobody sees it i can't 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.289
 now there blame ermolin when he 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.360
 did a rough foul i agree with that but 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.590
 he probably see him as a friend 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.690
 urgently need help 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.690
 everyone saw this except for the judge and 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.219
 young man behavior I can not judge now 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.930
 because i didn't see this moment i 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.189
 watched a completely different side we 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.170
 we will understand and of course we will sort it all 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.270
 of course if you add about heroes 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.890
 those guys who stayed we said about 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.900
 this in the locker room you now go beyond 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.740
 whole team for 24 people 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.630
 and I am very grateful that they fought they 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.369
 really did not defend 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.820
 opportunities for counterattack there though 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.320
 tried but they gave all that is on 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.049
 field probably now in the locker room they 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.150
 even can not go in the shower because 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.250
 no strength to go there probably we all them 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.310
 thankful that they fought in 8 room 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.310
 against of course this is a quality team 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.229
 probably the fact that they are from the first minute 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.250
 started pressing well i'm glad that guys 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.220
 confident enough to go out of 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.770
 this pressure and create moments 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.409
 again and what I said before deleting 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.860
 up to 1 delete up to 2 i think we played 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.979
 very worthy i hope that guys 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.990
 will remember 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.270
 and we will remind them with pleasure how 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.540
 they played like they came out well 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.000
 out of pressure how they attacked me 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.399
 I personally liked the game how it is 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.869
 held until removal then of course it 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.890
 It was 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.489
 really heroism that showed 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.349
 guys sorry bad sidorchuk all 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.439
 I was taken to the hospital with an open wound 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.359
 I think that there is enough as if 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.609
 that when I saw this open wound to me 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:25.739
 it became bad 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:27.180
 lance the same goes limping with him 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.739
 a very strong injury that he could not 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.650
 keep playing probably that's all for now 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.359
 I can not answer this now highlighted 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.319
 go out on the field now limping in 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:42.629
 very strong whisper I can answer 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.209
 just for what is really like 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.069
 now said yes it happened all this 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.930
 the game is already gone right now it's in history yes 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.090
 the guys stayed in this game 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.069
 really heroes we have the answer 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.319
 in the game, I am sure that the team will 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.980
 much angrier we will prepare ourselves to 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.989
 In this game, Iâ€™m sure we will fight money 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.319
 I expect our victories 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.319
 foot victor
