this<00:00:31.289> piece<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.710> going<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.920> come<00:00:32.040> out<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:33.079> it's

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
this piece is going to come out and it's

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.750 
this piece is going to come out and it's
a<00:00:34.140> little<00:00:34.350> hard<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.739> take<00:00:34.770> out<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.100> corners<00:00:35.489> but

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
a little hard to take out a corners but

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.959 
a little hard to take out a corners but
you<00:00:35.969> just<00:00:36.120> pull<00:00:36.600> them<00:00:36.750> out<00:00:36.840> like<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.700> and<00:00:38.700> you

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
you just pull them out like that and you

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.700 
you just pull them out like that and you
can<00:00:39.120> pull<00:00:39.329> out<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.570> one<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:42.320> do<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> quarter

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
can pull out this one and do a quarter

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.389 
can pull out this one and do a quarter
turn<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.680> take<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.860> out<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.930> then<00:00:49.399> the

turn here and take that out and then the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.250 
turn here and take that out and then the
rest<00:00:50.610> comes<00:00:50.940> out<00:00:51.090> pretty<00:00:51.270> easily<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:54.260> still

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
rest comes out pretty easily and still

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.229 
rest comes out pretty easily and still
then<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.949> put<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.219> back<00:00:56.309> together<00:00:56.930> just<00:00:59.239> insert

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
then to put it back together just insert

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:17.630 
then to put it back together just insert
this<00:01:00.510> here<00:01:01.640> put<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.820> here

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.340 
corner pieces and a simple the edge
pieces<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:15.580> for<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.850> corners<00:02:16.209> you'll<00:02:17.170> get

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
pieces so for the corners you'll get

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.430 
pieces so for the corners you'll get
three<00:02:17.560> pieces<00:02:17.739> that<00:02:18.100> look<00:02:18.130> like<00:02:18.370> this<00:02:19.380> kind<00:02:20.380> of

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
three pieces that look like this kind of

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.400 
three pieces that look like this kind of
like<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.560> kite<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:22.620> you'll<00:02:23.620> get<00:02:23.769> a<00:02:25.290> bunch<00:02:26.290> of

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
like a kite and you'll get a bunch of

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.830 
like a kite and you'll get a bunch of
these<00:02:26.470> little<00:02:26.530> triangle<00:02:27.370> pieces<00:02:27.610> as<00:02:28.180> the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
these little triangle pieces as the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.880 
these little triangle pieces as the
little<00:02:29.110> connectors<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.750> if<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.350> look<00:02:32.590> on<00:02:32.769> the

little connectors and if you look on the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.210 
little connectors and if you look on the
little<00:02:33.130> white<00:02:33.310> piece<00:02:34.230> down<00:02:35.230> right<00:02:35.680> here

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
little white piece down right here

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.080 
little white piece down right here
there's<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.209> little<00:02:37.360> slot<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.350> then<00:02:38.910> at<00:02:39.910> the

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
yeah you can put another little triangle

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.319 
yeah you can put another little triangle
there<00:02:45.310> but<00:02:46.150> if<00:02:46.450> you'd<00:02:47.380> like<00:02:47.590> your<00:02:47.799> cube<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.370> be

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
there but if you'd like your cube to be

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.750 
there but if you'd like your cube to be
better<00:02:49.600> at<00:02:49.840> corner<00:02:50.650> cutting<00:02:50.859> you<00:02:51.310> don't<00:02:51.459> need

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
better at corner cutting you don't need

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:59.039 
better at corner cutting you don't need
that<00:02:52.000> piece<00:02:52.799> so<00:02:53.799> you<00:02:53.829> take<00:02:54.549> the<00:02:54.579> triangle<00:02:58.049> you

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
that piece so you take the triangle you

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.410 
that piece so you take the triangle you
just<00:02:59.320> insert<00:02:59.980> one<00:03:00.400> little<00:03:00.670> prong<00:03:01.060> into<00:03:01.900> their

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
just insert one little prong into their

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.390 
just insert one little prong into their
take<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.600> other<00:03:04.750> colors<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:06.489> just<00:03:08.130> slide<00:03:09.130> it

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
take the other colors you just slide it

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.649 
take the other colors you just slide it
on<00:03:09.549> there<00:03:11.400> like<00:03:12.400> so

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.740 

and<00:03:16.659> then<00:03:16.810> you<00:03:16.930> have<00:03:17.049> a<00:03:17.140> corner<00:03:18.390> now<00:03:19.390> for<00:03:19.629> the

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
and then you have a corner now for the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.830 
and then you have a corner now for the
edges<00:03:20.079> you'll<00:03:20.349> have<00:03:20.560> two<00:03:20.920> pieces<00:03:21.659> see<00:03:22.659> they

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
edges you'll have two pieces see they

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.869 
edges you'll have two pieces see they
have<00:03:22.959> little<00:03:23.200> nubs<00:03:23.590> on<00:03:23.829> them<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:25.200> pull<00:03:26.879> you

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
have little nubs on them and pull you

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:34.050 
have little nubs on them and pull you
take<00:03:28.150> two<00:03:28.359> of<00:03:28.390> those<00:03:30.209> line<00:03:31.209> it<00:03:31.420> up<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:33.060> then

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
take two of those line it up and then

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.910 
take two of those line it up and then
they<00:03:34.840> just<00:03:35.400> fit<00:03:36.400> together<00:03:36.730> like<00:03:36.819> that<00:03:37.030> and

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
they just fit together like that and

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.330 
they just fit together like that and
then<00:03:38.920> as<00:03:39.129> described<00:03:39.639> earlier<00:03:39.819> on<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.359> video

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
then as described earlier on the video

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.619 
then as described earlier on the video
you<00:03:42.629> take<00:03:43.629> an<00:03:43.750> edge<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.260> kind<00:03:45.040> of<00:03:45.510> fit<00:03:46.510> it

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
you take an edge and kind of fit it

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.440 
you take an edge and kind of fit it
right<00:03:46.689> there<00:03:47.079> and<00:03:47.849> should<00:03:48.849> just<00:03:49.120> slide<00:03:49.389> right

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
right there and should just slide right

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.409 
right there and should just slide right
in<00:03:49.840> like<00:03:50.079> that<00:03:51.510> then<00:03:52.620> take<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.650> corner<00:03:54.419> it's

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
in like that then take a corner it's

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.140 
in like that then take a corner it's
easier<00:03:55.659> if<00:03:55.750> you<00:03:55.810> set<00:03:56.019> it<00:03:56.109> on<00:03:56.169> the<00:03:56.230> table<00:03:57.150> corner

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
easier if you set it on the table corner

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.429 
easier if you set it on the table corner
and<00:03:58.299> it<00:03:58.469> just<00:03:59.469> slides<00:04:00.069> right<00:04:00.310> in<00:04:00.519> like<00:04:00.730> that

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
and it just slides right in like that

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.440 
and it just slides right in like that
then<00:04:02.439> you<00:04:02.469> just<00:04:02.769> want<00:04:02.980> to<00:04:03.040> do<00:04:03.879> the<00:04:04.030> same<00:04:04.239> for

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
then you just want to do the same for

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.740 
then you just want to do the same for
the<00:04:04.540> rest<00:04:04.689> of<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.870> puzzle<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:06.389> it<00:04:07.389> should<00:04:07.719> be

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
the rest of the puzzle and it should be

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.140 
the rest of the puzzle and it should be
fully<00:04:08.230> assembled<00:04:09.150> just<00:04:10.150> like<00:04:10.389> this<00:04:10.599> one<00:04:12.150> thank
