it

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.190 
it
because<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.820> explores<00:04:12.390> a<00:04:12.540> character<00:04:13.020> that<00:04:13.140> I

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
because it explores a character that I

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.750 
because it explores a character that I
like<00:04:13.590> Jaden<00:04:14.010> Korr<00:04:14.160> is<00:04:14.310> a<00:04:14.340> really<00:04:14.610> cool

like Jaden Korr is a really cool

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.039 
like Jaden Korr is a really cool
character<00:04:15.000> and<00:04:15.420> it's<00:04:16.350> been<00:04:16.620> disappointing

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
character and it's been disappointing

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.110 
character and it's been disappointing
like<00:04:19.049> between<00:04:19.620> reading<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.760> fate<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:20.970> the

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.969 
Korr
he's<00:04:31.440> still<00:04:31.650> around<00:04:33.050> but<00:04:34.050> then<00:04:34.289> when<00:04:34.800> he<00:04:34.860> gets

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
he's still around but then when he gets

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.320

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
think that and there's a sequel to this

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.890 
think that and there's a sequel to this
book<00:04:37.830> they<00:04:38.250> set<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.550> up<00:04:38.669> rather<00:04:39.030> well<00:04:39.180> and<00:04:39.599> I

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
book they set it up rather well and I

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.990 
book they set it up rather well and I
had<00:04:40.259> already<00:04:40.379> known<00:04:40.680> that<00:04:40.889> going<00:04:41.280> in<00:04:41.430> I<00:04:41.639> had

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
had already known that going in I had

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.170 
had already known that going in I had
seen<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.720> announcements<00:04:43.169> for<00:04:43.349> it<00:04:43.470> so<00:04:44.370> it's

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
seen the announcements for it so it's

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.270 
seen the announcements for it so it's
really<00:04:45.449> I'd<00:04:46.409> love<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.830> fact<00:04:47.039> they're

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
really I'd love the fact they're

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.159 
really I'd love the fact they're
exploring<00:04:47.789> this<00:04:47.909> character<00:04:48.360> more<00:04:48.569> Jaden<00:04:48.990> Korr

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
exploring this character more Jaden Korr

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.990 
exploring this character more Jaden Korr
is<00:04:49.500> a<00:04:49.530> really<00:04:49.889> interesting<00:04:50.129> character<00:04:50.520> that

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
is a really interesting character that

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.149 
is a really interesting character that
could<00:04:51.330> really<00:04:51.479> be<00:04:51.750> turned<00:04:52.680> into<00:04:52.860> something

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:53.159 
could really be turned into something

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:58.040 
could really be turned into something
very<00:04:53.610> impressive<00:04:55.490> but<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:56.970> story<00:04:57.300> is<00:04:57.569> very

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
very impressive but the story is very

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.180 
very impressive but the story is very
interesting<00:04:58.379> because<00:04:58.710> it's<00:04:58.949> dealing<00:04:59.069> with

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
interesting because it's dealing with

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.890 
interesting because it's dealing with
time<00:04:59.520> travel<00:04:59.759> which<00:05:00.120> is<00:05:00.150> something<00:05:00.449> that<00:05:00.569> Star

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
time travel which is something that Star

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.760 
time travel which is something that Star
Wars<00:05:01.139> has<00:05:01.349> shied<00:05:01.949> away<00:05:01.979> from<00:05:03.349> they've<00:05:04.349> sort<00:05:04.680> of

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
Wars has shied away from they've sort of

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.070 
Wars has shied away from they've sort of
explored<00:05:05.129> the<00:05:05.250> concept<00:05:05.669> with<00:05:05.759> force<00:05:06.240> losing

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:09.379 
for about a hundred years completely

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:14.659 
for about a hundred years completely
because<00:06:10.379> of<00:06:10.409> the<00:06:10.500> legacy<00:06:10.710> comics<00:06:12.020> but<00:06:13.669> he

because of the legacy comics but he

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:15.920 
because of the legacy comics but he

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
could have been cut out it was a lot of

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.149 
could have been cut out it was a lot of
filler<00:06:16.199> with<00:06:16.469> him<00:06:16.710> but<00:06:17.779> Jaden<00:06:18.779> is<00:06:19.009> built<00:06:20.009> upon

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:20.159 
filler with him but Jaden is built upon

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:25.189 
filler with him but Jaden is built upon
which<00:06:20.550> is<00:06:20.699> awesome<00:06:21.150> and<00:06:21.300> it<00:06:22.259> was<00:06:22.650> and<00:06:23.690> the<00:06:24.690> new

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 
which is awesome and it was and the new

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:26.330 
which is awesome and it was and the new

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
characters they've run into at the end

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.879
