00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
there hmm and immediately you can see

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.490 
there hmm and immediately you can see
the<00:01:02.370> thickness<00:01:03.210> difference<00:01:03.899> between<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> two

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the thickness difference between the two

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.490 
the thickness difference between the two
covers<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.270> new<00:01:06.510> cover<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
covers this is the new cover this is the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.450 
covers this is the new cover this is the
original<00:01:07.799> default<00:01:09.080> i'd<00:01:10.080> say<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> little

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
original default i'd say so a little

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.170 
original default i'd say so a little
over<00:01:11.610> double<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.119> thickness<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:14.060> just<00:01:15.060> keep

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
over double the thickness so just keep

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.440 
over double the thickness so just keep
that<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.450> mind<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.970> let's<00:01:17.970> look<00:01:18.060> at<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
that in mind and let's look at the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.760 
that in mind and let's look at the
battery<00:01:20.630> view<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:22.020> obviously<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.500> thicker

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
battery view it's obviously a thicker

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.950 
battery view it's obviously a thicker
battery<00:01:23.220> as<00:01:23.400> well<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.450> can<00:01:24.570> see<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
battery as well as you can see the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.429 
battery as well as you can see the
default<00:01:25.229> battery<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.689> this<00:01:27.689> one<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> right

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
default battery is this one on the right

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.039 
default battery is this one on the right
and<00:01:28.710> got<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> new<00:01:29.939> battery<00:01:30.180> right<00:01:30.479> here<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
and got the new battery right here the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.499 
and got the new battery right here the
3200<00:01:31.950> milliamp<00:01:32.400> battery<00:01:33.619> so<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:35.479> can<00:01:36.479> just

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
3200 milliamp battery so you can just

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.469 
3200 milliamp battery so you can just
see<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.079> original<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:38.159> actually<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> 1300

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
see the original is actually a 1300

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.910 
see the original is actually a 1300
milliamp<00:01:39.869> batteries<00:01:40.320> battery<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.729> know

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
milliamp batteries battery so you know

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.630 
milliamp batteries battery so you know
1330<00:01:43.920> 500<00:01:44.430> milliamps<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> big<00:01:45.840> difference

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
1330 500 milliamps is a big difference

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.920 
1330 500 milliamps is a big difference
alright<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.060> let's<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.509> go<00:01:48.600> ahead<00:01:48.720> and

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
alright so let's just go ahead and

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.730 
alright so let's just go ahead and
install<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.860> new<00:01:50.189> one<00:01:51.049> goes<00:01:52.049> right<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.530> like

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
install this new one goes right in like

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.790 
install this new one goes right in like
any<00:01:52.950> other<00:01:53.159> battery<00:01:54.229> it<00:01:55.229> does<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:56.329> there<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.420> go

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
any other battery it does it there we go

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.580 
any other battery it does it there we go
and<00:01:59.090> install<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.300> new<00:02:00.480> case<00:02:00.870> as<00:02:01.320> well

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
and install the new case as well

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.320 
and install the new case as well
obviously<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.920> thickness<00:02:05.370> is<00:02:05.610> affected<00:02:06.120> it's

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
obviously the thickness is affected it's

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.680 
obviously the thickness is affected it's
a<00:02:06.420> thicker<00:02:06.660> phone<00:02:07.050> but<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.610> package<00:02:09.300> claims

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
a thicker phone but the package claims

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.930 
a thicker phone but the package claims
that<00:02:09.990> it<00:02:10.320> will<00:02:10.590> last<00:02:10.890> up<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.370> three<00:02:11.760> times

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
that it will last up to three times

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.860 
that it will last up to three times
longer<00:02:12.410> so<00:02:13.410> any<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.610> phone<00:02:15.300> users<00:02:15.660> who

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
longer so any of you phone users who

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.400 
longer so any of you phone users who
like<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.140> play<00:02:16.740> games<00:02:17.700> or<00:02:18.390> use<00:02:18.720> more<00:02:18.960> apps<00:02:19.170> than

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
like to play games or use more apps than

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.650 
like to play games or use more apps than
the<00:02:19.680> average<00:02:20.010> user<00:02:20.250> would<00:02:20.940> probably<00:02:21.330> benefit

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
the average user would probably benefit

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.750 
the average user would probably benefit
from<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:21.990> extended<00:02:22.440> battery<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.550> see

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
from this extended battery you can see

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.180 
from this extended battery you can see
we<00:02:24.420> have<00:02:24.570> a<00:02:24.690> volume<00:02:24.960> rocker<00:02:25.410> right<00:02:25.800> here<00:02:26.070> on

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
we have a volume rocker right here on

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.800 
we have a volume rocker right here on
the<00:02:26.310> side<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:28.410> 3.5<00:02:29.160> millimeter<00:02:29.810> headset

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
the side and the 3.5 millimeter headset

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.640 
the side and the 3.5 millimeter headset
jack<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.290> bit<00:02:31.590> top<00:02:33.110> with<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.200> bottom<00:02:34.470> there's<00:02:34.620> a

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
jack a bit top with the bottom there's a

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.180 
jack a bit top with the bottom there's a
little<00:02:34.740> cut<00:02:35.010> out<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.820> can<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:37.190> mini

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
little cut out so that you can the mini

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.750 
little cut out so that you can the mini
USB<00:02:38.370> port<00:02:38.940> can<00:02:39.180> be<00:02:39.210> shown<00:02:39.950> so<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.400> thickness

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
USB port can be shown so the thickness

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.130 
USB port can be shown so the thickness
of<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.940> phone<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.240> affected<00:02:42.720> it's<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.960> little

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
of the phone is affected it's a little
