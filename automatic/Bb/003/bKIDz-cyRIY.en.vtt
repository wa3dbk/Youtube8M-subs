00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.010
 we are behind the starting grid 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.639
 for sure race reserved for pilots 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.920
 honda 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.089
 so we'll go with them we went 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.100
 lower anyway one to go ahead 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.320
 because usually the first corner 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.769
 is quite eventful here are his seconds 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.430
 the grid will soon fall 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:27.750
 and go for the race I leave 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.830
 quietly because usually at 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.130
 first turn I always have some 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.579
 falls inside to see the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.260
 beautiful circuit here at reygades jean 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.870
 luc fouchet has been organizing this court since 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.420
 over 20 years old I still watch 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.739
 a little behind and here we go 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.390
 really get in pulls a lacrosse a 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.329
 turn right we can tighten that's it 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.510
 the more we can already everywhere in 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.360
 undergrowth land coming well prepared on 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.530
 see the land is perfect well watered 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.190
 small problems with visibility 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.570
 the sun is very difficult to see 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.149
 in the case of traffic we see that it 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.559
 push a little bit that's all pilot when 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.729
 same good level in this round at 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.780
 beyond there are more than 33 pilots at the start 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.189
 the big climb we have the sun a little 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.189
 in front quite difficult to see 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.570
 so this round reserved for all 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:22.810
 honda pilots whether it's on a 250 or 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:26.020
 450 cubic centimeters of a 250 mo at 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.700
 middle these attacks fight though at that 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.570
 left there he does not let go i'm going 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.640
 to be forced to go outside 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:35.950
 could double the circuit of reygades 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.500
 always a treat unrolled here there is a 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.340
 fabulous atmosphere always a lot of 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.729
 public 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.369
 motocross enthusiasts who come 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.869
 every year to have participated already 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.709
 at his races and at the same time also 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.880
 plan very nice races 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:54.299
 we are in the fastest part of 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.340
 circuit here with great care back up 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.709
 my arrival in a tight part here 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.590
 with my little left turn a series 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:04.659
 of waves in a very technical climb a 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.479
 little in the stadium part where all the 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.890
 public and gather with this great 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.590
 turn that never stops turning a 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.450
 big left turn is good 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.380
 stay inside 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.480
 I think it's going to fall a little bit 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.660
 lamps and metals on the floor but that 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.660
 past 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:26.490
 ah you have to attack for to double 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.000
 in this category the valuable 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.620
 of arrival and the big jump of arrival here 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.080
 beautiful jump that is more than 25 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.490
 meters we arrive and not for the last 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.040
 turn here to take the line of 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.190
 departure here we went around 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.690
