original Robocop it's like one of the
early<00:01:41.130> designs<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.820> guess<00:01:42.409> that's<00:01:43.409> kind<00:01:43.680> of

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.859 
early designs I guess that's kind of
cool<00:01:43.950> right<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:46.549> it<00:01:47.549> Robocop's<00:01:48.149> wife<00:01:48.450> shows
