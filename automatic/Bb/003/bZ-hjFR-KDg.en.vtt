00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:24.330
 This is a gift to the girl, I 'm here with 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.390
 architect oswaldo at a furniture store 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.060
 used this one will pick some pieces 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.610
 to give you tips on how to use this type of 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.890
 product since our home is normal I 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.340
 I'm suspicious I like I am I like 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.530
 in several stores, which can be 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.690
 give us the maximum in this kind of shop is 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.420
 very interesting because it awakens a lot 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.860
 creativity and we have to type 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.770
 your stores with your head fully 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:55.680
 open does not have to come with the idea 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.620
 formed cool and came calmly and looking 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.629
 maybe come back on another day that the play 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.989
 more interesting may be hidden 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.610
 at the bottom of a pile of furniture everything 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.700
 dusting but re-reading until 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.140
 a reuse of this part can create all 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.140
 identity of that environment 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.680
 it's not a bar 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.570
 This face is currently two 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.520
 main 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.820
 one of them would be this chair with this 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.950
 chat back up higher than the common 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.010
 she has a straight line I do not have 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.960
 many details I would elect two 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.390
 such chairs for a dining room 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.310
 in the room can be very modern well 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.010
 contemporary put these two 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.010
 chairs at the headwaters and then the 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.540
 others on the sides of the tables and 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.430
 Acrylic chairs with chairs 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.250
 synthetic materials for 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.720
 counter with natural material of this 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.030
 brand are solid wood would leave it 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.670
 so with this finish with this 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.330
 I would leave her in the color in which 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.150
 it is 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.190
 she's fine she 's very well really cool 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.410
 if it has any marks whatsoever 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.540
 wrinkled or leave the mark and 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.080
 kneaded that is part of her story 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.810
 maybe he would change the fabric of the seat 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.810
 by a more resistant fabric a leather 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.810
 white a more synthetic fabric 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.580
 the fall 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.840
 the piece that I found very interesting are 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.580
 these barber chairs now 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.150
 creativity is coming so we are coming 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.340
 can replace the classic armchairs 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.520
 some in home theater by two armchairs 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.310
 of those that are super comfortable or 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.160
 have space to even change the 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.160
 stools from a bar on a bench by 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.900
 several armchairs in these barbershops 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.330
 Some even adjust the height 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.400
 interesting super comfortable I found 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.880
 extraordinary these chairs what they 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.150
 I think highly of the idea to come in 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.440
 space of self calmly and without looking 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.480
 prejudice is not 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.730
 will be a unique environment a house 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.130
 unique will create the identity of who 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.950
 is using those spaces in the 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.290
 owner of these spaces if you want 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.080
 exchange these seats leave one day in the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.500
 room a day in the room is a day in the neighborhood 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.000
 has no rule and will only use aa 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.040
 house where she also has to have humor 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.780
 I do not think I play in this kind of 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.910
 furniture with a chair like that is 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.709
 take the mood is fun for us 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.890
 wants to bring more joy into 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.890
 House 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.540
 hey call phone 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.350
 I really enjoyed joining this bench to 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.960
 me it rather refers the beach one so 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.560
 time ago the material very Brazilian 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.220
 this screen the wood also fits three 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.320
 people sitting but I would give a reuse 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.940
 would perhaps place a glossy lacquer with 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.600
 a very strong color may be a yellow 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.850
 green 1 blue to give that relaxation 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.980
 the piece and not necessarily to use 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.530
 Sit down, she can have a closet for us. 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.630
 put some clothes on top can 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.000
 to be an entrance hall 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.270
 to change some decoration pieces some 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.520
 books over a single use 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.970
 different for what it was made for 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.970
 initially 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:46.539
 we find here a ready composition 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.449
 already using two parts with the use 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:52.180
 totally different I do not know if they 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.080
 are from the same time but it was a good piece of furniture 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.939
 cool 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:00.610
 the basis of a sewing machine served 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:03.430
 support for an older sideboard 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.319
 console oldest mann this piece 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.979
 Maybe I would leave her as she really is. 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:11.650
 in the same colors the same materials 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.870
 you can use an entrance hall or 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.810
 corner of a room put several 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.539
 candlesticks on top or several portraits in 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.669
 Top can be very good, composition. 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.159
 Two-piece two-piece design forming a 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.740
 only in very different points 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:28.449
 we have wood and steel 1 supported in 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.279
 on top of each other 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:33.539
 I found it very cool, the composition was a 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:33.539
 I find these subtitles 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:49.390
 osvaldo chose this piece here to give 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:51.340
 a tip and I looked and even asked no 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.160
 I like this piece so I found it super 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.440
 interesting in is not without use this 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.780
 Piece does not have that look right I think 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.250
 This is the big difference is when I 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.260
 I looked the first time I was 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.230
 Circling here, I did not like it either. 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.240
 much of her picture is not much of mine 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.030
 style but it is a piece that she can 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.750
 highlight in a contemporary setting 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:17.940
 We can use her on the black background for 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:21.460
 highlight white and red maybe in a 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.860
 environment where there is a more tenuous light 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.890
 slightly darker then it can be a 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.900
 room can be an entrance hall in the 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.510
 room it can function as a 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:35.260
 bedside table on which you have support 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:38.260
 for books and has support for the lamp is 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.330
 a good space a round can put 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.180
 some books on some pieces of 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.940
 above and work with the 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.460
 lighting as a light more 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:51.430
 focused on it that will highlight the 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.980
 red will have to attack the white me 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.050
 I think this piece has a lot of potential 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:58.740
 in the colors that are golden white and 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.740
 red
