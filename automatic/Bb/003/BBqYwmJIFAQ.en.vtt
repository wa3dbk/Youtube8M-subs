00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:03.549
 Recently, biologists have disappointed 

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:05.149
 of humanity they proved that 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:07.799
 itâ€™s impossible to plan reptiles because 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.680
 half-life of a child is such that 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.509
 in one and a half million years and no 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.019
 nothing remains in canada lizards 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.259
 hype million 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.259
 despite the rings are missing 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.279
 scared so it should be when 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:25.400
 animal husbandry 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.220
 age up to 65 million years 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.170
 The royal museum of the kontarev decided not to 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.150
 lag behind their clientâ€™s translation is logical 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.280
 error of technology calculations 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.090
 augmented reality bones 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.720
 dinosaur real image on ipo or 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.780
 virtual call us from others 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.250
 museums of Europe and North America 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.470
 to learn more about this technology 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.610
 for the museum in it especially 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.290
 exciting because it allows 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.579
 connect the real world fantasy world 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.999
 dinosaurs are extinct but visitors can 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:53.159
 revive the recent find of Russian 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.719
 mammoth scholars marrying him 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.839
 from permafrost revived discussions about 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.089
 possible planning 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.499
 fossil animal 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:02.289
 but if about mammoth scientists account 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.320
 have hope all the same lived not so long ago 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.799
 and found a person, that is, in the west already 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.549
 signed in their own powerlessness 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.409
 maybe this good news is better 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.539
 admire them on the screen of smartphones and 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:13.409
 tablets 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.520
 I give you augmented reality this 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.039
 youth technology is great that it 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:19.180
 a museum appeared 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.450
 now seems to get fascinating by myself 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.690
 technology is no longer surprising but keep 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.850
 and and antiquities from ontario she came out on 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.260
 new level for the first time three-dimensional if 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.860
 there is no special 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.909
 picture tags 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.759
 but from real objects ring ii 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.729
 visitors point cameras at skeletons 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.039
 vazar vlog looks like they 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.829
 were moving 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.630
 the story comes to life in the hands of visitors 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.929
 shoots substation increased by costa 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:45.749
 Rica the biggest dinosaur in 

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:48.099
 exposure wait a minute explains plan 

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:49.939
 works like reverse x-ray 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.479
 apparatus further shusha water satisfied before 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.179
 museum visitors were looking at the screen 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.259
 smartphone from boredom now because 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.119
 interesting 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.840
 the exhibit on the screen is like that cooler 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.280
 real penetration new 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.289
 technology is not the world is another step 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.429
 towards another dimension 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.759
 marginal we even have this experiment with 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.959
 dinosaurs says that soon we 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.260
 see a whole new world augmented 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.840
 reality on such in which to spice 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.989
 will use no pictures of objects 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.900
 several ancient lizards museum workers 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.299
 sit on the streets of the city bikin not so 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.419
 Here I decided the urban landscape on the computer 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:25.480
 through the eyes of cinema halls and then prove that 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.559
 low price close 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:28.319
 Mikhail Kondratyev will have a bite in his letters
