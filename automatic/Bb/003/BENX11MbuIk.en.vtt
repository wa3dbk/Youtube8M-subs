00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.250
 Allah 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.379
 the act ump 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:13.479
 Hello 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:17.380
 I propose to show you today how can not say the framework of a 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.679
 picture 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.640
 by forming per year 10 15 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.409
 to know if the format a3 half 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:26.429
 why because on some compact 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.429
 for example where we get images in the lead yesterday 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.790
 on the other hand we can not get them out correctly in 10 15 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.499
 so the fact remains put it back 

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:40.049
 the end of putting back the photo in format to finally allow it to draw 

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:41.740
 distinguish for example 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.950
 it also allows photos that are in the format 10 15 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.500
 to crop them 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.000
 to give some of the picture 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.220
 so for that 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.480
 it's simple 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.000
 we are open to others 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.980
 photo in open file 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.250
 you made 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.390
 out of 100 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.739
 you are looking for your image 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.190
 open 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.300
 a little to the photo in format a4 third it comes out of the game 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.170
 so we comfort her in the format too much of it 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.890
 for that it is enough to follow therefore selection 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.470
 all had signed 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.470
 so wait he put dots all around the matches 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.470
 and if I redo selection 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.880
 adopted the report 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.950
 three halves 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.150
 so if we look good he came back the framing so if 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
 when he decided to propose all the parts of the photo 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.990
 for takashi miike this selection in 3d format but you just have to 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.620
 click with the left click of the photo and drag the selection 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.410
 first 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.430
 lowering 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.800
 emilie is positioned here 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.940
 and if so 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.290
 so without being ashamed it suits us and we will do the step 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.370
 next where it is on the plane m 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.650
 first of all 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.930
 luckily you're here again the framing while high-end in the 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.310
 a3 half format 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.300
 I show you 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.120
 you go in the corner of a photo 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.399
 of two countries you are going to denain the selection 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.759
 we press the chick key 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:14.799
 the arrow to sir latouche controls the shift key either 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.090
 p with the mouse you move 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.800
 with the puy-de-dome on the ally and the 3d format 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.899
 and keep 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:28.359
 so there for example I put my section like that so the framing is there moyer 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:34.799
 and I still have my 3d format 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.189
 once I found the framing that I liked 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.219
 I was so 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:40.529
 picture 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:42.739
 cropped 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.519
 so the march has been cropped to the format 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.239
 three 2007 the pretentions of the draw 10 15 for example 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.239
 or format 13 18 of the format 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:55.129
 - 30 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.599
 an appointment in a ratio of other currencies 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.310
 for the moment no additional information to save the image 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.359
 naturally it is necessary to identify 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.429
 save as 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:09.749
 and you add a little letter a little clue at the end to be able to 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:13.049
 look at the original is not crush it create a new image 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.979
 street bakers 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.569
 we kept the default settings 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:19.400
 a party 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.400
 okay 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:25.889
 I hope I have been clear to you to play 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:26.409
 have a good day
