yesterday afternoon and I want to see

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:35.229 
yesterday afternoon and I want to see
what<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.840> looks<00:00:19.080> like<00:00:19.230> here<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.740> morning

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.080 

one<00:00:36.239> most<00:00:36.450> curious<00:00:36.660> about<00:00:36.809> today<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:38.090> which

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
one most curious about today is which

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.060 
one most curious about today is which
direction<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.660> us<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.989> shoot<00:00:40.260> if<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.770> shoot<00:00:40.920> you

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
direction of us to shoot if I shoot you

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.090 
direction of us to shoot if I shoot you
the<00:00:41.190> north<00:00:41.460> flights<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.480> little<00:00:42.719> more<00:00:42.840> calm<00:00:43.100> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
the north flights a little more calm a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.510 
the north flights a little more calm a
little<00:00:44.789> more<00:00:44.940> serene<00:00:46.070> looking<00:00:47.070> down<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.370> is

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
little more serene looking down here is

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.889 
little more serene looking down here is
South<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:48.059> get<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.300> gradient<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
South to get this gradient on the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.650 
South to get this gradient on the
horizon<00:00:49.500> which<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.649> really<00:00:50.010> nice<00:00:50.390> but<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.449> don't

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
horizon which is really nice but I don't

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.150 
horizon which is really nice but I don't
think<00:00:51.930> I'm<00:00:52.079> gonna<00:00:52.230> be<00:00:52.320> able<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.559> see<00:00:52.800> as<00:00:52.949> many

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
think I'm gonna be able to see as many

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.400 
think I'm gonna be able to see as many
of<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.640> polygons<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.870> surface<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
of the polygons that the surface of the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.740 
of the polygons that the surface of the
water

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
water

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.330 
water
so<00:00:57.410> I'm<00:00:57.470> gonna<00:00:57.590> stick<00:00:57.800> around<00:00:57.830> here<00:00:58.040> through

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
so I'm gonna stick around here through

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.920 
so I'm gonna stick around here through
sunrise<00:00:58.580> I<00:00:59.030> just<00:00:59.210> want<00:00:59.360> to<00:00:59.420> see<00:00:59.600> what<00:00:59.750> it<00:00:59.840> all

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
sunrise I just want to see what it all

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.890 
sunrise I just want to see what it all
looks<00:00:59.960> like<00:01:01.120> come<00:01:02.120> up<00:01:02.150> with<00:01:02.240> a<00:01:02.360> formula<00:01:02.780> for

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
looks like come up with a formula for

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.360 
looks like come up with a formula for
tomorrow<00:01:04.150> in<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.239> morning<00:01:05.390> here<00:01:06.190> there's<00:01:07.190> no

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
tomorrow in the morning here there's no

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.360 
tomorrow in the morning here there's no
clouds<00:01:07.640> really<00:01:08.770> these<00:01:09.770> have<00:01:09.980> to<00:01:10.070> have<00:01:10.160> all<00:01:10.250> the

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
clouds really these have to have all the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.530 
clouds really these have to have all the
uplift<00:01:10.670> in<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:10.850> afternoon<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.330> get<00:01:11.420> the

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
uplift in the afternoon to get the

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.930 
uplift in the afternoon to get the
clouds<00:01:11.810> so<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.950> can<00:01:13.100> almost<00:01:13.220> always<00:01:13.430> count<00:01:13.850> on

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
clouds so you can almost always count on

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.960 
clouds so you can almost always count on
your<00:01:14.920> sunrises<00:01:15.920> being<00:01:16.160> just<00:01:16.460> completely

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
your sunrises being just completely

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.430 
your sunrises being just completely
clean<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:17.570> without<00:01:17.840> anything<00:01:20.290> it's<00:01:21.290> not<00:01:21.380> a

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
clean and without anything it's not a

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:49.429 
clean and without anything it's not a
bad<00:01:21.590> thing<00:01:21.740> though<00:01:21.920> gives<00:01:22.760> lost<00:01:22.970> simplicity

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.289 

tomorrow<00:01:50.439> morning<00:01:50.890> would<00:01:51.520> come<00:01:51.729> here<00:01:52.000> and<00:01:52.090> try

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
tomorrow morning would come here and try

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.020 
tomorrow morning would come here and try
it<00:01:52.360> for<00:01:52.630> a<00:01:52.689> south-facing<00:01:53.530> shot<00:01:54.189> which<00:01:54.759> is<00:01:54.909> with

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
it for a south-facing shot which is with

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.200 
it for a south-facing shot which is with
the<00:01:55.119> VDC<00:01:55.479> behind<00:01:55.750> me<00:01:55.899> here<00:01:56.909> polarizer<00:01:57.909> has

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
the VDC behind me here polarizer has

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.029 
the VDC behind me here polarizer has
very<00:01:58.539> little<00:01:58.720> effect<00:01:58.869> on<00:01:59.170> it<00:01:59.350> so<00:01:59.679> I'll

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
very little effect on it so I'll

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:01.889 
very little effect on it so I'll
probably<00:02:00.220> skip<00:02:00.460> that<00:02:00.610> altogether<00:02:00.909> I<00:02:01.329> might

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
probably skip that altogether I might

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.109 
probably skip that altogether I might
use<00:02:02.259> a<00:02:02.560> to<00:02:02.979> stop<00:02:03.220> soft<00:02:03.850> grad<00:02:05.069> I'm<00:02:06.069> 8<00:02:06.460> by<00:02:06.670> 10<00:02:06.850> it's

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
use a to stop soft grad I'm 8 by 10 it's

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.109 
use a to stop soft grad I'm 8 by 10 it's
very<00:02:07.689> very<00:02:07.899> minor<00:02:08.549> but<00:02:09.549> it'll<00:02:09.700> help<00:02:09.819> me<00:02:09.940> show<00:02:10.090> a

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
very very minor but it'll help me show a

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.360 
very very minor but it'll help me show a
little<00:02:10.269> more<00:02:10.390> foreground<00:02:11.129> without<00:02:12.129> looking

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
little more foreground without looking

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.199 
little more foreground without looking
too<00:02:12.519> unnatural<00:02:14.459> also<00:02:15.459> facing<00:02:15.819> to<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:15.970> north

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
too unnatural also facing to the north

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.229 
too unnatural also facing to the north
end<00:02:16.799> to<00:02:17.799> the<00:02:17.950> west<00:02:18.280> here<00:02:18.519> there's<00:02:18.760> also<00:02:19.000> very

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
end to the west here there's also very

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:25.289 
end to the west here there's also very
little<00:02:19.420> effect<00:02:19.540> of<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.870> polarizer<00:02:24.180> it's<00:02:25.180> been

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
little effect of a polarizer it's been

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:26.610 
little effect of a polarizer it's been
the<00:02:25.390> rest<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.720> day<00:02:25.840> scouting<00:02:26.230> around<00:02:26.470> I'll

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
to be in wind I guess wait for right

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.290 
to be in wind I guess wait for right
conditions<00:03:13.320> for<00:03:13.380> that<00:03:13.910> but<00:03:14.910> here<00:03:15.060> in<00:03:15.150> Death

Dante's<00:03:29.580> view<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:29.850> found<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.240> really

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
Dante's view I found a really

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.530 
Dante's view I found a really
interesting<00:03:30.830> spot<00:03:31.830> down<00:03:32.220> below<00:03:32.550> which<00:03:32.880> I'm

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540

going<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.750> try<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.930> get<00:03:34.080> out<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:35.090> think<00:03:36.090> I

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
going to try to get out to I think I

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.730 
going to try to get out to I think I
might<00:03:36.360> have<00:03:36.510> some<00:03:36.690> photographic<00:03:37.140> potential

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
might have some photographic potential

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.190 
might have some photographic potential
but<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.220> was<00:03:38.790> doing<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.120> from<00:03:39.240> 5,000<00:03:39.870> feet<00:03:39.959> above

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
but I was doing it from 5,000 feet above

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.640 
but I was doing it from 5,000 feet above
and<00:03:41.930> look<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:42.959> little<00:03:43.110> different<00:03:43.470> on<00:03:43.560> the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
and look a little different on the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.120 
and look a little different on the
valley<00:03:43.860> floor<00:03:44.540> how<00:03:45.540> does<00:03:45.630> that<00:03:45.750> go<00:03:45.900> Canyon

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
valley floor how does that go Canyon

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.570 
valley floor how does that go Canyon
go<00:03:48.940> over<00:03:49.090> here<00:03:49.120> and<00:03:49.800> so<00:03:50.800> it's<00:03:50.950> gone<00:03:51.100> over<00:03:51.400> here

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
go over here and so it's gone over here

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.190 
go over here and so it's gone over here
before<00:03:51.730> getting<00:03:52.210> some<00:03:52.360> lunch<00:03:52.570> and<00:03:52.810> then<00:03:52.930> and

all the salt water at bad water is

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.760 
all the salt water at bad water is
really<00:04:05.820> just<00:04:06.480> horrible<00:04:07.230> for<00:04:07.290> anything<00:04:07.590> you're

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.039 
crystals get in the eyelets of my boots
and<00:04:17.130> that<00:04:17.609> slices<00:04:18.420> right<00:04:18.600> through<00:04:18.900> the

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
and that slices right through the

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.039 
and that slices right through the
shoelaces<00:04:19.910> this<00:04:20.910> shoe<00:04:21.120> is<00:04:21.390> already<00:04:21.959> looking

pretty<00:04:22.350> bad<00:04:22.500> here<00:04:22.860> I<00:04:23.010> can<00:04:23.970> hardly<00:04:24.420> even<00:04:24.540> tie

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
pretty bad here I can hardly even tie

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.450 
pretty bad here I can hardly even tie
that<00:04:24.990> so<00:04:25.320> I<00:04:25.380> was<00:04:25.530> up<00:04:25.680> bring<00:04:25.890> an<00:04:25.950> extra<00:04:26.100> set<00:04:26.430> of

laces just in case since I need to take

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.630

my<00:04:34.320> pack<00:04:34.560> off<00:04:34.740> and<00:04:34.770> put<00:04:35.040> it<00:04:35.100> on<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.280> ground<00:04:35.460> in

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
my pack off and put it on the ground in

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.620

and<00:04:37.020> it's<00:04:37.680> not<00:04:38.130> really<00:04:38.310> feasible<00:04:38.520> here

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
and it's not really feasible here

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.610 
and it's not really feasible here
because<00:04:39.060> it's<00:04:39.210> nasty<00:04:39.750> salt<00:04:40.110> water<00:04:40.290> everywhere

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
because it's nasty salt water everywhere

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.590 
because it's nasty salt water everywhere
I<00:04:40.830> brought<00:04:41.520> along<00:04:41.610> this<00:04:41.850> tool<00:04:41.970> IKEA<00:04:42.300> folding

it's<00:05:16.850> hoping<00:05:17.090> I<00:05:17.150> might<00:05:17.270> be<00:05:17.450> able<00:05:17.600> to<00:05:17.660> get<00:05:17.780> a

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
it's hoping I might be able to get a

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.640 
it's hoping I might be able to get a
shot<00:05:18.110> of<00:05:19.540> the<00:05:20.540> mountains<00:05:20.870> over<00:05:21.110> here<00:05:21.350> as<00:05:21.500> they

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
shot of the mountains over here as they

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.910 
shot of the mountains over here as they
were<00:05:21.770> still<00:05:21.950> illuminated<00:05:22.160> by<00:05:22.550> the<00:05:22.580> Sun<00:05:22.670> but

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
were still illuminated by the Sun but

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.180 
were still illuminated by the Sun but
the<00:05:24.920> light<00:05:25.100> was<00:05:25.220> just<00:05:25.250> moving<00:05:25.550> way<00:05:25.790> too<00:05:25.820> fast

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
the light was just moving way too fast

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.170 
the light was just moving way too fast
but<00:05:28.190> I<00:05:28.220> don't<00:05:28.520> know<00:05:28.580> if<00:05:28.700> asking<00:05:28.880> me<00:05:28.970> the<00:05:29.060> best

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
but I don't know if asking me the best

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.140 
but I don't know if asking me the best
shot<00:05:29.330> anyways<00:05:30.580> we're<00:05:31.580> getting<00:05:31.760> a<00:05:31.790> really<00:05:31.970> nice

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
shot anyways we're getting a really nice

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.930 
shot anyways we're getting a really nice
gradient<00:05:32.600> here<00:05:33.200> from<00:05:33.650> the<00:05:33.860> yellows<00:05:34.700> all<00:05:34.850> the

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
gradient here from the yellows all the

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.640 
gradient here from the yellows all the
way<00:05:35.000> up<00:05:35.060> to<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.240> Blues<00:05:38.080> good<00:05:39.080> reflections

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
way up to the Blues good reflections

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.880 
way up to the Blues good reflections
good<00:05:39.830> foreground<00:05:40.340> I<00:05:41.230> think<00:05:42.230> I'm<00:05:42.350> gonna<00:05:42.470> wait

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
good foreground I think I'm gonna wait

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.500 
good foreground I think I'm gonna wait
and<00:05:43.160> kind<00:05:43.430> of<00:05:43.460> see<00:05:43.640> what<00:05:43.760> happens<00:05:44.210> it's<00:05:44.390> a

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
and kind of see what happens it's a

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.950 
and kind of see what happens it's a
difficult<00:05:44.780> shot<00:05:45.170> as<00:05:45.410> far<00:05:45.710> as<00:05:45.830> the<00:05:45.920> exposure

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
difficult shot as far as the exposure

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.300 
difficult shot as far as the exposure
but<00:05:47.960> it<00:05:48.170> should<00:05:48.350> be<00:05:48.470> a<00:05:48.500> similar<00:05:48.830> shot<00:05:49.040> now

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
but it should be a similar shot now

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.390 
but it should be a similar shot now
versus<00:05:49.850> in<00:05:50.030> the<00:05:50.120> morning<00:05:50.480> so<00:05:50.770> and<00:05:51.770> then<00:05:52.070> we<00:05:52.280> get

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
versus in the morning so and then we get

00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:08.559 
versus in the morning so and then we get
a<00:05:52.460> shot<00:05:52.700> at<00:05:52.940> it<00:05:53.090> and<00:05:53.290> see<00:05:54.290> what<00:05:54.440> comes<00:05:54.620> of<00:05:54.800> it

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:08.569 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:17.620 

you

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.030 

well<00:06:18.630> I<00:06:18.660> went<00:06:18.870> ahead<00:06:18.960> and<00:06:19.170> took<00:06:19.260> my<00:06:19.410> shots<00:06:19.680> I

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 
well I went ahead and took my shots I

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.650 
well I went ahead and took my shots I
took<00:06:20.760> two<00:06:21.210> shots<00:06:21.570> on<00:06:22.170> Velvia<00:06:22.590> 50<00:06:23.010> and<00:06:23.940> I<00:06:24.420> think

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
took two shots on Velvia 50 and I think

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.090 
took two shots on Velvia 50 and I think
I<00:06:24.720> may<00:06:24.840> have<00:06:24.930> compromised<00:06:25.470> one<00:06:25.770> of<00:06:25.860> the<00:06:25.920> sheets

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 
I may have compromised one of the sheets

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.330 
I may have compromised one of the sheets
of<00:06:26.250> film<00:06:26.900> but<00:06:27.900> the<00:06:28.830> other<00:06:28.950> one<00:06:29.070> is<00:06:29.100> probably

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
of film but the other one is probably

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
of film but the other one is probably
okay<00:06:30.380> strick<00:06:31.380> exposure<00:06:31.830> because<00:06:32.580> I'm<00:06:32.940> dealing

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
okay strick exposure because I'm dealing

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.690 
okay strick exposure because I'm dealing
with<00:06:33.390> a<00:06:33.510> really<00:06:33.780> strong<00:06:34.310> and<00:06:35.310> bright

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700 
with a really strong and bright

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.840 
with a really strong and bright
reflection<00:06:36.650> but<00:06:37.650> also<00:06:37.830> I<00:06:37.980> hope<00:06:38.190> to<00:06:38.340> show<00:06:38.520> some

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
reflection but also I hope to show some

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.270 
reflection but also I hope to show some
of<00:06:38.880> the<00:06:39.180> cracks<00:06:40.170> and<00:06:40.380> the<00:06:40.470> salt<00:06:40.770> that<00:06:40.950> lie

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 
of the cracks and the salt that lie

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.140 
of the cracks and the salt that lie
beneath<00:06:41.490> the<00:06:41.700> surface<00:06:41.880> of<00:06:42.090> the<00:06:42.150> water<00:06:44.150> the

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
beneath the surface of the water the

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.540 
beneath the surface of the water the
mountain<00:06:45.600> there<00:06:46.020> on<00:06:46.170> the<00:06:46.290> left<00:06:46.470> side<00:06:46.710> I<00:06:47.190> want

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
mountain there on the left side I want

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.400 
mountain there on the left side I want
to<00:06:47.610> try<00:06:47.730> to<00:06:47.790> hold<00:06:47.940> some<00:06:48.180> detail<00:06:48.570> in<00:06:48.600> but<00:06:49.260> also

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:49.410 
to try to hold some detail in but also

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.150 
to try to hold some detail in but also
in<00:06:49.680> the<00:06:49.770> sky<00:06:50.040> and<00:06:50.630> I'm<00:06:51.630> kind<00:06:51.900> of<00:06:51.960> unsure<00:06:52.170> of<00:06:52.770> my

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 
in the sky and I'm kind of unsure of my

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.430 
in the sky and I'm kind of unsure of my
meter<00:06:53.400> reading<00:06:53.730> I<00:06:53.970> don't<00:06:54.930> know<00:06:55.110> if<00:06:55.230> I<00:06:55.290> did<00:06:55.410> a

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 
meter reading I don't know if I did a

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.840 
meter reading I don't know if I did a
good<00:06:55.530> job<00:06:55.680> I<00:06:57.890> guess<00:06:58.890> the<00:06:59.010> good<00:06:59.130> news<00:06:59.190> is<00:06:59.370> that

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
good job I guess the good news is that

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.210 
good job I guess the good news is that
in<00:07:00.240> the<00:07:00.780> morning<00:07:01.110> I'll<00:07:01.380> come<00:07:01.440> out<00:07:01.800> here<00:07:02.040> and<00:07:02.160> I

in the morning I'll come out here and I
can<00:07:02.460> take<00:07:03.030> essentially<00:07:03.450> the<00:07:03.540> same<00:07:03.690> shot<00:07:03.960> that

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:04.230 
can take essentially the same shot that

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.200 
can take essentially the same shot that
gives<00:07:05.160> you<00:07:05.280> an<00:07:05.370> opportunity<00:07:05.580> to<00:07:05.880> load<00:07:06.060> up<00:07:06.150> a

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210 
gives you an opportunity to load up a

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.110 
gives you an opportunity to load up a
couple<00:07:06.450> more<00:07:06.540> film<00:07:06.780> holders<00:07:07.970> camera<00:07:08.970> will
