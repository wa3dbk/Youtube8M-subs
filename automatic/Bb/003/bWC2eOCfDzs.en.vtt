00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
curves are all okay these are the first

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.410 
curves are all okay these are the first
steps<00:00:06.690> first<00:00:07.400> step<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.670> you<00:00:08.910> want<00:00:09.090> your<00:00:09.210> foot

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
steps first step is you want your foot

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.000 
steps first step is you want your foot
to<00:00:09.690> be<00:00:09.809> like<00:00:09.990> this<00:00:10.200> when<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.559> kick<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.860> ball

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
to be like this when you kick the ball

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.640 
to be like this when you kick the ball
so<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:11.940> can<00:00:12.120> hit<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.389> with<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.290> part<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.559> your

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
so you can hit it with that part of your

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.880 
so you can hit it with that part of your
foot<00:00:14.540> right<00:00:15.540> here<00:00:17.840> the<00:00:18.840> second<00:00:19.230> part<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.650> there

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
foot right here the second part is there

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.650 
foot right here the second part is there
are<00:00:20.010> two<00:00:20.220> ways<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.609> doing<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.359> get<00:00:21.449> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
are two ways of doing this to get the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.050 
are two ways of doing this to get the
spin<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.980> want<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.279> spin<00:00:23.519> where<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.910> ball

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
spin you want to spin where the ball

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.509 
spin you want to spin where the ball
spins<00:00:24.689> like<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.430> in<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:27.000> air<00:00:28.519> preferably

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
spins like that in the air preferably

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.040 
spins like that in the air preferably
and<00:00:30.090> then<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.449> would<00:00:30.570> occur<00:00:31.940> there<00:00:32.940> are<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.630> few

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
and then it would occur there are a few

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.630 
and then it would occur there are a few
steps<00:00:34.290> step<00:00:34.950> 1<00:00:35.329> learn<00:00:36.329> your<00:00:36.360> foot<00:00:36.780> please

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
steps step 1 learn your foot please

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.310 
steps step 1 learn your foot please
first<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:39.000> can't<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.360> your<00:00:39.480> foot<00:00:39.719> really

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
first you can't have your foot really

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.600 
first you can't have your foot really
wide<00:00:40.559> away<00:00:40.890> from<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.219> ball<00:00:41.399> like<00:00:41.579> that

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
wide away from the ball like that

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.760 
wide away from the ball like that
because<00:00:42.510> then<00:00:42.750> when<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.020> kick<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.260> your<00:00:43.559> foot

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
because then when you kick it your foot

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.560 
because then when you kick it your foot
is<00:00:43.860> going<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.070> swing<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.820> bring<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.420> all<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
is going to swing and bring it all the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.670 
is going to swing and bring it all the
way<00:00:45.750> over<00:00:45.930> there<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.469> going<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.620> be

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
way over there and it's just going to be

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.529 
way over there and it's just going to be
like<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.920> regular<00:00:47.160> shot<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:48.149> going<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.360> miss

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
like a regular shot it's going to miss

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.010 
like a regular shot it's going to miss
the<00:00:48.660> goal<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:50.210> first<00:00:51.210> step<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.780> put<00:00:51.809> your

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
the goal so first step is to put your

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.010 
the goal so first step is to put your
foot<00:00:52.610> closer<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:54.000> into<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.539> ball<00:00:54.719> then<00:00:54.989> you

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
foot closer it into the ball then you

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.080 
foot closer it into the ball then you
normally<00:00:55.320> would<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.610> more<00:00:56.820> support

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
normally would so you have more support

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.290 
normally would so you have more support
and<00:00:58.070> you're<00:00:59.070> able<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.430> swing<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.879> foot

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
and you're able to swing that foot

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.380 
and you're able to swing that foot
around<00:01:00.480> like<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.670> second<00:01:02.670> step<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
around like that second step is the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.870 
around like that second step is the
correct<00:01:03.660> swing<00:01:04.280> it's<00:01:05.280> not<00:01:05.489> like<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.760> already

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
correct swing it's not like I already

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.280 
correct swing it's not like I already
get<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.060> shot<00:01:06.299> where<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.510> use<00:01:06.689> their<00:01:06.869> leases

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
get a shot where you use their leases

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.039 
get a shot where you use their leases
but<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.799> want<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.330> swing<00:01:09.330> your<00:01:09.360> foot<00:01:09.720> like

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
but you want to swing your foot like

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.539 
but you want to swing your foot like
that<00:01:10.350> either<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> out<00:01:11.909> way<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.360> get<00:01:12.720> spin

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
that either to the out way to get spin

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.609 
that either to the out way to get spin
or<00:01:15.200> use<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.439> instep<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.070> swing<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.670> around

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
or use the instep and swing it around

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.050 
or use the instep and swing it around
but<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.830> do<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.159> second<00:01:20.549> version<00:01:20.729> you're

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
but if you do the second version you're

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.890 
but if you do the second version you're
going<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.240> get<00:01:21.420> more<00:01:21.659> spin<00:01:22.369> but<00:01:23.659> which<00:01:24.659> means

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
going to get more spin but which means

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.490 
going to get more spin but which means
more<00:01:25.140> curve<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:26.400> less<00:01:26.850> accuracy<00:01:27.540> because

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
more curve but less accuracy because

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.960 
more curve but less accuracy because
you're<00:01:28.680> bringing<00:01:29.159> your<00:01:29.250> foot<00:01:29.460> around<00:01:29.549> and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
you're bringing your foot around and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.240 
you're bringing your foot around and
you're<00:01:30.530> following<00:01:31.530> through<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.920> different

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
you're following through in a different

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.130 
you're following through in a different
portion<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.840> last<00:01:34.110> step<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:35.390> to<00:01:38.810> learn<00:01:39.810> how<00:01:39.960> to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
portion the last step is to learn how to

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.859 
portion the last step is to learn how to
raise<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.590> ball<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.070> kick<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.400> with<00:01:41.869> lube

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
raise the ball if you kick it with lube

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.190 
raise the ball if you kick it with lube
beginners<00:01:43.229> will<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.250> center<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> ball

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
beginners will in the center of the ball

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.990 
beginners will in the center of the ball
when<00:01:46.200> you're<00:01:46.380> trying<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.770> curve<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.189> it'll

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
when you're trying to curve it it'll

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.910 
when you're trying to curve it it'll
just<00:01:48.390> roll<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> ground<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.470> won't<00:01:49.649> even<00:01:49.740> go

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
just roll on the ground it won't even go

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.789 
just roll on the ground it won't even go
a<00:01:50.040> few<00:01:50.759> inches<00:01:50.970> off<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.329> ground<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.960> also

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
a few inches off the ground and also

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.980 
a few inches off the ground and also
this<00:01:53.070> technique<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.729> only<00:01:54.420> going<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.689> be<00:01:54.780> used

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
this technique is only going to be used

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.399 
this technique is only going to be used
on<00:01:55.140> free<00:01:55.380> kicks<00:01:55.649> or<00:01:56.460> long-range<00:01:57.329> shots<00:01:57.899> so

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
on free kicks or long-range shots so

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.160 
on free kicks or long-range shots so
that's<00:01:58.649> when<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.890> want<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.130> reason<00:01:59.610> vol<00:02:00.170> so

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
that's when you want to reason vol so

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.069 
that's when you want to reason vol so
yeah<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.670> last<00:02:02.909> step<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.570> finish<00:02:03.780> it

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
yeah and the last step is to finish it

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.619 
yeah and the last step is to finish it
like<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.439> pro
