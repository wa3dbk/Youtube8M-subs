that same density as I said they both

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.990 
that same density as I said they both
work<00:01:59.969> absolutely<00:02:00.780> amazing<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.740> love<00:02:02.159> them<00:02:02.340> both

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
for contouring that was about it I never

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.630 
for contouring that was about it I never
really<00:02:28.530> used<00:02:28.739> it<00:02:28.890> for<00:02:29.040> foundation<00:02:29.519> or

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
really used it for foundation or

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.970 
really used it for foundation or
anything<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:30.150> cause<00:02:30.269> it's<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.510> bit<00:02:30.780> big<00:02:31.170> in<00:02:31.439> my

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
anything just cause it's a bit big in my

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.059 
anything just cause it's a bit big in my
personal<00:02:32.489> preference<00:02:33.019> opinion<00:02:34.019> uh-huh<00:02:34.620> but

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
personal preference opinion uh-huh but

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.670 
personal preference opinion uh-huh but
this<00:02:35.219> is<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.370> Sedona<00:02:35.730> lace<00:02:35.849> one<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.389> 602<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.230> if

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
this is a Sedona lace one the 602 and if

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.530 
this is a Sedona lace one the 602 and if
you<00:02:37.769> can<00:02:37.950> see<00:02:38.219> it's<00:02:38.579> ever<00:02:38.879> so<00:02:39.180> slightly

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
you can see it's ever so slightly

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.949 
you can see it's ever so slightly
smaller<00:02:40.189> it's<00:02:41.189> more<00:02:41.459> narrow<00:02:41.909> here<00:02:42.359> this<00:02:42.750> one's

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
smaller it's more narrow here this one's

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.569 
smaller it's more narrow here this one's
a<00:02:43.079> lot<00:02:43.230> wider<00:02:43.469> here<00:02:44.720> they<00:02:46.159> well<00:02:47.159> as<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.459> can

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
a lot wider here they well as you can

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.369 
a lot wider here they well as you can
see<00:02:47.639> the<00:02:48.569> single<00:02:48.750> one<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:49.049> a<00:02:49.079> little<00:02:49.260> bit

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
see the single one is a little bit

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.890 
see the single one is a little bit
bigger<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.280> same<00:02:50.549> thing<00:02:50.970> they<00:02:51.239> just<00:02:51.269> as<00:02:51.689> dense

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
bigger the same thing they just as dense

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.899 
bigger the same thing they just as dense
as<00:02:52.049> each<00:02:52.230> other<00:02:52.409> the<00:02:53.159> Sedona<00:02:53.459> lace<00:02:53.549> one<00:02:53.819> is

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
as each other the Sedona lace one is

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.569 
as each other the Sedona lace one is
ever<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:54.329> slightly<00:02:54.359> softer<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.409> prefer<00:02:56.310> this

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
ever so slightly softer I prefer this

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.580 
ever so slightly softer I prefer this
for<00:02:56.879> foundation<00:02:57.689> I<00:02:57.810> think<00:02:58.049> this<00:02:58.169> is<00:02:58.290> amazing

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
for foundation I think this is amazing

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.440 
for foundation I think this is amazing
for<00:02:59.040> foundation<00:02:59.579> I<00:02:59.790> haven't<00:03:00.180> used<00:03:00.329> this

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
for foundation I haven't used this

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.089 
for foundation I haven't used this
contouring<00:03:00.959> but<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.230> like<00:03:01.469> to<00:03:01.650> use<00:03:01.799> it<00:03:01.980> with<00:03:02.069> my

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
contouring but I like to use it with my

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.270 
contouring but I like to use it with my
I<00:03:02.909> used<00:03:03.299> to<00:03:03.419> today<00:03:03.540> with<00:03:03.840> my<00:03:04.019> Studio<00:03:04.950> Fix<00:03:05.189> fluid
