00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
hello everyone last week we showed you a

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.849 
hello everyone last week we showed you a
video<00:00:05.399> showing<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.090> new<00:00:06.240> inner<00:00:06.810> van<00:00:07.080> XT<00:00:07.650> and

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
video showing the new inner van XT and

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.530 
video showing the new inner van XT and
how<00:00:08.010> it's<00:00:08.219> better<00:00:08.430> suited<00:00:08.790> for<00:00:08.969> taller

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
how it's better suited for taller

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.049 
how it's better suited for taller
customers<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.920> dealer<00:00:11.459> asked<00:00:11.730> me<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.850> question

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
customers a dealer asked me a question

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.629 
customers a dealer asked me a question
on<00:00:12.510> why<00:00:12.840> do<00:00:12.900> we<00:00:13.110> need<00:00:13.260> to<00:00:13.379> offer<00:00:13.530> both<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.459> I

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
on why do we need to offer both and I

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:15.769 
on why do we need to offer both and I
thought<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:14.850> would<00:00:15.059> put<00:00:15.209> this<00:00:15.389> video<00:00:15.570> together

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:15.779 
thought I would put this video together

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.950 
thought I would put this video together
with<00:00:16.139> Bernie's<00:00:16.740> help<00:00:17.010> showing<00:00:17.789> how<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.570> regular

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
with Bernie's help showing how a regular

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.080 
with Bernie's help showing how a regular
intervene<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.890> better<00:00:20.130> suited<00:00:20.460> for<00:00:20.820> somebody

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
intervene is better suited for somebody

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.690 
intervene is better suited for somebody
at<00:00:21.330> Bernie's<00:00:21.720> height<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.320> how<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.740> XT<00:00:23.340> itself

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
at Bernie's height and how the XT itself

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.520 
at Bernie's height and how the XT itself
just<00:00:24.000> really<00:00:24.420> would<00:00:24.600> not<00:00:24.780> work<00:00:25.020> very<00:00:25.289> well<00:00:25.350> for

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:25.530 
just really would not work very well for

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.680 
just really would not work very well for
Bernie<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.640> right<00:00:26.820> now<00:00:26.970> we're<00:00:27.150> looking<00:00:27.180> at<00:00:27.570> the

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690 
Bernie so right now we're looking at the

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.660 
Bernie so right now we're looking at the
inner<00:00:27.840> van<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.619> actually<00:00:29.039> birdies<00:00:29.400> enter

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
inner van this is actually birdies enter

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.119 
inner van this is actually birdies enter
van<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.390> he's<00:00:30.869> driving<00:00:31.320> into<00:00:31.590> his<00:00:31.710> usual

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
van and he's driving into his usual

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:44.060 
van and he's driving into his usual
position

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.770 

first<00:00:44.730> I'm<00:00:44.880> sure<00:00:44.940> if<00:00:45.150> the<00:00:45.270> camera<00:00:45.600> wasn't

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
first I'm sure if the camera wasn't

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.270 
first I'm sure if the camera wasn't
rolling<00:00:46.020> he<00:00:46.290> would<00:00:46.410> roll<00:00:46.620> right<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.980> with<00:00:47.130> no

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
rolling he would roll right in with no

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.610 
rolling he would roll right in with no
problems<00:00:47.720> all<00:00:48.720> right<00:00:48.900> so<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.290> is<00:00:49.350> Bernie

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
problems all right so this is Bernie

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.110 
problems all right so this is Bernie
this<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.890> your<00:00:50.130> actual<00:00:50.340> driving<00:00:50.640> position

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
this is your actual driving position

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.490 
this is your actual driving position
Bernie<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.780> height<00:00:51.930> they<00:00:52.110> normally

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
Bernie this is the height they normally

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.290 
Bernie this is the height they normally
sit<00:00:53.280> at<00:00:53.430> okay<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:55.230> very<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:56.070> would<00:00:56.850> say<00:00:56.970> very

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
sit at okay and very I would say very

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.619 
sit at okay and very I would say very
close<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:58.730> normal

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
close to normal

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.600 
close to normal
Oh<00:01:00.660> II<00:01:01.050> am<00:01:01.350> height<00:01:01.650> than<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.040> vehicle<00:01:02.400> so<00:01:02.550> you

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
Oh II am height than the vehicle so you

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.979 
Oh II am height than the vehicle so you
have<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.940> limp<00:01:03.090> no<00:01:03.300> limits<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.809> your

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
have to limp no limits on your

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.990 
have to limp no limits on your
visibility<00:01:04.259> and<00:01:04.589> that's<00:01:05.369> about<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.820> same

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
visibility and that's about the same

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.790 
visibility and that's about the same
height<00:01:06.270> as<00:01:06.300> the<00:01:06.740> rearview<00:01:07.740> mirror

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.440 

okay<00:01:15.800> I<00:01:15.830> think<00:01:16.070> let's<00:01:16.670> go<00:01:16.820> over<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.120> integrand

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
okay I think let's go over the integrand

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.740 
okay I think let's go over the integrand
XT<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:17.990> we'll<00:01:18.110> see<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.380> difference<00:01:19.690> okay<00:01:20.690> so

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
XT and we'll see the difference okay so

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.290 
XT and we'll see the difference okay so
we're<00:01:21.020> going<00:01:21.170> into<00:01:21.410> the<00:01:21.620> XT<00:01:22.040> here<00:01:25.060> right<00:01:26.060> away

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
we're going into the XT here right away

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.480 
we're going into the XT here right away
you'll<00:01:26.900> see<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.230> extra<00:01:27.530> Headroom<00:01:27.740> on<00:01:28.160> Barney

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
you'll see the extra Headroom on Barney

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:44.510 
you'll see the extra Headroom on Barney
right<00:01:28.670> there<00:01:29.050> quite<00:01:30.050> a<00:01:30.080> difference

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.819 

okay<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.329> Bernie's<00:01:45.689> Inquisition<00:01:46.619> I'm<00:01:46.710> going

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
okay so Bernie's Inquisition I'm going

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.380 
okay so Bernie's Inquisition I'm going
to<00:01:46.890> cut<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.280> go<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.549> different<00:01:47.729> angle<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.210> we

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
to cut and go to a different angle so we

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.569 
to cut and go to a different angle so we
can<00:01:48.509> see<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.869> little<00:01:48.960> bit<00:01:49.229> better<00:01:49.579> okay

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
can see this a little bit better okay

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.800 
can see this a little bit better okay
I'm<00:01:50.670> looking<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.060> through<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.299> passenger

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
I'm looking in through the passenger

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.969 
I'm looking in through the passenger
window<00:01:51.960> here<00:01:52.290> what<00:01:52.439> do<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.590> think<00:01:52.799> Bernie

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
window here what do you think Bernie

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.469 
window here what do you think Bernie
well<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.380> can<00:01:55.380> my<00:01:56.310> eye<00:01:56.340> line<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:57.000> above<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
well I can my eye line is just above the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.480 
well I can my eye line is just above the
top<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.869> steering<00:01:58.110> wheel<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.619> I'm<00:01:59.250> sure

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
top of the steering wheel and I'm sure

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.190 
top of the steering wheel and I'm sure
that<00:01:59.729> there<00:01:59.970> are<00:02:00.119> some<00:02:00.329> really<00:02:00.570> short<00:02:00.960> people

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
that there are some really short people

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.279 
that there are some really short people
that<00:02:01.619> drive<00:02:02.399> under<00:02:03.119> these<00:02:03.299> circumstances<00:02:03.509> but

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
that drive under these circumstances but

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.370 
that drive under these circumstances but
I<00:02:04.320> wouldn't<00:02:04.770> feel<00:02:05.009> comfortable<00:02:05.580> driving<00:02:06.380> in

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
I wouldn't feel comfortable driving in

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.419 
I wouldn't feel comfortable driving in
this<00:02:07.590> position

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
this position

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.120 
this position
maybe<00:02:09.330> just<00:02:09.660> because<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.560> know<00:02:10.709> for<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.950> last

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
maybe just because you know for the last

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.309 
maybe just because you know for the last
hundred<00:02:11.310> years<00:02:11.489> I've<00:02:11.910> been<00:02:12.090> sitting<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:13.290> know

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
hundred years I've been sitting you know

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.800 
hundred years I've been sitting you know
several<00:02:13.890> inches<00:02:14.190> higher<00:02:14.580> okay<00:02:15.390> we're<00:02:15.599> rolling

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
several inches higher okay we're rolling

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.509 
several inches higher okay we're rolling
here<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.260> I'm<00:02:16.349> just<00:02:16.380> showing<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
here and I'm just showing the the

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.990 
here and I'm just showing the the
difference<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.180> in<00:02:18.750> height<00:02:19.650> from<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.790> back

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
difference in in height from the back

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.820 
difference in in height from the back
here<00:02:21.330> obviously<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:22.080> can<00:02:22.200> see<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.380> Bernie's

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
here obviously you can see that Bernie's

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.309 
prefer building a few different models
as<00:02:37.260> possible<00:02:37.950> just<00:02:38.790> for<00:02:39.239> their<00:02:39.450> simplicity

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
as possible just for their simplicity

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.729 
as possible just for their simplicity
for<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:41.090> maintaining<00:02:42.090> competitive<00:02:42.900> pricing

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739
