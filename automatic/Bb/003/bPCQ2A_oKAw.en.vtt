00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.099
 welcome to fast food boxing good today 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.189
 the subject to talk about is knives 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.020
 many times when buying for 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.029
 give it away to get ready and have in 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.160
 our kitchen not only us 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.710
 we find the inconvenience of 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.540
 variety of knife material but 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.990
 also the different forms that 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.650
 there are knives 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:40.530
 so let's explain a bit these 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.620
 types of spells in the advantage that 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.570
 they have to come with a kilo 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.239
 and closes it 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:55.040
 and the disadvantages are very cheap and 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:57.890
 economic but what happens the metal that is 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.620
 used for this type of knives in 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.650
 general is a metal that is low 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.650
 quality 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:12.170
 I do not know which edge but we can not either 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.170
 grant the hammer of the one who has 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:20.159
 these start from here to here with 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.780
 a medium-high range of 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.090
 in terms of metal quality 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.780
 we already have different forms of 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:32.020
 blades this is a blade knife 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.830
 that a very thin sheet is flexible 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.640
 this is a harder blade and this is a 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.640
 bit harder 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.440
 plus the thickness of the sheet 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.980
 can see 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.840
 that also gives a bit the hardness of the 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.850
 metal 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.830
 each one has different utility for 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.500
 example this is to reinforce 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.050
 in too large pieces of meat without 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.840
 whole animals or half network what 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.170
 selections call this this kind of 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.720
 sheet so it's very flexible is finally 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.360
 used to throw us like fish 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.410
 where especially when we are starting 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.390
 or take out the skin and because we need 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.570
 incubate the leaf a little to go very 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.940
 behind the skin and you can get the most 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.240
 amount of meat possible and this 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.959
 knife is really used to use 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:35.170
 things in general like chop cut 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.170
 good very very small 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.810
 the good disadvantage the disadvantages that 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.170
 they have the comparison with this knife 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.250
 which it is one of ceramic pottery 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.550
 good is one of the metals 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.060
 better in the sense that we're not going to 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.800
 have the problem of when we use 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.450
 we cut onions and we went to fish 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.879
 simply to improve it with water 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.550
 the advantage it has is that it does not absorb 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.260
 the majors then we will not have 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.280
 to clean it as it helps us to go through with 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.730
 the metal that if we cut there we pass 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.410
 another type of food we are going to do that 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.680
 wash it with soap and water to remove 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.160
 goods and flavor that are absorbed from the 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.160
 foods 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.230
 already depending on the range of 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.870
 metals 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.000
 we find types of knives that are 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.079
 economic that I put from 15 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.450
 euros on the knife to up to 60 and 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.150
 some can reach up to 150 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.579
 quietly 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.579
 among others it stands out that it also has 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:47.010
 that when falling are quite resistant to 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.659
 difference of the ceramic that there is 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.930
 be a little careful about that 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:54.209
 because as it is a type of stone that 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.930
 it usually gives a form is a mineral that 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.930
 it would be a way 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.049
 in more practice in terms of falls 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.750
 the advantage that ceramic has to 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:08.230
 difference of these is that the edge that 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.849
 it is given and then one can 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.629
 keep keeping turning it 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.629
 correctly 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.139
 last a lot more two or three times more 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.790
 that the style of a sheet of metal is 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.730
 normal 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.280
 then we passed it to these that was good 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.410
 to show a little teach this guy 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.720
 of knife that we have we use it 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.720
 they did very fast is a metal that is 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.320
 quite acceptable and allows us 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.690
 use for little things like 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.030
 vegetables are for some type of turning 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.700
 followed the way we want to give some 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.550
 food another of the disadvantages that 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.500
 they have the ceramic knives is their 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.260
 high price in relation to the others 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.540
 of metals the best-known brands that 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.360
 we found from america functions 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.970
 the best ones are from the brand that will be 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.200
 remember to watch this video as well as 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:06.200
