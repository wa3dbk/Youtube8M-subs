00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.210
 hi friends from that band that 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.009
 as you are today I bring you one 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.200
 opinion that good because it is not very 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.509
 usual that they of my opinion on 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.039
 certain things apart from the analyzes the 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.109
 reviews 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.329
 and well, it's because I think that 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.880
 neither do you care much what I 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.739
 can think about certain issues that's why 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.890
 I prefer to bring applications to quote 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:31.199
 before getting into polemic or getting into 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.329
 in opinions that cause others can 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.610
 that does not interest you but the truth is that 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.010
 I felt that I had to give my opinion 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.430
 especially my warning for those 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:47.070
 that you have a steak aspire 1 572 g or the 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.650
 571 also be careful because so 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.640
 less in these computers the windows 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.470
 8.1 is a real trash I do not 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.500
 ask because they know that good 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:02.269
 well windows 8.1 is one is the evolution 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.640
 natural of windows 8 that has already 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:08.460
 a year or so in the market and that in 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.890
 theory is a product that is what 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.110
 sufficiently tested and consolidated 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.409
 as to not give errors but the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.750
 truth is that the windows forced me 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.740
 I practically put a gun in the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.009
 head 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.159
 and forced me to move from windows 8 to 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.020
 windows 8.1 for free that yes 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.420
 but it did not stop giving me the can with what 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.149
 Well, I had to update to 8.1 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.950
 had to update to 8.1 remember 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.619
 within four hours remember inside 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.689
 remember within two hours eight 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.840
 hours the typical tactics that good 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.850
 Well, many products are not used to 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.799
 that in the end we finish updating 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.259
 although we do not want well the problem 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.299
 is that when I decide some 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.709
 days to update you have seen the 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.420
 review since breath 572 that I already 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:00.270
 I said and it is true that I had 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.429
 previously updated to 8.1 and what 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.530
 had to reverse to windows 8 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:09.440
 because well, they did not work for me 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.989
 certain function keys such as can be 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.750
 the suspension lower the brightness raise the 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.640
 brightness is also not to put it on 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.799
 good suspension in the suspension is not 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.349
 and x did not exist if I did not put myself as the 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.780
 computer in less paid whole but 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.010
 without turning off because you kept hearing 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.840
 what is the fan 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.689
 Do not try to turn it on by giving 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.959
 power keys to all keys 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.819
 gun or the mouse tried I do not know everything 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.640
 possible because because I was going back to 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.290
 settle down what is he going back to 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.180
 light up in quotes because it's that 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.709
 even today do not really know what 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.420
 state is that because it is not my suspension 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.190
 in hibernation or restart or 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.879
 off so well I do not know yet that 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.560
 been outside in another galaxy that 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:59.340
 put on the computer by hitting 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.810
 suspension in 8.1 and well then another 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.900
 problem for example was that I was 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.359
 it turned off only without telling 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.459
 maybe 20 minutes later and you guys 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.680
 you'll say and that's not because of the plan 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.900
 energy because it was not for the plan of 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.239
 kind of good energy to do when 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.370
 turns off when you get off the cap if not 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.040
 we played on the computer in 20 minutes of 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.379
 suspend no no it had nothing to do 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.700
 with fact and windows basically what 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:28.489
 he told me in the faxes in the questions in 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.290
 currents and in the forums was 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.100
 basically and said evil and soon the 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.770
 young 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.760
 because the truth is that there was no 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.640
 way to be able to control this so 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.360
 well I was forced to reverse 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.280
 again once again from 8.1 to windows 8 it 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.050
 I gave to restore had a lot of files 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.510
 I did not want to lose and then not 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.570
 could I did not have time to catch and 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.980
 pass them to a hard drive and in a 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:01.680
 beginning then I decided to restore the 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.320
 system and restore an image of 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.880
 windows 8 own computer because 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.520
 that's another one in today's computers 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.080
 day no longer brings a disk of 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.110
 installation that you say good I have 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.210
 the disk of windows 8 I put it and to start 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.270
 hence, it is restored with the same 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:20.070
 files this does not this works from 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.590
 of an image that you have on your hard drive 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.190
 stored and that's good when I did 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.150
 that 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.920
 when I restore it to windows 8 then I 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.130
 I found that it failed 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.640
 continuously every time I turned it on 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.700
 it gave me error because there was a file a 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.470
 fragment of the system that failed I do not know 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.720
 why and good because the truth is that I 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.550
 have taken a week that I did not have 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.680
 time to restore it but it's that 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.190
 basically I have run out of computer 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:55.090
 for a while and almost the videos the 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.650
 ivas its editing on the fly and 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.480
 uploading it because I was afraid that 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.040
 when it was turned off it would no longer turn to 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.570
 turn on because maybe he was wearing 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.280
 to light 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.680
 an hour and a half because I was 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.770
 trying to repair the system and so every 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.570
 time I lit a chain and a 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.390
 series of catastrophic misfortunes that the 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.100
 really good they have done me I have done 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.560
 pose to make this video of 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.690
 warning and also complaint for 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.030
 gentlemen and the ladies the and the 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.760
 seÃ±oritos and the young ladies of microsoft 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.910
 because good because the truth is that 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:31.030
 even if you have not tried 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:35.020
 never having had in a behaves a 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:37.820
 mac to buy an apple computer and 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.390
 mandar windows app 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:44.330
 very far to say nothing strange 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.910
 because the truth is that well, well, 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.510
 leaves a lot to be desired that day 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:52.730
 from today to a windows 8.1 even though 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.710
 they are not giving me the can 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.840
 continuously to update it and still 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.940
 so I just restored it to windows 8 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.860
 because well, I had to do it 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:05.510
 restoration of these totally heavy and 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.220
 super that erases all files 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.520
 after having been able to transfer it to 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:13.100
 external hard drive that I have therefore what 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.900
 fully restore and good it seems 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.570
 that is no longer giving that problem but 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.000
 certainly something that should not have 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.550
 It should never have happened because 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.410
 is that you run out of a computer and if the 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.390
 computer is your work tool 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.910
 like mine is therefore the truth that you 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.040
 you find a very big problem like that 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:34.910
 Well you be careful to 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:37.220
 update to windows 8.1 and I the truth 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.470
 Who is here sending my complaint to 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.100
 microsoft I guess this this well 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.680
 neither 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.680
 an impact but I did need 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.140
 that it had to be to the world so 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.140
 say it because I got angry because it was 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:53.060
 quite was capitalized all this week 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.160
 previous because good because it is that I 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.070
 I was without a computer simply because 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.230
 have updated to windows 8.1 of a 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.720
 totally official way in a way 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.760
 totally legal and good then a thousand 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.430
 problems that I hope will never be 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.710
 repeat again and I do not want them to 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.140
 nobody because the truth that is a 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.450
 annoyance and more having this computer 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.970
 that has cost money and that does not have 

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:19.340
 more than a year so good from here I 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:22.640
 protest to the world I hope that good 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.500
 what do you at least see 

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.620
 this video then you think twice 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.530
 update it to 8.1 and nothing to like 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.040
 if you liked to give him dislike if 

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.780
 unfortunately, you did not like it 

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.300
 subscribe if you want to be up to date 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:39.290
 in terms of android applications in 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:41.630
 how many reviews and good pills 

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:45.580
 technological and other greetings and 

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.580
 ramones in the following video of that
