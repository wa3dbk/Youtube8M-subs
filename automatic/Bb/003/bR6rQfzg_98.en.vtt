00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 what's up, stay, I'm wingham and I'm not 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.099
 we are in playing with head I am in 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.750
 common with the m4 16 on the Chinese side the 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.790
 Russians go out there because in this 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.250
 hallway there's enough action so I 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.039
 what I am going to try to do is going to be 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.870
 the return to a fairly fast way 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.930
 found 1 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.120
 where they want to go was this which 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.310
 I crossed and around here in this house 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.010
 here at the beginning there is usually enough 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.780
 action although I found out on the beach myself 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.570
 be bold so it sounds like 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.150
 I'm fucked up and what you see in the title 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.610
 do not worry the series ends in itself 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.190
 but now I will explain it, leave me a 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.770
 little bit let's see if he killed people 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.340
 that is around here already explained to us 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.079
 what comes the title killed this revive 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.570
 to this other 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.300
 and the truth that everything comment 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:59.100
 I do it is really how I like to comment 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:02.309
 I mean, it's useless to name a series like that 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.880
 and do what I do when I really 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.549
 like to do it like this at all in all 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.619
 the videos I make did not kill this other 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.390
 in the background even though I have little life and 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.909
 I thought I had recharged the same 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.100
 we can that is a to the left and 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.880
 another in the house and like the medicine cabinet 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.000
 cure i am 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:27.350
 values ​​and introduce you a little 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.780
 well there's a 320 something pretty something 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.630
 quite normal then what was 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.900
 thought is from now on chapter 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.550
 number 10 of the series I give it to 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.230
 finalized and from now on instead 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.000
 to name 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.340
 to continue with the series leaving with head 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.740
 what I'm going to do basically is going to be 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.450
 continue with these life that what I do is 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.360
 comment everything I do because it's what 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.080
 I like to comment when I play 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.360
 I think you already know that my channel from 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.630
 since I created it, he has always focused 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.260
 in trying to make you better with me 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.260
 lets learn together 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.210
 I really like doing this kind of 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.130
 comments where I'm explaining what 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.800
 I'm doing and others that I intend 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.340
 use minimapa drums nipper unam 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.340
 left 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.790
 I do not hear someone more than 10 meters 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.720
 Life was quite touched was 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.100
 pretty fucked up and then so what 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.790
 I said before now from now 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.360
 the likes this kind of likes this guy 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.460
 of comments I 'm not going to pigeonhole them 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.740
 in the series when with head but that 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.910
 will be the normal normal comments 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.910
 and so I'm not so 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.620
 I'm not so pressed between quotes to 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.750
 say only what I think if I do not 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.210
 I want to play some joke 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.970
 I want to comment something over 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.370
 whatever I say 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.890
 I've decided that I think the best way 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.080
 that from now on they do not pigeonhole 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.210
 my way of commenting on a series but 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.860
 that's basically how I like it 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.530
 comment to me and so I read the 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.090
 comments and the rest of the series seems 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.740
 What kind of comments do you like? 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.540
 enough to you it was not time for 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.010
 live it 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.250
 so what better 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.420
 I do it in a more natural way 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.800
 a slightly more sporadic form 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.230
 and the safest way is a way 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.900
 regular because obviously what I do not 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.270
 he liked to do what he did not want to do was 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.970
 bring for example two chapters to the 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.180
 week of when with head because I think 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.609
 what would it be like 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.219
 how to surpass with the series would be like 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.959
 overload the stocking and in the back 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:56.099
 when you move here forward I had 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.099
 planned the action of the hand 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.980
 I will not support them because 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.120
 then they are dead whenever my 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.120
 team has killed them 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.060
 OK, bye 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.350
 people in front of me people to my left 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.060
 I'm going to kill first those who are 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.060
 in front of me that are the threats 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.479
 that can kill me and from then on 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.459
 I worry about the left 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.930
 because obviously if I go first to Paul 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.310
 from my left I can kill those who 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.630
 they are in front of me so I prefer 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.639
 doing it the other way around kills the first one 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.449
 that are in front of me and from there 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.160
 I will kill or I'll kill you if I make a 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.700
 bullet of course without having a bullet what 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.320
 I see a little difficult 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.940
 they're going to kill my team because it's 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.210
 I live if I would not be dead obviously 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.220
 so perfect 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.030
 so do not worry for the people 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.210
 that has been alarmed about the title of 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.660
 chapter 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:56.490
 because now you are going to have more of these 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:58.530
 that if normally way and some fuck 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.969
 get up go until the elector 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.649
 people in front of me 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:04.599
 and I have people in the background so I'm going to 

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:06.610
 try to go for them but it must be 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:08.769
 in the house so I'm not going to take care 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.610
 a lot and I'm going to try to kill those who 

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:15.470
 they are here only a couple and then this one 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.240
 go through pressed you knew more or less 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.890
 and here I make the jump even seen in the 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.670
 because they are dead 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.670
 although seen not there 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.880
 over here so look to the bottom that 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.300
 I think they come out there we have finished not 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.300
 we are going bad 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.820
 although look at the last drop in the other 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.700
 low is this 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:43.420
 let's go down 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.420
 everyone 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:53.840
 so I have not said anything from 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.420
 now I will make more comments saying what 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.120
 what I think but simply not 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:02.180
 I'm going to pigeonhole in a series since it's 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:05.360
 my spontaneous natural way of commenting 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.590
 so I prefer to do it you can do it 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.630
 one more way 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.060
 more natural that is not encased in 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.040
 a series of when with head so 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.249
 summarizing when with head is finished 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.859
 but the 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:21.359
 the likes commented in this way do not 

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:23.639
 they did not get much less because it's like 

00:06:21.359 --> 00:06:25.379
 I like to comment and it's something that I think 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:27.359
 that the comments you told me 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:29.039
 costs you also like so for me 

00:06:27.359 --> 00:06:30.869
 part nothing more to add I hope I have 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:33.889
 liked the video and see you in another 

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:33.889
 only see you later
