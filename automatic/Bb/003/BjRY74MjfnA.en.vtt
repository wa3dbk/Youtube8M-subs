00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.540 

you<00:00:21.060> know<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.960> don't<00:00:22.590> think<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.890> Christian<00:00:23.310> can

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
you know I I don't think a Christian can

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.220 
you know I I don't think a Christian can
lose<00:00:23.820> their<00:00:24.150> salvation

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
lose their salvation

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.339 
lose their salvation
in<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.400> sense<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.789> they<00:00:27.180> can<00:00:27.510> lose<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.080> I

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
in the sense that they can lose it I

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.740 
in the sense that they can lose it I
think<00:00:28.920> though<00:00:29.160> what<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> real<00:00:30.119> question<00:00:30.330> is

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
think though what the real question is

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.520 
think though what the real question is
would<00:00:31.710> God<00:00:32.120> respect<00:00:33.120> somebody<00:00:33.899> if<00:00:34.350> they

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
would God respect somebody if they

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.920 
would God respect somebody if they
decided<00:00:34.980> somewhere<00:00:35.550> along<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.030> line<00:00:36.239> that

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
decided somewhere along the line that

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.420 
decided somewhere along the line that
they<00:00:37.079> said<00:00:37.320> hey<00:00:37.469> I'm<00:00:37.800> out<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.100> here

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
they said hey I'm out of here

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.850 
they said hey I'm out of here
I'm<00:00:38.489> done<00:00:38.790> with<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.469> would<00:00:40.469> he<00:00:40.590> force

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
I'm done with this and would he force

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.520 
I'm done with this and would he force
them<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.579> know<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.760> continue<00:00:42.300> or<00:00:42.660> would<00:00:42.870> would

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
them you know to continue or would would

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.690 
them you know to continue or would would
they<00:00:43.649> never<00:00:43.829> have<00:00:44.040> you'd<00:00:44.160> have<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.460> thought

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
they never have you'd have that thought

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.369 
they never have you'd have that thought
because<00:00:45.120> they<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.510> been<00:00:45.660> regenerated<00:00:45.989> you

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
because they have been regenerated you

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.869 
because they have been regenerated you
know<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> bottom<00:00:46.829> line<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.730> are

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
know the bottom line is if you are

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.869 
know the bottom line is if you are
really<00:00:48.180> regenerated<00:00:49.110> which<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.070> think<00:00:50.520> most<00:00:50.700> of

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
really regenerated which I think most of

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.090 
really regenerated which I think most of
the<00:00:50.969> time

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
the time

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.680 
the time
honestly<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.309> big<00:00:53.579> problem<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> church

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
honestly the big problem in the church

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.500 
honestly the big problem in the church
today<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.110> think<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.980> most<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.329> people

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
today I think is that most of the people

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.950 
today I think is that most of the people
that<00:00:57.870> go<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.140> church<00:00:58.370> may<00:00:59.370> not<00:00:59.609> even<00:00:59.820> be<00:01:00.239> born

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
that go to church may not even be born

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.110 
that go to church may not even be born
again<00:01:01.079> they<00:01:01.649> may<00:01:01.800> not<00:01:01.980> even<00:01:02.039> be<00:01:02.280> regenerated

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
again they may not even be regenerated

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.719 
again they may not even be regenerated
that's<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.140> sobering<00:01:04.350> thought<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:05.309> say<00:01:05.489> most

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
that's a sobering thought to say most

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.450 
that's a sobering thought to say most
well<00:01:06.510> at<00:01:06.570> least<00:01:06.659> say<00:01:06.960> many<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.220> think<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
well at least say many and I think the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.740 
well at least say many and I think the
second<00:01:08.790> biggest<00:01:08.909> problem<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.390> church<00:01:09.420> as

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
second biggest problem in the church as

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.600 
second biggest problem in the church as
many<00:01:09.930> who<00:01:10.080> are<00:01:10.320> regenerated<00:01:11.130> aren't<00:01:11.400> really

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
many who are regenerated aren't really

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.700 
many who are regenerated aren't really
not<00:01:11.760> consecrated<00:01:12.630> which<00:01:12.810> which<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:13.619> you

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
not consecrated which which if you

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.080 
not consecrated which which if you
really<00:01:13.979> get<00:01:14.100> down<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.790> make<00:01:14.939> your

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
really get down to it to make your

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.179 
really get down to it to make your
calling<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.689> election<00:01:15.780> sure<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.920> know<00:01:17.040> where
