00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:11.349
 and it turns out that it gets stained at night 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.480
 I do not get used to the change of schedule and 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.610
 this is the only focus I have I hope 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.289
 that looks relatively good already 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.939
 We will see according to what you think 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.679
 could start making videos like that but 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.840
 I will have to resort to natural light what 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.730
 you are going to buy a little but good 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.470
 this happened to what is the theme of the day 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.029
 and is that my video from last Tuesday if 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.830
 you have not seen it I leave the link here 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.509
 so that you see it and enter in context 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.250
 talk about a role that other girls 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.110
 they were exposed using a language 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.460
 pretty vulgar that is not really what 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.290
 I care about in the video and send it to 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.550
 many feminist messages that 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.800
 Although I disagree with 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.240
 many of them one especially that I 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.770
 I worry this is the use of the phrase 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.510
 advantage of teaching girls how 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.130
 get dressed and teach children not to 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.750
 violate first I do not want to make it clear 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.850
 that I am completely against their 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.320
 blogs gaming and what is the slot gaming 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.090
 for shaming a person by 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.560
 how you dress around is entitled to 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.420
 dress as he pleases without being 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.160
 judged by it you want to dress more 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.620
 less provocative with more or less 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.780
 makeup you have the legitimate right to 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.930
 to be able to do it without being exposed 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.400
 to be raped, so to speak and over 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.320
 the society is seen with the right 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.940
 tell you you're dressed in this 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.320
 way therefore therefore you were 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.759
 looking for why not because that's a 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.259
 completely disgusting thought what 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.490
 I can assure you that as much as 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.800
 people insist that we are in a 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.630
 Rape culture is not acceptable 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.310
 people do not accept that kind of 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.479
 behavior or at least people with 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.220
 a little bit of conscience but 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.780
 regardless of this is to assume that 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.430
 all men especially 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.610
 heterosexuals are rapists in 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.020
 power is a thought completely 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.729
 disgusting and you want to admit or not is 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.229
 completely sexist because while 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.149
 that you complain about being told 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.100
 how to dress how to behave and how to be 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.479
 demure and fine women too 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.280
 they are taught that their feelings 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.259
 matter if they are taught that 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.179
 they feel uncomfortable they should say it they are 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.640
 teaches that if someone is invading their 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.350
 space can report it and they have 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.240
 the right of legitimate to do so while 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.369
 that children in society is 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.289
 patriarchal is so horrible the one 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.759
 we live there is a very clear message that 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.229
 is constantly repeating and 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.759
 men that are seeing me tell me if 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.300
 is not true can be summarized in the 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.780
 sentence 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.119
 girls do not hit girls not 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.310
 the girls are mistreated there 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.290
 treat them well and that's something that every 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.110
 so inside of us to the point 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.900
 that some girls with 6 or 7 years 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.090
 knowing this they go to the children they put him 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.770
 a slap punch despite 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.750
 that the body dimensions of this 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.030
 far exceed that of the child 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.800
 she is obviously at a disadvantage she knows 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.260
 that under the standards of this society 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.140
 he can not beat him for who will be the 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.150
 punished because because girls are not 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.250
 it hits them apart after there are phrases 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.500
 like the one you do not complain about, stop crying 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.360
 behave like a man throwing eggs 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.100
 so I wonder if we live in a 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.440
 society that benefits both man 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.020
 in a patriarchy because it turns out that the 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.090
 man has no right to express 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.160
 Your feelings and feelings are not 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.020
 I mean only the feminine part 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.520
 of his being but also his feelings 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.770
 as a male man to his 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.750
 concerns your insecurities like 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.760
 man who sincerely many times in 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.560
 this society are left aside and even 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.170
 we make fun of it and ourselves 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.950
 we assume that we have no problems when 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.569
 reality 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.190
 we have them I'll tell you an example 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.379
 I was 13 years old 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.239
 with a person who in that 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.519
 era was one year older than I have 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.349
 now is to say 27 years 14 years of 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.239
 difference not only this but that 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.160
 this person was in charge of me my 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.440
 parents had sued me Germany a 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.019
 camp and this man was to me 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.300
 charge that he did then to probe the matter of 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.950
 locate my curiosity and I used it 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.390
 to cajole me so that finally 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.430
 will end up having sex 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.310
 with him after which I felt 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.500
 completely dirty annoyed confused and 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.489
 first of all deeply ashamed 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.440
 to the point that after this 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.569
 relationship type is toshiba mom thing 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.910
 to be able to repeat this fact and 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.920
 I ended up telling everything to others 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.989
 people and this man can go through 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.760
 a judicial process which I did not know 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.590
 nothing until years after you shoot me 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.910
 they told him which by the way came out 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.500
 acquitted of what I want to talk about 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.450
 it really is what happened to me 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.190
 personally with my friends and with the 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.170
 fucking people when I talked to a 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.390
 my cousin who really did care 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.519
 because of the problem this one was not very clear 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.959
 the concept of what it is to be discreet and 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.970
 He went and told another cousin of mine 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.110
 within your concern without any 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.690
 kind of bad intention 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.790
 this other then instead of having the same 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.130
 concern that the first one had laughed 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.050
 He found the subject ridiculous and started 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.700
 to make jokes and between the two of some 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.230
 so they began to tell all 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.670
 world until there was not a single soul 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.110
 I did not know when I came back from 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.330
 germany i found the wonderful 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.130
 panorama that everyone knew my 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.110
 secret everyone knew my shame 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.420
 and instead of receiving words of support and 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.330
 of understanding the only thing that was there was a 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.940
 huge and massive mockery but a mockery 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.920
 so big and so embarrassing that I had to 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.440
 reinvent me the story will change 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.210
 completely reassure my cousin and 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.890
 spend five years of my life without power 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.020
 talk about this matter and why then 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.820
 because those things do not happen to a man 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.590
 what kind of uncles are you left because 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.270
 What happened to a man is a problem 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.100
 that man and nobody cares 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.380
 because apart from my parents and this 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.419
 my cousin nobody else cares about the 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.550
 matter and when this because man 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.560
 shame is also passed by 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.270
 these are done differently but also 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.680
 they are made to pass and they do not come to me to say 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.960
 now that only men are 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.400
 who sexually abuse women or 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.500
 other men because they also exist 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.360
 women who do this 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.310
 the problem is that with the standards 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.080
 social in which we move is much 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.610
 harder and much less accepted than a 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.890
 man says a woman has raped him 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.780
 because nobody is going to take it seriously 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.160
 therefore these cases are not reported 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.350
 because it's that you do not even have in 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.120
 consideration and that is something very sad and 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.500
 so I do not see any feminist 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.450
 putting the cry of the hundred so 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.460
 remember whatever it is man woman 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.650
 heterosexual homosexual bisexual 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.820
 transsexual whatever you have a person 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.860
 you have a right in your feelings 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.150
 matter whether it be feelings to know that 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.550
 of your femininity about your 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.590
 masculinity everything has to be treated and 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.210
 nobody can tell you how you should feel 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.160
 about it because how you feel is 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.570
 how you feel and can not control it 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.800
 but well more levels I say this is my 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.419
 opinion sometimes to see what you think 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.160
 in the comments section follow 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.570
 sharing his story would be more than 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.520
 happy to read it but here if 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.900
 we convince a conversation and we start 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.850
 to talk about this topic we know how to create 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.050
 a lot of awareness about it like this 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.000
 that I feel is something important 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.380
 share this video with all your friends 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.880
 in all your social networks that 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.169
 admits on facebook when they are born 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.180
 help a lot you can not imagine 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.870
 when firmly the social networks that 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.870
 will be in the description 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.080
 bye
