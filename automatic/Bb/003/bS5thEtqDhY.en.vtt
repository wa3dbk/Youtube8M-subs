then you're gonna owe likkle your tree
grows<00:02:14.080> immediately<00:02:15.180> looks<00:02:16.180> likely<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:18.160> can

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
grows immediately looks likely you can

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.240 
grows immediately looks likely you can
get<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.670> little<00:02:18.880> lag<00:02:19.210> from<00:02:19.570> this<00:02:19.870> too<00:02:20.500> still

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
get a little lag from this too still

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.420 
get a little lag from this too still
kind<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.520> glitchy<00:02:21.850> I<00:02:22.210> don't<00:02:22.870> know<00:02:22.960> why<00:02:26.430> maybe

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
kind of glitchy I don't know why maybe

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.340 
kind of glitchy I don't know why maybe
it<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.850> on<00:02:28.270> other<00:02:29.110> hands<00:02:30.510> sometimes<00:02:31.510> your<00:02:31.900> next

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
it is on other hands sometimes your next

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.430 
it is on other hands sometimes your next
tree<00:02:32.500> will<00:02:32.680> be<00:02:32.800> kind<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.100> difficult<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.610> grow

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
tree will be kind of difficult to grow

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.260 
tree will be kind of difficult to grow
see<00:02:35.440> there<00:02:36.100> you<00:02:36.130> go<00:02:36.250> then<00:02:36.550> you're<00:02:36.940> gonna<00:02:37.060> have

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
see there you go then you're gonna have

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.140 
see there you go then you're gonna have
plenty<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.990> wood<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:38.920> don't<00:02:39.790> know<00:02:39.880> how<00:02:40.060> I'm
