00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.790
 hello I find you for a 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.770
 new technical analysis that's going to be 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.600
 this time dedicated to water with 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.300
 videos of julie who participated in our 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.250
 stage at vittel level 4 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.990
 so level 4 is the most 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.640
 advanced of our courses it goes us 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.439
 allow to see points 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.540
 fairly detailed techniques in this 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.399
 swim we start with this video 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.600
 outside that will allow us to see 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.200
 all the issues the at 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.600
 alignment 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.000
 so the goal is that the body is good 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.440
 aligned they go through the smaller 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.800
 corridor possible and that stays well in 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.870
 this hallway so that for the swimmer 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.760
 meets the minimum of resistance and 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.239
 can advance with the most facilities 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.399
 possible 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.039
 so this point is rather respected here 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.929
 but at times we still have 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.449
 the legs that come out a little lax the 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.429
 body for example here on this move 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.320
 there we see the legs that leave one 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:05.190
 little bit on the right what are you going to have 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.900
 caused resistance I come back to 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.550
 beginning of the video because already on 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.470
 this external view we will be able to 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.320
 find some ways to improve 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.960
 this question of alignment there by 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.220
 example marc the head which by a small 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.770
 little on the left the look at the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.750
 vertical but slightly conveys 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.610
 left direction there if we go small 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.979
 little in the video see that head here 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.920
 on the next move returns more 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.780
 right so these head movements of 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.180
 right to left are not what you have 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.509
 because to tend to follow the head 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.090
 and therefore to describe laces it is necessary 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.770
 so shoulders turn that's normal 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.619
 in the swim but that the head 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.219
 do not accompany this rotation you 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.259
 have on the site different exercises where 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.680
 we are trying to dissociate 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.689
 the action of the shoulders of the position of 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.270
 the head for example the beats with 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.399
 arms along the body rendered another 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.780
 project notice you see here on 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.810
 this stop on images we are halfway 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.679
 of return is nothing the left arm 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.800
 could be a little more tense 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.630
 but he is well in the limelight so no 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.990
 problem at this level but if we 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.720
 advance of a few images he will come 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.100
 crossed here and so be the second 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.190
 part of the return is nothing he does a 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.819
 movement on the reverse side towards the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.879
 right 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.129
 and the hand actually go in front of the 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.620
 head 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:33.319
 the ideal it would be that it makes more 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.430
 in front of the poles in the shoulder axis 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.790
 because if they go back to the 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.709
 head 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.659
 the problem is that the beginning of the 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.400
 movement under must then he will do 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:45.090
 on the outside that with a push 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.000
 lateral to the left side and that will 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.439
 rethink to send it right so 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.790
 the ideal is to return well in 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.040
 the act to be able to do after 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.719
 the whole movement underwater in 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.180
 the body focused and not having these 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:58.680
 lateral pushes so I think that 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.769
 this entry from the hand into the water 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.239
 crossed is due to the fact that there in the middle 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.609
 rotois nothing she turns 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.530
 completely his hand let's see there we have the 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.060
 little finger that is directed towards us and 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.040
 a lot of swimmers do that because they 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.019
 have in the idea that it would be necessary to return 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.590
 hand in water by the little must 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.799
 absolutely 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.870
 and we see that in fact the rotation of the 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.169
 hand is between them a rotation of 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.180
 the shoulder and this rotation of the shoulder 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.790
 in the process of attak crossed so I you 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.189
 encourages to drop completely 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.930
 the idea of ​​entering the water when the 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.250
 hand in the water by the little finger that 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.189
 causes more problems than 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.900
 thing we'll go to the video under 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:39.629
 water but before I show you the 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.269
 turn because it is well executed so 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.359
 we have the turnaround that takes place on 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:48.030
 a movement 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:50.449
 then a pull arm the rotation and 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.449
 casting 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.280
 here is the video under water so I 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.850
 recalls that in its analyzes 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.640
 techniques 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.460
 we're not going to have all the points of the 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.010
 swim it would be very very long and so we 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.650
 will focus here on two points 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.820
 essential that is the body roll 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.820
 and the support of the arms 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.120
 so the roll first we see 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.160
 that here the swimmer and passes on the 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.739
 side with every movement there when you're 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.960
 here rocker on the left side 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.240
 and this position there that you see at 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.949
 the screen she's absolutely essential there 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.949
 must find it with each movement 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.599
 the essential because it will take 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.220
 tipped to the side before bringing them 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.930
 in couple cif so before calling to 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.030
 the team if you do not do that if 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.820
 you stay flat you necessarily have 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.900
 have a very lateral movement your arms 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.190
 or passed away on the less powerful sides 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.979
 and if you still try to push 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.770
 under water you're going to cause 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.479
 shoulder pain 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.370
 the shoulder joint is well 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.740
 does it turn on the side for 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:03.729
 able to have a powerful movement and 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:06.039
 directed to the feet so here 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.500
 the important thing to see that the hand is 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:10.120
 not stay close to the surface and enter 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.759
 right now under the water enough in 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.729
 depth about 30 centimeters and that 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.990
 sas has caused the rocker on the side 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.789
 so once the hand is returned 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.830
 like that so about 30 cm under 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.840
 the water she will be able to propel herself have 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.780
 advanced a few images to see 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.070
 how is the cotton pad on a few 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.800
 pictures that is a pity that she 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.440
 she comes back to flat barely I passed 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.080
 four images she came back 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.699
 completely flat and in fact there 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.259
 On the contrary, the body should be 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.780
 right now straighten on the side the poles 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:42.940
 remain engaged under water that 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.979
 poles it's going to be the fix point that's going 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.409
 we who will allow to support 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:49.750
 effectively if the poles move 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:53.139
 fits flat we will lose a lot in 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.539
 propulsion so leave the poles 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:59.229
 engaged underwater as much as possible 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:01.360
 in back otherwise the position of the arm 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:02.979
 is pretty good we see that the hand is going 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.219
 and then to the feet in the good 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:08.380
 direction to advance the ideal would be 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:10.659
 that even though the forearm and the 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.919
 hand be directed by the feet so 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:13.870
 the forearm is a little better 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:14.380
 positioned to participate in the 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.090
 propulsion 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.360
 we could also with the forearm we 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.500
 do not just support being the hand 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.710
 the idea would be to have the elbow 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.690
 who by a little less 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.370
 go small right away who stays a 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.130
 a little bit more back to be able to 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.390
 position the hand and forearm 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:32.110
 perpendicular to the body and press 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.110
 all this surface 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:38.050
 I will leave this video parade for 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.460
 finish with the rhythm of the movement 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:44.389
 the king we have a movement that is good 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:47.210
 accelerated taking support so any 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:50.240
 this part then when we are here 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.460
 can be quiet enough to the one between 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.190
 relatively and after by when 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.630
 we support we must support by accelerating 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.220
 and supports as quickly as possible towards the 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.090
 feet that's all for this 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.370
 technical analysis 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.289
 you will find in the game 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.090
 technical precisely different site 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:07.990
 exercises to work his points 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:10.940
 especially the back to a downtime for 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:13.250
 find the reference position we 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.860
 had a while ago Thursday spent on 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.050
 the side and then I give you an appointment 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.220
 you on the forum to let your 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.090
 comments and ask all your 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.090
 questions about this video
