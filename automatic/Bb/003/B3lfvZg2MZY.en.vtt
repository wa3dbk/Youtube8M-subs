00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.820
 with readings olive and good a served 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.590
 very simple today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.030
 can you change the pagination or 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.820
 it is also known as memory 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.950
 virtual virtual memory basically 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.960
 is that when you run out of what 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.060
 what are the resources of his memory 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.250
 physical physical memory by generation 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.640
 or ram memory that has either its 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.559
 laptop or your good desktop computer 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.030
 with that physical memory it is finished or 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.160
 all resources end all 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.710
 space they have in the computer 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.070
 basically begins to occupy space 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.210
 hard drive as if it were ram memory and 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.980
 Well I'm going to do it right now 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.960
 windows 8 but it really is the same 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.579
 for windows 7 windows vista windows xp 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.020
 basically what they have to do that 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.460
 are in strip the windows explorer 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.800
 in the case of windows 7 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.000
 nothing more pressure on windows and they're going to 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.160
 give a right click to where it says 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.870
 computer and they are going to properties in the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.879
 case of windows 8 you will see a 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.289
 explorer and we will give it equal way 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.149
 Right click on my computer or 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:09.630
 computer are not we were properties 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.770
 within start properties this the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.690
 left side let's find what 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.000
 are the advanced options and we're going 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.920
 there they will find several 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.510
 lashes we're going at this time is the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.630
 of options 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.370
 in English with 35 as advanced and gives us 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.230
 a city what would be the performance or 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.770
 the performance and has it in English as 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.500
 if the configuration or series 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.390
 now inside this new window we are going 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.619
 to go to what will be the second person 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.200
 which is equal advanced options 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.890
 way and you will be able to see here below the 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.689
 option that says 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.979
 virtual memory and in fact it gives them a 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:45.140
 description let's see the page is 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.819
 an area on the hard drive that windows uses 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.219
 as if it were ram basically what 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.020
 let's say focused a little while ago 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:53.270
 then we are going to change 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.799
 by default most of your 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.649
 teams is going to bring this like that 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.530
 they automatically want windows 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.520
 executive is choose the right size 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.439
 windows will likewise give them a 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.329
 recommendation of how much we can 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.159
 to put them this really depends on 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.269
 how much do you have free space 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.849
 on your disk because that is going to be 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.380
 driving with how do you now windows 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.160
 tells me here that the recommended thing is this 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.380
 well then I put a limit of 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.420
 that the minimum amount is what 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.930
 windows recommends and the mind two other 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.760
 the two gigas but in this case my 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.980
 computer will be using others 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.690
 basically 5 extra gigs of memory 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.480
 now do not get confused 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.349
 you have to put here for example 250 to 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.300
 20 gb of virtual memory is not going to 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.000
 work in the same way how 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.459
 if it were physical memory that is to say no 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.060
 can you have to add maybe 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.410
 20 gb of virtual memory and wait 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.480
 that works as if it were memory 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.600
 physical this is simply like some 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.040
 kind of help to the operating system in 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.410
 case that physical memory really 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.030
 get to run out of resources without 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.860
 However, this does not replace whatever the 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.790
 good physical memory here simply 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.410
 they are going to put the amount of memory 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.209
 virtual that you believe for your team 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.069
 and in a new way 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.380
 I recommend that they put it more or less 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.150
 the amount that windows recommends does not 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.930
 it has to be exact but if in those 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.500
 memory ranges and they're going to put it in 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.480
 or in establishing and they will put it ok 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.160
 and this basically would be all of that 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.020
 way you are going to be able to notice a 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.970
 fast performance on your computer if it is 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.250
 that are constantly staying with 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.660
 memory problems and in fact if 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.820
 they have operating systems where they do not 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.930
 they have pagination like I invented windows 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.180
 when you are running out 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.850
 physical memory is going to give you an alert or 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.470
 some kind of warning that memory opens 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.550
 everything is also already very low or that 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.870
 time then we are running out of 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.850
 memory and apart they will feel the team 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.500
 too slow then it 's very good 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.330
 that they know how to do this and that they configure it 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.800
 on all computers so that also 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.840
 these kinds of problems can be avoided 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.270
 of slowness maybe or performance in 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.340
 your computer and well, that would be 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.489
 all the kids take care of themselves until the 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.489
 following
