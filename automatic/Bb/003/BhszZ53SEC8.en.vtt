 cassette tape rewinding) 

00:00:05.964 --> 00:00:08.384
 ("Soul Kitchen" by The Doors) 

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:09.673
 -Are you hungry? 

00:00:09.673 --> 00:00:10.844
 -Why do you ask? 

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:13.352
 Well, maybe we can order some sandwiches 

00:00:13.352 --> 00:00:17.131
 or some chicken or something in that style 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:27.366
 You're not hungry? 

00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:27.952
 What about you? 

00:00:27.952 --> 00:00:29.280
 Are you hungry? 

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:31.764
 Oh, it's breakfast time 

00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:33.398
 Did you eat breakfast this morning -Yes 

00:00:33.398 --> 00:00:34.576
 Really? 

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:35.609
 What did you eat? 

00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:38.267
 - Oh, little things 

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:39.950
 like chocolate cake and tea 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.386
 - Is that all you got? 

00:00:41.386 --> 00:00:41.810
 That's all I want 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.975
 - You should eat more, Howard 

00:00:43.975 --> 00:00:45.150
 (laughter) 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.961
 -You have taken a lot of care. 

00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:48.123
 Do you eat a lot? 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:50.685
 -Well, 

00:00:50.685 --> 00:00:53.703
 You know it's something 

00:00:53.703 --> 00:00:55.901
 really bother me. 

00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:58.443
 What's wrong with being thick 

00:00:58.443 --> 00:00:59.547
 That's what I want to know 

00:00:59.547 --> 00:01:00.962
 Why is that so 

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:02.529
 - I didn't say there was anything wrong with that. 

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:05.967
 - Why is it so stiff to be thick? 

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:12.378
 I see nothing wrong with fat 

00:01:12.378 --> 00:01:14.016
 You know. 

00:01:14.016 --> 00:01:19.016
 I remember when I used to weigh 84 kilos 

00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.452
 I'm the same height. 

00:01:21.452 --> 00:01:22.874
 I am the same height as I am now 

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:24.974
 and I weighed 84 kilos. 

00:01:24.974 --> 00:01:26.995
 And I was going to university 

00:01:26.995 --> 00:01:30.699
 and I had this coupon in the cafeteria 

00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:33.694
 and the food is pretty much the same 

00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:35.179
 all based on starch 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.955
 You know it's cheap food, huh? 

00:01:37.955 --> 00:01:39.381
 And then, I don't know what it was 

00:01:39.381 --> 00:01:42.378
 but in order, I don't know, I just felt that I was, 

00:01:42.378 --> 00:01:44.176
 If you missed your meal, you just need to know 

00:01:44.176 --> 00:01:46.580
 I just figured, well, I was on the ski, did I? 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.880
 If I missed a meal, I just didn't care 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.493
 ("Why Do You Love" by The Doors " 

00:01:51.493 --> 00:01:53.327
 So, I would get up 

00:01:53.327 --> 00:01:58.327
 at 6:30 every morning just to make breakfast, huh? 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.833
 (laughter) 

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:05.700
 Eggs and corn porridge and sausages 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.112
 and toast, milk. 

00:02:10.112 --> 00:02:12.916
 And I would come to a few hours 

00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:16.055
 and I want to get there for breakfast 

00:02:17.392 --> 00:02:20.681
 Mashed potatoes 

00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:21.733
 You know, once in a while 

00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:25.391
 They would put a little piece of meat or something you know 

00:02:25.391 --> 00:02:27.456
 And I would go to a few more classes 

00:02:27.456 --> 00:02:28.966
 And then I would go to dinner 

00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:32.760
 And it was more mashed potatoes 

00:02:41.052 --> 00:02:45.058
 And then, about three months later, I weighed 84 kilos 

00:02:45.058 --> 00:02:46.253
 and you know what? 

00:02:46.253 --> 00:02:48.348
 I had it so well 

00:02:48.348 --> 00:02:51.814
 I felt like a tank you know 

00:02:51.814 --> 00:02:53.218
 I felt like one 

00:02:53.218 --> 00:02:56.632
 as a large mammal. 

00:02:56.632 --> 00:02:58.733
 A big beast. 

00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:00.938
 When I moved through the hallways 

00:03:00.938 --> 00:03:02.413
 or over the lawn. 

00:03:02.413 --> 00:03:04.722
 I just feel I could beat everyone 

00:03:04.722 --> 00:03:07.497
 out of the way for me, you know? 

00:03:07.497 --> 00:03:10.087
 I was solid, man. 

00:03:10.087 --> 00:03:12.350
 It is terrible to be thin and spliced 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.216
 Because, you know you could be overthrown 

00:03:16.216 --> 00:03:20.594
 of a strong gust or something, man 

00:03:20.594 --> 00:03:23.575
 Thick is beautiful 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.083
 - How much do you weigh now? 

00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:28.511
 -I don't know, to be honest 

00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:32.214
 I guess something about 68 kg 

00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:35.213
 -Really 

00:03:35.213 --> 00:03:36.076
 -Mhm mh 

00:03:37.292 --> 00:03:39.169
 Would you like to compare biceps? 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:39.660
 (laughter) 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.960
 Would you like to put your arm down, Howard 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.871
 Are you ready? 

00:03:44.871 --> 00:03:47.190
 Are you in the form -Okay, then 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.573
 Well, the interview is over 

00:03:48.573 --> 00:03:51.335
 (laughter) 

00:03:51.335 --> 00:03:55.629
