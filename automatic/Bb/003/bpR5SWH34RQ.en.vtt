make it part of our numeracy lessons to

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.009 
make it part of our numeracy lessons to
play<00:00:23.650> play<00:00:23.890> in<00:00:24.189> bottom<00:00:24.609> we<00:00:25.150> can't<00:00:25.390> just<00:00:25.749> say

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:26.019 
play play in bottom we can't just say

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.439 
play play in bottom we can't just say
it's<00:00:26.230> time<00:00:26.439> tables<00:00:27.039> but<00:00:27.220> if<00:00:27.310> I<00:00:27.460> this<00:00:27.699> strategy

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
it's time tables but if I this strategy

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.620 
it's time tables but if I this strategy
and<00:00:28.569> tactic<00:00:29.019> I<00:00:29.429> think<00:00:30.429> the<00:00:30.579> best<00:00:30.789> thing<00:00:30.939> is<00:00:31.419> the

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
and tactic I think the best thing is the

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.390 
and tactic I think the best thing is the
fact<00:00:31.659> that<00:00:31.960> anything<00:00:32.590> can<00:00:32.770> happen<00:00:33.010> in<00:00:33.310> the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
fact that anything can happen in the

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.540 
fact that anything can happen in the
game<00:00:33.580> white<00:00:33.760> one<00:00:33.940> so<00:00:34.480> you<00:00:34.600> can<00:00:34.780> be<00:00:35.020> a<00:00:35.830> really

correct then the black day she move

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.910 
correct then the black day she move
forward<00:01:01.480> by<00:01:01.630> the<00:01:01.660> number<00:01:02.170> that<00:01:02.320> summer<00:01:02.530> to

forward by the number that summer to
what<00:01:03.280> they<00:01:03.460> should<00:01:03.790> able<00:01:03.970> to<00:01:04.300> do<00:01:04.510> and<00:01:04.720> if<00:01:04.839> you

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
what they should able to do and if you

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.630 
what they should able to do and if you
throw<00:01:05.199> more<00:01:05.470> than<00:01:05.680> your<00:01:05.830> standard<00:01:06.130> then<00:01:06.550> you

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
throw more than your standard then you

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.200 
throw more than your standard then you
get<00:01:06.820> better<00:01:07.060> for<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:08.650> can<00:01:08.890> learn<00:01:09.190> from<00:01:09.250> it<00:01:09.760> get

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
get better for you can learn from it get

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.020 
get better for you can learn from it get
better<00:01:10.390> in<00:01:10.690> school<00:01:10.930> and<00:01:11.409> hopefully<00:01:12.130> get<00:01:12.970> a

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
have to go down a level or you have to
