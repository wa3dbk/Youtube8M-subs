lasted me about three months three or
four<00:00:52.649> months<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.420> I<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:55.050> really<00:00:55.440> do<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:55.829> these

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
four months and I I really do like these

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.299 
four months and I I really do like these
a<00:00:56.129> lot<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:56.879> I'm<00:00:57.270> not<00:00:57.719> going<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.289> go<00:00:58.739> buy<00:00:59.039> them

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
again because they are i think it's

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.830

twenty-three or twenty-four dollars each

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.969 
twenty-three or twenty-four dollars each
so<00:01:04.290> i<00:01:05.220> would<00:01:05.430> not<00:01:05.549> pay<00:01:05.790> $23<00:01:06.780> for<00:01:07.260> my<00:01:07.560> shampoo
