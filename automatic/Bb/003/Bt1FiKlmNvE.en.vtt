00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.540
 literally today we just 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.250
 remembered this how we got here 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.740
 and feeling like it was yesterday 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.440
 the right choice is that 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.010
 who do you want to be that you have a subgroup 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.830

 for your life it's your own 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.280
 choice i would say that 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.480
 he taught me to be more collected and 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.970
 go forward 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.890
 solve some puzzles picks 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.470
 even to nokia Russia would be 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.000
 overwhelming challenges your world suffer and 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.170
 fundamental education and 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.040
 opportunities to realize 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.700
 in all different all graduates have 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.880
 very good work either in science or in 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.540
 education or in companies caliber on 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.540
 production 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.790
 you can get a scientific name here 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.030
 scientific status 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.360
 that is, get dating and ride 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.790
 there 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.710
 these are grants simply because 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.500
 rotate in these circles some 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.450
 students we back smoothly tea muse 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.690
 inventions and the vast majority 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.060
 already has scientific publications of ours 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.030
 student custom how to work on the instrument 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.640
 how to understand rather how to do this 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.920
 experiment and how can I not answer 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.310
 at least the easiest garden question on 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.310
 translations 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.280
 the students 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.550
 gets the opportunity to communicate with those 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.270
 people who have not read this knowledge 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.180
 from textbooks and then retells these 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.160
 people write textbooks themselves get 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:17.280
 this new knowledge and this is probably 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:19.319
 very time neighbor 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.880
 labor and atmosphere and when are you coming 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.270
 here and walk on what town 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.180
 you feel differently and even change 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.140
 guys find yourself and implement here 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.140
 it will be a lotion 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.420
 I want to wish you always need at least 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.470
 which perhaps a little luck to 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.299
 still choose what you 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.400
 really like it very much 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.650
 wanted to do my whole life and though 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.810
 grace four years of study which 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.810
 you act listen to the heart 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.920
