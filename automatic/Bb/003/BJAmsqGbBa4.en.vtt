wanted to go south I don't think you get
any<00:01:46.649> more<00:01:46.680> south<00:01:47.009> than<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:48.020> it'll<00:01:49.020> be<00:01:49.140> a

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
any more south than this so it'll be a

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.600 
any more south than this so it'll be a
great<00:01:49.829> experience<00:01:49.890> for<00:01:50.430> our

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
there i think i agree with you there's a

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.659 
there i think i agree with you there's a
balance<00:04:25.380> there<00:04:25.560> between<00:04:25.800> overworked<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:26.520> I'm

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
balance there between overworked and I'm

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
business as usual and then i think the

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.450 
business as usual and then i think the
biggest<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.530> biggest<00:05:13.530> challenge<00:05:14.190> is<00:05:14.310> when

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
biggest the biggest challenge is when

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.980 
biggest the biggest challenge is when
you<00:05:14.550> have<00:05:14.700> them<00:05:14.850> here<00:05:15.890> for<00:05:16.890> an<00:05:16.980> extended<00:05:17.370> time

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
you have them here for an extended time

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.170 
you have them here for an extended time
you<00:05:18.990> got<00:05:19.110> to<00:05:19.200> try<00:05:19.380> to<00:05:19.440> make<00:05:20.340> practices<00:05:21.060> so

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
you got to try to make practices so

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.430 
you got to try to make practices so
they're<00:05:21.330> not<00:05:21.419> mundane<00:05:21.870> and<00:05:22.110> so<00:05:22.229> they're<00:05:22.350> not

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
they're not mundane and so they're not

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.810 
they're not mundane and so they're not
going<00:05:22.500> through<00:05:22.770> the<00:05:22.830> motions<00:05:23.190> but<00:05:23.340> i<00:05:23.430> think<00:05:23.700> as

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
going through the motions but i think as

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.180 
going through the motions but i think as
soon<00:05:23.850> as<00:05:24.240> you<00:05:24.870> step<00:05:25.169> on<00:05:25.320> the<00:05:25.350> plane<00:05:25.680> and<00:05:25.860> you<00:05:25.950> go

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
soon as you step on the plane and you go

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.490 
soon as you step on the plane and you go
and<00:05:26.490> you<00:05:26.580> get<00:05:27.210> to<00:05:27.360> the<00:05:27.450> site<00:05:27.960> and<00:05:28.229> then<00:05:28.350> I'll

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
and you get to the site and then I'll

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.780 
and you get to the site and then I'll
sudden<00:05:28.770> you<00:05:28.830> see<00:05:29.010> your<00:05:29.190> opposing<00:05:29.400> team

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
sudden you see your opposing team

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.090 
sudden you see your opposing team
standing<00:05:30.300> over<00:05:30.479> there<00:05:30.630> the<00:05:31.530> adrenaline<00:05:31.800> gets

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
standing over there the adrenaline gets

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.770 
standing over there the adrenaline gets
going<00:05:32.460> a<00:05:32.520> sense<00:05:32.729> of<00:05:32.790> urgency<00:05:32.940> gets<00:05:33.330> going<00:05:33.540> and

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
going a sense of urgency gets going and

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.420 
going a sense of urgency gets going and
I<00:05:33.960> would<00:05:34.290> anticipate<00:05:34.500> we'd<00:05:34.919> have<00:05:35.070> a<00:05:35.100> couple
