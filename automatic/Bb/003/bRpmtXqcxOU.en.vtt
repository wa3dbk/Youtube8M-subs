00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.740 
here at Milton Keynes at Yonge
conversions<00:00:38.250> because<00:00:38.670> they<00:00:38.940> built<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.450> and

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
conversions because they built this and

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.229 
conversions because they built this and
there<00:00:40.320> were<00:00:40.410> elements<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> layout<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:42.120> I

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
there were elements in the layout that I

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.959 
there were elements in the layout that I
truly<00:00:42.719> like<00:00:43.670> starting<00:00:44.670> right<00:00:45.329> at<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> back

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969

layout<00:00:47.969> differences<00:00:48.750> depend<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
layout differences depend on the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.920 
layout differences depend on the
individual<00:00:50.250> because<00:00:50.670> motorhome<00:00:51.390> people<00:00:51.840> are

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
individual because motorhome people are

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.260 
individual because motorhome people are
all<00:00:52.050> different<00:00:52.559> different<00:00:53.100> ages<00:00:53.670> different
