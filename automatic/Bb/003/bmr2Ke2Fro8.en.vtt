heat you melt the butter and you see the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.580 
heat you melt the butter and you see the
little<00:01:02.699> bubbly<00:01:03.420> parts<00:01:04.199> there<00:01:04.590> that's<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:06.590> the

burning<00:01:12.060> by<00:01:12.720> browning<00:01:14.060> hopefully<00:01:15.060> not

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240

burning<00:01:16.400> you<00:01:17.400> see<00:01:17.850> if<00:01:17.940> my<00:01:18.150> camera<00:01:18.660> can<00:01:18.930> guess

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
burning you see if my camera can guess

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.610 
burning you see if my camera can guess
that

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
that

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.820 
that
I<00:01:21.700> think<00:01:23.260> think<00:01:24.260> you<00:01:24.410> can<00:01:24.620> still<00:01:24.980> see<00:01:25.340> it<00:01:26.830> the

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
I think think you can still see it the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.810 
I think think you can still see it the
thing<00:01:28.040> about<00:01:29.500> melted<00:01:30.500> butter<00:01:30.800> is<00:01:31.220> that<00:01:31.580> as

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
thing about melted butter is that as

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.200 
thing about melted butter is that as
soon<00:01:32.060> as<00:01:32.270> it<00:01:32.450> does<00:01:32.480> get<00:01:33.140> brown<00:01:33.820> you<00:01:34.820> have<00:01:35.030> to

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
soon as it does get brown you have to

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.970 
soon as it does get brown you have to
take<00:01:35.450> it<00:01:35.600> off<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:35.990> heat<00:01:36.100> so<00:01:37.100> I<00:01:37.130> have<00:01:37.760> a<00:01:38.980> ball

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
take it off the heat so I have a ball

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
take it off the heat so I have a ball
here<00:01:43.300> that<00:01:44.300> I'm<00:01:44.450> going<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.840> pour<00:01:45.140> it<00:01:45.290> in<00:01:45.500> I

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.700
