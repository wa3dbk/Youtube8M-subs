birdsong is that you can infer all

in their day-to-day life if they choose
to<00:00:38.129> mimic<00:00:38.399> them<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.640> then<00:00:38.730> incorporate<00:00:39.210> them

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
to mimic them and then incorporate them

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.600 
to mimic them and then incorporate them
into<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.660> vocabulary<00:00:40.260> what<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.250> here<00:00:41.489> is

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
into that vocabulary what I have here is

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.160 
into that vocabulary what I have here is
an<00:00:41.730> array<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:41.940> sixteen<00:00:42.450> different<00:00:42.600> local<00:00:42.899> bird

calls from the Tri State New York area

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.340 
calls from the Tri State New York area
and<00:00:45.149> I'm<00:00:45.420> gonna<00:00:45.539> see<00:00:45.750> how<00:00:45.780> they<00:00:45.989> combine<00:00:46.170> with

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
and I'm gonna see how they combine with

00:00:46.350 --> 00:02:36.790 
and I'm gonna see how they combine with
beatbox<00:00:46.920> into<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> single<00:00:47.879> musical<00:00:48.180> idea

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.470 

wasn't<00:02:37.800> that<00:02:37.860> fun<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.060> want<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.269> tell<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.420> a

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
wasn't that fun so I want to tell you a

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.270 
wasn't that fun so I want to tell you a
little<00:02:39.570> bit<00:02:39.720> about<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.530> bird<00:02:40.920> calls<00:02:41.130> that

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
little bit about the bird calls that

little bit about the bird calls that
you're<00:02:41.370> hearing<00:02:41.610> in<00:02:41.850> this<00:02:41.970> musical

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
you're hearing in this musical

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.440 
you're hearing in this musical
experiment<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.739> first<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.670> kick<00:02:45.000> drum<00:02:45.239> as

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
experiment the first is the kick drum as

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.360 
experiment the first is the kick drum as
the<00:02:45.750> wing<00:02:46.260> beats<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.860> ruffed<00:02:47.070> grouse

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
the wing beats of the ruffed grouse

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.949 
the wing beats of the ruffed grouse
which<00:02:47.430> looks<00:02:47.910> like<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.090> combination<00:02:48.299> of<00:02:48.780> a

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
which looks like a combination of a

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.440 
which looks like a combination of a
chicken<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:50.310> pheasant<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:51.060> lives<00:02:51.269> in<00:02:51.420> the

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
chicken and a pheasant it lives in the

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.180 
chicken and a pheasant it lives in the
undergrowth<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.140> lot<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.320> deciduous<00:02:52.950> for

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
undergrowth and a lot of deciduous for

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.509 
undergrowth and a lot of deciduous for
in<00:02:53.340> pine<00:02:54.090> forests<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:55.340> communicates<00:02:56.340> with

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
in pine forests and communicates with

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.479 
in pine forests and communicates with
mates<00:02:57.150> potential<00:02:57.930> mates<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.489> potential

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
mates potential mates and potential

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.770 
mates potential mates and potential
rivals<00:02:59.820> by<00:03:00.000> beating<00:03:00.299> its<00:03:00.420> wings<00:03:00.480> together

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
rivals by beating its wings together

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.610 
rivals by beating its wings together
like<00:03:01.049> this<00:03:05.900> and<00:03:06.900> that's<00:03:07.049> really<00:03:07.200> cool<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:07.530> I've

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
like this and that's really cool so I've

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.410 
like this and that's really cool so I've
sample<00:03:07.920> I've<00:03:08.040> sampled<00:03:08.220> one<00:03:08.610> of<00:03:08.970> those<00:03:09.239> wing

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
sample I've sampled one of those wing

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.509 
sample I've sampled one of those wing
beats<00:03:09.630> as<00:03:09.750> our<00:03:09.870> kick<00:03:10.019> drum<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.829> next<00:03:11.130> is<00:03:11.310> our

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
beats as our kick drum the next is our

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.930 
beats as our kick drum the next is our
little<00:03:12.209> symbol<00:03:12.600> that's<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.620> wood<00:03:13.860> thrush<00:03:14.130> and

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
little symbol that's the wood thrush and

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.430 
little symbol that's the wood thrush and
then<00:03:15.150> of<00:03:15.239> course<00:03:15.450> we<00:03:15.600> have<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.989> American

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
then of course we have the American

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.170 
then of course we have the American
bittern<00:03:16.650> which<00:03:16.829> is<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:16.980> species<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.370> heron<00:03:17.760> that

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
bittern which is a species of heron that

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.509 
bittern which is a species of heron that
communicates<00:03:18.660> by<00:03:18.950> gulping<00:03:19.950> in<00:03:20.100> air<00:03:20.250> and

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
communicates by gulping in air and

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.520 
communicates by gulping in air and
inflating<00:03:20.940> an<00:03:21.030> air<00:03:21.269> sac<00:03:21.690> on<00:03:21.900> its<00:03:22.019> chest<00:03:22.079> which

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
inflating an air sac on its chest which

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.920 
inflating an air sac on its chest which
it<00:03:22.650> then<00:03:22.680> uses<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.610> expel<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.299> sound<00:03:24.660> very

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
it then uses to expel a sound very

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:34.039 
it then uses to expel a sound very
quickly<00:03:25.170> like<00:03:25.350> this<00:03:30.620> we're<00:03:31.620> sampled<00:03:33.049> the

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
quickly like this we're sampled the

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.789 
quickly like this we're sampled the
little<00:03:34.470> bass<00:03:34.650> line<00:03:34.890> you<00:03:35.040> heard<00:03:35.239> that's<00:03:36.239> a<00:03:36.420> duck

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799

it's<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:37.890> gadwall<00:03:38.340> I'd<00:03:38.670> never<00:03:38.910> heard<00:03:39.090> of<00:03:39.150> duck

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
it's a gadwall I'd never heard of duck

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.449 
it's a gadwall I'd never heard of duck
that<00:03:39.510> sounded<00:03:39.720> like<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:39.959> before<00:03:40.280> we<00:03:41.280> have

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
that sounded like that before we have
