00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.569
 MSU 

00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:03.909
 laboratory niro computer 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:06.120
 interfaces it is here that professor 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.450
 Alexander Kaplan and his colleagues are studying 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.200
 capabilities of the human brain and 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.209
 recalculation the answer to the question to what 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:14.990
 able power of thought interface brain 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.820
 computer 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.310
 unique device 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.420
 which allows you to manage 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.400
 computer without the help of muscles any 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.529
 a person can form teams 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.109
 using only own 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.590
 brain electrical activity 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.820
 imagine our bodies controlled 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.960
 electrical nerve impulses and 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.660
 a reaction is generated in the brain 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.470
 and if so with the help of electrodes they can 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.750
 count spiros encrypt I became 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.830
 I wonder if you are so well decoded 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.290
 interest rates can someone else 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.190
 moment according to the representation 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.860
 why would these figures be epic 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.850
 activity not to use 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.970
 as signals or as a percentage as well 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.770
 say what letters to communicate with 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.790
 the outside world word for word at the end 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.880
 After all, we built such a sum of system 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.130
 communication without words 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.010
 but it turns out as if by the power of thought 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.290
 really change forces 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.260
 brain electrical activity 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.450
 this technology is called interface 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.740
 brain computer today is the most 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.040
 famous lab design 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.780
 alexander caplan 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.640
 gaming and gym interface to assemble 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.040
 puzzle reprinted by the power of thought already 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.400
 quite commonplace idea enough 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.040
 just put on a cap with 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.600
 electrodes they are connected 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.650
 pet that captures 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.850
 signals from the brain 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.890
 side by side cheek by cheek alas 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.240
 the bomb 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.140
 so buying side by side we have school side 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.840
 cheers why next you will make 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.960
 letter 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.090
 concentrate all your attention on her 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.780
 the program starts to highlight the lines 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.630
 vertical and horizontal when 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.190
 the line goes through the letter you want 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.380
 just talk to yourself 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.480
 and so score up to ten in this way 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.450
 you send to computer 10 times 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.119
 electric wave he recognizes your cat 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.280
 and moves the desired building letter today 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.400
 scientists of many countries have already created 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.819
 device that allow the power of thought 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.640
 manage for example a prosthetic or disabled 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.989
 laboratory chair alexander caplan 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.000
 now create the so-called 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.130
 manipulator but flight manual 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.959
 allows a person to do something other than 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.039
 hands 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:32.659
 not this way but I will say this 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.629
 at the table doing something prints 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.639
 but itâ€™s necessary to submit 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:37.519
 phone 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:38.999
 so I can activate 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:41.059
 worthy curator who suggested so 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:43.120
 here is this phone europe gas 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.860
 Alexander Kaplan allocates another 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.200
 important direction 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.590
 Ukrainian gas for example taught century 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.790
 suffered some sort of brain area without 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.370
 training it will die off but if 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.360
 constantly play special games with 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.450
 using the brain computer interface 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.989
 tons will act and 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:00.970
 develop 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.860
 scientists sure the human brain possesses 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.530
 much more manipulative 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.660
 abilities than we think and therefore 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.350
 creating new devices 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.550
 driven by the power of thought just around the corner
