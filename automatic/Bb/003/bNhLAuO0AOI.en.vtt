one<00:03:00.360> ramp<00:03:00.600> in<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.870> beginning<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.350> tried

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
one ramp in the beginning that I tried

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.680 
one ramp in the beginning that I tried
double<00:03:01.950> but<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.130> kind<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.459> super<00:03:03.209> overpower<00:03:03.570> and

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
I did it in the wrong rotation so that

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.960 
I did it in the wrong rotation so that
didn't<00:03:07.230> come<00:03:07.350> out<00:03:07.500> good<00:03:07.560> but<00:03:08.250> Stoke<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.850> at

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
didn't come out good but Stoke that at

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.630 
didn't come out good but Stoke that at
least<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.330> bit<00:03:09.510> him<00:03:09.630> on<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.780> wave<00:03:09.990> ride<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:11.370> yeah

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
least a bit him on the wave ride so yeah

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.940 
least a bit him on the wave ride so yeah
that's<00:03:11.820> it<00:03:12.060> now<00:03:12.240> next<00:03:12.660> step<00:03:12.900> looking<00:03:13.740> forward

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
to Denmark hopefully we get some better

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.430 
to Denmark hopefully we get some better
waves<00:03:16.860> they're<00:03:17.480> here<00:03:18.480> in<00:03:18.570> tenerife<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:19.050> wasn't

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
waves they're here in tenerife I wasn't

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.560 
waves they're here in tenerife I wasn't
so<00:03:19.560> good<00:03:19.709> for<00:03:19.890> me<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.910> pain<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.360> broken

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
so good for me the pain of the broken

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.290 
so good for me the pain of the broken
toe<00:03:21.870> kind<00:03:22.230> of<00:03:22.350> held<00:03:23.160> me<00:03:23.220> back<00:03:23.400> not<00:03:23.940> really<00:03:24.180> so

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
toe kind of held me back not really so

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.670 
toe kind of held me back not really so
much<00:03:24.330> in<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.630> heats<00:03:24.780> but<00:03:25.050> I<00:03:25.080> couldn't<00:03:25.440> train

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
much in the heats but I couldn't train

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.949 
much in the heats but I couldn't train
before<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.340> it's<00:03:27.030> difficult<00:03:27.240> to<00:03:27.570> wave<00:03:27.720> right

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
before and it's difficult to wave right

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.240 
before and it's difficult to wave right
here<00:03:28.170> difficult<00:03:28.560> not<00:03:28.650> difficult<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:29.070> wave

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
here difficult not difficult to wave

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.259 
here difficult not difficult to wave
right<00:03:29.400> but<00:03:29.520> it's<00:03:29.640> hard<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.910> pick<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.150> right

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
right but it's hard to pick the right

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.479 
right but it's hard to pick the right
waves<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:31.440> I<00:03:31.470> didn't<00:03:31.769> really<00:03:31.860> get<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.100> chance<00:03:32.160> to

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
waves so I didn't really get a chance to

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.400 
waves so I didn't really get a chance to
get<00:03:33.000> used<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.330> waves<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:33.750> let's<00:03:33.959> show<00:03:34.200> my

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
get used to the waves and let's show my

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.920 
get used to the waves and let's show my
jumps<00:03:34.709> were<00:03:34.830> okay<00:03:35.450> but<00:03:36.450> my<00:03:36.570> wave<00:03:36.720> riding

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
jumps were okay but my wave riding

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.270 
jumps were okay but my wave riding
wasn't<00:03:37.230> very<00:03:37.350> good<00:03:37.410> so<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.830> didn't<00:03:38.190> do<00:03:38.250> very

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
wasn't very good so I didn't do very

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.340 
wasn't very good so I didn't do very
well<00:03:38.489> but<00:03:38.850> I<00:03:39.030> did<00:03:39.330> my<00:03:39.420> best<00:03:39.450> with<00:03:39.690> a<00:03:39.840> broken<00:03:40.170> toe

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
well but I did my best with a broken toe

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.199 
well but I did my best with a broken toe
and<00:03:40.380> I'm<00:03:41.160> hoping<00:03:41.430> we're<00:03:41.580> gonna<00:03:41.640> get<00:03:41.820> good<00:03:42.030> wind

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
and I'm hoping we're gonna get good wind

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.350 
and I'm hoping we're gonna get good wind
and<00:03:42.360> clip<00:03:42.540> Miller<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:43.170> zeal<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.670> come<00:03:44.970> back<00:03:45.150> up

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
and clip Miller and zeal to come back up

00:03:45.360 --> 00:04:43.190 
and clip Miller and zeal to come back up
and<00:03:45.570> back<00:03:46.500> up<00:03:46.650> my<00:03:46.830> fourth<00:03:47.040> base<00:03:47.280> in<00:03:47.430> poser

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.740 

then<00:04:43.770> we<00:04:43.860> came<00:04:44.010> to<00:04:44.190> tenerife<00:04:44.640> and<00:04:45.210> was<00:04:45.720> a

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
then we came to tenerife and was a

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.540 
then we came to tenerife and was a
little<00:04:46.050> bit<00:04:46.170> better<00:04:46.320> result<00:04:46.800> I<00:04:46.980> was<00:04:47.280> third<00:04:47.520> on

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
little bit better result I was third on

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.600 
little bit better result I was third on
the<00:04:47.790> single-elimination<00:04:48.230> I<00:04:49.250> lost<00:04:50.250> him<00:04:50.460> my
