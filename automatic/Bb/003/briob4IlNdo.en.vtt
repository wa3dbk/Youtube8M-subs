 today is we will comment and talk 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.410
 about how new flamingos were 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.930
 thrown problem glasses 2 a week 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.090
 past but before that I will comment 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.769
 quickie about the games play is me 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.470
 was playing and with the psyche pi 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.240
 I was in a new camouflage, and I 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.180
 call me kawai kauai 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.190
 I do not know what you want to call there, right. 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.280
 research he was with the mombo pipe 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.780
 laser sight and cut ammunition that the poet 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.120
 ammunition for those who do not know that 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.969
 broad smile people to be able to recharge 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.579
 faster and it was a nice thing I 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.980
 was playing against gringos and bringing 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.430
 the gringos they suffered because I already 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.699
 was green and he was in 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.039
 A lot of disadvantage is that the connection is a 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.190
 cool little hope you guys 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.530
 Enjoy it and let's talk about the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.080
 camouflage for those who do not know were 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.950
 released in 94 and arrows in the week 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.150
 and just like fla jems is not 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.150
 had nothing much and then I found some 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.920
 as in scenario of the tre part that 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.390
 say so 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:28.110
 every camouflage costs 160 microsoft 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.670
 points which gives around 4 or 5 reais 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.009
 more or less, right 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.259
 But you need to get squashed that you 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.850
 is finding it expensive 45 reais a 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.450
 camouflage 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.520
 think with me no matter how cheap they are 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.399
 It's still expensive but I'll explain to 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.649
 You guys because yesterday you paid your 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.070
 I play with more or less if you bought 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.930
 here in Brazil i believe that he 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.049
 Then you bought near the launch the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.719
 project you paid around $ 200 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:03.180
 sure if you gave a lot of luck but 7 80 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:06.540
 real more or less then it 's the game already 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.979
 It's expensive Jorge is already expensive, who bought it. 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.550
 whether they think they have the right to everything 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.940
 have to leave if not the cosmo black ops 2 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.030
 bought 31 feet there for four thousand 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.940
 microsoft puts what gives around 100 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.580
 real more 1 or if your game is already there 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.930
 for 280 reais look what beauty 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.799
 cheap 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:35.870
 Okay then suddenly they throw those 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.470
 860 microsoft random camouflage 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.110
 points 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.870
 then wraps around in all the beds 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.989
 do launches gives around 30 reais 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.670
 more or less always remembering that 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.340
 That's the way I always talk to you. 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.390
 that hold together where you buy the 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.440
 points 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.310
 but last around 30 real ie the 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.069
 your game 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.480
 if you want to buy everything that came out 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.769
 Now your game is already in 310 real 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.739
 more or less, right 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.230
 at least because there were people I 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.450
 I know you paid 200 reais at the launch of 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.730
 game then the game was already done 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.709
 worth and 330 reais 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:21.260
 and poxa charge we played lagen seriously same 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.599
 because I have social attracts 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.569
 growing a little more and in the area by 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:29.030
 cause of beds fla jens what they 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.130
 make changes for you in the area 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.590
 only many will it look cute or if 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.010
 She'll be ugly, that's all. 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.739
 we are full flogging of aesthetics - 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.380
 Children, do not you put on a camouflage 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.660
 diamond your work will become more 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.519
 powerful it will not have a record or 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.609
 minor or will not have a power giving 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.859
 bigger in nothing but look I'm not 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:54.709
 saying that camouflage should add 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:58.549
 some damage power or something from the 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.900
 type gun saying that camouflage is a 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.540
 useless thing 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.329
 so it's just really the question 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.030
 of Aymara aesthetics will only be 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.400
 cute or thinner or the way 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.709
 What do you want? 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.389
 I see no other purpose for 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.930
 camouflage is what I'm trying 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:20.450
 say did not understand wrong and I bought 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.220
 just this one because I wanted to buy one 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.640
 camouflage 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.850
 You guys are not going to make this video but I'm not 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.160
 I'm going to buy the others anyway. 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.860
 I think it's a waste of money 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.680
 buy the other camouflages but still 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.990
 talking about the camouflages I found the 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.670
 camouflages rather feminine 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.020
 so I do not know if you agree 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:47.960
 With me, but there's a lot of pink, very purple. 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:51.110
 very bright comes out very colorful like that 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:55.700
 It's then I found it very feminine off the 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.740
 camouflage is for example that 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.650
 You're seeing that I'm using it. 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:05.000
 there are some little pets it's all cute little one 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:08.600
 well girl even then you and me that I am 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.060
 I like it, I thought it was cute but not 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.180
 so much to be able to buy all the 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.010
 camouflages good anyway that's what 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.140
 I wanted to talk to you today about the 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.450
 fla jens fields leave my opinion of 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.490
 that no I will not buy all 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.800
 lages beds I bought only that goes 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.930
 to be able to make same room video and 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.669
 Of course I told you now, I'll use it. 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.730
 huh 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:34.430
 this is not advise you to buy 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:37.070
 because it does not make any difference at this time 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.700
 You'll get better because of this and it's 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.919
 that 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.050
 leave in the comments what you 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.660
 found the fields do you go buy 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.729
 or not because I do not know if it's just me 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.010
 which I found very missionary of the match 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:49.640
 I entered here so it is not reflected in the 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.440
 comments 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.160
