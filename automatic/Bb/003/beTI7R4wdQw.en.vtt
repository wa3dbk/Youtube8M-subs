00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.510 

and<00:02:49.240> then<00:02:49.360> I<00:02:49.390> believe<00:02:49.780> he<00:02:49.930> actually<00:02:50.280> at<00:02:51.280> that

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
and then I believe he actually at that

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.790 
and then I believe he actually at that
point<00:02:51.580> with<00:02:51.970> hit<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.270> a<00:02:52.750> node<00:02:53.110> on<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.319> seventh

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
point with hit the a node on the seventh

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:03.030 
point with hit the a node on the seventh
fret<00:02:53.920> of<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.130> D<00:02:54.640> string<00:03:01.800> then<00:03:02.800> you<00:03:02.830> actually

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
fret of the D string then you actually

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.990 
fret of the D string then you actually
do<00:03:03.370> that

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
do that

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.229 
do that
that<00:03:04.300> last<00:03:04.780> part<00:03:05.080> twice<00:03:11.700> okay<00:03:12.700> so<00:03:12.760> then<00:03:13.090> the

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
that last part twice okay so then the

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.850 
that last part twice okay so then the
last<00:03:13.390> part<00:03:13.720> of<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:13.959> I<00:03:14.019> kind<00:03:14.170> of<00:03:14.260> finish<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:14.709> off

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
last part of it I kind of finish it off

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.710 
last part of it I kind of finish it off
with<00:03:15.160> a<00:03:15.280> again<00:03:15.640> it's<00:03:16.030> basically<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.480> same

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
with a again it's basically the same

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.130 
with a again it's basically the same
double<00:03:17.140> stop<00:03:17.349> shapes<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:19.450> do<00:03:19.600> this<00:03:19.780> seventh

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
double stop shapes you do this seventh

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.490 
double stop shapes you do this seventh
and<00:03:20.290> ninth<00:03:20.470> one<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.970> you<00:03:22.150> hit<00:03:22.330> a<00:03:22.360> ghost<00:03:22.720> no<00:03:23.019> you

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
and ninth one and you hit a ghost no you

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.410 
and ninth one and you hit a ghost no you
can<00:03:23.620> either<00:03:23.769> hit<00:03:24.010> that<00:03:24.220> ghost<00:03:24.489> note<00:03:24.819> either<00:03:25.180> on

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
can either hit that ghost note either on

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.910 
can either hit that ghost note either on
the<00:03:25.600> D<00:03:26.290> or<00:03:26.560> cheese<00:03:26.980> string<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:29.500> then<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.769> go

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
the D or cheese string and then you go

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.940 
the D or cheese string and then you go
down<00:03:30.100> to<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.700> seventh<00:03:31.060> fret<00:03:31.530> bar<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.769> nose

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
down to the seventh fret bar and nose

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.610 
down to the seventh fret bar and nose
and<00:03:32.980> hit<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.489> double<00:03:33.819> stop<00:03:34.030> again<00:03:34.620> hit

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
and hit that double stop again hit

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:51.240 
and hit that double stop again hit
another<00:03:35.890> ghost<00:03:36.220> now<00:03:42.660> so<00:03:43.660> again<00:03:43.780> this<00:03:50.040> so<00:03:51.040> then

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
another ghost now so again this so then

00:03:51.250 --> 00:04:01.280 
another ghost now so again this so then
when<00:03:51.549> you<00:03:51.640> put<00:03:51.790> those<00:03:51.910> all<00:03:52.209> together<00:03:52.359> you<00:03:53.049> got

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.440 

not<00:04:02.290> too<00:04:02.470> bad<00:04:02.680> but<00:04:02.890> just<00:04:02.950> got<00:04:03.220> some<00:04:03.579> good<00:04:03.730> some

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
not too bad but just got some good some

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.440 
not too bad but just got some good some
good<00:04:04.480> exercises<00:04:05.320> in<00:04:05.500> here<00:04:05.950> some<00:04:06.549> good

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
good exercises in here some good

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.440 
good exercises in here some good
techniques<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:08.530> de<00:04:08.769> band<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.730> bending<00:04:10.209> the

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
techniques the de band the bending the

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.130 
techniques the de band the bending the
double<00:04:10.780> stops<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:12.609> ghost<00:04:12.850> notes<00:04:13.150> hit<00:04:13.660> nose<00:04:13.870> in

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
double stops the ghost notes hit nose in

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.090 
double stops the ghost notes hit nose in
there<00:04:15.840> that's<00:04:16.840> just<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.470> ghost<00:04:17.650> notes<00:04:17.919> are

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
there that's just the ghost notes are

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.360 
there that's just the ghost notes are
really<00:04:18.400> just<00:04:18.579> a<00:04:18.729> kind<00:04:18.970> of<00:04:19.919> it<00:04:20.919> kind<00:04:21.039> of<00:04:21.130> helps

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
really just a kind of it kind of helps

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.900 
really just a kind of it kind of helps
with<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.579> timing<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.330> it<00:04:22.450> helps<00:04:23.640> keep<00:04:24.640> that

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
with the timing and it helps keep that

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.050 
with the timing and it helps keep that
rocking<00:04:25.600> thing<00:04:26.590> going<00:04:27.010> with<00:04:27.190> the<00:04:27.460> with<00:04:27.970> the

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
rocking thing going with the with the

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:41.820 
rocking thing going with the with the
right<00:04:28.270> hand<00:04:28.510> picking

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.680 

anyway<00:04:42.830> that's<00:04:43.010> pretty<00:04:43.160> much<00:04:43.730> it<00:04:44.060> again<00:04:44.510> that

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
anyway that's pretty much it again that

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.500 
anyway that's pretty much it again that
was<00:04:44.810> in<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:44.990> Kia<00:04:45.200> you<00:04:45.980> can<00:04:46.340> play<00:04:47.030> around<00:04:47.150> with

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
was in the Kia you can play around with

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.900 
was in the Kia you can play around with
it<00:04:47.690> and<00:04:48.080> you<00:04:48.830> know<00:04:48.890> use<00:04:49.190> it<00:04:49.220> in<00:04:49.760> different

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
it and you know use it in different

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.140 
it and you know use it in different
situations<00:04:50.720> different<00:04:50.990> tempos

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150
