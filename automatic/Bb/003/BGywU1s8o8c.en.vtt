let's<00:00:12.090> go

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:46.720 

okay<00:00:36.890> no<00:00:37.890> more<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.220> it<00:00:41.000> okay<00:00:42.000> let's<00:00:42.750> roll<00:00:43.220> huh

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.640 

let's<00:00:47.730> think<00:00:47.850> about<00:00:48.000> C<00:00:48.360> major<00:00:48.600> there<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.260> are

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
let's think about C major there we are

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.270 
let's think about C major there we are
a<00:00:49.680> C<00:00:50.070> major<00:00:50.280> with<00:00:51.210> an<00:00:51.329> octave<00:00:51.660> down<00:00:51.809> here<00:00:52.110> right

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
a C major with an octave down here right

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.979 
a C major with an octave down here right
here's<00:00:53.280> middle<00:00:53.489> C<00:00:54.140> okay<00:00:55.250> now<00:00:56.989> always

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
here's middle C okay now always

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.170 
here's middle C okay now always
mentioning<00:00:58.410> inversion<00:00:59.220> so<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.879> side<00:01:00.089> I

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
mentioning inversion so this side I

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.850 
mentioning inversion so this side I
thought<00:01:00.360> take<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.690> opportunity<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.290> tell

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
thought take this opportunity to tell

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.640 
thought take this opportunity to tell
you<00:01:01.920> what<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.550> don't<00:01:02.670> know<00:01:03.650> there's

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
you what it is if you don't know there's

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.810 
you what it is if you don't know there's
a<00:01:04.739> root<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.909> chord<00:01:06.210> here<00:01:06.330> see<00:01:06.930> see<00:01:07.710> eg<00:01:08.460> being

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
a root of a chord here see see eg being

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.540 
a root of a chord here see see eg being
a<00:01:08.910> C<00:01:09.119> major<00:01:09.300> chord<00:01:09.649> I'm<00:01:10.649> going<00:01:10.800> to<00:01:10.860> take<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.190> C

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
a C major chord I'm going to take that C

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.930 
a C major chord I'm going to take that C
off<00:01:11.700> there<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.660> put<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.990> there<00:01:13.640> C<00:01:14.640> major<00:01:14.789> chord

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
off there and put it there C major chord

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.540 
off there and put it there C major chord
still<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.600> sure<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:17.100> sounds<00:01:17.399> a<00:01:17.460> little

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
still a sure but sounds a little

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.660 
still a sure but sounds a little
different<00:01:17.970> doesn't<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:19.490> let's<00:01:20.490> keep

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
different doesn't it and let's keep

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.540 
different doesn't it and let's keep
moving<00:01:21.060> up<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.479> that's<00:01:21.860> your<00:01:22.860> site<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.369> that's

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
moving up so that's your site so that's

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.340 
moving up so that's your site so that's
the<00:01:23.700> first<00:01:23.970> inversion<00:01:24.300> it's<00:01:24.690> as<00:01:24.810> simple<00:01:25.050> as

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
the first inversion it's as simple as

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.790 
the first inversion it's as simple as
that

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
that

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.260 
that
here's<00:01:26.039> the<00:01:26.160> second<00:01:26.520> inversion<00:01:26.759> let's<00:01:27.060> take

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
here's the second inversion let's take

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.050 
here's the second inversion let's take
the<00:01:27.420> e<00:01:27.450> off<00:01:27.780> there<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.289> put<00:01:28.440> up<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:30.350> GE<00:01:32.060> again

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
the e off there and put up here GE again

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.900 
the e off there and put up here GE again
it<00:01:33.179> sounds<00:01:33.479> differently<00:01:34.490> there<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.700> that's

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
it sounds differently there it is that's

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.410 
it sounds differently there it is that's
the<00:01:36.090> first<00:01:36.390> note<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.660> our<00:01:36.929> intro<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.429> it's<00:01:38.670> g<00:01:39.030> c

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
the first note of our intro so it's g c
