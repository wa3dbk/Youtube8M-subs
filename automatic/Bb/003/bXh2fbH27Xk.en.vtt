00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
good stuff 20 surfaces apps have been

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.450 
good stuff 20 surfaces apps have been
stopped<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:42.390> let's<00:03:42.810> run<00:03:43.020> minecraft<00:03:44.510> yes

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.460 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:57.850 

single-player<00:03:50.460> I<00:03:50.820> just<00:03:51.390> started<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.780> new<00:03:51.930> world

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.730 

it's<00:03:58.860> gonna<00:03:59.010> change<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.460> render<00:03:59.820> distance

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.230 

before<00:04:04.740> it's<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:05.010> lot<00:04:05.190> smoother<00:04:05.670> than<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:06.030> was

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
before it's a lot smoother than it was

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.450 
before it's a lot smoother than it was
before<00:04:06.390> because<00:04:06.750> before<00:04:07.170> this<00:04:07.350> I<00:04:07.530> was<00:04:07.680> relying

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
before because before this I was relying

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.780 
before because before this I was relying
really<00:04:08.760> badly<00:04:10.610> can<00:04:11.610> I<00:04:11.670> hit<00:04:11.790> one<00:04:11.970> more<00:04:12.120> time<00:04:12.330> oh

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
really badly can I hit one more time oh

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.759 
really badly can I hit one more time oh
yeah<00:04:14.820> this<00:04:15.750> is<00:04:15.870> way<00:04:16.109> smoother<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:19.590> only

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
yeah this is way smoother the only

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:20.900 
yeah this is way smoother the only
reason<00:04:20.040> it's<00:04:20.160> lagging<00:04:20.400> it<00:04:20.609> but<00:04:20.730> now<00:04:20.850> is

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
reason it's lagging it but now is

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.000 
reason it's lagging it but now is
because<00:04:21.150> I'm<00:04:21.270> screen<00:04:21.540> recording<00:04:22.020> but<00:04:22.680> apart

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
because I'm screen recording but apart

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.400 
because I'm screen recording but apart
from<00:04:23.100> this<00:04:23.340> yeah<00:04:23.730> this<00:04:24.450> is<00:04:24.600> pretty<00:04:24.780> smoother

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
from this yeah this is pretty smoother

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.450 
from this yeah this is pretty smoother
than<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:25.770> was<00:04:25.919> before<00:04:26.130> so<00:04:27.650> yeah<00:04:28.650> that<00:04:28.890> is<00:04:28.919> thing

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
than it was before so yeah that is thing

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.030 
than it was before so yeah that is thing

which is pretty sexy so yeah it's gonna

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.580 
which is pretty sexy so yeah it's gonna
move<00:05:16.210> at<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.420> top<00:05:16.660> performance<00:05:17.200> is<00:05:17.320> gonna

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
move at the top performance is gonna

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.230 
move at the top performance is gonna
disable<00:05:18.160> all<00:05:18.520> these<00:05:18.820> you<00:05:19.060> know<00:05:19.090> optimize<00:05:21.240> now

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
disable all these you know optimize now

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.310 
disable all these you know optimize now
apparently<00:05:22.870> this<00:05:23.860> is<00:05:24.190> it<00:05:25.030> optimize<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:26.140> top

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
apparently this is it optimize the top

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.560 
apparently this is it optimize the top
performance<00:05:26.830> and<00:05:27.370> we're<00:05:28.090> going<00:05:28.300> to<00:05:28.360> have<00:05:28.540> a

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
performance and we're going to have a

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.420 
performance and we're going to have a
quick<00:05:28.780> look<00:05:28.960> on<00:05:29.200> Minecraft<00:05:29.830> on<00:05:30.040> it

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
quick look on Minecraft on it
