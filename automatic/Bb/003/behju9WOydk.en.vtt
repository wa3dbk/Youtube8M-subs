00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.630 

okay<00:04:06.480> I<00:04:06.510> turned<00:04:06.840> off<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.069> fan<00:04:08.069> or

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
okay I turned off the fan or

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.460 
okay I turned off the fan or
disconnected<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.420> load<00:04:09.599> it's<00:04:10.170> a<00:04:10.260> little

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
disconnected the load it's a little

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.910 
disconnected the load it's a little
quieter<00:04:10.830> now<00:04:11.330> and<00:04:12.330> let's<00:04:12.870> take<00:04:13.739> some

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
quieter now and let's take some

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.890 
quieter now and let's take some
measurements<00:04:14.040> from<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:14.760> analyzer<00:04:17.900> the

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
measurements from the analyzer the

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.810 
measurements from the analyzer the
voltage<00:04:19.850> on<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.510> upper<00:04:21.810> right<00:04:22.109> is<00:04:22.820> twelve

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
voltage on the upper right is twelve

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.300 
voltage on the upper right is twelve
point<00:04:24.210> three<00:04:24.479> three<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.020> that's<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.800> battery

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
point three three and that's the battery

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.490 
point three three and that's the battery
without<00:04:26.729> a<00:04:26.910> load

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
without a load

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.560 
without a load
there's<00:04:28.500> no<00:04:28.680> wattage<00:04:29.160> and<00:04:29.370> amperage<00:04:30.120> because

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
there's no wattage and amperage because

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.430 
there's no wattage and amperage because
there's<00:04:30.750> no<00:04:30.870> load<00:04:32.630> but<00:04:33.630> let's<00:04:33.810> take<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.050> look<00:04:34.260> at

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
there's no load but let's take a look at

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:42.770 
there's no load but let's take a look at
the<00:04:34.590> AP<00:04:35.340> which<00:04:36.060> is<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.419> peak<00:04:36.690> amps<00:04:41.240> it's<00:04:42.240> one

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
the AP which is the peak amps it's one

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.820 
the AP which is the peak amps it's one
point<00:04:43.020> six<00:04:44.060> amps<00:04:45.060> I<00:04:45.210> believe<00:04:45.510> I<00:04:45.870> read<00:04:46.710> it

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
point six amps I believe I read it

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.530 
point six amps I believe I read it
correctly<00:04:47.330> one<00:04:48.330> point<00:04:48.570> six<00:04:48.780> eight<00:04:49.050> amps<00:04:50.540> and

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
correctly one point six eight amps and

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.150 
correctly one point six eight amps and
let's<00:04:51.780> take<00:04:51.990> a<00:04:52.020> look<00:04:52.260> at<00:04:52.350> the<00:04:52.470> reading<00:04:52.830> on<00:04:52.919> top

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
let's take a look at the reading on top

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.840 
let's take a look at the reading on top
of<00:04:53.340> that<00:04:53.490> when<00:04:54.000> I<00:04:54.030> connect<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:55.050> load<00:04:55.850> should

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
of that when I connect the load should

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:08.150 
of that when I connect the load should
be<00:04:57.000> lower

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.420 

okay<00:05:09.160> so<00:05:09.220> with<00:05:09.640> the<00:05:09.820> load<00:05:10.030> running

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
okay so with the load running

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.029 
okay so with the load running
continuously<00:05:13.510> it's<00:05:13.900> at<00:05:14.280> 0.87<00:05:15.280> amps

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:24.420 

the<00:05:18.580> 80<00:05:18.839> peak<00:05:19.839> amps<00:05:20.289> is<00:05:20.909> 1.68

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.350 

and<00:05:24.910> that<00:05:25.180> means<00:05:26.400> there<00:05:27.400> is<00:05:27.520> a<00:05:27.550> search<00:05:27.880> current

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
and that means there is a search current

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.920 
and that means there is a search current
when<00:05:28.630> the<00:05:28.660> fan<00:05:29.020> turns<00:05:29.320> on<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:31.060> it<00:05:31.630> draws<00:05:31.900> a

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
when the fan turns on and it draws a

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.110 
when the fan turns on and it draws a
little<00:05:32.290> bit<00:05:32.500> more<00:05:32.710> current<00:05:33.100> to<00:05:33.580> get<00:05:33.729> the<00:05:33.880> motor

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
little bit more current to get the motor

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.920 
little bit more current to get the motor
running<00:05:34.710> and<00:05:35.710> that's<00:05:36.009> the<00:05:36.220> surge<00:05:36.460> current

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
running and that's the surge current

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.010 
running and that's the surge current
that's<00:05:37.930> why<00:05:38.169> the<00:05:38.229> peak<00:05:38.620> amperage<00:05:39.490> is<00:05:40.020> higher

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
that's why the peak amperage is higher

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.460 
that's why the peak amperage is higher
than<00:05:41.889> the<00:05:42.490> continuous<00:05:42.940> running<00:05:43.509> average

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
than the continuous running average

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.030 
than the continuous running average
so<00:05:46.010> that's<00:05:46.190> how<00:05:46.700> to<00:05:46.760> use<00:05:46.850> the

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
so that's how to use the

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.910 
so that's how to use the
power<00:05:49.610> analyzer<00:05:51.370> okay<00:05:52.370> in<00:05:52.640> conclusion<00:05:53.920> this

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920 
power analyzer okay in conclusion this

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.560 
power analyzer okay in conclusion this
unit<00:05:55.720> is<00:05:57.130> fairly<00:05:58.130> well<00:05:58.310> made<00:05:58.520> similar<00:05:59.210> to

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
unit is fairly well made similar to

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.500 
unit is fairly well made similar to
turnigy<00:06:00.340> thermodyne<00:06:01.340> and<00:06:01.610> GT<00:06:02.270> power

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
turnigy thermodyne and GT power

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.890 
turnigy thermodyne and GT power
analyzers<00:06:03.760> it<00:06:04.760> operates<00:06:05.240> fine

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
analyzers it operates fine

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.070 
analyzers it operates fine
with<00:06:06.440> the<00:06:06.560> load<00:06:06.740> I<00:06:06.890> provided<00:06:07.490> I<00:06:07.780> have<00:06:08.780> not

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
with the load I provided I have not
