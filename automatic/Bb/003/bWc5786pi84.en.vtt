00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.440
 hello dear spectators i am intending 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.059
 a few weeks on recommendation one 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:16.920
 girlfriend a sg cam 4000 or it jay 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.740
 Bought 4000 and have with them after 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.620
 taken in Thailand and then unfortunately 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.020
 this is what I happened to have me in 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.350
 dive on the glued or underneath 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.300
 water 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.800
 after a few great pictures in poverty 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.619
 but does not live right on the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.110
 glued on and suddenly she was gone 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.350
 Now I can tell you in contrast 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.540
 the gkm will do the following for you 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.090
 does not fall on the sea 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.620
 but she floats up so she 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.540
 swim very slowly 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.890
 Nevertheless I have the unfortunately 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.870
 not found again 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.719
 That's why I'm on the internet 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:57.390
 looked up and I have a sj 6000 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.399
 but this is not from as 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.399
 they can be branded but was from 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.979
 Affolter offered me naturally 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.850
 The fear is that it will be a fake 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:13.200
 written by some fans and no 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:17.850
 So this sj 4000 is from oh and there 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.350
 identical with the sj 4000 from sg camp 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.149
 that all seems the same manufacturer 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.560
 somehow then that of others 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.429
 be branded differently 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.109
 Of course I have one now 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.749
 Six thousands model in contrast to 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:33.450
 four thousand model and there is 

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:35.039
 then the question if that is now a fake 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.979
 is then fits the battery still has 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:42.240
 a second battery with the sg kmk 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.109
 and the battery fits I grab now 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.619
 just here 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:48.619
 the 6000 off 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.360
 here you can see her coming too 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.560
 an incredible amount of accessories 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.000
 business as usual you have these 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:05.500
 Camera and is the great thing about the sj 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.570
 6000 is one has this larger one here 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.640
 the bigger display you can see these little ones 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.130
 diodes down here on the edge of a larger one 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.450
 display and if you click here on this 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.450
 Sounds once briefly 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.950
 so you can see here now 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.080
 same animal blue and green up here 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.160
 so these diodes the earlier down here 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.250
 have shone that you can see now 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.660
 here at the power button to the power 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.130
 button so i just wanted to get out of here 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.840
 the camera because that's synonymous 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.040
 interesting as you can see here already 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.810
 a big display 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.020
 otherwise of dimensions exactly that 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.760
 same as I have already tried 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.360
 Also this camera we do not under 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.610
 water but she swims up something 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.140
 very handy is in principle if you 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.150
 not somehow like me unfortunately much 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.890
 too late realizes because the sea â€‹â€‹is then 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.450
 but something big and then just use 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.880
 Not when the camera is hovering when she is 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.440
 Once she's gone, she's gone 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.950
 as already mentioned I still had that 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.820
 whole original accessories from the sj 4000 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.500
 here you can see 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.650
 I have here a battery with scm 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.690
 Branding fits just like that 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.670
 original battery or kaka at this 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.739
 Camera was here when I got it 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.490
 now it opens opens on every 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:24.740
 case easier as with the sj 4000 camera 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.570
 Did you think something here here 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.470
 is the battery who was there says it cain 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.000
 jake and branding so unfortunately it is always 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.500
 a little tricky the batteries at all 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.210
 to get in this chamber but now 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:43.430
 you come here simply the but already 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:51.700
 Let's see if it's different 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:58.160
 around so too and the camera is synonymous 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:01.660
 welcome screen from the menu items 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.860
 is it the same as the sj 4000 wifi 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.320
 Here you can see that the camera or 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.600
 it was identical so nothing 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.850
 because of fake does not fit when we look 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.650
 Now briefly the description 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:19.070
 look at 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:20.930
 the side so busu you can at all 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.050
 not exactly realize that here was the 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.490
 description of the sj 4000 wifi 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.370
 This was the description 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.510
 the both as 6000 was the from of 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.030
 and marketed was sold 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.590
 they are similar in general 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.410
 the accessory that is clear it is me 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.390
 Of course I have everything twice now too 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.500
 the service in the mobile phone what already 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.650
 tried it works great 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.470
 Just here you can do it 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.470
 maybe that will work and then go 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.390
 Of course wlan is not here 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.030
 it can be turned on down here 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:59.840
 see it ultimately quite simple with 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.440
 connect the phone and that shows now 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.790
 sometimes 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.740
 Of course it has to be a phone first 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.740
 connect with the wlan of the camera 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.460
 the camera is called by default 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:21.260
 sports tv is connected 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.260
 Just press connect 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.410
 so is in points 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.740
 Now I open what I take 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.380
 because times 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.380
 I'll take this app here 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.840
 the phone across yes and now you can 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:48.180
 I can also see on the phone 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.449
 What the camera looks like a little bit 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.690
 crazy so that's already done 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:53.690
 fun 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.130
 but pretty smoothly, she says 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.760
 little 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:05.580
 Yesterday has definitely been pretty 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.600
 it works great too, maybe 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.430
 quite interesting if you have it now 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.750
 I look at this case once 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.660
 of course, the replacement cover 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:15.600
 the sj 4000 camera was there 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.160
 if you ever think about them 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.590
 are identical here, too, I'm leaving 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.590
 made it easy to replace 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.310
 So it seems the same production 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.270
 to be so are the packaging 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.170
 very similar 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:33.270
 That's why I can only recommend you 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:35.910
 Best ordered via Amazon Prime 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.940
 among us also cheaper than the sg came 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.160
 around 10 euro or so it all makes 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.830
 not bock but as I said there you can 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.790
 order relaxed and no 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:49.410
 fear that you will buy a fake 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.270
 if you liked the video 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.260
 I 'm sorry for you otherwise at night 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.260
 stay until then
