00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.320
 first video here on the channel to 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.329
 next episode of fifa 15 winter 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.679
 upgrade prediction yes, that's how it looks 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:15.269
 here again from today the next 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.220
 video is at the start and the last one 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.449
 episode has arrived really well have 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.679
 I'm pretty happy if it's today 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.699
 again as good as last load again 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.679
 a thumb why would I be there 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.730
 extremely happy about it and thus again 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.109
 many interesting players 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.480
 First of all, a very important one 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.490
 history and although I do not know if 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.859
 the whole thing was just sarcasm or 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.450
 really stupid but this comment the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.330
 I became a blind here now yes 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.280
 written on ner under the under 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.740
 video sometimes downgrade for 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.050
 the winter break but max where is perisic 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.640
 de bruyne balls rabbi and choupo moting 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.170
 sachs has a clue and claps because of the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.000
 leave it alone and then no player like 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.480
 exclude job from GrieÃŸmann or 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.910
 kelly husband max what's up 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.190
 first that's not a sentence I've got something 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.870
 you want to tell me and I know myself 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.220
 want to say and second, just because I like 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.590
 in the first episode the players do not 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.030
 assuming it means to accept 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.980
 he quite frankly I partially understand 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.810
 not as you always ask directly 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.030
 could that be in a 120,000 episode 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.590
 player ran comes my goodness normally no matter 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.390
 who today in the example but of course 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.150
 Let's start directly with the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.210
 First this is eric maxime choupo moting 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.890
 This year is currently at 1 76 of the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.260
 left midfielder at the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.030
 outstanding round played but little 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.740
 met or not played so blatantly 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.540
 has been extremely well developed 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.250
 pretty much the best by now 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.080
 player at Schalke next eventual 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.490
 but I think both the stronger 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.010
 very much of his achievements yes because he 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.760
 really always plays well and constantly 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.500
 accordingly, that an update 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.060
 then gets but as far as I know 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.620
 at least on the system change of di 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.150
 martino most striker played what i did 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.320
 I could imagine that he had one 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.880
 striker card gets one 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.810
 get common midfield 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.100
 could be there that was probably lying 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.600
 but that means at the end left 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.299
 I played midfield and I think so 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.680
 bike in the beginning, yes, but maybe 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.180
 Striker would be very nice if that 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.280
 I am very good at this card 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.170
 just given 79 like her 79 september 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.090
 79 has schooling ' has the dribblings 72 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.040
 74 56 it could also be 80 original 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.650
 on the left, it usually does a lot 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.630
 rarely upgrades from +4 last year 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.860
 he even does not own two players 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.299
 So only gold players I mean 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.639
 now we do that very rarely was that 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.989
 in Ramsey and kossi agassa that's why 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.810
 I do not fight without a company though 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.120
 three would be long 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.370
 for shooting on 79 would be the monument 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.690
 relatively new is the next player 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.190
 then also a purple Bundesliga the 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.010
 season proved again correctly 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.349
 and indeed the superstar of currently 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.720
 eintracht frankfurt alexander meier yes 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.950
 the number 14 is ready for eternity 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.349
 meanwhile has beautiful club legend 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.140
 has had 60 tempo this year 80 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.640
 schools 72 drilling 75 4 676 matching 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.230
 76 overall I think that with 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.209
 be increased after he 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.050
 the top scorer was the round and frankfurt 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.209
 actually closed exactly there 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.010
 were it available to the largest 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.720
 in any case at the 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.420
 Frankfurter I think once you get one 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.700
 79 that's again +3 the whole 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.290
 as garages justified with 84 shooting 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.489
 the 14 shooting was a simple one 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.230
 really good shot on the header has 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.170
 compression both aut to respect the 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.980
 wirtin partner and 73 60 tempo that 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.269
 dribbling and hamburg 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.130
 who are really high because they are 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.110
 not his strengths tend to be in the big and 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.670
 immobile player but of course 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.440
 nevertheless an absolute scorer and 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.660
 ice cold when it comes to the ball 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.730
 Into the gate to bow and therefore think 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.170
 That's a relatively deserved upgrade for him 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.280
 would their opinion of course one again 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.810
 in the comments write yours again 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.609
 opinion rey to the players and also the 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.900
 The next projects I should do it 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.489
 the next you could imagine 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.750
 Of course, not all of me, me either 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.340
 take only those with those over the 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.400
 Presentation if that makes the update and 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.920
 Although that's why I'll take next 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.269
 a good karim bellarabi why now 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.739
 the next German are general 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.000
 Relatively many German Bundesliga players 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.340
 this episode and 24 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.700
 why came in belgrade is it relative 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.290
 simple and he has 570 rating there 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.040
 are ridiculous the absolutely ridiculous 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.230
 bellarabi is at one 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.639
 champions league participant one of 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.760
 Tribal player of the outstanding players 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:49.540
 been in this round and so far 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.989
 just keeps getting bigger 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.670
 better and better 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.049
 but Brunswick already convinced the 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.760
 season he is really really good again 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.019
 that's why i think and probably and 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.760
 I could well imagine him 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.709
 He also deserves his april 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.090
 and although I have him so again you 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.000
 already looks a bit higher rated 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.620
 again and only to whole 78 again 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.239
 +3 but we can open it up 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.739
 Germany the plus 4 goes because he 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.290
 really so garage champions league 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.910
 convinced otherwise alex meier or too 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.709
 choupo-moting was shooting 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.260
 relatively difficult to convince them 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.690
 honestly not play 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.310
 looked but just because of the stop 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.800
 so convinced in all competitions 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.990
 to imagine 90 73 fit 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.090
 to bring in there would be for the young 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.370
 bella the attached above all, of course 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.240
 380 the tip is very important 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.530
 because the monday 09.08 is secured 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.419
 absolutely ridiculous defender dumb 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.160
 switched in the next game and that is 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.660
 the last german for this episode it 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.250
 is a defender of over and over again 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.980
 stay balanced and it is the 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.850
 robin knoche from vfl wolfsburg this 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:52.300
 year so far 1 75 m rating only and to 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:54.190
 770 vending and also 68 ps 71 46 that 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.810
 I'll think about it all the same 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.740
 has completely earned 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.660
 wolfsburg currently has 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.010
 table second in the Bundesliga has 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.810
 played a really solid round 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.070
 unfortunately almost better at naldo 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.570
 but probably not an update 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.889
 even if he already has two in 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.380
 Form says I think the rally of 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.520
 81 I may be up to 82 again 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.169
 I'm not sure if the april gets 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.389
 I can not imagine so well at 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.190
 boche a bit more than that 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.840
 he has really been extreme 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.400
 evolving and getting better and better 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.860
 and then you are happy for the 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.870
 junior work has hamas and later 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.270
 also for the a nationalelf there grows 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.190
 really good player approach 79 rating 70 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.630
 defending to 79 how would the physics have 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.520
 would be appropriate in my opinion 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.169
 And I think there you definitely 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.910
 living very well and robin knoche would be 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.840
 so that even better in ultimate team that 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.820
 he had, I can not imagine 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.169
 but it could also be good because 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.570
 German defense gives 19 cigarettes 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:43.630
 it is relatively rare as if we were 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.950
 will see what to choose as 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.850
 what you decide for will be good 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.620
 we come to the last player of this 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.660
 episode still was often called that 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.039
 is a player we all so well 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.450
 how the times wanted to see 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.710
 you want to see because they are absolutely 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.840
 justified when he upgrade 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.729
 this is david 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.169
 how rea the moment maybe 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:00.639
 second best keeper or best goalkeeper 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.100
 even the premier league along with 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.450
 Timo Kurz was an incredible series 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.340
 played two to get in shape that would be 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.320
 great again top values â€‹â€‹is relatively rare 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.300
 already in a half-series but that 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.800
 completely right because he is for me 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.970
 the best player when playing with the 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.770
 Carla is not rooney either 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.120
 bad but for me in the round yet 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.380
 That's why it thinks so 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.610
 to get it an update to firmware 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.650
 turns with 89 90 reflexes 780 68 79 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.030
 Positioning that would be normal values 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.919
 for the goalkeeper that might even be 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.150
 the best card then in the premier 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:30.370
 league from a goalkeeper I think 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.610
 this year would not be as strong nor 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.169
 competition but otherwise thinks 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.909
 that's almost the best goalkeeper 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:36.830
 is in the premier league and that 

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:39.169
 he proves again and again, hopefully 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.430
 so well prove that was from 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.020
 this as well as sony fall today if so 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.430
 As I said, do it yourself 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.139
 friend writes me your players like that 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.400
 comments that I should rate and 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.870
 write your opinion in the comments 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.310
 and then we'll see each other next time 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.659
 Again, I wish you a nice day 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.659
 then and look
