know my thoughts on it and then I have

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.279 
know my thoughts on it and then I have
about<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.490> 45<00:00:18.000> second<00:00:18.390> clip<00:00:18.570> at<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.720> end<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:19.170> the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
about a 45 second clip at the end of the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.679 
about a 45 second clip at the end of the
video<00:00:19.529> which<00:00:19.830> contains<00:00:20.550> about<00:00:20.670> 10<00:00:21.060> seconds<00:00:21.570> of

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
video which contains about 10 seconds of

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.330 
video which contains about 10 seconds of
sound<00:00:22.080> because<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.470> didn't<00:00:22.800> really<00:00:23.070> actually

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
sound because I didn't really actually

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.070 
sound because I didn't really actually
want<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.090> get<00:00:24.240> copyright<00:00:24.689> infringement

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
want you to get copyright infringement

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.439 
want you to get copyright infringement
but<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:25.949> can<00:00:26.070> basically<00:00:26.310> get<00:00:26.880> what<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.180> sounds

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
but you can basically get what it sounds

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.200 
but you can basically get what it sounds
like<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.840> great<00:00:28.080> system<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:28.830> first<00:00:29.699> off<00:00:29.939> um

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
like it's a great system so first off um

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.820 
like it's a great system so first off um
it<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> little<00:00:31.019> bit<00:00:31.140> expensive<00:00:31.439> it's<00:00:31.710> two

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
it is a little bit expensive it's two

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.860 
it is a little bit expensive it's two
hundred<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.130> fifty<00:00:32.369> dollars<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.480> think

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
hundred and fifty dollars but I do think

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.250 
hundred and fifty dollars but I do think
it's<00:00:34.079> well<00:00:34.290> worth<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:35.090> if<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.809> are<00:00:37.020> looking

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
it's well worth it if you are looking

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.290 
it's well worth it if you are looking
for<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> well<00:00:37.649> surround<00:00:38.070> sound<00:00:38.399> system<00:00:38.790> it's

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
for a well surround sound system it's

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.470 
for a well surround sound system it's
not<00:00:39.510> quite<00:00:39.930> as<00:00:40.079> good<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.500> like<00:00:40.739> Full<00:00:41.100> HD<00:00:41.480> home

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
not quite as good as a like Full HD home

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.750 
not quite as good as a like Full HD home
stereo<00:00:43.200> system<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.219> very<00:00:44.460> good

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
stereo system but it is very good

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.840

quality<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:46.379> sound<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.860> perfectly<00:00:47.399> good<00:00:47.640> for

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
quality the sound is perfectly good for

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.959 
quality the sound is perfectly good for

like a dorm room in our apartment like

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.250 
like a dorm room in our apartment like

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
that it has two speakers built inside

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.709 
that it has two speakers built inside
which<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.129> see<00:00:56.309> up<00:00:56.550> here<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.390> top

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
which you can see up here on the top

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.290 
which you can see up here on the top
half<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> speaker<00:00:58.680> system<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.000> then<00:01:00.120> down

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
half of the speaker system and then down

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.330 
half of the speaker system and then down
here<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.690> bottom<00:01:00.870> right<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.680> actually<00:01:02.190> has

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
here in the bottom right it actually has

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.490 
here in the bottom right it actually has
a<00:01:02.370> subwoofer<00:01:03.000> which<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> great<00:01:04.229> deal

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
a subwoofer which is a great deal

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.859 
a subwoofer which is a great deal
because<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:05.189> subwoofer<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.360> about<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> hundred

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
because a subwoofer is about a hundred

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.350 
because a subwoofer is about a hundred
dollars<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.530> itself<00:01:07.860> which<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.880> why<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.030> thought

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
dollars in itself which is why I thought

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.120 
dollars in itself which is why I thought
this<00:01:09.450> was<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.659> great<00:01:09.990> unit<00:01:10.290> because<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.100> a

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
this was a great unit because it is a

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.370 
this was a great unit because it is a
combination<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.180> speaker<00:01:12.510> system<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.020> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
combination of a speaker system and a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.560 
combination of a speaker system and a
subwoofer<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.700> top<00:01:14.939> um<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.540> can

Brookstone<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.270> think<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.630> get<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.840> off<00:01:39.930> of

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
Brookstone I think you can get it off of

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.520 
Brookstone I think you can get it off of
the<00:01:40.140> Amazon<00:01:40.530> for<00:01:40.710> like<00:01:40.740> 200<00:01:41.600> but<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.500> a

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
the Amazon for like 200 but it is a

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.800 
the Amazon for like 200 but it is a
great<00:01:44.009> deal<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> think<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:45.509> terms<00:01:45.689> of

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
great deal I think in terms of

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.450 
great deal I think in terms of
accessories<00:01:46.320> what<00:01:46.530> was<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.829> box<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.310> came

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
accessories what was in the box it came

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.249 
accessories what was in the box it came
with<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.700> actual<00:01:47.939> stereo<00:01:48.299> system<00:01:48.600> itself<00:01:48.990> a

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
with the actual stereo system itself a

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.319 
with the actual stereo system itself a
bunch<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.979> little<00:01:50.130> docks<00:01:50.520> for<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.000> hook<00:01:51.180> up

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
bunch of little docks for you to hook up

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.450 
bunch of little docks for you to hook up
different<00:01:51.720> kinds<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.049> iPads<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.710> iPhones<00:01:52.799> to

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
different kinds of iPads and iPhones to

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.990 
different kinds of iPads and iPhones to
the<00:01:53.579> actual<00:01:54.149> system<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.500> I'm<00:01:55.770> still<00:01:56.640> early<00:01:56.729> in

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
the actual system and I'm still early in

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.060 
the actual system and I'm still early in
so<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.570> hook<00:01:57.750> up<00:01:57.930> like<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.110> radio<00:01:58.560> or<00:01:58.890> an

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
so you can hook up like a radio or an

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.770 
so you can hook up like a radio or an
external<00:01:59.610> audio<00:01:59.880> source<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.509> which<00:02:00.659> is

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
external audio source to it which is

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.560 
external audio source to it which is
very<00:02:01.020> cool<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:03.000> also<00:02:03.119> came<00:02:03.329> with<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
very cool and it also came with the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.240 
very cool and it also came with the
remote<00:02:03.869> but<00:02:04.290> other<00:02:04.560> than<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.770> that's

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
remote but other than that that's

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.150 
remote but other than that that's
basically<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.939> um<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.770> don't<00:02:07.770> know<00:02:07.860> what<00:02:08.039> this

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
basically it um I don't know what this

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.710 
basically it um I don't know what this
Bob<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.489> know<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:09.149> yeah<00:02:09.479> that's<00:02:09.569> basically

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
Bob you know but yeah that's basically

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.660 
Bob you know but yeah that's basically
it<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.349> does<00:02:10.560> work<00:02:10.800> well<00:02:11.039> though<00:02:11.280> it's<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.489> great

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
it it does work well though it's a great

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.330 
it it does work well though it's a great
deal<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.360> think

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
deal I think

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.890 
deal I think
the<00:02:14.340> speaker<00:02:14.849> quality<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.390> great<00:02:15.690> the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
the speaker quality is great the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.080 
the speaker quality is great the
subwoofer<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> good<00:02:16.950> subwoofer<00:02:17.550> it's<00:02:17.940> not

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
subwoofer is a good subwoofer it's not

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.150 
subwoofer is a good subwoofer it's not
the<00:02:18.239> best<00:02:18.540> but<00:02:18.750> it's<00:02:18.870> well<00:02:19.080> worth<00:02:19.110> 250<00:02:19.920> bucks

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
the best but it's well worth 250 bucks

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.759 
the best but it's well worth 250 bucks
and<00:02:20.430> again<00:02:20.970> I'm<00:02:21.120> very<00:02:21.180> happy<00:02:21.720> with<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.260> I

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
and again I'm very happy with it and I

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.309 
and again I'm very happy with it and I
think<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:23.310> guys<00:02:23.489> will<00:02:23.730> be<00:02:23.760> too<00:02:24.120> but<00:02:25.080> overall

think you guys will be too but overall

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.050 
think you guys will be too but overall

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
it's a great unit I highly recommend I

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.330 
it's a great unit I highly recommend I
design<00:02:27.450> in<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.870> past<00:02:28.110> I've<00:02:28.349> bought<00:02:28.560> Bose<00:02:28.920> and

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
design in the past I've bought Bose and

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.520 
design in the past I've bought Bose and
I<00:02:30.060> homes<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.750> stuff<00:02:30.900> like<00:02:31.019> that<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.410> they

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
I homes and stuff like that and they

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.190 
I homes and stuff like that and they
always<00:02:31.680> seem<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.980> break<00:02:32.340> or<00:02:32.610> just<00:02:33.000> not<00:02:33.540> work<00:02:33.930> as

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
always seem to break or just not work as

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.530 
always seem to break or just not work as
well<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.670> they<00:02:35.790> didn't<00:02:36.030> even<00:02:36.090> include<00:02:36.300> a

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
well and they didn't even include a

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.059 
well and they didn't even include a
subwoofer<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.319> is<00:02:37.470> definitely<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.890> best

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
subwoofer so this is definitely the best

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.820 
subwoofer so this is definitely the best
stereo<00:02:38.370> system<00:02:38.640> I've<00:02:38.760> ever<00:02:38.790> bought<00:02:39.319> and<00:02:40.319> yeah
