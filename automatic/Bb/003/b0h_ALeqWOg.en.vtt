respiratory<00:03:43.150> sounds<00:03:43.650> normally

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.750 

then<00:03:49.110> we'll<00:03:49.230> check<00:03:49.410> our<00:03:49.620> skin<00:03:49.860> our<00:03:50.130> hair<00:03:50.520> coat

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
then we'll check our skin our hair coat

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.860 
then we'll check our skin our hair coat
checking<00:03:51.570> for<00:03:51.750> any<00:03:51.930> parasites<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:53.250> he<00:03:53.310> liked

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
checking for any parasites and he liked

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.530 
checking for any parasites and he liked
making<00:03:54.870> sure<00:03:55.020> that<00:03:55.170> her<00:03:55.380> hair<00:03:55.910> coat<00:03:56.910> is<00:03:57.120> normal

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
making sure that her hair coat is normal

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:05.619 
making sure that her hair coat is normal
and<00:03:57.660> her<00:03:57.780> skin<00:03:58.050> looks<00:03:58.080> healthy

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.899 

and<00:04:05.810> then<00:04:06.290> we<00:04:06.409> can<00:04:06.590> wake<00:04:06.799> her<00:04:07.040> and<00:04:07.340> one<00:04:07.640> of<00:04:07.670> two

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
and then we can wake her and one of two

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.479 
and then we can wake her and one of two
ways<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.299> do<00:04:08.420> that<00:04:08.599> is<00:04:08.870> we<00:04:09.079> can<00:04:09.230> use<00:04:09.260> a<00:04:09.489> digital

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
ways to do that is we can use a digital

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.420 
ways to do that is we can use a digital
scale<00:04:10.760> with<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.180> patient's<00:04:11.689> own<00:04:11.900> carrier<00:04:12.560> and

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
scale with the patient's own carrier and

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.250 
scale with the patient's own carrier and
we<00:04:13.549> can<00:04:13.730> set<00:04:13.969> the<00:04:14.120> scale<00:04:14.359> to<00:04:14.599> zero<00:04:14.900> and<00:04:15.139> then

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
we can set the scale to zero and then

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.439 
we can set the scale to zero and then
put<00:04:15.439> her<00:04:15.560> in<00:04:15.709> there<00:04:15.859> to<00:04:16.009> get<00:04:16.100> her<00:04:16.280> weight<00:04:16.489> or

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
put her in there to get her weight or

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.249 
put her in there to get her weight or
else<00:04:17.750> we'll<00:04:17.930> use<00:04:18.079> a<00:04:18.169> clear<00:04:18.470> box<00:04:19.239> and<00:04:20.239> weigh<00:04:21.079> her

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:21.259 
else we'll use a clear box and weigh her

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:26.350 
else we'll use a clear box and weigh her
that<00:04:21.440> way<00:04:24.400> but<00:04:25.400> this<00:04:25.520> way<00:04:25.729> when<00:04:25.880> she<00:04:26.060> stands

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
that way but this way when she stands

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.270 
that way but this way when she stands
still<00:04:26.660> we<00:04:26.840> can<00:04:26.960> get<00:04:27.080> an<00:04:27.169> accurate<00:04:27.349> weight<00:04:27.800> on

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
still we can get an accurate weight on

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:37.690 
still we can get an accurate weight on
her<00:04:28.550> in<00:04:28.699> grams<00:04:30.789> which<00:04:31.789> is<00:04:32.289> 572

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.250 

but<00:04:38.270> were<00:04:38.360> we<00:04:38.510> planning<00:04:38.780> to<00:04:38.960> do<00:04:39.080> any

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
but were we planning to do any

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.250 
but were we planning to do any
procedures<00:04:39.830> to<00:04:40.040> her
