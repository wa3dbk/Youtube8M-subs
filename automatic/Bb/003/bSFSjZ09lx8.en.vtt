scholarship when I started racing and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.460 
scholarship when I started racing and
even<00:01:04.920> when<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.100> want<00:01:05.600> but<00:01:06.600> my<00:01:06.720> knees<00:01:06.930> were<00:01:06.960> shot

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
even when I want but my knees were shot

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.469 
even when I want but my knees were shot

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
I couldn't race anymore

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.500 
I couldn't race anymore
and<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.500> everyone<00:01:11.460> thinks<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.939> did<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.450> to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
and so everyone thinks I did it just to

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.240 
and so everyone thinks I did it just to
rehab<00:01:12.869> my<00:01:13.049> knees<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:13.560> I'd<00:01:13.680> already<00:01:13.830> had<00:01:14.040> so

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
rehab my knees but I'd already had so

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.830 
rehab my knees but I'd already had so
many<00:01:14.369> surgeries<00:01:14.670> at<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.240> point<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.689> it

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
many surgeries at that point that it

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.219 
many surgeries at that point that it
wasn't<00:01:16.310> really<00:01:17.310> about<00:01:17.520> rehabbing<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.479> couldn't

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
wasn't really about rehabbing a couldn't

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.530 
wasn't really about rehabbing a couldn't
sprint<00:01:19.500> at<00:01:20.280> all<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.820> he's<00:01:20.939> still<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.240> couldn't

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
sprint at all and he's still I couldn't

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.810 
sprint at all and he's still I couldn't
rent<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.930> mountain<00:01:22.170> biking<00:01:22.320> wrote<00:01:22.680> nothing

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
rent and mountain biking wrote nothing

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.170 
rent and mountain biking wrote nothing
and<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.860> knew<00:01:26.220> I'd<00:01:26.430> have<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> better<00:01:27.060> chance

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
and so I I knew I'd have a better chance

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.240 
and so I I knew I'd have a better chance
at<00:01:28.080> something<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.710> was<00:01:28.860> more<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.100> a

didn't automatically go to Worlds

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:53.170 
didn't automatically go to Worlds
because<00:02:39.350> I<00:02:39.470> was<00:02:39.620> almost<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:40.160> beginner

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.880 

and<00:02:54.180> as<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.480> woman<00:02:54.780> we<00:02:55.230> were<00:02:55.350> also<00:02:55.530> fortunate

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
and as a woman we were also fortunate

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.550 
and as a woman we were also fortunate
because<00:02:56.250> we<00:02:56.570> came<00:02:57.570> of<00:02:57.750> age<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.050> same<00:02:58.230> time<00:02:58.440> as

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
because we came of age the same time as

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.560 
because we came of age the same time as
the<00:02:58.680> men<00:02:58.890> we<00:02:59.280> didn't<00:02:59.520> we<00:02:59.670> weren't<00:02:59.820> added<00:03:00.300> later

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
the men we didn't we weren't added later

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.480 
the men we didn't we weren't added later
on<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:02.160> so<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:03.620> feel<00:03:04.620> fortunate<00:03:04.980> about<00:03:05.280> that

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
on and so I feel fortunate about that

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.910 
on and so I feel fortunate about that
and<00:03:05.730> also<00:03:05.850> like<00:03:06.240> when<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.420> raced<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:07.170> felt<00:03:07.740> like<00:03:07.860> I

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.210 
and also like when I raced I felt like I
was<00:03:08.040> representing<00:03:08.670> women<00:03:08.820> because<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.510> was

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
was representing women because I was

was representing women because I was
winning<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.490> so<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:11.790> knew<00:03:12.210> I<00:03:12.240> was<00:03:12.480> being

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
winning and so I knew I was being

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.720 
winning and so I knew I was being
compared<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.440> men<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:13.890> wanted<00:03:14.250> you
