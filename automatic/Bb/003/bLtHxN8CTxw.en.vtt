00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.410
 hello I wanted to show as I did 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.200
 my human nails did that 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.059
 help could look like 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.580
 they have become pretty nice 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.859
 maybe a bit cheesy though 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.859
 I think they look like the mac 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.689
 pallet design already done 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.660
 I just say what I do 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:30.000
 has used and indeed needs none 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.570
 then scissors tape this one like that 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.690
 small stripes cut it with her 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.469
 then nails can cover so crosswise so that 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.969
 you can almost paint the orange is 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.090
 actually just have to go here 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.070
 expect the pink lag was quite good 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.410
 has dried up i have the s 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.920
 and I use it all nice all 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.260
 normal mottos pink has a relatively long time 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.000
 maybe used to dry 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.070
 you dry one more faster 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.609
 when it's dried you stick it 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.739
 nails off with the strip you undertake 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.920
 lay in oranges i have to go here 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.450
 They are for large areas 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.130
 actually bad because the dry 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.090
 make a bad mobile but for a ne 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:19.500
 thing I think that's quite good and so 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.810
 I then made the strip and 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.580
 since the but was so tired I have from p2 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.680
 still made this metallic paint over it 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.930
 that makes me a whole lot worse 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.130
 I've then made equal then 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.000
 you do not really have to wait until 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.920
 the orange underneath has dried 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.960
 and then I have the stripes again 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.240
 subtracted as the name was still relative 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.340
 it was liquid when it was dry 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.110
 be very simple that we then grabbed 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.030
 Reinhardt and you with deducting I do 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.100
 That's usually better if he still has one 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.899
 bit wet and then I have 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.490
 actually twitter does not matter 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.229
 I have not had one for a long time 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.210
 there are more uses but I think so 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.000
 unfortunately not anymore 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.360
 and have that over the complete needle 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.340
 and then have 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.869
 I have such a stone the mac 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.150
 range the wish you happy to show you 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.640
 But send my girlfriend first 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.710
 here still has his hearty and then 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.330
 I have my dose here I think 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.660
 I have no more snacks now 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.140
 I already took ten with me 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.990
 The tweezers keep hearts out 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.790
 Here it is now a flower I have 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.190
 Taken with the tweezers and on the 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.690
 still wet glitter on the nail 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.500
 always put it over the oranges 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.360
 streak 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.040
 I now have it on every hand made 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.780
 looks a bit much you could 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.750
 maybe just a cent on one 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.630
 or two nails apply it 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.489
 also very funny and have it just like that 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.560
 little when the climb was still wet 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.810
 not dry that way 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.030
 Press in with the tweezers 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.040
 has little liability and then I have 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.940
 at the very end a top coat over 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.560
 made plain clear so that the 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.660
 hold stones and thus stop 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.690
 a bit small, I think you are quite good 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.760
 there but for the reform is always 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.980
 said it was just fine, maybe 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.840
 I'll definitely get it anyway 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.519
 are that a nice colorful now 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.220
 Nails I'm actually here completely 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.140
 funny I think my friends will be 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.380
 Dead fall over if this because the 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.330
 just so colorful but there you feel 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.180
 already tuned so and now it could 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.980
 just imitate if you want or 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.900
 Tried what connection in any case 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.900
 It was that good
