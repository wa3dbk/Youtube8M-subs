00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 Analyzer computer control 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.529
 boiler temperatures for you is the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.360
 winemaking a process in which you 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.219
 actively intervene for the best possible 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.809
 We use the wine to produce it 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.730
 complete technology know how of 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.220
 We do not leave nature behind 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.779
 simply grant the natural 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.510
 Determination of grape juice is namely 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.670
 vinegar we have to go into the natural 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.960
 regulate processes intervene around wines 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.529
 with a certain taste too 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.410
 receive 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.300
 I and I stand by this attitude 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.399
 I have not the slightest problem 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.989
 I am also willing to do all these 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.989
 absolutely transparent processes 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.059
 But not all wine producers put it that way 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.270
 much value on transparency as frederik 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.980
 industry and not on ethics the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.350
 Winery technology offers a lot 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.000
 travel the efforts of 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.219
 Science in harmony with nature 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.390
 apparently end at the door of 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.309
 wine cellar has exactly this experience 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.290
 also michelle toulouse one of the customers 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.200
 from league and claude bourbon jorge makes 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.090
 the owner of a huge winery 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.909
 the island of santeramo in the lagoon of 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.270
 Venice was right about some practices 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.850
 amazed when it comes to the bottling 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.770
 went the man with his truck over 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.009
 and of course I meant 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.479
 I have rubber arabic while I asked 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.180
 what do we need for that? 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.920
 bottle filling gum arabic because 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.790
 that stabilized the wine and gave it to him 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.150
 requires 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.960
 So he leaves a film glass of rubber 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.360
 Arabic then he still thinks I have 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.380
 also his acid with the white wine needs 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.450
 always something acidic 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.909
 I have wine or citric acid with me 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.970
 everything you want 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:51.600
 I thought our wine is natural 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.579
 But all the rows do that for him 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.500
 we totally abnormally smoked beer 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.990
 Arabic and tartaric acid refused 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.219
 which was unusual, we propose 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.729
 to taste the wine 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.790
 he tasted it and thought he understood now 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.790
 I 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.030
 who does it all completely normal 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.280
 Whenever we stressed shopping help 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.010
 we wanted natural help 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.810
 but it was always synonymous laughter is just 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.280
 Give them a violet wine 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.780
 gives bananas or strawberry aroma 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.180
 That was an aroma being artificially through 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.410
 the ports generated or worse 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.120
 is offered to you 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.830
 flavorings in the boiler add my 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.200
 friends the still natural wine 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.810
 make the name of the technical wines 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.569
 They say then this wine is very 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:48.519
 technically that means that much is added 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:51.010
 some things should not be added 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.269
 will use certain additives 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.069
 Not at all because they are not for me 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.380
 to match the wine and the wine 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.600
 rather harm I meet a precise 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.730
 choose between high quality 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.920
 science and what not for me 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.420
 I think it suits me but that 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.290
 science the possibility gives one 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.700
 to make a choice 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.700
 only that is important to me 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.920
 there are so many different types of 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.810
 winemaking as it tastes 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.950
 For discussion, only the 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.730
 role of humans in the 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.190
 Manufacturing process is someone's wine 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.610
 Here's a wine maker 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.500
 Winemaker as the Anglo-Saxons say 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.500
 or he just accompanies nature 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:55.670
 not the slightest trace of reduction 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:57.860
 unbelievable or mine 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.510
 business cards stands nature assistance 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.760
 but never my make a 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.700
 otherwise it would hardly have to be makers or 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.560
 Give red majors when they breed sheep 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.200
 if you wrote a marca I think 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.120
 the shocking we just see 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.040
 just to look at this wonderful world 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.040
 an oak tree causes an oak to grow 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.359
 Nobody would therefore be dogma 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.160
 That would be pretty pretentious 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.260
 the same goes for wine 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.440
 many winemakers are subject to this mistake 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.580
 because they were told that 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.140
 they were in one direction 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.330
 which is directed to the manufacturers of 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:36.130
 However, additives make you pay 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.130
 actually they could do without it 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.600
 that there is not any more than 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.610
 passively created artworks otherwise 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.290
 I would have to say once 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.570
 not my brushes move from 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.210
 alone or the musician would have to say 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.280
 my fingers play by themselves but that 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.120
 there is not everything from humans 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.730
 is created 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.400
 this also includes the wine always has a lot 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.740
 with doubt uncertainty and effort to do 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.750
 because it is exhausting 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.440
 I can never really relax 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.440
 always on 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.230
 i am active in viticulture as a young man 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.400
 I was physically more active now I am 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.290
 not so much anymore 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.120
 but i know the conditions for that 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.490
 must prevail in the boiler from the head 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.620
 I try to influence her like that and 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.020
 to modulate that is the best 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.830
 to get every kettle out and the best 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.830
 from every country on 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.530
 hardly anything man-made 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.330
 is so fiercely contested and 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.150
 controversial to the border of the 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.460
 irrational the wine on the one hand 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.440
 enjoyment and on the other hand god 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.650
 drink is through this ambivalence 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.750
 Shaping requires us to be creative 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.470
 out but also to the humility 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.060
 because wine is enormously complicated the 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.840
 Science is progressing 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.280
 but it also teaches us less to do 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.740
 today, diseases are tolerated and 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.780
 Process developed around the nature better 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.550
 to watch and to yourself 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.290
 leave 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.790
 That's the way science works 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.250
 bonding with nature 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:21.220
 also the social pressure causes 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.860
 that it intervenes less than today 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.350
 tries to understand and who knows 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.810
 maybe others too 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.630
 Open starts as you bio dynamics 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.520
 In any case, this represents 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.650
 Science more than ever 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:40.000
 explore the magic connection 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:42.300
 between human vine and wine 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.300
 Euro 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.129
 mio 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:48.129
 next week is
