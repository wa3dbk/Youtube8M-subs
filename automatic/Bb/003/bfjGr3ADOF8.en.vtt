00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.920
 electric motors consist of two 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.810
 parts one stationary stator another 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.000
 moving rotor which rotates inside 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.820
 the stator in the stator are 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.390
 numerous windings passing through 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.820
 windings 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.020
 electric current creates 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.090
 concentrated magnetic field which 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.219
 rotates the rotor resulting in 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.170
 mechanical energy arises along the axis 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.270
 the stator made grooves in each of 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.640
 which inserted a coil of copper wire 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.250
 the more powerful the engine the more 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.760
 the stator and the larger the womb 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.760
 wire 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.579
 the first step is to cover the isolation grooves that 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.809
 will maintain voltage on 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.809
 wire hitch pins 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.990
 the uterus is made up of many turns of copper 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.340
 wire winded with 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.710
 program control 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.200
 the more powerful the engine the more turns in 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:41.979
 uterus this machine is designed for winding 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:44.140
 13 coils of copper wire now 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.880
 workers fasten the notch wire on 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.369
 stamps in order to wire is not 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:56.710
 diverged when the uterus is inserted into 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:02:00.990
 stator grooves workers cover 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.990
 each bundle of fiberglass insulation 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.520
 then they insulate with fiberglass 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.100
 sheets part on whom left over 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.260
 outside the grooves further they insert 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.150
 fiberglass wedges to 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.150
 block the uterus inside the grooves 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.660
 when all the uterus is inserted and 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.819
 isolated workers start 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.220
 engine assembly preparation 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.230
 they wear acrylic insulation 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:34.319
 sleeve on both ends of each uterus 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:36.269
 each skein has two outputs then they 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.180
 collect these insulated wires 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.560
 power cables the amount of wires in 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.510
 one cable varies depending 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.510
 motor voltage 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.700
 workers solder wire hanks 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.340
 insulate then lay the wires 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.520
 inside the stator and outputs them so that 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.200
 they were available for later 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.450
 connections to a power source when 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.820
 the engine will be installed now with 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.400
 using chemical resistant and heat resistant 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.410
 polyester cord working tight 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.960
 bind the uterus so that they don't 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.850
 shifted when the engine is running this 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:21.440
 bundle of interconnected hanks 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.810
 the wire is called the stator now 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.180
 workers immerse the stator in glory capacity 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.570
 based on polyester thanks to this 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:35.270
 the stator becomes absolutely 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:36.910
 water resistant then stator by six 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.610
 hours placed in an oven at a temperature 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:44.890
 135 degrees Celsius lacquer hardens and 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.890
 gives it the rigidity of the stator mattcom 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.180
 now you need to balance your mouth and if 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.040
 he is not fine 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.460
 the engine will vibrate that 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.840
 unacceptable rotor is also balanced 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.480
 like car wheels 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.760
 only the accuracy of such a balancing 100 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.440
 times higher 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.150
 now they gently insert the rotor 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.260
 stator 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.580
 Care must be taken not to 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.650
 damage the status of the rotor will rotate 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.080
 on steel bearings bearings 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.420
 heated to cause their expansion 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.880
 thanks to which they are easier to install 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.100
 then they are cooled by a stream of cold 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.340
 air so that they tightly sat on the shaft 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.210
 the rotor is exactly the same process going on 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.210
 rear wall of the engine 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.490
 worker heat the fan and 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.139
 set it on the rotor shaft role 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.080
 fan is to 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:43.370
 cool the engine running so that it 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.990
 did not overheat and did not fail 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.480
 the fan is protected by a protective casing 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.950
 protective cover is also installed on 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.110
 front of the engine 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.150
 Further, the finished engine passes a row. 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.550
 tests to evaluate besides 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.500
 everything else in the quality of insulation and its 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.540
 performance in general such 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.460
 industrial engines are designed to 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.290
 use in factories on such 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.020
 equipment like belt conveyors 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:10.220
 pump and fan and and compressors without 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.220
 them we would be gone
