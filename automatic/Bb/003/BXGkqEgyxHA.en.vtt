pretending to be the spy I think the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.140 
pretending to be the spy I think the
enemy<00:00:25.260> seems<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.680> trust<00:00:26.010> her<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.820> did<00:00:27.029> not

want to be blowing her cover and so I

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.500 
want to be blowing her cover and so I
made<00:00:29.609> my<00:00:29.789> daring<00:00:30.269> leap<00:00:30.420> into<00:00:31.910> what<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.180> that

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
made my daring leap into what is that

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:42.260 
made my daring leap into what is that
weird<00:00:33.870> oh<00:00:39.800> very<00:00:40.800> good<00:00:40.950> then<00:00:41.280> but<00:00:41.670> now<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:41.969> must

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
weird oh very good then but now we must

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.119 
weird oh very good then but now we must
be<00:00:42.420> finding<00:00:42.809> our<00:00:42.930> way<00:00:42.960> back<00:00:43.170> into<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.800> lair<00:00:44.010> of

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
be finding our way back into the lair of

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.229

unfortunately<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.379> sea<00:00:46.680> Fox<00:00:47.010> took<00:00:47.280> some

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
unfortunately the sea Fox took some

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.240 
unfortunately the sea Fox took some
damage<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:48.840> can't<00:00:49.170> use<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.770> attack<00:00:50.070> them

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
damage so we can't use it to attack them

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.840 
damage so we can't use it to attack them
underwater<00:00:54.800> but<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.829> think<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.430> found<00:00:56.640> an

underwater but I think I found an

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.520 
underwater but I think I found an
underground<00:00:57.239> tunnel<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.809> connects<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.410> this

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
underground tunnel that connects to this

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.160 
underground tunnel that connects to this
Islands<00:00:58.949> cave<00:00:59.280> network<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.420> we'll<00:01:00.660> sneak<00:01:00.870> in
