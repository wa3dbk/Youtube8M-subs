meal it is nitrogen of my source of

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.170 
meal it is nitrogen of my source of
nitrogen<00:02:58.769> so<00:02:59.769> in<00:02:59.890> spread<00:03:00.310> that<00:03:00.519> when<00:03:00.880> I<00:03:00.910> don't

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
its carbon okay I'm going to turn this

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.800 
its carbon okay I'm going to turn this
off<00:03:18.549> and<00:03:20.220> that's<00:03:21.220> going<00:03:21.579> to<00:03:21.640> show<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:22.030> sum
