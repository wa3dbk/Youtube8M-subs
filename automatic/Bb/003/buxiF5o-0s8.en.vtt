00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
that's would have given up right and we

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:04.610 
that's would have given up right and we
but<00:00:03.629> we<00:00:03.750> were<00:00:03.870> beginning<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.319> be<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.560> bit

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
but we were beginning to be a bit

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.349 
but we were beginning to be a bit
resigned<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.580> fact<00:00:05.609> that<00:00:05.940> these<00:00:06.150> things

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
resigned to the fact that these things

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.179 
resigned to the fact that these things
weren't<00:00:06.660> gonna<00:00:06.870> start<00:00:07.259> I<00:00:07.440> mean<00:00:07.589> we've<00:00:08.010> gone

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
weren't gonna start I mean we've gone

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.140 
weren't gonna start I mean we've gone
from<00:00:09.290> 37<00:00:10.290> thousand<00:00:10.740> down<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.429> about<00:00:11.610> thirteen

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
from 37 thousand down to about thirteen

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.340 
from 37 thousand down to about thirteen
thousand<00:00:12.780> before<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.710> first<00:00:13.980> one<00:00:14.250> did<00:00:15.350> ignite

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
thousand before the first one did ignite

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.929 
thousand before the first one did ignite
and<00:00:17.100> it<00:00:17.220> wound<00:00:18.060> up<00:00:18.390> very<00:00:19.230> very<00:00:19.380> slowly<00:00:19.830> just<00:00:20.310> as

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
and it wound up very very slowly just as

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.779 
and it wound up very very slowly just as
it<00:00:21.119> had<00:00:21.270> wound<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.779> all<00:00:21.960> for<00:00:22.289> wound<00:00:23.039> down<00:00:23.369> very

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
it had wound and all for wound down very

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.349 
it had wound and all for wound down very
slowly<00:00:24.890> as<00:00:25.890> they<00:00:26.070> were<00:00:26.220> choked<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.760> suppose<00:00:27.119> by

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
slowly as they were choked I suppose by

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.679 
slowly as they were choked I suppose by
the<00:00:27.420> ash<00:00:27.660> but<00:00:28.080> number<00:00:29.010> four<00:00:29.250> wound<00:00:29.880> up<00:00:30.210> very

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
the ash but number four wound up very

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.020 
the ash but number four wound up very
slowly<00:00:31.019> as<00:00:31.320> did<00:00:31.560> number<00:00:31.740> three<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.759> came

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
slowly as did number three that came

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.610 
slowly as did number three that came
back<00:00:33.239> about<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.540> minute<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:33.989> thirty<00:00:34.260> minute

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
back about a minute and thirty minute

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.200 
back about a minute and thirty minute
and<00:00:34.710> forty<00:00:34.950> seconds<00:00:35.280> after<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> first<00:00:35.969> one

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
and forty seconds after the first one

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.600 
and forty seconds after the first one
but<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.230> two<00:00:37.440> when<00:00:37.739> they<00:00:37.920> came<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.370> thirty

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
but one and two when they came in thirty

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.880 
but one and two when they came in thirty
seconds<00:00:39.030> later<00:00:39.180> they<00:00:40.170> came<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.680> with<00:00:40.829> a

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
seconds later they came in with a

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.580 
seconds later they came in with a
gigantic<00:00:41.460> roar<00:00:41.910> once<00:00:42.690> they<00:00:43.050> came<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.530> it

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
gigantic roar once they came in and it

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.080 
gigantic roar once they came in and it
was<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:44.100> was<00:00:44.219> more<00:00:44.399> like<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> simulator

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
was that was more like the simulator

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.760 
was that was more like the simulator
while<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.899> were<00:00:45.989> trying<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.320> start<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
while you were trying to start the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.590 
while you were trying to start the
engines<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.219> back<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:48.120> folks<00:00:48.450> were

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
engines in the back the folks were

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.840 
engines in the back the folks were
seeing<00:00:48.870> great<00:00:49.110> sheets<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.649> flame<00:00:49.860> they<00:00:50.250> yeah

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
seeing great sheets of flame they yeah

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.630 
seeing great sheets of flame they yeah
must<00:00:51.300> have<00:00:51.449> been<00:00:51.980> terrified<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.250> would<00:00:53.550> have

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
must have been terrified I would have

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.520 
must have been terrified I would have
been<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.030> mean<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.750> think<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.350> they

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
been I mean I I just think that they

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.930 
been I mean I I just think that they
must<00:00:55.739> have<00:00:55.890> been<00:00:55.980> absolutely<00:00:56.340> petrified

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
must have been absolutely petrified

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.360 
must have been absolutely petrified
because<00:00:57.379> the<00:00:58.379> first<00:00:58.590> class<00:00:58.770> passengers<00:00:59.219> knew

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
because the first class passengers knew

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.130 
because the first class passengers knew
very<00:00:59.520> little<00:00:59.609> about<00:00:59.910> it<00:00:59.969> they<00:01:00.270> were<00:01:00.329> mostly

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
very little about it they were mostly

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.680 
very little about it they were mostly
asleep<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.309> club<00:01:02.550> class<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.180> blinds<00:01:03.449> were

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
asleep in the club class the blinds were

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.310 
asleep in the club class the blinds were
down<00:01:03.870> they'd<00:01:04.110> finished<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> meal<00:01:04.739> they<00:01:05.489> were

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
down they'd finished the meal they were

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.660 
down they'd finished the meal they were
rested<00:01:07.320> well<00:01:07.590> some<00:01:08.070> were<00:01:08.189> resting<00:01:08.549> and

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
rested well some were resting and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.280 
rested well some were resting and
somewhere<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.479> know<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.840> putting<00:01:10.170> things

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
somewhere you know just putting things

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.530 
somewhere you know just putting things
away<00:01:10.470> but<00:01:11.130> down<00:01:11.430> at<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.640> back<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.240> think<00:01:12.270> there

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
away but down at the back I think there

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.190 
away but down at the back I think there
are<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> hundred<00:01:12.930> or<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.920> these<00:01:15.200> antibody

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
are a hundred or so of these antibody

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.140 
are a hundred or so of these antibody
antibody<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.040> passengers<00:01:17.520> had<00:01:17.640> got<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:17.820> in

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
antibody and passengers had got on in

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.760 
antibody and passengers had got on in
kuala<00:01:18.479> lumper<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:18.930> out<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.259> Perth<00:01:19.500> and

the back at all and some of the fuel we

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.289 
the back at all and some of the fuel we
were<00:01:28.560> putting<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.040> engine<00:01:29.430> or<00:01:29.640> maybe<00:01:30.180> all

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
were putting in the engine or maybe all

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.520 
were putting in the engine or maybe all
of<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.540> were<00:01:30.659> putting<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:30.960> engines<00:01:31.259> that

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
of you were putting in engines that

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.550 
of you were putting in engines that
wasn't<00:01:31.950> igniting<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.820> engine<00:01:33.290> but<00:01:34.290> for

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
wasn't igniting in the engine but for

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.160 
wasn't igniting in the engine but for
some<00:01:34.770> reason<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.150> didn't<00:01:36.570> know<00:01:36.689> why<00:01:36.900> it

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
some reason and we didn't know why it

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.050 
some reason and we didn't know why it
was<00:01:37.619> apparently<00:01:38.130> shooting<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.729> back<00:01:39.000> of

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
was apparently shooting out the back of

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.760 
was apparently shooting out the back of
the<00:01:39.329> engines<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.840> we<00:01:39.900> had<00:01:40.020> four<00:01:40.290> engines<00:01:40.680> that

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the engines and we had four engines that

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.370 
the engines and we had four engines that
look<00:01:40.950> like<00:01:41.100> blow<00:01:41.790> torches<00:01:42.270> now<00:01:42.659> if<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.290> were

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
look like blow torches now if you were

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.109 
look like blow torches now if you were
sat<00:01:43.619> down<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.950> back<00:01:44.130> behind<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.579> engine<00:01:44.939> and

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
sat down the back behind the engine and

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.210 
sat down the back behind the engine and
this<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.960> must<00:01:46.200> thought<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.890> all<00:01:47.009> four

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
this it must thought that all four

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.370 
this it must thought that all four
engines<00:01:47.340> were<00:01:47.640> all<00:01:47.729> fire<00:01:48.030> obviously<00:01:48.630> when<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
engines were all fire obviously when the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.679 
engines were all fire obviously when the
engines<00:01:49.950> came<00:01:50.159> back<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.490> knew<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
engines came back you knew that you the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.740 
engines came back you knew that you the
equation<00:01:52.380> had<00:01:52.500> moved<00:01:52.890> back<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.790> being<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.119> your

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
equation had moved back to being in your

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
equation had moved back to being in your
favor<00:01:55.020> once<00:01:55.860> we<00:01:56.100> got<00:01:56.280> one<00:01:56.549> going<00:01:56.850> I

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
favor once we got one going I

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.020 
favor once we got one going I
I<00:01:58.770> knew<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> weight<00:01:59.490> we<00:01:59.700> were<00:01:59.759> over<00:02:00.000> at

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
I knew the weight we were over at

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.910 
I knew the weight we were over at
maximum<00:02:00.540> landing<00:02:00.719> weight<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.530> guess

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
maximum landing weight and I guess

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.530 
maximum landing weight and I guess
because<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.460> don't<00:02:03.030> commit<00:02:03.329> all<00:02:03.509> these

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
because you don't commit all these

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.679 
because you don't commit all these
figures<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.159> memory<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.729> guess<00:02:06.180> we<00:02:06.540> could

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
figures to memory but I guess we could

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.839 
figures to memory but I guess we could
level<00:02:07.020> off<00:02:07.140> at<00:02:07.290> 8,000<00:02:07.920> feet<00:02:07.950> as<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.489> happens<00:02:08.729> I

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
level off at 8,000 feet as it happens I

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.600 
level off at 8,000 feet as it happens I
was<00:02:08.970> about<00:02:09.239> right<00:02:09.569> now<00:02:10.440> 8,000<00:02:11.280> feet<00:02:11.400> would

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
was about right now 8,000 feet would

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.490 
was about right now 8,000 feet would
have<00:02:11.700> been<00:02:11.790> wonderful<00:02:12.300> with<00:02:12.390> one<00:02:12.599> engine

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
have been wonderful with one engine

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.350 
have been wonderful with one engine
one<00:02:13.860> thing<00:02:14.040> we<00:02:14.160> couldn't<00:02:14.520> have<00:02:14.670> done<00:02:14.850> was<00:02:15.210> to

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
one thing we couldn't have done was to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.240 
one thing we couldn't have done was to
got<00:02:15.600> back<00:02:15.810> into<00:02:16.020> Jakarta<00:02:16.650> without<00:02:16.950> going

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
got back into Jakarta without going

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.730 
got back into Jakarta without going
round<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.940> island<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.570> rounded<00:02:19.050> North<00:02:19.350> past

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
round the island that rounded North past

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.480 
round the island that rounded North past
Krakatoa

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
Krakatoa

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.790 
Krakatoa
or<00:02:20.640> going<00:02:21.360> further<00:02:21.750> south<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.380> looking<00:02:22.650> for

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
or going further south and looking for

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.980 
or going further south and looking for
another<00:02:22.950> runway<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.210> was<00:02:24.330> our<00:02:24.540> option

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
another runway so that was our option

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.170 
another runway so that was our option
once<00:02:25.170> we<00:02:25.350> had<00:02:25.500> one<00:02:25.680> engine<00:02:25.860> going<00:02:26.280> we<00:02:26.610> knew<00:02:26.910> we

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
once we had one engine going we knew we

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.540 
once we had one engine going we knew we
weren't<00:02:27.390> we<00:02:28.020> were<00:02:28.140> in<00:02:28.260> with<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.440> chance<00:02:28.770> and

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
weren't we were in with a chance and

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.420 
weren't we were in with a chance and
obviously<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.390> other<00:02:30.420> three<00:02:31.230> came<00:02:31.590> in<00:02:31.830> not

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
obviously the other three came in not

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.520 
obviously the other three came in not
long<00:02:32.640> after<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.150> with<00:02:33.630> two<00:02:33.840> engines<00:02:34.170> going

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
long after that with two engines going

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.050 
long after that with two engines going
where<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:34.980> knew<00:02:35.190> we<00:02:35.310> could<00:02:35.459> level<00:02:35.730> at<00:02:35.820> about

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
where I knew we could level at about

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.090 
where I knew we could level at about
twelve<00:02:36.390> thousand<00:02:36.870> feet<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.860> course

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
twelve thousand feet and of course

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.830 
twelve thousand feet and of course
that's<00:02:38.400> exactly<00:02:38.580> what<00:02:39.150> we<00:02:39.270> were<00:02:39.390> going<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.690> do

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
that's exactly what we were going to do

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.960 
that's exactly what we were going to do
so<00:02:40.050> once<00:02:40.230> we<00:02:40.410> went<00:02:40.650> through<00:02:40.830> 30,000<00:02:41.430> feet<00:02:41.550> one

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
so once we went through 30,000 feet one

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.490 
so once we went through 30,000 feet one
engine<00:02:42.300> started<00:02:42.690> up<00:02:42.810> we<00:02:42.959> were<00:02:43.050> able<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.290> kill

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
engine started up we were able to kill

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.620 
engine started up we were able to kill
the<00:02:43.650> descent<00:02:44.010> slightly<00:02:44.490> and<00:02:44.910> after<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.420> it

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
the descent slightly and after that it

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.850 
the descent slightly and after that it
all<00:02:45.780> became<00:02:46.430> yeah<00:02:47.430> we<00:02:47.790> knew<00:02:48.510> as<00:02:49.290> time<00:02:49.620> went<00:02:49.770> on

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
all became yeah we knew as time went on

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.979 
all became yeah we knew as time went on
we<00:02:49.920> had<00:02:50.160> more<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.400> more<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:50.880> chance<00:02:51.180> as<00:02:51.480> long

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
we had more and more of a chance as long

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.840 
we had more and more of a chance as long
as<00:02:52.140> they<00:02:52.290> kept<00:02:52.530> going<00:02:52.739> because<00:02:53.400> we<00:02:53.550> didn't

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
as they kept going because we didn't

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.250 
as they kept going because we didn't
know<00:02:53.910> why<00:02:54.090> they<00:02:54.270> stopped<00:02:54.570> in<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.780> first<00:02:55.020> place

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
know why they stopped in the first place

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.710 
know why they stopped in the first place
and<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.920> was<00:02:56.040> quite<00:02:56.310> sudden<00:02:56.670> really<00:02:57.209> although

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
and it was quite sudden really although

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.780 
and it was quite sudden really although
they<00:02:58.020> went<00:02:58.260> down<00:02:58.470> slowly<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.489> we<00:02:59.670> were

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
they went down slowly and we were

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.900 
they went down slowly and we were
worried<00:03:00.209> that<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:01.350> might<00:03:01.560> happen<00:03:01.770> again<00:03:02.070> so

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
worried that it might happen again so

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.610 
worried that it might happen again so
you<00:03:02.970> had<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.239> baby<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.720> engines<00:03:04.050> did<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.410> oh

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
you had to baby the engines did you oh

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.570 
you had to baby the engines did you oh
yeah<00:03:05.340> once<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.300> what<00:03:06.810> happened<00:03:07.140> was<00:03:07.290> we<00:03:07.580> we

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
yeah once and what happened was we we

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.979 
yeah once and what happened was we we
leveled<00:03:08.910> off<00:03:08.940> at<00:03:09.090> twelve<00:03:09.330> hours<00:03:09.570> of<00:03:09.690> eat<00:03:09.840> my

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
leveled off at twelve hours of eat my

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.690 
leveled off at twelve hours of eat my
head<00:03:10.110> off<00:03:10.230> well<00:03:10.950> we<00:03:11.040> had<00:03:11.190> all<00:03:11.310> four<00:03:11.520> engines

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
head off well we had all four engines

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.729 
head off well we had all four engines
going<00:03:12.209> we<00:03:12.450> could<00:03:12.600> talk<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:12.930> Jakarta<00:03:13.380> control

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
going we could talk to Jakarta control

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.620 
going we could talk to Jakarta control
again<00:03:14.040> quite<00:03:14.280> clearly<00:03:14.550> on<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.820> radio<00:03:15.120> and

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
again quite clearly on the radio and

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.870 
again quite clearly on the radio and
they<00:03:15.840> asked<00:03:16.200> us<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.320> climb<00:03:16.680> back<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:17.070> 15,000

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
they asked us to climb back to 15,000

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.390 
they asked us to climb back to 15,000
feet<00:03:17.910> because<00:03:18.450> there<00:03:19.019> was<00:03:19.110> these<00:03:19.830> mountains

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
feet because there was these mountains

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.449 
feet because there was these mountains
along<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.970> west<00:03:21.600> coast<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:22.080> Java<00:03:22.350> which<00:03:23.250> we

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
along the west coast of Java which we

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.160 
along the west coast of Java which we
did<00:03:23.670> we<00:03:23.910> climbed<00:03:24.150> up<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.420> 15,000<00:03:25.019> feet<00:03:25.080> and

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
did we climbed up to 15,000 feet and

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.840 
did we climbed up to 15,000 feet and
when<00:03:25.350> we<00:03:25.470> got<00:03:25.650> back<00:03:25.799> to<00:03:25.860> 15,000<00:03:26.549> feet<00:03:26.640> listen

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
when we got back to 15,000 feet listen

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.130 
when we got back to 15,000 feet listen
Elmo's<00:03:27.299> fire<00:03:27.600> started<00:03:28.380> up<00:03:28.500> again<00:03:28.650> oh<00:03:29.070> yeah<00:03:29.340> and

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
Elmo's fire started up again oh yeah and

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.930 
Elmo's fire started up again oh yeah and
I'm<00:03:31.140> not<00:03:31.350> slow<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.709> thought<00:03:32.160> well<00:03:32.430> what<00:03:32.640> this<00:03:32.760> is

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
I'm not slow I thought well what this is

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.600 
I'm not slow I thought well what this is
not<00:03:33.120> good<00:03:33.450> let's<00:03:34.320> get<00:03:34.590> out<00:03:34.739> of<00:03:34.769> it<00:03:35.010> quickly<00:03:35.280> and

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
not good let's get out of it quickly and

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.280 
not good let's get out of it quickly and
I<00:03:35.700> pulled<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.030> flash<00:03:36.299> levers<00:03:36.690> back<00:03:36.870> to

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
I pulled the flash levers back to

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.400 
I pulled the flash levers back to
descend<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.459> as<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:38.940> did<00:03:39.209> number<00:03:39.840> two<00:03:40.200> engine

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
descend and as I did number two engine

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.370 
descend and as I did number two engine
began<00:03:40.799> to<00:03:41.100> backfire<00:03:41.580> or<00:03:41.640> surge<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:43.019> this<00:03:43.170> big

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
began to backfire or surge and this big

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.190 
began to backfire or surge and this big
sheet<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.680> flame<00:03:43.980> shoots<00:03:44.760> up<00:03:44.970> past<00:03:45.269> my<00:03:45.570> right

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
sheet of flame shoots up past my right

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.280 
sheet of flame shoots up past my right
ear<00:03:46.230> forward<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.360> there<00:03:48.360> was<00:03:48.450> a<00:03:48.480> problem<00:03:49.019> with

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
ear forward and there was a problem with

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.770 
ear forward and there was a problem with
it<00:03:49.500> but<00:03:49.709> boom<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.250> was<00:03:50.370> going<00:03:50.700> boom<00:03:51.150> when<00:03:51.690> the

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
it but boom it was going boom when the

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.350 
it but boom it was going boom when the
airplane<00:03:52.140> began<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:53.100> shake<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.820> vibrate

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
airplane began to to shake and vibrate

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.930 
airplane began to to shake and vibrate
and<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.230> have<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.650> say<00:03:55.799> I<00:03:55.829> thought<00:03:56.280> at<00:03:56.489> one<00:03:56.640> stage

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
and I have to say I thought at one stage

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.690 
and I have to say I thought at one stage
it<00:03:57.209> was<00:03:57.299> such<00:03:57.600> that<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.290> engine<00:03:59.280> might<00:03:59.459> shake

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
it was such that the engine might shake

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.610 
it was such that the engine might shake
itself<00:04:00.060> off<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.360> wing<00:04:00.540> is<00:04:00.930> there<00:04:01.110> any<00:04:01.230> held<00:04:01.440> on

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
itself off the wing is there any held on

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.380 
itself off the wing is there any held on
by<00:04:01.799> a<00:04:01.829> couple<00:04:02.070> of<00:04:02.190> bolts<00:04:02.430> something<00:04:02.850> yes<00:04:03.150> yeah

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
by a couple of bolts something yes yeah

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.240 
by a couple of bolts something yes yeah
and<00:04:03.720> when<00:04:03.989> you've<00:04:04.110> had<00:04:04.200> four<00:04:04.470> engines<00:04:04.890> going

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
and when you've had four engines going

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.460 
and when you've had four engines going
no<00:04:05.430> engines<00:04:05.820> going<00:04:06.090> you're<00:04:06.239> very<00:04:06.870> reluctant

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
no engines going you're very reluctant

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.170 
no engines going you're very reluctant
to<00:04:07.590> shut<00:04:07.829> down<00:04:07.860> an<00:04:08.370> engine<00:04:08.670> I<00:04:08.790> tell<00:04:09.030> you

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
to shut down an engine I tell you

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.080 
to shut down an engine I tell you
however<00:04:09.720> we<00:04:09.989> had<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:10.530> so<00:04:11.190> we're<00:04:11.370> back<00:04:11.549> on<00:04:11.790> three

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
however we had to so we're back on three

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.960 
however we had to so we're back on three
engines<00:04:12.480> then<00:04:12.750> once<00:04:13.049> we'd<00:04:13.260> had<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:13.970> at

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
engines then once we'd had that at

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.930 
engines then once we'd had that at
search<00:04:15.360> I<00:04:15.630> persuaded<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.709> other<00:04:16.739> two<00:04:17.190> -<00:04:17.459> just

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
search I persuaded the other two - just

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.460 
search I persuaded the other two - just
to<00:04:18.060> gingerly<00:04:18.479> open<00:04:18.870> up<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.109> other<00:04:19.229> three

set<00:04:22.080> on<00:04:22.229> a<00:04:22.260> decent<00:04:22.590> power<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:23.789> we<00:04:23.910> were<00:04:24.030> going

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
set on a decent power and we were going

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.840 
set on a decent power and we were going
to<00:04:24.300> fight<00:04:24.510> that<00:04:25.110> power<00:04:25.530> with

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
to fight that power with

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.249 
to fight that power with
with<00:04:27.330> drag<00:04:27.630> we're<00:04:27.870> going<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.050> put<00:04:28.169> the

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:28.259 
with drag we're going to put the

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:29.809 
with drag we're going to put the
undercarriage<00:04:28.590> down<00:04:28.860> earlier<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.370> flaps<00:04:29.639> out

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:29.819 
undercarriage down earlier the flaps out

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:31.850 
undercarriage down earlier the flaps out
use<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:30.240> speed<00:04:30.509> brakes<00:04:30.750> to<00:04:31.199> slow<00:04:31.350> us<00:04:31.530> down<00:04:31.560> and

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
use the speed brakes to slow us down and

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.050 
use the speed brakes to slow us down and
get<00:04:32.009> a<00:04:32.039> stand<00:04:32.340> then<00:04:32.580> we<00:04:32.669> wouldn't<00:04:32.850> have<00:04:33.000> to

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
get a stand then we wouldn't have to

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.939 
get a stand then we wouldn't have to
touch<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.389> engines<00:04:33.750> right<00:04:34.080> because<00:04:34.830> I'd

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
touch the engines right because I'd

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.309 
touch the engines right because I'd
realized<00:04:35.250> they<00:04:35.340> were<00:04:35.400> unstable<00:04:35.960> now<00:04:36.960> when<00:04:37.199> we

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
realized they were unstable now when we

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.460 
realized they were unstable now when we
turn<00:04:37.560> back<00:04:37.620> in<00:04:38.160> we<00:04:38.910> were<00:04:39.120> given<00:04:39.690> a<00:04:39.750> radar<00:04:40.139> steer

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
turn back in we were given a radar steer

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.659 
turn back in we were given a radar steer
from<00:04:40.710> over<00:04:40.949> at<00:04:41.039> the<00:04:41.190> airfield

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
from over at the airfield

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.719 
from over at the airfield
outbound<00:04:42.090> descending<00:04:42.900> we<00:04:43.410> turn<00:04:43.770> back<00:04:43.800> in<00:04:44.340> and

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
outbound descending we turn back in and

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.939 
outbound descending we turn back in and
we'll<00:04:44.970> coming<00:04:45.270> in<00:04:45.419> towards<00:04:45.900> Jakarta<00:04:46.620> towards

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
we'll coming in towards Jakarta towards

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:48.230 
we'll coming in towards Jakarta towards
the<00:04:47.039> city<00:04:47.220> to<00:04:47.430> cart<00:04:47.639> at<00:04:47.849> two<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:48.120> a<00:04:48.150> half

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
the city to cart at two and a half

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.050 
the city to cart at two and a half
thousand<00:04:48.750> feet<00:04:48.780> to<00:04:49.650> turn<00:04:49.889> left<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.819> do<00:04:51.030> a

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
thousand feet to turn left to do a

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.629 
thousand feet to turn left to do a
landing<00:04:51.599> we'd<00:04:52.319> been<00:04:52.590> in<00:04:52.620> Jakarta<00:04:53.370> three<00:04:53.550> or

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
landing we'd been in Jakarta three or

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.370 
landing we'd been in Jakarta three or
four<00:04:53.789> days<00:04:53.970> before<00:04:54.210> so<00:04:54.720> we<00:04:54.840> thought<00:04:55.050> we<00:04:55.199> knew

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
four days before so we thought we knew

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.960 
four days before so we thought we knew
where<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.710> airfield<00:04:55.860> was<00:04:56.220> in<00:04:56.490> relation<00:04:56.940> to

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
where the airfield was in relation to

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.270 
where the airfield was in relation to
the<00:04:57.210> city<00:04:57.449> and<00:04:58.050> it<00:04:58.169> wasn't<00:04:58.380> there<00:04:58.860> we<00:04:59.070> couldn't

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
the city and it wasn't there we couldn't

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.029 
the city and it wasn't there we couldn't
see<00:04:59.610> it<00:04:59.729> was<00:04:59.849> a<00:04:59.880> big<00:05:00.180> black<00:05:00.389> patch<00:05:00.690> so<00:05:01.650> I<00:05:01.680> said

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
see it was a big black patch so I said

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.310 
see it was a big black patch so I said
to<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.310> first<00:05:02.550> officer<00:05:03.120> er<00:05:03.180> ask<00:05:03.960> them<00:05:04.229> if

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
they've got their runway lights on and

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.300 
they've got their runway lights on and
they<00:05:06.630> said<00:05:06.690> all<00:05:06.960> sorry<00:05:07.380> and<00:05:07.889> they<00:05:08.039> put<00:05:08.220> the

lights<00:05:08.490> on<00:05:08.699> the<00:05:09.180> airfield<00:05:09.479> now<00:05:09.690> so<00:05:09.840> that<00:05:09.960> made

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
lights on the airfield now so that made

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.469 
lights on the airfield now so that made
it<00:05:10.169> a<00:05:10.320> lot<00:05:10.440> easier<00:05:10.500> yes<00:05:11.340> and<00:05:11.759> then<00:05:12.000> they<00:05:12.210> said

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
it a lot easier yes and then they said

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.570 
it a lot easier yes and then they said
we're<00:05:13.169> clear<00:05:13.410> to<00:05:13.590> land<00:05:13.740> on<00:05:14.009> their<00:05:14.160> instrument

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
we're clear to land on their instrument

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.270 
we're clear to land on their instrument

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
landing system that we were going to use

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.040 
landing system that we were going to use
wasn't<00:05:20.280> working<00:05:20.759> I<00:05:20.940> could<00:05:21.300> find<00:05:21.539> the<00:05:21.659> center

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
wasn't working I could find the center

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.360 
wasn't working I could find the center
line<00:05:22.199> of<00:05:22.229> the<00:05:22.409> runway<00:05:22.560> using<00:05:23.130> their

path<00:05:26.159> from<00:05:26.430> information<00:05:27.360> now<00:05:28.289> that<00:05:28.319> doesn't

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
path from information now that doesn't

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.350

matter oh you got eyes and you can judge

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.810 
matter oh you got eyes and you can judge
it<00:05:30.590> however<00:05:31.590> as<00:05:31.860> we<00:05:32.039> were<00:05:32.130> getting<00:05:32.400> closer<00:05:32.699> and

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
it however as we were getting closer and

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.029 
it however as we were getting closer and
closer<00:05:33.120> to<00:05:33.360> the<00:05:33.419> lights<00:05:33.599> Jakarta<00:05:34.320> it<00:05:34.770> seemed

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
closer to the lights Jakarta it seemed

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.610 
closer to the lights Jakarta it seemed
to<00:05:35.130> be<00:05:35.190> very<00:05:35.250> foggy<00:05:35.940> over<00:05:36.509> the<00:05:36.659> top<00:05:36.870> of<00:05:37.080> Jakarta

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
to be very foggy over the top of Jakarta

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.260 
to be very foggy over the top of Jakarta
so<00:05:38.039> when<00:05:38.220> we<00:05:38.340> asked<00:05:38.490> the<00:05:38.669> visibilities<00:05:39.240> and

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
so when we asked the visibilities and

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.540 
so when we asked the visibilities and
then<00:05:39.509> no<00:05:39.630> it's<00:05:39.750> unlimited<00:05:40.130> and<00:05:41.130> I<00:05:41.280> see<00:05:41.430> what

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
then no it's unlimited and I see what

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.480 
then no it's unlimited and I see what
it's<00:05:41.669> not<00:05:41.759> up<00:05:41.969> here<00:05:42.620> we<00:05:43.620> can't<00:05:43.949> see<00:05:44.190> very<00:05:44.219> far

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
it's not up here we can't see very far

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.600 
it's not up here we can't see very far
and<00:05:44.940> we<00:05:45.060> I<00:05:45.389> sort<00:05:45.900> of<00:05:45.960> leant<00:05:46.199> across<00:05:46.370> and<00:05:47.370> looked

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
and we I sort of leant across and looked

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.820 
and we I sort of leant across and looked
at<00:05:47.820> the<00:05:47.969> edge<00:05:48.240> the<00:05:48.690> apron<00:05:49.050> extreme<00:05:49.469> edge<00:05:49.620> of

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
at the edge the apron extreme edge of

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.980 
at the edge the apron extreme edge of
the<00:05:49.949> windscreen<00:05:50.280> and<00:05:50.759> I<00:05:51.030> had<00:05:51.210> about<00:05:51.479> two<00:05:51.810> inch

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
the windscreen and I had about two inch

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.080 
the windscreen and I had about two inch
which<00:05:52.469> is<00:05:52.590> that<00:05:52.830> when<00:05:52.979> I<00:05:53.009> could<00:05:53.310> see<00:05:53.520> much

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
which is that when I could see much

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.060 
which is that when I could see much
better<00:05:54.419> out<00:05:54.810> I<00:05:54.840> mean<00:05:55.320> I<00:05:55.409> could<00:05:55.560> see<00:05:55.770> and

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
better out I mean I could see and

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.360 
better out I mean I could see and
something<00:05:56.430> obviously<00:05:57.060> had<00:05:57.449> made<00:05:57.719> the

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
something obviously had made the

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.050 
something obviously had made the
windscreen<00:05:59.370> you've<00:05:59.490> had<00:05:59.639> it<00:05:59.759> was<00:05:59.909> almost

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
windscreen you've had it was almost

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.659 
windscreen you've had it was almost
opaque<00:06:00.570> I<00:06:00.960> needed<00:06:01.560> to<00:06:01.680> see<00:06:01.860> to<00:06:02.250> judge<00:06:02.460> the

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
opaque I needed to see to judge the

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:04.219 
opaque I needed to see to judge the
approach<00:06:03.030> and<00:06:03.330> I<00:06:03.389> could<00:06:03.539> only<00:06:03.630> see<00:06:03.900> that<00:06:04.020> this

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229 
approach and I could only see that this

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.379 
approach and I could only see that this
two-inch<00:06:04.650> strip<00:06:04.949> and<00:06:05.370> it<00:06:05.580> was<00:06:05.699> similar<00:06:06.060> on<00:06:06.330> the

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
two-inch strip and it was similar on the

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.800 
two-inch strip and it was similar on the
other<00:06:06.990> side<00:06:07.289> of<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:08.370> the<00:06:09.030> copilot<00:06:09.509> I<00:06:09.570> think<00:06:09.750> in

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
other side of the the copilot I think in

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.450 
other side of the the copilot I think in
fact<00:06:09.990> he<00:06:10.110> could<00:06:10.229> see<00:06:10.469> that<00:06:10.620> a<00:06:10.680> less<00:06:11.009> than<00:06:11.039> his

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
fact he could see that a less than his

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.300 
fact he could see that a less than his
side<00:06:11.699> but<00:06:11.880> anyway<00:06:12.409> there<00:06:13.409> we<00:06:13.530> were<00:06:13.710> we<00:06:13.949> had<00:06:14.099> to

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
side but anyway there we were we had to

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.180 
side but anyway there we were we had to
see<00:06:14.699> out<00:06:15.030> to<00:06:15.389> let<00:06:15.599> to<00:06:16.199> judge<00:06:16.409> the<00:06:16.560> approach<00:06:16.860> and

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
see out to let to judge the approach and

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.459 
see out to let to judge the approach and
I<00:06:17.550> was<00:06:18.000> going<00:06:18.120> to<00:06:18.180> have<00:06:18.300> to<00:06:18.419> ease<00:06:18.810> my<00:06:19.110> bottom

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:19.469 
I was going to have to ease my bottom

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:21.890 
I was going to have to ease my bottom
across<00:06:19.770> the<00:06:19.979> seat<00:06:20.250> sit<00:06:20.550> on<00:06:20.699> one<00:06:20.909> cheek<00:06:21.240> because

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
across the seat sit on one cheek because

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.390 
across the seat sit on one cheek because
I<00:06:22.020> needed<00:06:22.380> to<00:06:22.500> have<00:06:22.650> my<00:06:22.860> feet<00:06:23.039> on<00:06:23.190> the<00:06:23.219> rudder

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
I needed to have my feet on the rudder

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.399 
I needed to have my feet on the rudder
pedals<00:06:23.550> being<00:06:24.090> a<00:06:24.150> 3<00:06:24.360> engine<00:06:24.630> approached<00:06:24.960> yes

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409 
pedals being a 3 engine approached yes

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:28.640 
pedals being a 3 engine approached yes
and<00:06:25.729> we<00:06:26.729> as<00:06:27.120> a<00:06:27.180> team<00:06:27.599> and<00:06:28.050> it<00:06:28.229> was<00:06:28.259> a<00:06:28.380> wonderful

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
and we as a team and it was a wonderful

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.980 
and we as a team and it was a wonderful
team<00:06:29.070> effort<00:06:29.400> I<00:06:29.550> think<00:06:29.759> that<00:06:29.909> was<00:06:30.060> we<00:06:30.539> managed

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
team effort I think that was we managed

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.529 
team effort I think that was we managed
to<00:06:31.080> do<00:06:31.289> an<00:06:31.770> approach<00:06:32.190> and<00:06:32.490> get<00:06:33.030> to<00:06:33.270> the<00:06:33.389> right

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539 
to do an approach and get to the right

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:35.420 
to do an approach and get to the right
place<00:06:33.780> over<00:06:34.110> the<00:06:34.229> runway<00:06:34.500> when<00:06:34.650> I<00:06:34.710> sat<00:06:35.039> back<00:06:35.250> in

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.159 
place over the runway when I sat back in
the<00:06:35.520> seat<00:06:35.789> said<00:06:36.360> we're<00:06:36.510> not<00:06:36.599> going<00:06:36.750> to<00:06:36.839> die<00:06:36.990> now

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:37.169 
the seat said we're not going to die now

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:38.540
