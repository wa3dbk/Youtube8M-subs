notice<00:00:34.200> we're<00:00:34.380> using<00:00:34.530> about<00:00:34.860> an<00:00:35.040> excise<00:00:37.670> and

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
notice we're using about an excise and

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.639 
notice we're using about an excise and
we<00:00:38.790> spread<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.149> through<00:00:39.750> piece<00:00:40.350> by<00:00:40.620> piece

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
we spread that through piece by piece

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.209 
we spread that through piece by piece
and<00:00:41.480> then<00:00:42.480> very<00:00:42.690> important<00:00:43.290> comb<00:00:44.040> that

so what we're going to do is to use the
diffuser<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:49.309> lift<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.520> roots<00:00:50.760> with<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.690> comb

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
diffuser to lift the roots with the comb

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.990 
diffuser to lift the roots with the comb
with<00:00:52.500> our<00:00:52.649> hands<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.399> create<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.270> shape

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.610 

notice<00:01:00.000> I'm<00:01:00.149> keeping<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.660> diffuser<00:01:01.050> moving

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
notice I'm keeping the diffuser moving

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.189 
notice I'm keeping the diffuser moving
all<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.100> time<00:01:02.309> what<00:01:02.820> we're<00:01:02.969> trying<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.449> get<00:01:03.660> is

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
all the time what we're trying to get is

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.370 
all the time what we're trying to get is
an<00:01:04.439> even<00:01:05.070> drying<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> whole<00:01:06.299> head<00:01:06.689> when<00:01:07.259> we

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
an even drying of the whole head when we

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.280 
an even drying of the whole head when we
take<00:01:07.560> over<00:01:07.860> with<00:01:08.009> our<00:01:08.040> hands<00:01:08.790> we're<00:01:09.600> using<00:01:09.990> our

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
take over with our hands we're using our

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.710 
take over with our hands we're using our
hands<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.549> sensitive<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.149> how<00:01:12.390> dry<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
hands a to be sensitive to how dry the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.109 
hands a to be sensitive to how dry the
hair<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.020> becoming<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:14.070> also<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.460> shape<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.240 

so<00:01:26.130> before<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> attach<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.600> hair<00:01:27.810> with<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> brush

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
so before I attach the hair with a brush

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.830 
so before I attach the hair with a brush
I've<00:01:29.250> prepared<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:30.000> shape<00:01:30.210> I've<00:01:30.510> got<00:01:30.720> the

I've prepared the shape I've got the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.100 
I've prepared the shape I've got the
volume<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.290> want<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.880> hairs<00:01:33.120> evenly<00:01:33.840> dried

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
volume I want the hairs evenly dried

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.260 
volume I want the hairs evenly dried
it's<00:01:34.440> just<00:01:34.590> very<00:01:34.710> slightly<00:01:35.100> damp<00:01:35.430> all<00:01:35.670> true<00:01:35.970> I

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
parts that matter the most and that is

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.600 
parts that matter the most and that is
the<00:01:42.840> hairline<00:01:43.290> here<00:01:44.660> the<00:01:45.660> top<00:01:45.900> layer<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.610> the

the hairline here the top layer and the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.170 
the hairline here the top layer and the
tips<00:01:47.990> we're<00:01:48.990> going<00:01:49.230> to<00:01:49.380> use<00:01:49.740> five<00:01:50.430> sections<00:01:50.970> on

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
tips we're going to use five sections on

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.360 
tips we're going to use five sections on
the<00:01:51.300> front<00:01:51.570> one<00:01:52.380> two<00:01:53.070> three<00:01:53.910> four<00:01:54.570> five<00:01:55.370> so

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
the front one two three four five so

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.940 
the front one two three four five so
really<00:01:56.730> important<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.630> work<00:01:57.900> very<00:01:58.500> cleanly

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
really important to work very cleanly

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.640 
really important to work very cleanly
use<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.910> clip<00:02:00.330> to<00:02:00.360> take<00:02:00.900> away<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.350> hair<00:02:01.530> you're

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
use a clip to take away the hair you're

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.840 
use a clip to take away the hair you're
not<00:02:01.710> working<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:03.890> take<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> section<00:02:05.280> there's<00:02:05.700> no

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
not working on take a section there's no

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.449 
not working on take a section there's no

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
bigger than the width of the brush or

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.449 
bigger than the width of the brush or

the thickness of the brush and hold the
hair<00:02:11.670> high<00:02:12.350> so<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.500> can<00:02:13.650> get<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.920> brush

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
hair high so that you can get the brush

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.060 
hair high so that you can get the brush
underneath<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.240> have<00:02:16.200> control<00:02:16.650> on<00:02:16.890> those

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.059 

very<00:02:27.850> important<00:02:28.390> also<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.230> angle<00:02:30.010> of

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
very important also that the angle of

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.030 
very important also that the angle of

if<00:02:36.459> you're<00:02:36.670> going<00:02:36.850> across<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.569> hair<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:38.470> will

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
if you're going across the hair you will

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.340 
if you're going across the hair you will
blow<00:02:39.160> up<00:02:39.370> all<00:02:39.700> those<00:02:39.940> short<00:02:40.569> hairs<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.319> you
