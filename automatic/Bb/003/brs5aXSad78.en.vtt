it's<00:01:33.729> down<00:01:34.030> to<00:01:34.390> a<00:01:34.659> different<00:01:35.500> reason<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.759> not

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
it's down to a different reason and not

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.319 
it's down to a different reason and not
just<00:01:37.299> stress<00:01:37.960> and<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.520> majority<00:01:40.000> of<00:01:40.030> cases

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
just stress and in the majority of cases

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.060 
just stress and in the majority of cases
it<00:01:40.930> is<00:01:41.079> down<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.619> a<00:01:41.950> genetic<00:01:42.790> hair<00:01:43.240> loss<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.770> for
