is<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> great<00:00:20.789> family<00:00:21.150> game<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:22.050> we<00:00:22.800> picked<00:00:23.010> it

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
is a great family game and we picked it

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.890 
is a great family game and we picked it
up<00:00:23.189> years<00:00:23.580> ago<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.600> think<00:00:24.630> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
up years ago and this is I think the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.339 
up years ago and this is I think the
most<00:00:25.170> played<00:00:25.560> game<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.130> our<00:00:26.250> collection

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
most played game in our collection

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.259 
most played game in our collection
perhaps<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.470> think<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:29.099> think<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.179> is

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
perhaps you think so I think it is

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.479 
perhaps you think so I think it is
because<00:00:30.599> we<00:00:30.750> played<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.199> basically<00:00:32.130> every

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
because we played it basically every

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.250 
because we played it basically every
family<00:00:32.940> gathering<00:00:33.329> we<00:00:33.450> have<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
family gathering we have this is the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.600 
family gathering we have this is the
game<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:34.649> pull<00:00:34.829> out<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.160> reason<00:00:35.520> we

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
game that we pull out and the reason we

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.910 
game that we pull out and the reason we
do<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:36.000> because<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.540> one<00:00:36.750> can<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.469> played<00:00:37.739> by

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
do is because this one can be played by

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.069 
do is because this one can be played by
any<00:00:38.340> number<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.820> people<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.809> know<00:00:39.899> it

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
any number of people and you know it

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.560 
any number of people and you know it

to get one five-minute rule and the
corners<00:01:20.340> are<00:01:20.520> wild<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.299> those<00:01:21.479> don't<00:01:21.630> count<00:01:21.840> so

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
corners are wild so those don't count so

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.020 
corners are wild so those don't count so
if<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.200> go<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.350> angle<00:01:22.830> or<00:01:22.920> off<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.189> side<00:01:23.400> you

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
if you go to angle or off the side you

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.130 
if you go to angle or off the side you
just<00:01:24.210> get<00:01:24.330> these<00:01:24.450> four<00:01:24.720> arrow<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.110> that

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
just get these four arrow and that

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.630 
just get these four arrow and that
counts<00:01:25.500> as<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> fifth<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:26.040> for<00:01:26.220> any<00:01:26.400> color

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
counts as the fifth one for any color

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.480 
counts as the fifth one for any color
it's<00:01:27.420> great<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:28.049> did<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.530> other<00:01:28.650> cards

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
it's great so if we did the other cards

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.340 
it's great so if we did the other cards
so<00:01:30.060> let's<00:01:30.240> say<00:01:30.450> kala<00:01:30.720> but<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.930> are<00:01:31.079> playing

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
so let's say kala but I are playing

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.380 
so let's say kala but I are playing
against<00:01:31.860> each<00:01:31.950> other<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:33.090> he's<00:01:33.240> probably

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
against each other so he's probably

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.140 
against each other so he's probably
gonna<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.869> seven<00:01:34.530> cards<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:34.950> case<00:01:35.369> and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
gonna have seven cards in that case and

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.840 
gonna have seven cards in that case and
I'm<00:01:36.270> gonna<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.540> seven<00:01:36.900> cards<00:01:37.340> found<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.610> oh

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
I'm gonna have seven cards found it oh

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.300 
I'm gonna have seven cards found it oh
what'd<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.450> find<00:01:39.650> that<00:01:40.650> there<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.159> two

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
what'd you find that there can be two

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.350 
what'd you find that there can be two
three<00:01:42.210> four<00:01:42.630> six<00:01:43.200> eight<00:01:43.470> nine<00:01:44.040> ten<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.030> says

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
three four six eight nine ten so it says

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.240 
three four six eight nine ten so it says
you<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.630> up<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.899> ten<00:01:46.140> players<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.649> we

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
you can have up to ten players but we

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.730 
you can have up to ten players but we
don't<00:01:47.430> ever<00:01:47.549> get<00:01:47.700> limited<00:01:48.090> by<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.259> so<00:01:49.259> if

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
typically with the six of us we can

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.830 
typically with the six of us we can
choose<00:04:11.620> whether<00:04:11.860> we<00:04:11.980> want<00:04:12.070> to<00:04:12.310> split<00:04:13.030> three

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
choose whether we want to split three

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.260 
choose whether we want to split three
people<00:04:14.140> into<00:04:14.320> two<00:04:14.470> teams<00:04:14.680> or<00:04:14.950> two<00:04:15.850> people<00:04:16.150> into

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
three teams and go out that way but

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.590 
three teams and go out that way but
what's<00:04:18.760> really<00:04:18.880> trick<00:04:19.150> is<00:04:19.270> you<00:04:19.390> don't<00:04:19.539> know

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
what's really trick is you don't know

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.090 
what's really trick is you don't know
what<00:04:19.720> your<00:04:19.840> other<00:04:19.960> partner<00:04:20.770> is<00:04:20.830> going<00:04:20.950> to<00:04:21.010> be

what your other partner is going to be

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.950 
what your other partner is going to be
doing<00:04:21.280> or<00:04:21.940> in<00:04:22.240> this<00:04:22.330> case<00:04:22.570> it<00:04:22.750> was

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
doing or in this case it was

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.570 
doing or in this case it was
split<00:04:23.110> into<00:04:23.259> just<00:04:23.560> two<00:04:23.710> teams<00:04:23.949> I've<00:04:24.190> got<00:04:24.400> two

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580

split into just two teams I've got two
partners<00:04:25.000> and<00:04:25.630> so<00:04:25.750> everybody's<00:04:26.169> taking<00:04:26.470> their

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
partners and so everybody's taking their

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.110 
partners and so everybody's taking their
own<00:04:26.680> turn<00:04:26.919> we<00:04:27.100> don't<00:04:27.280> know<00:04:27.370> which<00:04:27.520> other<00:04:27.669> cards

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
own turn we don't know which other cards
