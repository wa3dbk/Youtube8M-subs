like this well there are a huge benefit
to<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:10.930> look<00:04:11.200> to<00:04:11.319> the<00:04:11.440> local<00:04:12.010> region<00:04:12.370> there's

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
to the look to the local region there's

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.089 
to the look to the local region there's
an<00:04:13.000> unprecedented<00:04:13.659> business<00:04:14.379> case<00:04:14.650> in<00:04:14.890> terms

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
an unprecedented business case in terms

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.009 
an unprecedented business case in terms
of<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.400> benefit<00:04:16.269> of<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.479> cost<00:04:16.720> of<00:04:16.900> the

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
of the benefit of the cost of the

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.650 
of the benefit of the cost of the
investment<00:04:17.139> and<00:04:17.769> it<00:04:18.310> connects<00:04:18.970> our<00:04:19.209> region

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
investment and it connects our region

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.680 
investment and it connects our region
into<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:20.199> major<00:04:20.919> national<00:04:21.729> electrified<00:04:22.240> rail

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
into the major national electrified rail

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.740 
into the major national electrified rail
network<00:04:23.110> so<00:04:23.710> I<00:04:24.039> think<00:04:24.460> that<00:04:24.760> the<00:04:25.120> investment

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
network so I think that the investment

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.740 
network so I think that the investment
is<00:04:25.840> really<00:04:26.050> justified<00:04:26.850> this<00:04:27.850> animation<00:04:28.270> gives

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
is really justified this animation gives

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.240 
is really justified this animation gives
an<00:04:28.930> impression<00:04:29.410> of<00:04:29.500> how<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.740> line<00:04:30.039> will

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
an impression of how the line will

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.670 
an impression of how the line will
change<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:31.360> key<00:04:31.510> benefit<00:04:31.990> will<00:04:32.169> be<00:04:32.260> boosting

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
change the key benefit will be boosting

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.740 
change the key benefit will be boosting
the<00:04:32.770> economy<00:04:32.860> by<00:04:33.669> tens<00:04:34.030> of<00:04:34.270> millions<00:04:34.630> of
