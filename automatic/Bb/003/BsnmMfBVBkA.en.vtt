00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
so oftentimes we're asked how do i

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.140 
so oftentimes we're asked how do i
flower<00:00:19.170> my<00:00:19.440> camellia<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.730> answer<00:00:21.000> is

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
flower my camellia and the answer is

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.090 
flower my camellia and the answer is
camellias<00:00:21.660> flower<00:00:21.930> by<00:00:22.170> themselves<00:00:22.770> it's<00:00:22.920> just

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
camellias flower by themselves it's just

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.460 
camellias flower by themselves it's just
the<00:00:23.220> gardener<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.700> needs<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.210> encourage<00:00:24.720> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
the gardener that needs to encourage the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.070 
the gardener that needs to encourage the
conditions<00:00:26.100> that<00:00:26.279> actually<00:00:26.640> help<00:00:27.450> induce<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
conditions that actually help induce the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.710 
conditions that actually help induce the
bloom<00:00:28.290> and<00:00:28.560> bring<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> bloom<00:00:29.400> into<00:00:29.610> flower<00:00:29.910> so

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
bloom and bring the bloom into flower so

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.330 
bloom and bring the bloom into flower so
here<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:30.990> have<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> young<00:00:31.500> plant<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.950> is<00:00:32.160> one

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
here we have a young plant this is one

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.500 
here we have a young plant this is one
that<00:00:32.520> has<00:00:32.579> been<00:00:32.640> grown<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.120> house<00:00:33.270> for

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
that has been grown in the house for

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.900 
that has been grown in the house for
many<00:00:33.660> years<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.710> been<00:00:34.890> restricted<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.820> its

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
many years it's been restricted in its

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.810 
many years it's been restricted in its
size<00:00:36.210> mainly<00:00:36.960> by<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.770> lack<00:00:37.980> or<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.640> lower

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
size mainly by the lack or the lower

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.720 
size mainly by the lack or the lower
levels<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.360> fertilizer<00:00:39.900> and<00:00:40.320> by<00:00:41.040> dryness

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
levels of fertilizer and by dryness

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.639 
levels of fertilizer and by dryness
-<00:00:41.850> that's<00:00:42.030> watering<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.380> see<00:00:43.530> we

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
- that's watering and you can see we

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.290 
- that's watering and you can see we
have<00:00:43.770> blooms<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.340> opened<00:00:44.640> up<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.120> is

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
have blooms that have opened up this is

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.180 
have blooms that have opened up this is
in<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> winter<00:00:45.780> time<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.290> here<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.070> in

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
in the winter time and here we have in

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.639 
in the winter time and here we have in
the<00:00:47.220> top<00:00:47.519> of<00:00:47.699> it<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.969> young<00:00:48.840> bud<00:00:49.079> that's<00:00:49.379> about

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the top of it a young bud that's about

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.229 
the top of it a young bud that's about
ready<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.129> open<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.609> probably<00:00:50.879> open<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
ready to open and probably open in the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.400 
ready to open and probably open in the
next<00:00:51.390> couple<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.930> weeks

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
next couple of weeks

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.819 
next couple of weeks
so<00:00:53.160> how<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> camellia<00:00:54.750> grows<00:00:55.019> is<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.410> puts<00:00:55.620> out<00:00:55.800> a

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
so how a camellia grows is it puts out a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.099 
so how a camellia grows is it puts out a
flush<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.280> new<00:00:56.460> growth<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.059> during<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
flush of new growth and during the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.049 
flush of new growth and during the
summer<00:00:58.320> time<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.769> growth<00:00:58.980> hardens<00:00:59.429> often<00:00:59.940> as

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
summer time that growth hardens often as

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.900 
summer time that growth hardens often as
we<00:01:00.269> go<00:01:00.449> into<00:01:00.769> mid<00:01:01.769> summer<00:01:02.070> sometime<00:01:02.879> just

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
we go into mid summer sometime just

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.690 
we go into mid summer sometime just
before<00:01:03.449> June<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.559> growth<00:01:04.980> starts<00:01:05.339> hardening

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
before June the growth starts hardening

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.570 
before June the growth starts hardening
off<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.360> plant<00:01:06.630> decides<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.530> flower<00:01:07.800> and<00:01:08.010> buds

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
off the plant decides to flower and buds

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.630 
off the plant decides to flower and buds
form<00:01:09.030> down<00:01:09.390> at<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.690> leaf<00:01:09.900> axis<00:01:10.500> although<00:01:10.980> you

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
form down at the leaf axis although you

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.180 
form down at the leaf axis although you
the<00:01:12.030> gardener<00:01:12.420> can't<00:01:12.660> see<00:01:12.960> them<00:01:13.200> then<00:01:13.800> as<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
the gardener can't see them then as the

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.040 
the gardener can't see them then as the
season<00:01:14.370> progresses<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.300> we<00:01:15.390> go<00:01:15.540> into<00:01:15.810> fall

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
season progresses and we go into fall

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.530 
season progresses and we go into fall
these<00:01:16.409> buds<00:01:16.650> begin<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.190> swell<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.300> all

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
these buds begin to swell and that all

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.590 
these buds begin to swell and that all
happens<00:01:19.200> under<00:01:20.070> normal<00:01:20.370> temperatures<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
happens under normal temperatures of the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.140 
happens under normal temperatures of the
summer<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:22.200> into<00:01:22.380> fall<00:01:22.800> as<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.880> get<00:01:24.030> into

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
summer going into fall as we get into

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.450 
summer going into fall as we get into
late<00:01:24.270> fall<00:01:24.780> temperatures<00:01:25.680> start<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.190> cool

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
late fall temperatures start to cool

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.450 
late fall temperatures start to cool
down<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:27.240> light<00:01:27.960> level<00:01:28.290> shortens<00:01:28.830> and<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
down the light level shortens and the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.880 
down the light level shortens and the
plants<00:01:30.000> get<00:01:30.150> triggered<00:01:30.600> into<00:01:30.780> yes<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.650> time

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
plants get triggered into yes it's time

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.030 
plants get triggered into yes it's time
for<00:01:32.510> blooming<00:01:33.510> and<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.260> big<00:01:34.410> buds<00:01:34.770> begin

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
for blooming and so the big buds begin

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.120 
for blooming and so the big buds begin
to<00:01:35.310> swell<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.940> swell<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.620> continues

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
to swell and swell and that continues

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.460 
to swell and swell and that continues
until<00:01:38.160> they<00:01:38.670> open<00:01:39.120> now<00:01:39.630> camellias<00:01:40.260> are

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
until they open now camellias are

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.710 
until they open now camellias are
classified<00:01:41.280> as<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.730> early<00:01:42.120> mid<00:01:42.360> or<00:01:42.570> late
