of<00:00:43.800> topspin<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.399> your<00:00:44.579> shots<00:00:45.440> the<00:00:46.440> power<00:00:46.680> level

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
of topspin on your shots the power level

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.270 
of topspin on your shots the power level
is<00:00:47.309> moderate<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.480> low<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> middle

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
is moderate to low so it's in the middle

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.580 
is moderate to low so it's in the middle
it<00:00:50.910> gives<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.300> probably<00:00:51.660> even<00:00:51.809> control<00:00:52.350> in

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
it gives you probably even control in

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.860 
it gives you probably even control in

material<00:01:14.820> they've<00:01:15.000> added<00:01:15.390> into<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.500> frame

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
material they've added into the frame

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.890 
material they've added into the frame
which<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.640> supposed<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.119> make<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> racket<00:01:18.869> a

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
which is supposed to make the racket a

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.890 
which is supposed to make the racket a
lot<00:01:19.080> more<00:01:19.229> stable<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.000> better<00:01:21.000> feel<00:01:21.299> let's

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
lot more stable and better feel let's

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.350 
lot more stable and better feel let's
see<00:01:22.049> how<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.229> did<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.500> court<00:01:22.890> yeah<00:01:23.820> well<00:01:24.119> this

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
see how I did on court yeah well this

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.130 
see how I did on court yeah well this
racket<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.990> pure<00:01:25.259> drive<00:01:25.970> 107<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.390> definitely

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
racket the pure drive 107 it definitely

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.170 
racket the pure drive 107 it definitely
helped<00:01:28.680> me<00:01:28.740> generate<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.610> little<00:01:29.850> bit<00:01:30.000> more

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
helped me generate a little bit more

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.640 
helped me generate a little bit more
topspin<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> little<00:01:31.229> bit<00:01:31.320> more<00:01:31.439> power

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
topspin and a little bit more power

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.010 
topspin and a little bit more power
around<00:01:31.890> my<00:01:32.040> shots<00:01:32.340> with<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> bigger<00:01:33.540> head<00:01:33.780> size

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
around my shots with a bigger head size

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.590 
around my shots with a bigger head size
in<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> bigger<00:01:34.500> sweet<00:01:34.860> spot<00:01:35.189> it's<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.329> tweener

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
in the bigger sweet spot it's a tweener

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.429 
in the bigger sweet spot it's a tweener
frame<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.950> helps<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.670> helps<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.030> both

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
frame so it helps it helps you both

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.810 
frame so it helps it helps you both
pretty<00:01:40.439> good<00:01:40.500> control<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.130> at<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.490> same<00:01:41.640> time

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
pretty good control and at the same time

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.480 
pretty good control and at the same time
power<00:01:42.470> as<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.799> see<00:01:43.920> here<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.340> just

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
power as you can see here and just

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.010 
power as you can see here and just
stepping<00:01:44.729> into<00:01:44.909> my<00:01:45.090> four<00:01:45.390> hands<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.780> was<00:01:45.899> able

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
stepping into my four hands I was able

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.230 
stepping into my four hands I was able
to<00:01:46.140> get<00:01:46.350> good<00:01:46.560> topspin<00:01:47.070> with<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> Wolfer<00:01:47.909> system

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
to get good topspin with a Wolfer system

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.870 
to get good topspin with a Wolfer system
that<00:01:48.390> they<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.829> cortex<00:01:50.159> technology

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
that they have and the cortex technology

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.550 
that they have and the cortex technology
that's<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.270> racket<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.840> definitely<00:01:52.229> helps

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
that's in the racket it definitely helps

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.760 
that's in the racket it definitely helps
Jen<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.340> lessen<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> shock<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.540> little<00:01:54.960> bit<00:01:55.140> so

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
Jen to lessen the shock a little bit so

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.380 
Jen to lessen the shock a little bit so
it's<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.159> little<00:01:56.310> bit<00:01:56.460> less<00:01:56.579> vibration<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.360> your

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
it's a little bit less vibration on your

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
was very easy on my arm on court I felt

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.090 
was very easy on my arm on court I felt
that<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:05.970> 107<00:03:06.660> head<00:03:06.840> size<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.950> was<00:03:08.070> a

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
that the 107 head size and it was a

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.250 
that the 107 head size and it was a
little<00:03:08.340> bit<00:03:08.520> thicker<00:03:08.760> beam<00:03:09.090> gave<00:03:09.930> me<00:03:10.020> a<00:03:10.050> little

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
little bit thicker beam gave me a little

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.470 
little bit thicker beam gave me a little
bit<00:03:10.410> larger<00:03:10.739> sweet<00:03:11.070> spot<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.640> a<00:03:11.670> little<00:03:12.360> bit

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
bit larger sweet spot and a little bit

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.080 
bit larger sweet spot and a little bit
more<00:03:12.600> power<00:03:12.870> on<00:03:13.050> court<00:03:13.610> good<00:03:14.610> for<00:03:14.790> getting<00:03:14.910> the

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
more power on court good for getting the

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.320 
more power on court good for getting the
ball<00:03:15.209> deep<00:03:16.040> this<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.190> kind<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.700> tweener

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
ball deep this is kind of a tweener

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.970 
ball deep this is kind of a tweener
racket<00:03:18.840> right<00:03:18.989> in<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.170> middle<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.590> power<00:03:19.800> and

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
racket right in the middle of power and

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.479 
racket right in the middle of power and
control

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
control

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.940 
control
so<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.150> mean<00:03:21.330> it'd<00:03:21.390> be<00:03:21.420> good<00:03:21.690> for<00:03:21.830> players<00:03:22.830> with

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
so I mean it'd be good for players with

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.210 
so I mean it'd be good for players with
long<00:03:23.340> swings<00:03:23.820> long<00:03:24.510> slow<00:03:24.840> swings<00:03:25.170> or<00:03:25.470> if<00:03:26.010> you

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
have a short fast game style you'd be

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.570 
have a short fast game style you'd be
able<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.250> adjust<00:03:29.550> to<00:03:29.670> this<00:03:29.910> racket<00:03:30.330> also
