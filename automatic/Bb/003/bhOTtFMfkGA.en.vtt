done one in a while and you know I I

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.619 
done one in a while and you know I I
like<00:00:14.039> to<00:00:14.160> get<00:00:14.249> opinionated<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.059> stuff<00:00:15.299> but<00:00:15.539> it

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:15.629 
like to get opinionated and stuff but it

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:17.240 
like to get opinionated and stuff but it
just<00:00:15.660> doesn't<00:00:16.020> translate<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.920> way<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.220> I

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
just doesn't translate the way that I

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.400 
just doesn't translate the way that I
wanted<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.640> my<00:00:17.970> articles<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.960> thought<00:00:19.380> I

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
wanted to my articles so I thought I

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.310 
wanted to my articles so I thought I
would<00:00:19.530> talk<00:00:19.800> about<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:20.279> couple<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.880> things<00:00:21.320> one

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
would talk about a couple of things one

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.810 
would talk about a couple of things one
of<00:00:22.349> the<00:00:22.500> things<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.800> wanted<00:00:23.009> to<00:00:23.070> talk<00:00:23.250> about<00:00:23.279> was

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
of the things I wanted to talk about was

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.150 
of the things I wanted to talk about was
Floyd<00:00:24.359> Mayweather<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.019> Canelo<00:00:25.529> fighting<00:00:25.949> I

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
Floyd Mayweather and Canelo fighting I

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.460 
Floyd Mayweather and Canelo fighting I
think<00:00:26.910> what<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> lot<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.750> people<00:00:28.320> don't

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
think what a lot of people don't

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.320 
think what a lot of people don't
understand<00:00:29.009> and<00:00:29.220> these<00:00:29.789> could<00:00:30.000> either<00:00:30.089> be

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
understand and these could either be

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.380 
understand and these could either be
just<00:00:30.689> people<00:00:31.050> who<00:00:31.199> choose<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.220> like<00:00:32.669> Floyd<00:00:33.060> or

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
just people who choose to like Floyd or

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.930 
just people who choose to like Floyd or
choose<00:00:33.720> to<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.110> Canelo<00:00:34.700> but<00:00:35.700> when<00:00:35.850> you

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
choose to like Canelo but when you

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.200 
choose to like Canelo but when you
really<00:00:36.090> break<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.539> down<00:00:37.850> making<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.000> fight

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
really break it down making that fight

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.000 
really break it down making that fight
happen<00:00:39.570> isn't<00:00:39.719> as<00:00:39.899> easy<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:40.260> signing<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
happen isn't as easy as signing on the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.770 
happen isn't as easy as signing on the
dotted<00:00:41.129> line<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.760> saying<00:00:41.910> hey<00:00:42.149> let's<00:00:42.420> do<00:00:42.629> this

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
dotted line and saying hey let's do this

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.810 
dotted line and saying hey let's do this
I<00:00:43.050> think<00:00:43.710> what<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.190> lot<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.489> people<00:00:44.579> don't

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
I think what a lot of people don't

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.029 
I think what a lot of people don't
understand<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.390> Canelo<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.350> significantly

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
understand is Canelo is significantly

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.900 
understand is Canelo is significantly
larger<00:00:47.550> we're<00:00:48.300> talking<00:00:48.750> about<00:00:49.460> 17<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.579> 20

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
larger we're talking about 17 to 20

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.410 
larger we're talking about 17 to 20
pounds<00:00:51.270> heavier<00:00:51.500> naturally<00:00:52.500> than<00:00:53.420> Mayweather

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
pounds heavier naturally than Mayweather

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.080 
pounds heavier naturally than Mayweather
is<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.260> if<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.949> even<00:00:56.579> if<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> catch

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
is so if you even if we have a catch

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.209 
is so if you even if we have a catch
weight<00:00:57.359> which<00:00:57.629> we<00:00:57.809> won't<00:00:58.079> play<00:00:58.320> we'll<00:00:58.649> will<00:00:59.039> be

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
weight which we won't play we'll will be

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.520 
weight which we won't play we'll will be
at<00:00:59.340> 147<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.359> assure<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.809> Floyd

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
at 147 I can assure you that Floyd

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.860 
at 147 I can assure you that Floyd
doesn't<00:01:01.859> budge<00:01:01.949> for<00:01:02.160> anyone<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:03.300> Canelo<00:01:03.600> wants

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
doesn't budge for anyone if Canelo wants

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.210 
doesn't budge for anyone if Canelo wants
the<00:01:03.960> opportunity<00:01:04.140> he's<00:01:04.650> gonna<00:01:04.830> have<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.100> go

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
the opportunity he's gonna have to go

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.420 
the opportunity he's gonna have to go
down<00:01:05.250> now<00:01:06.000> we<00:01:06.060> know<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.500> Canelo<00:01:07.500> can't

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
down now we know that Canelo can't

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.580 
down now we know that Canelo can't
really<00:01:08.790> drain<00:01:09.060> down<00:01:09.299> too<00:01:09.630> much<00:01:09.840> because<00:01:09.900> then

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
really drain down too much because then

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.920 
really drain down too much because then
he<00:01:10.740> loses<00:01:10.890> all<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.280> his<00:01:11.400> power<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.509> we're

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
he loses all of his power so we're

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.480 
he loses all of his power so we're
really<00:01:13.080> at<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:14.119> crossroad<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.439> well<00:01:16.439> if<00:01:16.740> even

so he'll be fine or something but think

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.370 
so he'll be fine or something but think
about<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.940> just<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.270> little<00:02:18.420> bit<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:18.900> just

following<00:03:34.080> which<00:03:34.500> could<00:03:34.770> explain<00:03:34.890> why<00:03:35.340> they

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
following which could explain why they

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.160 
following which could explain why they
though<00:03:36.060> all<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.540> his<00:03:36.660> fans<00:03:36.870> call<00:03:37.140> themselves

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
though all of his fans call themselves

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.390 
though all of his fans call themselves
the<00:03:38.040> Khanna

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
the Khanna

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.760 
the Khanna
army<00:03:38.700> he<00:03:39.390> literally<00:03:39.690> does<00:03:39.959> have<00:03:39.989> an<00:03:40.290> army<00:03:40.620> of

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
army he literally does have an army of

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.250 
army he literally does have an army of
followers<00:03:41.760> so<00:03:42.720> he's<00:03:43.200> very<00:03:43.500> much<00:03:43.650> similar<00:03:44.340> to

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
followers so he's very much similar to

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.380 
followers so he's very much similar to
what<00:03:46.310> Mayweather<00:03:47.310> would<00:03:47.610> be<00:03:47.730> considered<00:03:48.209> to

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
what Mayweather would be considered to

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.290 
what Mayweather would be considered to
us<00:03:48.570> here<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.200> although<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.340> wouldn't<00:03:50.880> say<00:03:51.060> he's

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
us here and although I wouldn't say he's

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.240 
us here and although I wouldn't say he's
you<00:03:51.840> know<00:03:51.870> on<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.830> level

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
you know on that level

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.360 
you know on that level
boxing<00:03:53.910> wise<00:03:54.090> but<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:54.750> I<00:03:55.380> definitely<00:03:56.250> don't

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
boxing wise but I I definitely don't

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.800 
boxing wise but I I definitely don't
think<00:03:56.489> that<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:56.910> should<00:03:57.090> happen<00:03:57.239> anytime<00:03:57.600> soon

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
think that it should happen anytime soon

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.170 
think that it should happen anytime soon
but<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:58.620> think<00:03:59.130> we're<00:03:59.310> gonna<00:03:59.430> see<00:03:59.730> it<00:03:59.850> happen

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
but I think we're gonna see it happen

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.660 
but I think we're gonna see it happen
within<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.570> next<00:04:00.750> two<00:04:01.140> fights<00:04:01.489> what<00:04:02.489> made

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
within the next two fights what made

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.090 
within the next two fights what made
that<00:04:02.820> obvious<00:04:03.209> for<00:04:03.510> me<00:04:03.660> was<00:04:04.110> when<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.560> WBC

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
that obvious for me was when the WBC

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
that obvious for me was when the WBC
rated<00:04:05.610> him<00:04:05.760> number<00:04:06.000> two<00:04:06.180> at<00:04:06.330> 147<00:04:07.170> however<00:04:08.120> that

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
rated him number two at 147 however that

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.850 
rated him number two at 147 however that
was<00:04:09.330> just<00:04:09.660> removed<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:10.110> couple<00:04:10.140> of<00:04:10.470> days<00:04:10.680> ago

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
was just removed a couple of days ago

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.850 
was just removed a couple of days ago
and<00:04:11.190> now<00:04:11.489> he's<00:04:11.790> rated<00:04:12.300> number<00:04:12.570> one<00:04:12.750> at<00:04:13.170> 140<00:04:13.680> so

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
and now he's rated number one at 140 so

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.479 
and now he's rated number one at 140 so
it<00:04:13.950> makes<00:04:14.160> you<00:04:14.310> question<00:04:14.550> what's<00:04:14.910> going<00:04:15.209> on

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
it makes you question what's going on

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.610 
it makes you question what's going on
from<00:04:17.359> what<00:04:17.479> I<00:04:17.509> understand<00:04:17.959> he<00:04:18.109> is<00:04:18.139> moving<00:04:18.530> up
