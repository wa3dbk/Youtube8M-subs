00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
seven because that shot it's worth two

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.520 
seven because that shot it's worth two
and<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:29.120> game<00:02:29.300> continues<00:02:29.510> on<00:02:29.900> like<00:02:29.959> that<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:30.500> I

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
and the game continues on like that so I

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.960 
and the game continues on like that so I
will<00:02:30.709> just<00:02:30.860> remember<00:02:31.280> any<00:02:31.459> shot<00:02:31.700> from<00:02:31.850> the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
will just remember any shot from the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.050 
will just remember any shot from the
free-throw<00:02:32.180> line<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:32.660> worth<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.170> and

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
free-throw line is worth to you and

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.940 
free-throw line is worth to you and
that's<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.270> for<00:02:35.480> 21<00:02:37.750> if<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.870> player<00:02:39.110> airballs

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
that's it for 21 if a player airballs

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.680 
that's it for 21 if a player airballs
so<00:02:40.430> shoots<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:40.910> completely<00:02:41.360> misses<00:02:41.660> the

so shoots and completely misses the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.930 
so shoots and completely misses the
backboard<00:02:42.200> in<00:02:42.320> the<00:02:42.410> rim<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:43.310> next<00:02:43.550> player<00:02:43.730> can

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
backboard in the rim the next player can

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.250 
backboard in the rim the next player can
choose<00:02:44.180> where<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.420> shoot<00:02:44.720> from<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.140> that's

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
choose where to shoot from so that's

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.460
