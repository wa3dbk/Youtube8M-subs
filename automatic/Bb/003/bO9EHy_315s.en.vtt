 organized by activision which 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.110

 by twitter what you are seeing I am 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.250

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.500
 impressive it as another said 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.860
 the camp but that kills me on top kills me 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.230
 with a streak of 24 is so good that 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.850
 He presented a contest Campero if you do not 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.670

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.650
 professional or be my mother incredible is 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.360
 what is amazing what I get 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.360
 to give the rage inside to kill me 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.400
 similar specimen buy a game 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.870
 so as not to move them giusti 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.520
 my mother is that she gave him the is that 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.330
 I took with a stick 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.210
 and they gave him the head mother of mine 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.240
 guys what I was a little 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.800
 nervous because I wanted to get a 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.170
 fierce measure in the new maps that of 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.760
 done they take me out the challenges of 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.430
 relentless and I skip the challenges of 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.140
 inexorable I think that I made prestige the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.690
 first week of game the first 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.850
 prestige when the challenges were played 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.380
 and others but did not count not because of 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.060
 I have already raised another implacable 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.940
 channel but they're starting to 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.680
 jump like the ones like who you drop with 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.900
 the war bird but we are foolish to 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.400
 Tunisia how many shooting guards I know that 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.440

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.660
 everything all absolutely all 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.729
 challenges I do not know if it will be a bug or is it 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.700
 that the game is like this or I have no idea 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.140
 but good this this prestige not 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.680

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.530
 from tlc 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.390
 So then, I'm going to accept 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.980
 attentive that the moment is coming there 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.680

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.220

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.120
 we went up is that since I was 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.400
 very nervous is because I should be able to 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.250

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.840
 we hope youtube and I become famous but 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.880
 they gave me the joke but softly with 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.580

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.950

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.160
 it's not very good of course there we see this 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.740

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.040

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.590
 Red 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.070

 This country I fuck in the country that 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.110
 I could have gotten genomics and 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.940
 I was then those 23 games in one 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.860
 proportion we see the medallions and the 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.980

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.450

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.860
 the advantages and a salutary until then 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.410
