00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.210
 hello to all and all his possessions 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.800
 lyon find themselves today for the 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.000
 call of the week for the call of the week 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.480
 duty the week so 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.820
 and today you offered me tube 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.079
 black ops and the match in paris so that's it 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.899
 that's right now I'm not losing 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.579
 time outbidding I'm not going to tell me too much 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.980
 tune and then I think people 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.829
 will play - their lives only if Paris is by 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.469
 example ten thousand code paint so 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.660
 let's go and I chose the weapon game 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.250
 like like a match in paris since I 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.929
 think if the one where the party lasted 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.760
 the longest 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:52.010
 I'm afraid of being wrong but I think 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.300
 that it is the one that will last the most 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.949
 long time so grid 12 really does 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.539
 lease that I did not do it exceeded 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.859
 new maps and all its dlc 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.409
 so short I hope you're fine 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.630
 me it's great so I asked about 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.780
 twitter and in the comments of my 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.729
 latest videos the challenge you would like 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.290
 and ball I was sleeping 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.060
 favorite party then I had and that's right 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.409
 What to do a little game of weapons is 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.150
 very pleasant it's not a game mode 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.220
 we are raging and I normally say 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.480
 normally because we never know I 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.730
 I'm not an angry fang I hope not 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.020
 too much row does see the emblems a 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.940
 little farted true me I have no emblem 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.420
 so I can not talk so these parties 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.780
 grid match in paris i weapons challenge du 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.010
 day arrived first or in the top 3 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.840
 but we will aim for the top 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.530
 first place it can be easy 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.950
 go we start this python little reminder 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.690
 20 weapons 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.910
 this time we make a break with a 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.800
 weapon one goes to the next train seems 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.030
 only one to 20 but every time we do 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.860
 a real one with an uncle's weapon with the 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.090
 bit we'll go to the next round and 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.500
 so on until you reach the 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.300
 ballistic knife and loses the last 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.500
 frag true someone wins at the 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.500
 ballistic knife and the world there 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.600
 al batha and macaigne macaigne maken a 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:13.480
 knife is a humiliation that makes 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:16.330
 come back now all the putting 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.130
 tactically I'm making myself spend I want 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.140
 not to spend it was sure it was safe 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.280
 in short it's not serious it's true that in this 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.860
 moment I went into tactics went 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.700
 what do you have to do a little bit more 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.740
 a month now that I was going into 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.420
 tactical I'm doing a little bit I had 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.640
 a little haunted handy when 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.300
 we are looking for trouble for reflex 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.320
 I saw you you I saw you a 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.489
 do they belong to people everywhere is 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.370
 already everywhere late but yeah no I'm 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:48.130
 not good in the first part of the day 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:50.140
 it is not serious off you go to frei 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.800
 3 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.020
 frack here to arrive first goal 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.020
 I also wanted to talk about a small thing 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.190
 kick up the end of the big him 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.100
 as say good as my colleague says 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.990
 the act I also wanted a little bit 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.640
 mouth in my last video not 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:14.860
 in the first episode of the symposium 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.209
 of the week I was told to shout at 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.300
 plagiarism to plagiarism 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:23.650
 like what am I dreaming there g gentlemen ken 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.780
 browning and his concept of call week 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.989
 do not know what it is because 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.989
 it's exactly 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.890
 yes we cry out to plagiarism and these 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.739
 people there I want to tell them 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.970
 look at the date simply 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.610
 watching is simple 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.310
 just watch the date of videos the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.730
 date of the video I made 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.980
 I explain my concept of two conferences 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.010
 of the week and challenges and you will see 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.480
 that this video appears well before a 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.700
 video of browning krems on this concept 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.410
 which is a little different from mine so 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.510
 before shouting at plagiarism it's 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.970
 know who plagiarized who is he if he is 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.959
 really reason to talk about plagiarism 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.209
 so that's all we do 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.870
