00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hi to all these Berluti boys 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.200
 moment these goals for 405 mi 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.300
 speaks to see another in the right col 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.940
 this time I will report to fierce 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:20.480
 glad the world is not mental yoox 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:23.279
 well I have to tell him sincerely that 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.430
 thankfully I had registered this 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:31.720
 match with the port playstation 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:35.420
 otherwise I would not be thinking about its scope 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.239
 registered 15 in wood I managed to 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.570
 bring the channel to an end anyway 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.410
 this game 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.829
 the play with some of my friends who 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:52.750
 they were was noticed a lot too 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:55.449
 maybe I understand why you lie aside 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.469
 the carmen of molteni scaffold 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:03.579
 they conquered this area underpass 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:06.640
 calm that I have unfortunately not by a 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.460
 draw the end of it but still you are 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:15.399
 managed to do it the same as he used to 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:17.950
 specialist series because yes because 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.640
 I think I already had something in the classmates 1 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.700
 video support 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.120
 to also use specialist I think that 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.880
 this was the longest the most 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.460
 long have they ever done indeed 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.340
 put it in the bag cut it some 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.610
 parts of the pd because it once spawned 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.300
 constantly changing and making for the 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.960
 make enemies the minimum step to do 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:48.320
 in fact maybe even in the companion too 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.530
 of the arts that later with continue to 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.310
 conquer if one after the other therefore 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.200
 find you would trust them 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.689
 this game had been a lot 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:06.220
 this meat but I still managed to 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:08.830
 make her the lord I taste it in bringing it 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.890
 other karma like this in fact this is 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.110
 the first one that carries 5 channel that also from 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.390
 other sectors that register but this 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:22.500
 thankfully yes so i hope to bring 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:26.830
