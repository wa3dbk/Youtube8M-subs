light settings here make it a spot okay
alt<00:01:34.350> R<00:01:35.659> to<00:01:36.659> reset<00:01:37.259> its<00:01:37.380> rotation<00:01:37.890> scale<00:01:38.610> it

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
alt R to reset its rotation scale it

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.240 
alt R to reset its rotation scale it
down<00:01:41.180> GZ<00:01:42.680> hit<00:01:43.680> f12<00:01:44.009> see<00:01:44.280> what<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.460> looks<00:01:44.729> like

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
down GZ hit f12 see what this looks like

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.050 
down GZ hit f12 see what this looks like
okay<00:01:47.250> good

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
okay good

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.990

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
so now we have just a spotlight I think

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.429 
so now we have just a spotlight I think
I<00:01:51.060> might<00:01:51.210> scale<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.540> down<00:01:51.570> actually

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
I might scale it down actually

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.069 
I might scale it down actually
I'm<00:01:54.189> just<00:01:54.399> hitting<00:01:54.490> s<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:55.060> moving<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:55.960> mouse

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
I'm just hitting s and moving the mouse

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.620 
I'm just hitting s and moving the mouse
in<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.770> hitting<00:01:57.249> f12<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.789> render<00:01:57.909> and<00:01:58.240> escape

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
in and hitting f12 to render and escape

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.809 
in and hitting f12 to render and escape
to<00:01:58.869> get<00:01:59.140> out<00:01:59.259> of<00:01:59.350> it

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
to get out of it

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.410 
to get out of it
scale<00:02:00.819> it<00:02:00.939> down<00:02:00.969> with<00:02:01.240> Warren<00:02:01.600> G<00:02:01.750> Z<00:02:02.469> hit<00:02:02.920> f12

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
scale it down with Warren G Z hit f12

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.520 
scale it down with Warren G Z hit f12
just<00:02:04.420> so<00:02:04.509> we<00:02:04.569> can<00:02:04.750> kind<00:02:04.929> of<00:02:04.960> see<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.319> full

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
just so we can kind of see the full

because<00:04:11.200> well<00:04:12.200> here<00:04:12.440> you<00:04:12.530> know<00:04:12.620> what<00:04:12.739> this

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
because well here you know what this

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.580 
because well here you know what this
will<00:04:13.580> be<00:04:13.610> easier<00:04:13.879> I'll<00:04:14.000> hit<00:04:14.120> escape<00:04:14.209> twice

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
will be easier I'll hit escape twice

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.289 
will be easier I'll hit escape twice
what<00:04:15.590> we'll<00:04:15.739> do<00:04:15.950> is<00:04:16.250> we'll<00:04:16.579> come<00:04:16.850> over<00:04:16.970> here

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
what we'll do is we'll come over here

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.879 
what we'll do is we'll come over here
and<00:04:17.449> we'll<00:04:18.320> change<00:04:18.620> it<00:04:18.829> to<00:04:19.389> solid<00:04:20.389> again<00:04:20.600> and

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
and we'll change it to solid again and

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.310 
and we'll change it to solid again and
just<00:04:21.889> watch<00:04:22.130> right<00:04:22.520> here<00:04:22.750> watch<00:04:23.750> what<00:04:23.960> happens

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
just watch right here watch what happens

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.930 
just watch right here watch what happens
as<00:04:25.190> I<00:04:25.340> hit<00:04:25.490> alt<00:04:25.669> a<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:26.840> can<00:04:27.169> see<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:28.010> energy

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
as I hit alt a you can see the energy

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.110 
as I hit alt a you can see the energy
does<00:04:29.780> change<00:04:30.229> so<00:04:31.100> what<00:04:31.220> will<00:04:31.310> happen<00:04:31.340> is<00:04:31.760> that

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
does change so what will happen is that

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.510 
does change so what will happen is that
light<00:04:32.900> will<00:04:33.139> blink<00:04:33.350> as<00:04:33.710> you<00:04:34.220> can<00:04:34.340> see<00:04:34.430> the

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
light will blink as you can see the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.090 
light will blink as you can see the
energy<00:04:34.639> is<00:04:34.940> changing<00:04:35.330> from<00:04:35.449> 0<00:04:35.540> to<00:04:35.900> 1<00:04:36.350> to<00:04:36.590> 0<00:04:36.680> to<00:04:37.070> 1

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
energy is changing from 0 to 1 to 0 to 1

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.629 
energy is changing from 0 to 1 to 0 to 1
and<00:04:37.280> it's<00:04:37.490> a<00:04:37.699> bit<00:04:37.880> laggy<00:04:38.300> I<00:04:38.660> suppose<00:04:39.370> but<00:04:40.370> tell

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
and it's a bit laggy I suppose but tell

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.990 
and it's a bit laggy I suppose but tell
you<00:04:40.760> know<00:04:40.880> what<00:04:41.030> that's<00:04:41.479> all<00:04:41.570> right<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:43.000> this

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
you know what that's all right and this

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.080 
you know what that's all right and this
is<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.300> same<00:04:44.540> for<00:04:44.870> all<00:04:45.169> of<00:04:45.200> these<00:04:45.590> if<00:04:46.310> you

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
is the same for all of these if you

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.360 
is the same for all of these if you
switch<00:04:47.360> it<00:04:47.389> it<00:04:47.660> will<00:04:47.870> keep<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:49.070> keyframes<00:04:49.870> and

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
switch it it will keep the keyframes and

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.730 
switch it it will keep the keyframes and
you<00:04:52.370> can<00:04:52.520> also<00:04:52.639> change<00:04:53.180> or<00:04:53.630> set<00:04:53.930> keyframes<00:04:54.410> for

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
you can also change or set keyframes for

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.830 
you can also change or set keyframes for
the<00:04:54.950> colors<00:04:55.220> too<00:04:55.400> so<00:04:56.050> well<00:04:57.050> actually<00:04:57.320> I<00:04:58.840> don't

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
the colors too so well actually I don't

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.330 
the colors too so well actually I don't
want<00:04:59.930> to<00:05:00.080> get<00:05:00.169> into<00:05:00.289> that<00:05:00.350> yet<00:05:00.650> we'll<00:05:01.039> keep<00:05:01.190> it

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
want to get into that yet we'll keep it

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.590 
want to get into that yet we'll keep it
a<00:05:01.400> spotlight<00:05:01.760> I<00:05:02.000> don't<00:05:02.180> wanna<00:05:02.300> get<00:05:02.389> into<00:05:02.539> that

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
a spotlight I don't wanna get into that

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.879 
a spotlight I don't wanna get into that
yet<00:05:02.780> that<00:05:02.810> will<00:05:03.200> cover<00:05:03.350> we'll<00:05:03.650> cover<00:05:03.800> more
