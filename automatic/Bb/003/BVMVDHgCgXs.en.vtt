00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
about subliminal so if the guy can't

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:13.830 
about subliminal so if the guy can't

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.090 

there's<00:02:19.780> any<00:02:20.080> way<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:20.350> can<00:02:20.650> call<00:02:20.920> that

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
there's any way you can call that

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.550 
there's any way you can call that
something<00:02:21.610> else<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:23.200> then<00:02:23.380> it's<00:02:23.470> another

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
something else and then it's another

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.440 
something else and then it's another

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.899 

the<00:02:30.379> idea<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.650> violating<00:02:31.280> free<00:02:31.549> will<00:02:31.730> is

the idea of violating free will is

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.940 
the idea of violating free will is
something<00:02:32.239> that<00:02:32.359> even<00:02:32.510> God<00:02:32.870> doesn't<00:02:33.409> do<00:02:33.560> and

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
something that even God doesn't do and

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.760 
something that even God doesn't do and
yet<00:02:34.489> man<00:02:35.379> thinks<00:02:36.379> they<00:02:36.469> can<00:02:36.650> do<00:02:36.769> this

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.830 

they<00:02:40.770> talk<00:02:41.040> about<00:02:41.250> when<00:02:42.090> people<00:02:42.330> do<00:02:42.630> something

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
they talk about when people do something

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.230 
they talk about when people do something

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
again the evidence against that is

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:57.520 
again the evidence against that is
haven't<00:02:46.140> got<00:02:46.260> any<00:02:46.440> societies<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.370> zombies
