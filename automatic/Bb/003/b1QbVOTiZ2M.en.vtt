of a local game shop and I had to buy it
it's<00:01:47.460> from<00:01:47.579> 1993<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.540> we're<00:01:48.899> currently<00:01:48.990> in

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
2010 so that's 1718 years that no one's

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.560 
2010 so that's 1718 years that no one's
opened<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.680> which<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:52.979> incredible<00:01:53.509> so<00:01:54.509> I'm

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.840

changed<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.560> color<00:03:22.770> it<00:03:23.280> was<00:03:23.400> originally<00:03:23.790> I

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
changed the color it was originally I

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.080 
changed the color it was originally I
believe<00:03:24.090> this<00:03:24.240> color<00:03:24.540> but<00:03:25.290> then<00:03:25.850> Nintendo<00:03:26.850> had

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
believe this color but then Nintendo had

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.580 
believe this color but then Nintendo had
to<00:03:27.209> change<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.870> go<00:03:27.990> to<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.170> orange<00:03:28.380> gun

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
to change and go to the orange gun

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.010 
to change and go to the orange gun
because<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.040> new<00:03:29.160> law<00:03:29.190> that<00:03:29.730> all<00:03:30.450> fake

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
because of a new law that all fake

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.960 
because of a new law that all fake
plastic<00:03:31.290> guns<00:03:31.680> for<00:03:32.250> consoles<00:03:32.610> were<00:03:32.730> supposed

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
plastic guns for consoles were supposed

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.420 
plastic guns for consoles were supposed
to<00:03:33.060> look<00:03:33.300> fake<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:34.080> believe<00:03:34.350> so<00:03:35.100> they<00:03:35.220> went<00:03:35.370> to

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
to look fake I believe so they went to

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.270 
to look fake I believe so they went to
the<00:03:35.730> orange<00:03:35.910> version<00:03:36.200> so<00:03:37.200> finding<00:03:37.740> the

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
the orange version so finding the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.400
