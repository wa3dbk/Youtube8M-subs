ways you can do it make a 2 by 4
put<00:02:08.070> it<00:02:08.130> in<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.250> bottom<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:09.210> can<00:02:09.240> cut<00:02:09.479> two<00:02:09.630> by

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
put it in the bottom you can cut two by

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.770 
put it in the bottom you can cut two by
fours<00:02:10.140> or<00:02:10.490> pressure-treated

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
fours or pressure-treated

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
size to put it in here then you can

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.100 
size to put it in here then you can
screw<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.820> into<00:02:17.940> your<00:02:18.180> main<00:02:18.330> support<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:19.020> will

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
your house you have a storage problem by

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.359 
your house you have a storage problem by
getting<00:05:24.689> it<00:05:24.809> into<00:05:25.080> here<00:05:25.499> underground<00:05:25.860> you've

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:26.369 
getting it into here underground you've

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:27.979 
getting it into here underground you've
alleviated<00:05:26.999> a<00:05:27.059> lot<00:05:27.209> of<00:05:27.330> storage<00:05:27.569> problems

alleviated a lot of storage problems

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:30.589 
alleviated a lot of storage problems
because<00:05:28.139> this<00:05:28.319> will<00:05:28.589> hold<00:05:28.830> a<00:05:28.949> lot<00:05:29.159> of<00:05:29.189> stuff<00:05:29.599> so

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
because this will hold a lot of stuff so

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:32.570 
because this will hold a lot of stuff so

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:34.589 
more hopefully I can get it done for

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:36.949 
more hopefully I can get it done for
this<00:05:34.830> week<00:05:35.069> or<00:05:35.249> two<00:05:35.399> just<00:05:35.580> time<00:05:36.059> as<00:05:36.269> time<00:05:36.779> is

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:36.959 
this week or two just time as time is

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:38.989 
this week or two just time as time is
hard<00:05:37.110> to<00:05:37.199> find<00:05:37.379> so<00:05:38.159> hopefully<00:05:38.610> this<00:05:38.699> will<00:05:38.819> give

00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:38.999

hard to find so hopefully this will give
you<00:05:39.089> some<00:05:39.240> ideas<00:05:40.369> really<00:05:41.369> roughly<00:05:41.699> the<00:05:41.849> hinges

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
you some ideas really roughly the hinges

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.719 
you some ideas really roughly the hinges
were<00:05:42.479> free<00:05:42.929> I'm<00:05:43.889> gonna<00:05:44.069> scrounge<00:05:44.369> up<00:05:44.490> some

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
were free I'm gonna scrounge up some

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.820 
were free I'm gonna scrounge up some
boards<00:05:45.089> so<00:05:45.689> basically<00:05:46.050> I'll<00:05:46.169> have<00:05:46.289> fifteen<00:05:46.709> or

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
boards so basically I'll have fifteen or

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.889 
boards so basically I'll have fifteen or
twenty<00:05:47.069> dollars<00:05:47.099> into<00:05:47.519> the<00:05:47.789> tar<00:05:48.029> and

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:48.899 
twenty dollars into the tar and

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:50.659 
twenty dollars into the tar and
everything<00:05:49.349> else<00:05:49.529> is<00:05:49.679> pretty<00:05:50.099> much<00:05:50.219> free<00:05:50.519> or

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
everything else is pretty much free or

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.819 
everything else is pretty much free or
scrounge<00:05:50.969> so<00:05:51.209> looking<00:05:52.079> though<00:05:52.199> this<00:05:52.529> could<00:05:52.740> be

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:52.829 
scrounge so looking though this could be

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:54.350 
scrounge so looking though this could be
an<00:05:52.949> option<00:05:53.159> for<00:05:53.399> you<00:05:53.610> especially<00:05:53.999> if<00:05:54.239> you<00:05:54.269> have
