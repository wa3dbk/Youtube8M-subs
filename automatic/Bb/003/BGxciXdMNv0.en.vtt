00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
something like that I don't think it

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.340 
something like that I don't think it
should<00:02:02.310> ask<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.820> doctor<00:02:03.149> Phil<00:02:03.600> because<00:02:04.170> he's

should ask this doctor Phil because he's

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.200 
should ask this doctor Phil because he's
probably<00:02:04.590> way<00:02:04.829> better<00:02:05.040> at<00:02:05.250> using<00:02:05.399> these<00:02:05.670> AWB

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210

then<00:02:06.509> actually<00:02:07.049> giving<00:02:07.380> relationship<00:02:07.979> advice

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
then actually giving relationship advice

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.620 
then actually giving relationship advice
but<00:02:08.910> that's<00:02:09.390> just

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
but that's just

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.960 
but that's just
what<00:02:10.200> I'm<00:02:10.320> thinking<00:02:10.680> I'm<00:02:10.860> not<00:02:11.010> sure<00:02:11.190> he's

what I'm thinking I'm not sure he's

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.840 
what I'm thinking I'm not sure he's
