00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 Come on, let's go back to Jaguar who loved 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.010
 Marc Cherry usually starts 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.480
 while for a long time he had 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.429
 juror ie I say it all from 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.620
 suite already sees the photos I do not like 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.299
 when I see that hulls nancy beats 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.800
 tarbes that really crazy I assume listen 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.990
 the rolling camellias you see this tale 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.100
 martin in paris launches on suv so 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.630
 During a very long time 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.449
 he said we will not do it because 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.000
 we are tied to land rover so they 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.560
 make their cayenne to milk this 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.330
 concept that should happen in series if 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.470
 the years 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.200
 very big front grille the lights way xf 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.580
 very massive very large car also to 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.650
 even the jaguar is more violent 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.810
 usually he roars harder 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.860
 and I put this aggressiveness on the 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.940
 board account 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.050
 there are more and more Germans to 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.340
 terminals now that he's soft the 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.780
 sales in the premium to echo 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.610
 german I sincerely 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.660
 the acalan on Thursday its two cold porsche 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.740
 so you said it all against what 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.050
 you told me that interests me 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.160
 I like it then why but first 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.510
 because we did not expect them on this 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.760
 segment there yeah that's right there are some 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.560
 porsche cayenne on its proportions 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.910
 from some angles his arrears 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.510
 how little back there is this 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.580
 not bad 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.000
 what I like is diversity 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.480
 we did not expect jaguar on it 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.700
 come 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.380
 I do not doubt for a moment that 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.890
 pleases the United States, which was called 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.040
 China 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.300
 it's a concept it's a concept they 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.740
 will work dates and bearings 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.740
 studlet in 21 or 22 inches 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.060
 one thing also is that we see it in 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.840
 blue 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.700
 the subaru electric it was not the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.950
 colors that must never be agreed 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.390
 with you I know all that but in the end 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.159
 a crate even a concept it's from 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.020
 emotion is in the opinion of all who 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.490
 is right there it feels so not 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.640
 reason that it's going to sell 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.290
 the reason they will go everywhere on the 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.930
 no choice but I was expecting 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.690
 something more wadi in Flemish and 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.130
 to laugh there there nothing exactly 1 and a 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.310
 bonus to traders I find it ugly I 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.970
 found extremely banal is expected 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.210
 so yeah that 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.910
 he has rezoned selling beautiful lights back 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.020
 the gentle slope there and not bad but in 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.420
 the more they give the impression of having 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.979
 summer 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.319
 even the model to have been quickly done 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.269
 to be ready to transfer our pace 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.219
 and a booth the exactly what I 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.620
 thought to see watch the doua we feel that 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:22.030
 it's not very well stuck behind 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.069
 even the jaguar how they did 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.420
 in my opinion had to be delivered tonight 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:31.030
 not everything we'll come back to but we have 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.889
 six months but on roddick sasebo the eye 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.079
 but you see to finish it's very 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:36.849
 interesting lifestyle what are you 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.200
 do you think you'll tell me it's not worth it 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.120
 a porsche strangely while me 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.290
 I like it but it's interesting because 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.980
 that I have what does not have its like 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.659
 to launch this car the whole com a 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.040
 been on sport sport sport all 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.810
 tests made on circuits 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.549
 they showed plenty of room pilots 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.680
 is all packed and that face matches 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.180
 at 911 and that's where it's an approach 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.189
 really very Germanic to say that's it 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.510
 in a we have a pure sports car and 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.340
 hard you know before jaguar in drawing goes 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.590
 fast but it's not necessarily as 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.629
 rigorous as a story and 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.489
 history is history but he 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.459
 the agreement but since love then 20 years 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.780
 with jsc departure is there since a few 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.359
 time they come back with models 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.669
 super load super macha that's good 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.540
 but I glamor you borrow a 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:19.989
 little con but good 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.819

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.280
 renew jetair the nissan or and that 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.469
 it's also powerful hazell my job 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.950
 at chez jaguar 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:32.269
 we are in frankfurt so in a saint 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.500
 Saints of the car is for that 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.439
 that she is more electric also there 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.370
 because we would like it here are those 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:38.510
 who want to show that they want 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.920
 show that they know how to go quickly a 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.480
 go we will offer them to go fast 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.260
