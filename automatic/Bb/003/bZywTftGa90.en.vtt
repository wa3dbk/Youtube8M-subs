00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.420
 we present you and the 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.610
 the manual inspiration of the swimming pools operating with a water supply under 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.509
 pressure 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.849
 and equipped with a filter cartridge 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.049
 the water supply is done either by a simple garden hose 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.149
 by taking resting boosters if your pool has one 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.710
 The back of your house is more than enough to 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.689
 operate the cyclone 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.689
 the device was very easy to use 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.050
 man is simply implemented we are still in the telescopic handle 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.730
 valley processes 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.700
 the device is immersed 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.610
 almost horizontally 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.170
 slightly inclined so that the dome of filtration to purge itself of 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.170
 respect 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.860
 water pipe 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.860
 central attention eq swirling by venturi effect 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.000
 the water flow 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.519
 this summer it rises and comes in the club wash through the cartridge 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.519
 filter 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.440
 this collective rise while the water perfectly filtered 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.030
 gold under the flange 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.159
 and lateral in for pregnancy function was deposited on the bottom 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:24.950
 and direct him 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.950
 chelsea the central exasperation 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.590
 let's take a look at the cyclone in action on a pool background 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.040
 use of dead animals small pebbles 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.240
 simple and many have dropped 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.869
 sipa the quality of the cyclone was indeed to retain all the particles 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.100
 even the finest 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.149
 the earth carried by wind to the same fine algae 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.440
 employment sites when conventional filtration is disconnected 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.409
 he avoids the tibet 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.310
 the group's actions occurred shortly floating 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.310
 always difficult to boot the bulky 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.269
 the cyclone can be used alone 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.299
 its efficiency and speed allow the owners of 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:24.170
 pools 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.840
 to clean the bottom very shortly before just after swimming 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.790
 without the finest particles being resuspended 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.719
 lightweight side allow cleaning in the corners and rounded 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:10.789
 indeed 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:14.279
 he brushes and pushes the dirt in the central inspiration 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.579
 to better understand the operation and power of this 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.059
 apparatus we are going to have it work on a previously salt-glazed window 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:42.339
 standing sand and hardwood 

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:46.339
 swirling central aspiration effect to the cyclone shows 

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:48.769
 very clearly 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.459
 notice slight sideways in function and brush and repel 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.639
 the dirt the greens the central exasperation 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:00.289
 thanks to them the enhanced efficiency and the cyclone and you as well as on any 

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:02.169
 its width 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.309
 the device is extracted from the pool 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:07.849
 note that the water that is flowing is perfectly clear which is filtered 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.579
 the telescopic handle and the garden hose separate sections 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.280
 the simple jet of water is enough to clean the cyclone in one minute 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.840
 the highly filtering cartridge of the cyclone makes it possible to reduce the time 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.659
 use of conventional filtration 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:31.509
 so the filter loans of which die and pumps and the filter 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.110
 main pool 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.599
 from his anchor more the same way 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:38.340
 of water a very important water saving 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.719
 there is only one operating economy of points 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:46.119
 the cyclone simultaneously allows to clean and readjust the level 

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.629
 of your pool 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:49.770
 vis-Ã -vis your environment 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.259
 the quantities of chlorinated water usually rejected by the pump 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:54.080
 in the trains 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.729
 will be significantly reduced 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.080
 in order to 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.339
 protecting your environment 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:04.560
 the cyclone allows you substantial savings in chlorinated products 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.560
 and other water treatment products 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.449
 the cyclone and little bulky 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.629
 very light and simple operation makes it a robust and 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:24.360
 durable without any possible breakdown 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.710
 it allows you to clean your pool during the winter season 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.460
 after sainte-rose thunderstorms without having to restart the filtration 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.460
 classical 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.300
 its simplicity of operation makes it usable by any person 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.189
 electrical manipulations or valves of your always-sion filter 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:52.189
 delicate are no longer necessary 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:02.289
 the cyclone is an essential product for large and small pools 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:04.340
 it is very effective 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.409
 daf chained very simple and very robust 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:11.469
 it works without electricity saving the water usually lost 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:13.849
 with the classic filtration system
