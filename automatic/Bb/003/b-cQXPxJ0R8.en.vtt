00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.530

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.529
 interesting 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.529
 Phew 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.170
 because there's no I'm going to bring people back 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.250
 interesting 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.100
 as part of his covenant 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.820
 seriously 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.610
 normal 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.200
 for you it looks like this 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.760
 good 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.070
 then welcome 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.280
 this 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.090
 tutorial of what we are going to do 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.840
 what was happening there 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:21.409
 and this is with the function of that 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:25.690
 new snapshot the 13 w 39 from this 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.270
 from before as from www 30 and in 17 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.320
 what 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.460
 where the commands can be 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.460
 very large millions 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.789
 do not 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:45.689
 awesome and that's what you do 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:48.990
 the blocks and sand falling 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:53.189
 disguised as a command block that has 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.939
 the command to appear another piece of 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.469
 sand and appear one and a thing street 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.440
 us on top of the pressure plate that 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.080
 is on top of the sand deadline 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.090
 and that 's all it makes a mountain of 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.090
 command blocks what 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.360
 doing 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.990
 throw 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.990
 throw 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:26.980
 is to throw the stone stone in disguise 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.980
 of sand falling or not 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.980
 so let's see to do this for 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.000
 the command I wish more rope to put a 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.000
 damn description be 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.490
 face 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.720
 a lever that I show a long time ago and 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.720
 Quick 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.200
 but no 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.920
 still crisis 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.920
 he's very young 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.880
 Y 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.580
 that's pulling the command blocks 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.030
 what I know beginning this same this 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:11.220
 same watch and when to clean stone 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.220
 disguised as juncker if our magnet 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.590
 and when there is more then it starts to 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.450
 throw more 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.000
 and then this so we have a 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:28.100
 Montana 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.100
 because it has water 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.090
 if he is going to put us with that 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.390
 very simple for those who are too lazy 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.390
 go to put blocks 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.359
 with 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.810
 if it existed but this and the anvil 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.430
 I do not think 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.180
 but here in 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.180
 we'll see 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.480
 or not 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.239
 once saved 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.239
 time here in 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.340
 two 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.340
 know no 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.460
 not because they are anvil until they fall 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.400
 because they are the only blocks that have 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.390
 that effect but I do not care 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.390
 I want to climb 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.710
 it is impressive 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:52.419
 it does not matter then if you liked me 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.930
 like if you did not like it too and if you do not 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:05:00.900
 like if you want to see more let's see 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.900
 when see more subscribe to the bathroom 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.500
 let's say it for that work we 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.139
 it has not been fix 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.820
 remember that I always tell them if 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.979
 they want to tell me what to do in the next 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.630
 because this shows that it is very 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.630
 improvised because it is very simple 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:39.840
 comment tell me what you want to see 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:43.710
 while they have not gone away you have to 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.529
 take a long time can do them 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.350
 OK, good bye 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:49.680
 plus 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.680
 and only a block like old did 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.680
 Print
