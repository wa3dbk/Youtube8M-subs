not really finessing it just you know
power<00:01:18.570> shutting<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.200> from<00:01:19.439> outside<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.950> box

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
power shutting it from outside the box

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.359 
power shutting it from outside the box
just<00:01:20.340> outside<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.790> box<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.710> he's<00:01:22.710> pretty

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
just outside the box and he's pretty

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.969 
just outside the box and he's pretty
good<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.850> be<00:01:23.970> honest<00:01:24.259> his<00:01:25.259> long<00:01:25.590> shot<00:01:25.860> is

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
good to be honest his long shot is

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.830 
good to be honest his long shot is
pretty<00:01:26.220> decent<00:01:26.430> not<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> best<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.420> use<00:01:27.630> but

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
pretty decent not the best of use but

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.109 
pretty decent not the best of use but
it's<00:01:28.020> decent<00:01:28.530> as<00:01:28.710> finesse<00:01:29.460> shot<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.820> really

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
it's decent as finesse shot is really

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.390 
it's decent as finesse shot is really
good<00:01:30.299> i<00:01:30.329> think<00:01:30.659> he<00:01:30.720> has<00:01:30.810> 93<00:01:31.380> finishing<00:01:31.890> which

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
good i think he has 93 finishing which

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.890 
good i think he has 93 finishing which
is<00:01:32.549> really<00:01:32.759> nice<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.299> he<00:01:33.420> has<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> really

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
is really nice and he has a really

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.080 
is really nice and he has a really
decent<00:01:34.170> power<00:01:34.470> shot<00:01:34.799> as<00:01:34.950> well<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.700> you'll<00:01:35.939> see

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
decent power shot as well as you'll see

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.969 
decent power shot as well as you'll see
in<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.240> clips<00:01:36.479> he's<00:01:36.990> one<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.290> those<00:01:37.500> strikers

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
in the clips he's one of those strikers

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.670 
in the clips he's one of those strikers
that<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.630> know<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:40.049> passed<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.530> to

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.310 
him and he will score as you can see the
powershot<00:01:44.100> there<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.399> i'm<00:01:44.460> talking<00:01:44.759> about

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
powershot there that i'm talking about

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.770 
powershot there that i'm talking about
just<00:01:46.320> really<00:01:46.740> really<00:01:46.920> nice<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.640> he<00:01:48.600> can

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
just really really nice and he can

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.870 
just really really nice and he can
really<00:01:49.020> score<00:01:49.320> from<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:50.369> know<00:01:50.490> anywhere

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
really score from you know anywhere

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.120 
really score from you know anywhere
within<00:01:51.119> 30<00:01:51.479> yards<00:01:51.570> if<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.799> shoot<00:01:52.979> with

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
within 30 yards if you just shoot with

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.190 
within 30 yards if you just shoot with
him<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.520> think<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.149> was<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.930> was<00:01:54.990> out

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
him I think that was like that was out

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.310 
him I think that was like that was out
of<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.380> exact<00:01:55.770> same<00:01:56.040> goal<00:01:56.340> or<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:57.630> different

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
of the exact same goal or a different

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.870 
of the exact same goal or a different
goal<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.590> was<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.799> exact<00:01:59.130> same<00:01:59.340> account<00:01:59.759> i'm

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
goal that was the exact same account i'm

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.880 
goal that was the exact same account i'm
not<00:02:00.000> sure<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.450> he's<00:02:01.049> also<00:02:01.200> got<00:02:01.469> some<00:02:01.649> he's

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
not sure but he's also got some he's

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.350 
not sure but he's also got some he's
gone<00:02:02.070> he's<00:02:02.310> also<00:02:02.460> got<00:02:02.670> really<00:02:02.939> nice<00:02:03.060> heading

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
gone he's also got really nice heading

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.780 
gone he's also got really nice heading
as<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:03.960> see<00:02:04.140> i<00:02:04.530> don't<00:02:04.979> really<00:02:05.340> cross<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
as you can see i don't really cross the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.760 
as you can see i don't really cross the
ball<00:02:05.939> in<00:02:06.119> much<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:06.990> haven't<00:02:07.649> really

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
ball in much so I haven't really

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.190 
ball in much so I haven't really
experiment<00:02:08.640> with<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:08.879> but<00:02:09.090> every<00:02:09.420> chance<00:02:10.080> he

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
experiment with it but every chance he

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.960 
experiment with it but every chance he
really<00:02:10.470> gets<00:02:10.649> through<00:02:10.830> his<00:02:11.009> head<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.400> usually

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
really gets through his head it usually

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.860 
really gets through his head it usually
goes<00:02:12.120> in

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
goes in

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.050 
goes in

two together I got the video race like
the<00:02:31.319> thing<00:02:31.709> where<00:02:31.829> the<00:02:31.920> clip<00:02:32.129> goes<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:32.549> I<00:02:32.700> got

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
that a bit wrong so the cliffs might be

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.850 
that a bit wrong so the cliffs might be
a<00:02:35.069> bit<00:02:35.250> off<00:02:35.400> but<00:02:36.150> i'm<00:02:36.989> just<00:02:37.349> experimenting

he's also got decent passing and I put

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.170 
he's also got decent passing and I put
the<00:03:36.750> were<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:37.169> there<00:03:37.349> may<00:03:37.620> be<00:03:37.879> the<00:03:38.879> reason<00:03:39.000> i

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
the were that there may be the reason i

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.460 
the were that there may be the reason i
thought<00:03:39.209> maybe<00:03:39.510> is<00:03:39.840> because<00:03:40.109> if<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:40.379> have

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
thought maybe is because if you have

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.309 
thought maybe is because if you have
loads<00:03:40.849> like<00:03:41.849> millions<00:03:42.299> of<00:03:42.389> coins<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.780> spend<00:03:43.079> i

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
loads like millions of coins to spend i

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.830 
loads like millions of coins to spend i
would<00:03:43.859> recommend<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.430> getting<00:03:44.669> him<00:03:44.910> or<00:03:45.209> if

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
would recommend you getting him or if

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.979 
would recommend you getting him or if
you<00:03:46.139> only<00:03:46.379> have<00:03:46.739> around<00:03:47.010> 200<00:03:47.879> to<00:03:48.000> 300<00:03:48.540> k<00:03:48.690> i

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
you only have around 200 to 300 k i

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.960 
you only have around 200 to 300 k i
would<00:03:49.530> say<00:03:49.709> stick<00:03:50.010> with<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.250> normal<00:03:50.639> or<00:03:50.760> get<00:03:50.910> a

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
would say stick with the normal or get a
