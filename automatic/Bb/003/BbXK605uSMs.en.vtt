this<00:00:04.180> is<00:00:04.360> the<00:00:04.600> x-ray<00:00:05.290> of<00:00:05.410> the<00:00:06.809> the<00:00:07.809> leg<00:00:08.109> that

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320 
this is the x-ray of the the leg that

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.459 
this is the x-ray of the the leg that
was<00:00:08.500> done<00:00:08.860> a<00:00:09.160> year<00:00:09.309> ago<00:00:09.700> and<00:00:10.030> she's<00:00:10.809> had<00:00:10.990> a<00:00:11.019> TTA

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:11.469 
was done a year ago and she's had a TTA

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:12.930 
was done a year ago and she's had a TTA
procedure<00:00:12.010> done<00:00:12.280> here<00:00:12.520> it<00:00:12.580> was<00:00:12.670> done<00:00:12.820> at

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
procedure done here it was done at

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.410 
procedure done here it was done at
another<00:00:13.180> vet<00:00:13.360> hospital<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:15.130> looks<00:00:15.490> okay<00:00:16.029> but

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
another vet hospital it looks okay but

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.009 
another vet hospital it looks okay but
she<00:00:17.140> is<00:00:17.320> quite<00:00:17.650> sore<00:00:18.039> on<00:00:18.189> the<00:00:18.220> side<00:00:18.670> and<00:00:19.180> she

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:20.019 
she is quite sore on the side and she

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.450 
she is quite sore on the side and she
came<00:00:20.230> to<00:00:20.259> me<00:00:20.560> to<00:00:20.740> have<00:00:20.859> a<00:00:20.890> stem-cell<00:00:21.220> therapy

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
came to me to have a stem-cell therapy

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.319 
came to me to have a stem-cell therapy
done<00:00:22.119> and<00:00:23.130> she's<00:00:24.130> actually<00:00:24.429> gone<00:00:24.789> very<00:00:25.150> well

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:25.329 
done and she's actually gone very well

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.319 
done and she's actually gone very well
after<00:00:25.630> that<00:00:26.140> so<00:00:26.710> this<00:00:26.859> left<00:00:27.339> side<00:00:27.730> is<00:00:28.089> now<00:00:28.269> no

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
after that so this left side is now no

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.470 
after that so this left side is now no
longer<00:00:28.659> a<00:00:28.869> problem<00:00:29.140> and<00:00:29.789> at<00:00:30.789> the<00:00:30.999> time<00:00:31.210> when<00:00:31.419> I

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
longer a problem and at the time when I

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.300 
longer a problem and at the time when I
extrude<00:00:31.899> her<00:00:32.230> she<00:00:32.560> had<00:00:32.770> quite<00:00:33.040> a<00:00:33.070> lot<00:00:33.280> of

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
extrude her she had quite a lot of

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.259 
extrude her she had quite a lot of
osteoporosis<00:00:33.820> that's<00:00:35.309> quite<00:00:36.309> a<00:00:36.340> marked

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269 
osteoporosis that's quite a marked

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.750 
osteoporosis that's quite a marked
arthritic<00:00:37.629> change<00:00:38.050> the<00:00:39.010> trochlea<00:00:39.370> ridge<00:00:39.519> here

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
arthritic change the trochlea ridge here

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.330 
arthritic change the trochlea ridge here
has<00:00:39.940> a<00:00:39.969> lot<00:00:40.149> of<00:00:40.239> bone<00:00:40.660> on<00:00:40.930> it<00:00:41.109> there's<00:00:41.920> a<00:00:41.980> big

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
has a lot of bone on it there's a big

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.430 
has a lot of bone on it there's a big
osteophyte<00:00:42.670> growing<00:00:43.199> developing<00:00:44.199> on<00:00:44.350> the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
osteophyte growing developing on the

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.189 
osteophyte growing developing on the
back<00:00:44.620> of<00:00:44.829> the<00:00:45.039> patella<00:00:46.030> and<00:00:46.269> she<00:00:46.899> has<00:00:47.050> an

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
back of the patella and she has an

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.470 
back of the patella and she has an
effusion<00:00:47.590> so<00:00:48.280> she's<00:00:48.460> got<00:00:48.640> fluid<00:00:48.879> in<00:00:49.120> her<00:00:49.300> knee

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
effusion so she's got fluid in her knee

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.750 
effusion so she's got fluid in her knee
and<00:00:49.780> other<00:00:50.170> signs<00:00:50.559> associated<00:00:51.460> with<00:00:51.550> chronic

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
and other signs associated with chronic

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.139 
and other signs associated with chronic
inflammation<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:53.379> we<00:00:53.500> treated<00:00:53.800> her<00:00:54.070> with<00:00:54.730> stem

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
inflammation so we treated her with stem

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.810 
inflammation so we treated her with stem
cells<00:00:55.420> and<00:00:55.719> she<00:00:56.440> actually<00:00:56.890> recovered<00:00:57.609> really

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
cells and she actually recovered really

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.520 
cells and she actually recovered really
well<00:00:57.999> on<00:00:58.300> that<00:00:58.420> side<00:00:59.969> subsequently<00:01:00.969> and<00:01:01.530> this

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
well on that side subsequently and this

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.079 
well on that side subsequently and this
isn't<00:01:02.920> all<00:01:03.159> that<00:01:03.190> uncommon

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
isn't all that uncommon

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.660 
isn't all that uncommon
she<00:01:04.449> has<00:01:04.600> ruptured<00:01:04.870> her<00:01:05.350> right<00:01:05.710> cranial

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
she has ruptured her right cranial

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.700 
she has ruptured her right cranial
cruciate<00:01:07.120> ligament<00:01:07.510> and<00:01:07.600> a<00:01:08.080> lot<00:01:08.230> of<00:01:08.320> dogs<00:01:08.500> when

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
cruciate ligament and a lot of dogs when

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.770 
cruciate ligament and a lot of dogs when
they've<00:01:08.860> done<00:01:09.010> one<00:01:09.220> side<00:01:09.490> will<00:01:09.730> often<00:01:10.210> go<00:01:10.420> and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
they've done one side will often go and

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.990 
they've done one side will often go and
rupture<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.530> other<00:01:11.650> side<00:01:11.950> so<00:01:12.580> this<00:01:12.700> is<00:01:12.760> her

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
rupture the other side so this is her

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.950 
rupture the other side so this is her
right<00:01:13.240> knee<00:01:13.540> and<00:01:14.850> at<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:16.000> moment<00:01:16.240> this<00:01:16.720> knee

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
right knee and at the moment this knee

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.270 
right knee and at the moment this knee
has<00:01:17.230> no<00:01:17.490> significant<00:01:18.490> changes<00:01:18.910> there<00:01:20.280> other

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
has no significant changes there other

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.740 
has no significant changes there other
than<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.730> fact<00:01:21.940> that<00:01:22.000> she<00:01:22.210> has<00:01:22.360> ruptured<00:01:22.570> a

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
than the fact that she has ruptured a

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.780 
than the fact that she has ruptured a
cruciate<00:01:23.140> ligament<00:01:23.500> so<00:01:24.100> I'm<00:01:24.490> going<00:01:24.700> to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
cruciate ligament so I'm going to

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.180 
cruciate ligament so I'm going to
measure<00:01:24.970> this<00:01:25.240> knee<00:01:25.510> to<00:01:26.020> do<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.170> ttio<00:01:26.680> procedure

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
measure this knee to do a ttio procedure

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.320 
measure this knee to do a ttio procedure
and<00:01:28.050> that's<00:01:29.050> a<00:01:29.230> procedure<00:01:29.620> where<00:01:30.040> we<00:01:30.330> changing

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
and that's a procedure where we changing

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.360 
and that's a procedure where we changing
the<00:01:31.420> bio<00:01:31.630> dynamics<00:01:32.140> of<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.410> knee<00:01:32.590> so<00:01:33.160> that<00:01:33.280> you

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
the bio dynamics of the knee so that you

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.760 
the bio dynamics of the knee so that you
don't<00:01:33.640> need<00:01:34.060> a<00:01:34.330> cruciate<00:01:34.750> ligament<00:01:35.110> it's<00:01:35.590> not

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
don't need a cruciate ligament it's not

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.370 
don't need a cruciate ligament it's not
a<00:01:35.800> stabilizing<00:01:36.370> procedure<00:01:36.940> it's<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.960> procedure

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
a stabilizing procedure it's a procedure

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.080 
a stabilizing procedure it's a procedure
that's<00:01:38.710> changing<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.280> way<00:01:39.370> the<00:01:39.640> knee<00:01:39.790> works

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
that's changing the way the knee works

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.880 
that's changing the way the knee works
so<00:01:40.660> you<00:01:40.720> don't<00:01:40.960> actually<00:01:41.200> have<00:01:41.560> to<00:01:41.620> have<00:01:41.860> a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
so you don't actually have to have a

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.610 
so you don't actually have to have a
cruciate<00:01:42.280> ligament<00:01:42.760> in<00:01:42.940> big<00:01:43.480> dogs<00:01:43.750> it's<00:01:44.320> a<00:01:44.440> lot

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
cruciate ligament in big dogs it's a lot

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.320 
cruciate ligament in big dogs it's a lot
better<00:01:44.740> to<00:01:44.980> do<00:01:45.100> this<00:01:45.310> procedure<00:01:45.580> than<00:01:46.090> it<00:01:46.180> is

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
better to do this procedure than it is

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.090 
better to do this procedure than it is
to<00:01:46.450> try<00:01:46.660> and<00:01:46.720> attempt<00:01:47.020> stabilisation<00:01:47.680> type

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
to try and attempt stabilisation type

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.400 
to try and attempt stabilisation type
procedures<00:01:48.700> they<00:01:49.630> just<00:01:49.840> don't<00:01:50.020> work<00:01:50.170> as<00:01:50.380> well

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
procedures they just don't work as well

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.910 
procedures they just don't work as well
as<00:01:50.830> things<00:01:51.250> like<00:01:51.310> at<00:01:51.550> ETA<00:01:51.880> or<00:01:52.300> at<00:01:52.480> eto<00:01:52.920> so

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
as things like at ETA or at eto so

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.150 
as things like at ETA or at eto so
Brooklyn<00:01:54.310> is<00:01:54.550> going<00:01:54.760> to<00:01:54.820> have<00:01:54.940> a<00:01:54.970> TT<00:01:55.360> I<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.710> I'm

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
Brooklyn is going to have a TT I so I'm

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.330 
Brooklyn is going to have a TT I so I'm
going<00:01:57.370> to<00:01:57.400> measure<00:01:57.550> her<00:01:57.880> knee<00:01:58.150> to<00:01:59.190> get<00:02:00.190> the

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
going to measure her knee to get the

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.980 
going to measure her knee to get the
angle<00:02:02.580> of<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.760> tibial<00:02:04.090> plateau<00:02:04.180> and<00:02:04.810> the

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
angle of the tibial plateau and the

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:12.280 
angle of the tibial plateau and the
changes<00:02:05.380> that<00:02:05.410> I<00:02:05.530> need<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:05.830> make<00:02:05.980> to<00:02:06.190> that

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.490 

so<00:02:13.159> I<00:02:13.189> measure<00:02:13.400> patella<00:02:13.879> ligament<00:02:14.290> four<00:02:15.290> point

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
so I measure patella ligament four point

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.339 
so I measure patella ligament four point
eight<00:02:15.590> centimeters<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.900> then<00:02:18.049> we<00:02:18.140> measure

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
eight centimeters and then we measure

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:27.399 
eight centimeters and then we measure
her<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.900> be<00:02:21.470> oppressed<00:02:21.860> osteotomy<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:27.290> we've

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
her to be oppressed osteotomy so we've

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.199 
her to be oppressed osteotomy so we've
got<00:02:27.530> four<00:02:27.739> point<00:02:27.980> seven<00:02:28.189> centimeters<00:02:29.000> and

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
got four point seven centimeters and

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.309 
got four point seven centimeters and
then<00:02:29.390> up<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:32.390> it's<00:02:32.480> about<00:02:32.629> five<00:02:32.900> point

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
then up to so it's about five point

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.440 
then up to so it's about five point
eight<00:02:33.530> centimeters<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:35.690> that's<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.409> fairly

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
eight centimeters and that's a fairly

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.839 
eight centimeters and that's a fairly
fairly<00:02:38.450> sort<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:39.159> expected<00:02:40.159> measurement<00:02:40.730> and

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
fairly sort of expected measurement and

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.660 
fairly sort of expected measurement and
a<00:02:40.879> dog<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.209> this<00:02:41.359> size<00:02:41.659> and<00:02:42.220> then<00:02:43.220> I'm<00:02:43.370> also

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
a dog of this size and then I'm also

00:02:43.670 --> 00:03:00.930 
a dog of this size and then I'm also
going<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:45.849> get<00:02:46.849> her<00:02:47.239> tibial<00:02:47.690> plateau<00:02:47.810> angle

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.750 

so<00:03:01.750> this<00:03:01.870> is<00:03:01.990> parallel<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.560> wire<00:03:03.040> her<00:03:03.340> tibial

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
so this is parallel to wire her tibial

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:17.120 
so this is parallel to wire her tibial
condyle<00:03:04.240> is<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:06.750> I'll<00:03:07.750> make<00:03:07.780> another

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.490 

what<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.760> nice<00:03:18.060> degrees<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.990> that<00:03:19.110> actually

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
what a nice degrees to that actually

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.170 
what a nice degrees to that actually
this<00:03:19.590> looks<00:03:19.860> like<00:03:20.070> that<00:03:20.490> is<00:03:20.730> probably<00:03:21.060> more

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
this looks like that is probably more

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.150 
this looks like that is probably more
like<00:03:21.450> her<00:03:21.660> angle

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:43.400 

I'll<00:03:25.610> be<00:03:25.730> better<00:03:25.880> than<00:03:26.120> egg

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:51.630 

okay

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:59.350 

around<00:03:52.640> about<00:03:53.319> 16<00:03:54.319> degrees<00:03:57.130> so<00:03:58.150> that's<00:03:59.150> quite

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
around about 16 degrees so that's quite

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.839 
around about 16 degrees so that's quite
a<00:03:59.420> big<00:03:59.630> angle<00:04:00.020> 16<00:04:00.530> degrees<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.160> dogs<00:04:01.400> of<00:04:01.640> this

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
a big angle 16 degrees and dogs of this

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.360 
a big angle 16 degrees and dogs of this
breed<00:04:02.019> that's<00:04:03.019> a<00:04:03.170> possible<00:04:03.620> angle<00:04:04.010> but<00:04:04.190> I'll

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
breed that's a possible angle but I'll

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.150 
breed that's a possible angle but I'll
probably<00:04:04.550> use<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.450> wedge<00:04:05.750> angle<00:04:06.200> of<00:04:06.319> 16<00:04:06.739> degrees

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
probably use a wedge angle of 16 degrees

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.580 
probably use a wedge angle of 16 degrees
as<00:04:07.519> about<00:04:08.209> a<00:04:08.269> maximum<00:04:08.810> for<00:04:08.930> this<00:04:09.050> dog<00:04:09.319> so

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
as about a maximum for this dog so

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.190 
as about a maximum for this dog so
she'll<00:04:09.769> have<00:04:09.800> a<00:04:09.950> 16<00:04:10.370> degree<00:04:10.640> wedge<00:04:10.849> so<00:04:11.720> she'll

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
she'll have a 16 degree wedge so she'll

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.290 
she'll have a 16 degree wedge so she'll
actually<00:04:12.590> have<00:04:12.830> a<00:04:12.860> wedge<00:04:13.220> of<00:04:13.400> bone<00:04:13.610> taken<00:04:14.000> out

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
actually have a wedge of bone taken out

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.250 
actually have a wedge of bone taken out
down<00:04:15.110> here<00:04:15.530> in<00:04:15.709> her<00:04:16.010> in<00:04:16.910> her<00:04:17.090> tibia<00:04:17.299> to<00:04:17.870> adjust

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
down here in her in her tibia to adjust

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.159 
down here in her in her tibia to adjust
the<00:04:18.620> tibial<00:04:18.950> plateau<00:04:19.209> to<00:04:20.209> increase<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.989> make

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
the tibial plateau to increase to make

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.730 
the tibial plateau to increase to make
it<00:04:21.380> so<00:04:21.799> the<00:04:21.979> tibial<00:04:22.310> plateau<00:04:22.430> becomes<00:04:22.880> flatter

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
it so the tibial plateau becomes flatter

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.740 
it so the tibial plateau becomes flatter
in<00:04:24.740> relation<00:04:25.280> to<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.580> tibial<00:04:25.910> other<00:04:26.270> femoral

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
in relation to the tibial other femoral

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.700 
in relation to the tibial other femoral
condyles<00:04:27.200> so<00:04:28.160> that<00:04:28.340> makes<00:04:28.610> it<00:04:29.410> possible<00:04:30.410> for

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
condyles so that makes it possible for

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.620 
condyles so that makes it possible for
her<00:04:31.010> to<00:04:31.040> have<00:04:31.250> normal<00:04:31.700> function<00:04:32.120> of<00:04:32.210> her<00:04:32.389> leg

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
her to have normal function of her leg

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.409 
her to have normal function of her leg
without<00:04:33.110> actually<00:04:33.500> having<00:04:33.650> a<00:04:33.950> a<00:04:34.550> cruciate

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
without actually having a a cruciate

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.810 
without actually having a a cruciate
ligament
