00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.909
 now we are in try-out then let that 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.260
 beautiful see 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.420
 I am also not with Tom then 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.670
 prosecuted 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.290
 settings that thin 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.150
 Manage your favorite way home location 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.280
 and safety 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.240
 those are institutions suggest that 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.090
 comes our prayer house 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.920
 then tonton warned about what is possible 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.659
 interesting that you and also as 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.130
 for example, the deduction that he leaves that 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.810
 he hear that 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.820
 You have the view that can set 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.420
 the number of functions that it does demonstrate 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.740
 what was still going on was a street name 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.250
 because what we are at the moment 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.299
 understand 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.430
 and we don't know anything about it 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.760
 forms of comes to itself from the 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.760
 cupboards 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.119
 I am engraving this morning by xander we 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.920
 are now a number 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.310
 and of course and burn when i am slow 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.170
 logos and one of course 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.509
 round starts to vote from is from at 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.159
 until he are also the multiple languages ​​too 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.030
 to gain 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.300
 there are still a number of settings 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.190
 that point but let's just go to it 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.410
 navigation screen 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.880
 it does look very much known from 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.050
 you 're not on the road so can't 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.519
 a lot of course but we are quite the 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.860
 are here for example how 8 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.870
 hour drive how fast you can drive 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.489
 So that important to me naturally 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.620
 think that really not really thumb must 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.600
 look very well then to see what you 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.910
 can you now brown free for the frieze 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.340
 must do peace falls as law because the 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.690
 maximum allowed speed is what is 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.220
 nicely done is that a small minute 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.010
 is making the sound louder and softer 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.290
 you can move where you can zoom out 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.180
 zooming in on the map and the voice from you 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.300
 put and can set rich and the 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.850
 night over empire daytime then come to 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.130
 here with temple agents do it 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.190
 works great as far as I am concerned 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.299
 could rate update here then your has 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.170
 I actually kinda like 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.340
 it gwen the 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.350
 then it must be fair , above all 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.820
 dom tower becomes cold 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.500
 anyway i'm on my own again 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.200
 I am also a luxury enthusiast 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.489
 have my mouth fit costs 40 euros 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.260
 because there is a nice article with it 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.630
 what to do because the prices thereof exience 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.630
 are up to tons for him never
