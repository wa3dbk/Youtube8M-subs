that's<00:02:33.420> not<00:02:33.569> what<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.810> wanted<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.260> see<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.970> let<00:02:35.970> me

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
that's not what I wanted to see I let me

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.690 
that's not what I wanted to see I let me
just<00:02:36.329> go<00:02:36.480> back<00:02:36.659> to<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.200> desktop<00:02:37.769> for<00:02:37.799> a<00:02:38.040> second

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
just go back to the desktop for a second

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.520 
just go back to the desktop for a second
or<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:39.180> file<00:02:39.390> manager<00:02:39.959> will<00:02:40.110> probably<00:02:40.409> be

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
or the file manager will probably be

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.679 
or the file manager will probably be
better<00:02:40.739> so<00:02:41.129> see<00:02:41.400> see<00:02:41.909> here<00:02:42.150> we<00:02:42.329> have<00:02:42.540> the

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
better so see see here we have the

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:49.339 
better so see see here we have the
folder<00:02:43.049> desktop<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.769> CPI<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:48.750> do<00:02:49.019> we<00:02:49.140> have

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
folder desktop and CPI and do we have

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:56.330 
folder desktop and CPI and do we have
minecraft<00:02:49.680> -<00:02:50.670> P<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:52.220> yes<00:02:53.220> we<00:02:53.250> do<00:02:55.010> maybe<00:02:56.010> if<00:02:56.220> I

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
minecraft - P I yes we do maybe if I

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.550 
minecraft - P I yes we do maybe if I
just<00:02:56.519> click<00:02:56.730> execute<00:02:57.180> from<00:02:57.480> there<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:58.019> let<00:02:58.409> that

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
just click execute from there I let that

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.899 
just click execute from there I let that
work<00:03:00.140> so<00:03:01.140> yeah<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:01.439> is<00:03:01.500> basically<00:03:01.909> minecraft

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
work so yeah this is basically minecraft

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.849 
work so yeah this is basically minecraft
let's<00:03:03.239> just<00:03:03.450> get<00:03:03.599> everything<00:03:04.019> else<00:03:04.409> out<00:03:04.799> of

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
let's just get everything else out of

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.839 
let's just get everything else out of
the<00:03:05.099> way<00:03:05.220> here

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:13.699 

I'm<00:03:08.849> not<00:03:09.239> sure<00:03:09.540> if<00:03:09.870> it's<00:03:10.079> possible<00:03:10.349> -<00:03:12.500> yep<00:03:13.500> it's

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
I'm not sure if it's possible - yep it's

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.009 
I'm not sure if it's possible - yep it's
at<00:03:13.859> full<00:03:14.099> screen<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.819> it<00:03:15.299> all<00:03:15.480> looks<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.870> little

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
at full screen and it all looks a little

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.140 
at full screen and it all looks a little
bit<00:03:16.260> messed<00:03:16.530> up<00:03:16.799> that<00:03:17.069> this<00:03:17.159> is<00:03:17.340> only<00:03:17.489> an<00:03:17.879> alpha

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
bit messed up that this is only an alpha

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.020 
bit messed up that this is only an alpha
build<00:03:18.659> and<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.709> looks<00:03:19.889> to<00:03:20.040> be<00:03:20.069> lagging<00:03:20.459> a

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
build and it looks to be lagging a

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.300 
build and it looks to be lagging a
little<00:03:21.299> bit<00:03:21.659> to<00:03:22.049> be<00:03:22.200> honest<00:03:22.530> see<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.099> is

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
little bit to be honest see it is

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.399 
little bit to be honest see it is
lagging<00:03:23.639> a<00:03:23.879> bit<00:03:25.970> your<00:03:26.970> peeps<00:03:27.299> are<00:03:27.599> switching

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
lagging a bit your peeps are switching

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.229 
lagging a bit your peeps are switching
back<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.920> desktop<00:03:29.250> in<00:03:29.519> between<00:03:29.879> the<00:03:30.090> apps

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
back to the desktop in between the apps

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.849 
back to the desktop in between the apps
and<00:03:30.599> maybe<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:30.840> need<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.079> get<00:03:31.319> it<00:03:31.440> out<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.590> full

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
and maybe I need to get it out of full

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.530 
and maybe I need to get it out of full
screen<00:03:31.920> mode<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.459> I<00:03:32.849> shouldn't<00:03:33.209> see<00:03:33.299> it<00:03:33.420> is

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
screen mode so I shouldn't see it is

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.270 
screen mode so I shouldn't see it is
fully<00:03:33.840> buggy

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
fully buggy

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.650 
fully buggy
so<00:03:35.280> yeah<00:03:35.430> it's<00:03:35.609> better<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:36.030> just<00:03:36.180> keep<00:03:36.269> it<00:03:36.569> in

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
so yeah it's better to just keep it in

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.330 
so yeah it's better to just keep it in
this<00:03:36.840> smaller<00:03:37.199> mode<00:03:37.500> here<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:37.949> it<00:03:38.040> seems<00:03:38.250> to

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
this smaller mode here and it seems to

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.069 
this smaller mode here and it seems to
be<00:03:38.459> working<00:03:38.699> better<00:03:39.090> in<00:03:39.359> this<00:03:39.510> smaller<00:03:39.780> mode

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
be working better in this smaller mode

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.890 
be working better in this smaller mode
now<00:03:40.919> let's<00:03:41.190> go<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.669> start<00:03:42.120> game<00:03:42.419> create<00:03:43.349> road

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
now let's go to start game create road

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.270 
now let's go to start game create road
I'm<00:03:45.900> not<00:03:46.139> sure<00:03:46.319> if<00:03:46.470> there<00:03:46.650> was<00:03:46.739> any<00:03:46.919> sound

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
I'm not sure if there was any sound

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.250 
I'm not sure if there was any sound
though<00:03:47.699> I<00:03:47.730> don't<00:03:47.879> have<00:03:48.060> any<00:03:48.209> speakers<00:03:48.660> writing

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
though I don't have any speakers writing

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.080 
though I don't have any speakers writing
to<00:03:49.410> my<00:03:49.500> Raspberry<00:03:50.040> Pi<00:03:50.069> so<00:03:50.609> I<00:03:50.669> wouldn't<00:03:50.910> work

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
to my Raspberry Pi so I wouldn't work

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.289 
to my Raspberry Pi so I wouldn't work
anyhow<00:03:51.569> I<00:03:51.919> can<00:03:52.919> trick<00:03:53.129> you<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.400> my<00:03:53.549> earphone<00:03:53.910> so

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
anyhow I can trick you to my earphone so

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.650 
anyhow I can trick you to my earphone so
there's<00:03:54.540> no<00:03:54.690> point<00:03:54.959> really<00:03:56.120> so<00:03:57.120> it<00:03:57.329> isn't

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
there's no point really so it isn't

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.509 
there's no point really so it isn't
going<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.989> be<00:03:58.139> super<00:03:58.560> fast<00:03:58.769> running<00:03:59.220> on<00:03:59.400> this

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
going to be super fast running on this

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.280 
going to be super fast running on this
device<00:03:59.579> so<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.329> fact<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.599> I<00:04:00.750> commanded<00:04:01.139> in

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
device so the fact that I commanded in

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.530 
device so the fact that I commanded in
the<00:04:01.410> first<00:04:01.620> place<00:04:01.919> is<00:04:02.190> pretty<00:04:02.430> cool<00:04:02.699> let's<00:04:03.299> see

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
the first place is pretty cool let's see

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.539 
the first place is pretty cool let's see
if<00:04:03.690> we<00:04:03.840> can<00:04:04.019> see<00:04:04.169> it<00:04:04.290> in<00:04:04.379> action<00:04:07.549> it's

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
if we can see it in action it's

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:15.650 
if we can see it in action it's
currently<00:04:08.940> generating<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.720> world<00:04:09.900> now

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.539 

and<00:04:16.660> yeah<00:04:17.049> it<00:04:17.230> feels<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.620> be<00:04:17.739> working<00:04:20.549> that's

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
and yeah it feels to be working that's

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:34.190 
and yeah it feels to be working that's
pretty<00:04:21.880> cool

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.560 

but<00:04:34.800> yeah<00:04:35.010> that's<00:04:35.490> pretty<00:04:35.700> much<00:04:35.970> it<00:04:36.150> for<00:04:36.360> this

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
but yeah that's pretty much it for this

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.570 
but yeah that's pretty much it for this
video<00:04:36.960> really<00:04:37.320> I<00:04:37.470> just<00:04:37.740> wanted<00:04:37.980> to<00:04:38.130> basically

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
video really I just wanted to basically

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.170 
video really I just wanted to basically
show<00:04:39.090> you<00:04:39.150> how<00:04:39.570> to<00:04:39.830> install<00:04:40.830> it<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:41.370> I

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
show you how to install it and I

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.660 
show you how to install it and I
basically<00:04:42.420> wanted<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.110> show<00:04:43.740> you<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:44.130> game<00:04:44.280> in

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
basically wanted to show you the game in

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.230 
basically wanted to show you the game in
action<00:04:44.820> running<00:04:45.480> on<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:45.780> Raspberry<00:04:45.930> Pi

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
action running on the Raspberry Pi

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.180 
action running on the Raspberry Pi
though<00:04:48.240> yeah<00:04:48.420> this<00:04:48.660> is<00:04:48.840> actually<00:04:49.290> pretty<00:04:49.650> neat

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
though yeah this is actually pretty neat

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.070 
though yeah this is actually pretty neat
you<00:04:50.610> know<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:50.820> Raspberry<00:04:51.240> Pi<00:04:51.300> isn't<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:51.900> most

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
you know the Raspberry Pi isn't the most

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.930 
you know the Raspberry Pi isn't the most
powerful<00:04:52.680> device<00:04:52.950> out<00:04:53.250> there<00:04:53.520> though<00:04:53.730> it<00:04:53.850> is

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
powerful device out there though it is

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.500 
powerful device out there though it is
you<00:04:54.360> know<00:04:54.480> obviously<00:04:54.660> powerful<00:04:55.470> enough<00:04:55.710> to
