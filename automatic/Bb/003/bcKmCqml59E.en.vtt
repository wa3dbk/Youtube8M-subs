00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.830
 so here is bruno how is ours 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.840
 I call him lily of the valley school we know it's my colleague 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.959
 of work that loses 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:09.939
 tweak it 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:13.299
 so you take your less than 80 hundredths average difficulty in the 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.609
 back 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:17.939
 quite simply 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.939
 a loop all that has more beautiful 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.640
 as for done to buckle 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.820
 it is at this address inside 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.190
 like classic white pauriol 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.220
 time precepta 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.530
 it blocks 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.610
 for 3 who can do more behind you 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.880
 from 10 to 15 centimeters 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.680
 greedy thuram 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.680
 he turns 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.810
 so you get up 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.370
 and return 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.370
 nearly 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.540
 once we are there 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.540
 I take your piece 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.730
 the painter in the loop 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.730
 as toxic 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.130
 child without father 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.740
 worship 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.650
 between five and six times 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.290
 even four or five 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.290
 it's enough 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.380
 in the field after page 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.130
 totally different 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.380
 spurs who are absent 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.380
 once they are net at this point 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.430
 you take your blue 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.430
 no other country he has to 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.149
 study that still has limitations 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.149
 and there you will see the loop that is behind 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:18.659
 once we are there 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.659
 if we put everything back flat 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.789
 and two pieces of press 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:27.789
 that is to say the small and your body of the mines 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.699
 you take your two pieces 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:32.989
 of claude 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.989
 alas you shoot all four at the same time 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.919
 see you soon 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.919
 once you've pulled the four well 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.369
 more than the big 

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:55.369
 2 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:58.869
 after 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:01.869
 ap cut the pieces 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:03.980
 and then we're done
