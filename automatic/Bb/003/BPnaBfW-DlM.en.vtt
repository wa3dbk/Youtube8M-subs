in<00:00:00.530> this<00:00:01.130> video<00:00:01.430> we're<00:00:01.820> going<00:00:02.000> to<00:00:02.090> show

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:02.179 
in this video we're going to show

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:05.280 
in this video we're going to show
painting<00:00:02.840> simulation<00:00:03.469> using<00:00:03.739> CSR<00:00:04.520> robotics

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:05.290 
painting simulation using CSR robotics

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.510 
painting simulation using CSR robotics
the<00:00:06.290> first<00:00:06.529> thing<00:00:06.709> we're<00:00:06.830> going<00:00:07.009> to<00:00:07.100> do<00:00:07.339> is

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:07.520 
the first thing we're going to do is

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.150 
the first thing we're going to do is
design<00:00:07.850> a<00:00:07.910> paint<00:00:08.300> plume<00:00:08.690> that<00:00:08.990> we'll<00:00:09.410> use<00:00:09.769> to

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
design a paint plume that we'll use to

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.720 
design a paint plume that we'll use to
then<00:00:10.849> paint<00:00:11.269> apart<00:00:11.860> so<00:00:12.860> to<00:00:12.950> design<00:00:13.370> a<00:00:13.400> paint

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
then paint apart so to design a paint

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.099 
then paint apart so to design a paint
blom<00:00:14.089> will<00:00:14.780> first<00:00:15.110> open<00:00:15.410> up<00:00:16.070> the<00:00:16.779> create<00:00:17.779> paint

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:18.109 
blom will first open up the create paint

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.080 
blom will first open up the create paint
plume<00:00:18.439> panel<00:00:18.949> and<00:00:19.100> give<00:00:19.279> it<00:00:19.400> a<00:00:19.490> name<00:00:19.699> and<00:00:20.000> then

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
plume panel and give it a name and then

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.269 
plume panel and give it a name and then
we'll<00:00:20.240> choose<00:00:20.420> a<00:00:20.480> shape<00:00:20.869> to<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:21.260> plume<00:00:21.500> this

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
we'll choose a shape to the plume this

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.580 
we'll choose a shape to the plume this
can<00:00:22.490> either<00:00:22.580> be<00:00:22.699> a<00:00:22.849> cone<00:00:23.240> or<00:00:23.539> a<00:00:23.599> bell<00:00:24.260> shape

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
can either be a cone or a bell shape

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.370 
can either be a cone or a bell shape
will<00:00:25.490> use<00:00:25.670> the<00:00:25.880> cone<00:00:26.150> and<00:00:26.480> use<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:26.990> default

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
will use the cone and use the default

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.769 
will use the cone and use the default
values<00:00:27.830> then<00:00:28.609> you<00:00:28.760> want<00:00:28.939> to<00:00:29.000> give<00:00:29.179> it<00:00:29.300> a<00:00:29.390> paint

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
values then you want to give it a paint

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.810 
values then you want to give it a paint
deposition<00:00:30.619> function<00:00:31.130> you<00:00:31.550> can<00:00:31.699> either

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
deposition function you can either

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.600 
deposition function you can either
measure<00:00:32.150> an<00:00:32.480> actual<00:00:32.930> plume<00:00:33.320> then<00:00:34.070> then<00:00:34.310> we<00:00:34.460> can

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
measure an actual plume then then we can

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.400 
measure an actual plume then then we can
enter<00:00:34.910> those<00:00:35.090> values<00:00:35.540> into<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:35.930> computer<00:00:36.380> and

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
enter those values into the computer and

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.310 
enter those values into the computer and
use<00:00:36.710> those<00:00:37.040> or<00:00:37.340> we<00:00:38.240> can<00:00:38.390> use<00:00:38.510> a<00:00:38.540> mathematical

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
use those or we can use a mathematical

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.950 
use those or we can use a mathematical
function<00:00:39.770> such<00:00:40.040> as<00:00:40.070> a<00:00:40.600> Gaussian<00:00:41.600> or<00:00:41.720> a<00:00:41.780> by

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
function such as a Gaussian or a by

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.790 
function such as a Gaussian or a by
Gaussian<00:00:42.440> to<00:00:43.280> simulate<00:00:43.790> paint<00:00:44.120> flow<00:00:44.420> if<00:00:45.020> we

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
Gaussian to simulate paint flow if we

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.100 
Gaussian to simulate paint flow if we
use<00:00:45.950> a<00:00:46.420> Gaussian<00:00:47.420> distribution<00:00:48.310> we<00:00:49.310> also<00:00:49.490> use

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
use a Gaussian distribution we also use

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.560 
use a Gaussian distribution we also use
on<00:00:51.110> the<00:00:51.800> left<00:00:52.010> missed<00:00:52.460> pressure<00:00:52.880> air<00:00:53.240> pressure

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
on the left missed pressure air pressure

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.260 
on the left missed pressure air pressure
dry<00:00:53.960> weight<00:00:54.200> and<00:00:54.350> flow<00:00:54.650> rate<00:00:54.920> when<00:00:55.760> we<00:00:55.880> when<00:00:56.240> we

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
dry weight and flow rate when we when we

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.540 
dry weight and flow rate when we when we
compute<00:00:56.750> how<00:00:56.900> much<00:00:57.080> paint<00:00:57.470> is<00:00:57.710> being

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
compute how much paint is being

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.690 
compute how much paint is being
deposited<00:00:59.030> by<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.570> plume<00:00:59.930> and<00:01:00.280> here's<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:01.340> step

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
deposited by the plume and here's a step

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.910 
deposited by the plume and here's a step
that<00:01:01.730> we<00:01:02.060> do<00:01:02.270> to<00:01:02.510> speed<00:01:02.840> up<00:01:03.020> the<00:01:03.050> simulation<00:01:03.410> we

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
that we do to speed up the simulation we

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.980 
that we do to speed up the simulation we
call<00:01:04.190> it<00:01:04.400> integration<00:01:05.150> so<00:01:05.360> this<00:01:05.600> red<00:01:05.960> line

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
call it integration so this red line

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.190 
call it integration so this red line
that<00:01:06.530> goes<00:01:06.590> through<00:01:06.770> the<00:01:07.070> plume<00:01:07.370> is<00:01:08.200> actually

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
that goes through the plume is actually

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.020 
that goes through the plume is actually
the<00:01:09.320> line<00:01:09.590> that<00:01:09.860> we're<00:01:10.070> integrating<00:01:10.880> the

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
the line that we're integrating the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.690 
the line that we're integrating the
paint<00:01:11.330> along<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:12.890> we're<00:01:13.070> summing<00:01:13.550> up<00:01:13.640> the

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
paint along so we're summing up the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.360 
paint along so we're summing up the
paint<00:01:14.060> as<00:01:14.300> it<00:01:14.480> were<00:01:14.840> to<00:01:15.020> pass<00:01:15.230> over<00:01:15.650> that<00:01:15.680> point

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
paint as it were to pass over that point

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.070 
paint as it were to pass over that point
and<00:01:16.610> cause<00:01:16.850> that<00:01:16.880> line<00:01:17.420> to<00:01:17.600> go<00:01:17.750> through<00:01:17.990> the

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
and cause that line to go through the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.130 
and cause that line to go through the
plume<00:01:18.520> here<00:01:19.520> will<00:01:19.700> show<00:01:19.910> it<00:01:20.090> on<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.930> paint

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
plume here will show it on the paint

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.100 
plume here will show it on the paint
bloom<00:01:21.380> on<00:01:21.560> a<00:01:21.590> static<00:01:22.220> plate<00:01:22.790> you<00:01:23.540> can<00:01:23.690> see<00:01:23.900> from

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
bloom on a static plate you can see from

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.550 
bloom on a static plate you can see from
the<00:01:24.400> update<00:01:25.400> that<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.820> red<00:01:26.150> is<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.560> thick

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
the update that the red is the thick

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.200 
the update that the red is the thick
part<00:01:27.800> because<00:01:28.700> this<00:01:28.820> is<00:01:28.940> a<00:01:28.970> Gaussian

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
part because this is a Gaussian

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.720 
part because this is a Gaussian
distribution<00:01:29.900> we're<00:01:30.380> using<00:01:30.560> kind<00:01:31.220> of<00:01:31.370> thin<00:01:31.610> at

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
distribution we're using kind of thin at

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.149 
distribution we're using kind of thin at
the<00:01:31.850> edges<00:01:32.140> then<00:01:33.140> we<00:01:33.260> can<00:01:33.440> show<00:01:33.650> this<00:01:33.800> along<00:01:34.130> a

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
the edges then we can show this along a

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.230 
the edges then we can show this along a
moving<00:01:34.730> plate<00:01:35.120> and<00:01:35.470> we<00:01:36.470> can<00:01:36.650> see<00:01:36.890> that<00:01:36.920> the

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
moving plate and we can see that the

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.880 
moving plate and we can see that the
same<00:01:38.240> kind<00:01:38.270> of<00:01:38.690> paint<00:01:38.930> deposition<00:01:39.560> applies

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
same kind of paint deposition applies

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.899 
same kind of paint deposition applies
but<00:01:40.220> to<00:01:40.430> a<00:01:40.460> moving<00:01:40.970> pattern

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
but to a moving pattern

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.469 
but to a moving pattern
let's<00:01:42.539> go<00:01:42.689> back<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.109> use<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> by<00:01:43.590> Gaussian

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
let's go back and use a by Gaussian

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.880 
let's go back and use a by Gaussian
distribution<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.170> show<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.499> difference

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
distribution just to show the difference

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.130 
distribution just to show the difference
of<00:01:46.979> by<00:01:47.159> Gaussian<00:01:47.780> distribution<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.869> also

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
of by Gaussian distribution is also

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.230 
of by Gaussian distribution is also
often<00:01:49.380> produced<00:01:50.069> by<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> paint<00:01:50.670> gun<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.060> has<00:01:51.210> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
often produced by a paint gun that has a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.959 
often produced by a paint gun that has a
little<00:01:51.509> plug<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:53.159> orifice<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
little plug in the orifice that the

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:55.730 
little plug in the orifice that the
paint<00:01:54.210> comes<00:01:54.450> out<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:54.899> not<00:01:55.079> much<00:01:55.289> paint<00:01:55.619> is

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
paint comes out so not much paint is

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.190 
paint comes out so not much paint is
deposited<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.579> center<00:01:57.149> but<00:01:57.329> it's<00:01:57.959> more

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
deposited in the center but it's more

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.699 
deposited in the center but it's more
around<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.619> edges<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.420> plume<00:02:00.530> so<00:02:01.530> we'll

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
around the edges of the plume so we'll

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.219 
around the edges of the plume so we'll
do<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.450> integration<00:02:03.450> again<00:02:03.959> and<00:02:04.140> we'll

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
do this integration again and we'll

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.859 
do this integration again and we'll
compute<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.740> flow<00:02:05.450> through<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.599> paint

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
compute the flow through the paint

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.300 
compute the flow through the paint
plumes<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.349> that<00:02:07.500> we<00:02:07.619> can<00:02:07.740> just<00:02:07.770> look<00:02:08.069> that

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
plumes so that we can just look that

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.130 
plumes so that we can just look that
value<00:02:08.670> up<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.849> increase<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.720> improve<00:02:09.989> our

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
value up to increase to improve our

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.589 
value up to increase to improve our
simulation<00:02:10.769> speed<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.400> then<00:02:12.269> we'll<00:02:12.390> go<00:02:12.510> ahead

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
simulation speed and then we'll go ahead

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.559 
simulation speed and then we'll go ahead
and<00:02:12.720> will<00:02:12.930> simulate<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.590> on<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.739> flat<00:02:14.099> plate<00:02:14.569> and

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
and will simulate it on a flat plate and

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.180 
and will simulate it on a flat plate and
we<00:02:15.780> simulate<00:02:16.170> on<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.319> flat<00:02:16.530> plate<00:02:16.769> you<00:02:16.890> can<00:02:17.010> see

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
we simulate on a flat plate you can see

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.490 
we simulate on a flat plate you can see
the<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.849> hole<00:02:18.120> left<00:02:18.480> behind<00:02:18.900> by<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.170> paint

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
the the hole left behind by the paint

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.030 
the the hole left behind by the paint
not<00:02:19.769> in<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.040> center<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.440> has<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.650> ring

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
not in the center and it has a ring

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.460 
not in the center and it has a ring
where<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.400> heavy<00:02:23.879> pain<00:02:24.209> is<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.690> then<00:02:25.319> we'll

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
where the heavy pain is and then we'll

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.610 
where the heavy pain is and then we'll
look<00:02:25.590> at<00:02:25.799> it<00:02:25.950> on<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.420> moving<00:02:27.420> plate<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.110> there

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
look at it on a moving plate and there

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.819 
look at it on a moving plate and there
you<00:02:28.769> can<00:02:28.799> see<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.930> distribution<00:02:31.500> doesn't

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
you can see the the distribution doesn't

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.349 
you can see the the distribution doesn't
matter<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.099> much<00:02:32.459> that<00:02:32.700> there's<00:02:32.879> a<00:02:32.940> missing

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
matter that much that there's a missing

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:34.970 
matter that much that there's a missing
part<00:02:33.599> because<00:02:33.959> you<00:02:34.079> still<00:02:34.349> get<00:02:34.500> pretty<00:02:34.769> good

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
part because you still get pretty good

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.119 
part because you still get pretty good
coverage<00:02:35.370> through<00:02:35.609> that<00:02:35.790> whole<00:02:35.940> thing<00:02:37.129> so

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
coverage through that whole thing so

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.979 
coverage through that whole thing so
let's<00:02:38.310> use<00:02:38.489> this<00:02:38.670> plume<00:02:39.000> actually<00:02:39.569> load<00:02:39.750> in<00:02:39.900> a

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
let's use this plume actually load in a

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.099 
let's use this plume actually load in a
work<00:02:40.200> cell<00:02:40.500> with<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.709> ABB<00:02:41.670> 3200<00:02:42.510> robot<00:02:42.870> that's

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
work cell with a ABB 3200 robot that's

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.670 
work cell with a ABB 3200 robot that's
painting<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.849> apart<00:02:45.109> we've<00:02:46.109> we've<00:02:46.440> eliminated

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
painting a apart we've we've eliminated

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.270 
painting a apart we've we've eliminated
all<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:48.540> guard<00:02:48.810> rails<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.650> fixture

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
all the the guard rails and the fixture

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.920 
all the the guard rails and the fixture
holding<00:02:50.639> the<00:02:50.760> part<00:02:51.000> just<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:51.359> we<00:02:51.480> can<00:02:51.599> see<00:02:51.810> it

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
holding the part just so we can see it

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.979 
holding the part just so we can see it
more<00:02:52.109> clearly<00:02:52.849> so<00:02:53.849> we'll<00:02:54.000> paint<00:02:54.239> both<00:02:54.660> sides

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
more clearly so we'll paint both sides

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.220 
more clearly so we'll paint both sides
of<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.349> part<00:02:56.690> first<00:02:57.690> thing<00:02:57.930> we'll<00:02:58.049> do<00:02:58.200> is

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
of this part first thing we'll do is

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.110 
of this part first thing we'll do is
we'll<00:02:58.530> turn<00:02:58.739> on<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.130> paint<00:02:59.370> so<00:02:59.579> when<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.849> moves

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
we'll turn on the paint so when it moves

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.930 
we'll turn on the paint so when it moves
through<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.329> pa's<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.750> applies<00:03:01.019> paint<00:03:01.410> and

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
through the pa's it applies paint and

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.280 
through the pa's it applies paint and
then<00:03:02.940> we'll<00:03:03.120> create<00:03:03.359> will<00:03:03.720> open<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.079> program

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
then we'll create will open the program

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.450 
then we'll create will open the program
that's<00:03:04.919> been<00:03:05.069> created<00:03:05.639> to<00:03:05.849> paint<00:03:06.060> apart

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
that's been created to paint apart

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.030 
that's been created to paint apart
so<00:03:08.150> notice<00:03:08.450> on<00:03:08.630> this<00:03:08.780> side<00:03:09.080> on<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.560> back<00:03:09.770> side

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
so notice on this side on the back side

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.400 
so notice on this side on the back side
of<00:03:10.100> this<00:03:10.370> part<00:03:10.700> we're<00:03:11.150> going<00:03:11.300> to<00:03:11.360> use<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.780> sort

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
of this part we're going to use the sort

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.930 
of this part we're going to use the sort
of<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.740> path<00:03:13.040> up<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:13.850> down<00:03:14.030> motion<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:15.940> then

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
of a to path up and down motion and then

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.130 
of a to path up and down motion and then
you'll<00:03:17.090> see<00:03:17.270> on<00:03:17.360> the<00:03:17.450> other<00:03:17.570> side<00:03:17.810> will<00:03:17.960> use<00:03:18.110> a

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
you'll see on the other side will use a

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.260 
you'll see on the other side will use a
back<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:18.590> forth<00:03:18.800> motion<00:03:18.920> just<00:03:19.550> to<00:03:19.730> get

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
back and forth motion just to get

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.640 
back and forth motion just to get
different<00:03:20.420> ideas<00:03:20.930> how<00:03:21.080> you<00:03:21.170> would<00:03:21.410> paint

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
different ideas how you would paint

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.980 
different ideas how you would paint
apart<00:03:22.010> we<00:03:22.820> don't<00:03:23.000> really<00:03:23.150> concentrate<00:03:23.750> on<00:03:23.780> the

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
apart we don't really concentrate on the

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.280 
apart we don't really concentrate on the
edges<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:25.090> we<00:03:26.090> don't<00:03:26.210> really<00:03:26.330> concentrate<00:03:27.110> on

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
edges and we don't really concentrate on

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.050 
edges and we don't really concentrate on
getting<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.770> top<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.280> bottom<00:03:28.460> but<00:03:28.850> which

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
getting the top and the bottom but which

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.880 
getting the top and the bottom but which
you<00:03:29.210> would<00:03:29.690> have<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:30.050> do<00:03:30.200> but<00:03:30.350> this<00:03:30.500> is<00:03:30.620> a<00:03:30.650> good

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
you would have to do but this is a good

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.220 
you would have to do but this is a good
tool<00:03:31.070> for<00:03:31.100> for<00:03:32.060> visualizing<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:32.690> paint<00:03:32.960> and

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
tool for for visualizing the paint and

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.740 
tool for for visualizing the paint and
seeing<00:03:33.500> how<00:03:33.650> much<00:03:33.830> is<00:03:34.010> deposited<00:03:34.700> so<00:03:35.570> it<00:03:35.660> gives

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
seeing how much is deposited so it gives

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.500 
seeing how much is deposited so it gives
a<00:03:35.900> good<00:03:35.930> idea<00:03:36.110> of<00:03:36.560> verification<00:03:37.400> after<00:03:38.390> it

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
a good idea of verification after it

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.440 
a good idea of verification after it
gets<00:03:38.630> painted<00:03:38.990> then<00:03:39.830> we<00:03:40.400> can<00:03:40.700> open<00:03:41.180> up<00:03:41.270> that

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
gets painted then we can open up that

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.280 
gets painted then we can open up that
same<00:03:42.040> paint<00:03:43.150> update<00:03:44.150> table<00:03:44.420> that<00:03:44.750> shows<00:03:44.780> the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
same paint update table that shows the

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.530 
same paint update table that shows the
different<00:03:46.220> colors<00:03:46.520> corresponding<00:03:47.270> to<00:03:47.420> the

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
different colors corresponding to the

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.310 
different colors corresponding to the
thickness<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.310> we<00:03:49.310> can<00:03:49.490> see<00:03:49.700> that<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:50.320> you

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
thickness and we can see that the you

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.500 
thickness and we can see that the you
can<00:03:51.470> see<00:03:51.620> where<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:51.950> red<00:03:52.190> is<00:03:52.370> deposited<00:03:53.030> is

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
can see where the red is deposited is

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.240 
can see where the red is deposited is
the<00:03:53.810> heavy<00:03:54.080> so<00:03:54.680> let's<00:03:54.860> look<00:03:54.980> at<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.220> other

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
the heavy so let's look at the other

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.130 
the heavy so let's look at the other
side<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:55.820> we<00:03:55.910> can<00:03:56.060> see<00:03:56.240> that<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.450> streak<00:03:56.870> down

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
side and we can see that the streak down

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.960 
side and we can see that the streak down
the<00:03:57.320> centers<00:03:57.680> where<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:57.920> two<00:03:58.640> plumes

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
the centers where the two plumes

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.670 
the centers where the two plumes
overlaps<00:03:59.450> we<00:03:59.660> get<00:03:59.780> a<00:03:59.810> lot<00:03:59.990> of<00:04:00.050> pain<00:04:00.380> down<00:04:00.620> there

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
overlaps we get a lot of pain down there

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.940 
overlaps we get a lot of pain down there
and<00:04:01.130> on<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.180> on<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.450> front<00:04:02.810> side<00:04:03.050> the

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
and on the on the front side the

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.280 
and on the on the front side the
back-and-forth<00:04:04.310> pattern<00:04:04.940> produced<00:04:05.290> some

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
back-and-forth pattern produced some

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.080 
back-and-forth pattern produced some
overlap<00:04:06.710> looks<00:04:07.070> like<00:04:07.220> that<00:04:07.370> yellow<00:04:07.730> streak

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
overlap looks like that yellow streak

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.050 
overlap looks like that yellow streak
has<00:04:08.600> more<00:04:08.960> paint<00:04:09.260> there<00:04:09.880> another<00:04:10.880> thing<00:04:11.030> we

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
has more paint there another thing we

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.110 
has more paint there another thing we
can<00:04:11.300> do<00:04:11.420> is<00:04:11.450> put<00:04:11.900> arrows<00:04:12.500> at<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.370> top<00:04:13.550> five

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
can do is put arrows at the top five

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.960 
can do is put arrows at the top five
vertices

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
vertices

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.300 
vertices
so<00:04:16.570> these<00:04:17.049> are<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.290> points<00:04:17.799> that<00:04:17.890> probably

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
so these are the points that probably

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.830 
so these are the points that probably
the<00:04:18.430> paint<00:04:18.700> will<00:04:18.850> drip<00:04:19.209> this<00:04:19.450> is<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:19.690> heaviest

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
the paint will drip this is the heaviest

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.100 
the paint will drip this is the heaviest
point<00:04:20.910> on<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.210> on<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.450> part<00:04:22.690> that<00:04:22.840> has<00:04:22.930> the

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
point on the on the part that has the

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.130 
point on the on the part that has the
most<00:04:23.320> pink<00:04:23.970> this<00:04:24.970> is<00:04:25.090> a<00:04:25.120> useful<00:04:25.300> tool<00:04:25.720> just<00:04:25.930> for

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
most pink this is a useful tool just for

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.170 
most pink this is a useful tool just for
quickly<00:04:26.350> figuring<00:04:26.860> out<00:04:26.980> where<00:04:27.190> the<00:04:27.340> most<00:04:27.550> most

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
quickly figuring out where the most most

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.810 
quickly figuring out where the most most
pain<00:04:28.480> is<00:04:28.720> so<00:04:29.620> from<00:04:29.800> this<00:04:29.920> simulation<00:04:30.400> we<00:04:30.670> can

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
pain is so from this simulation we can

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.150 
pain is so from this simulation we can
also<00:04:30.940> show<00:04:31.240> contour<00:04:32.080> maps<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:32.650> we<00:04:32.710> can<00:04:32.860> differ

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
also show contour maps and we can differ

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.370 
also show contour maps and we can differ
we<00:04:33.790> can<00:04:33.970> have<00:04:34.270> a<00:04:34.330> difference<00:04:34.810> between<00:04:34.930> two

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
we can have a difference between two

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.050 
we can have a difference between two
consecutive<00:04:35.860> paintings<00:04:36.490> to<00:04:36.580> see<00:04:36.760> how<00:04:36.850> they

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
consecutive paintings to see how they

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.780 
consecutive paintings to see how they
changed<00:04:37.510> so<00:04:38.470> these<00:04:38.590> are<00:04:38.650> tools<00:04:38.950> that<00:04:39.160> allow

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
changed so these are tools that allow

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.740 
changed so these are tools that allow
you<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:40.060> create<00:04:40.920> painting<00:04:41.920> paths<00:04:42.160> and

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
you to create painting paths and

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.030 
you to create painting paths and
simulate<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.870> paint<00:04:44.080> and<00:04:44.290> verify<00:04:44.910> thank<00:04:45.910> you
