 smog residents of small towns and villages 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.120
 Denmark is pleased to welcome migrants if 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.740
 Visitors get a job then 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.019
 everything is great because in this 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.730
 case they pay taxes we have one of 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.740
 lowest unemployment in 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.020
 the country and we are best able to cope with 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.240
 job search for migrants their influence 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.890
 definitely positive past 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.539

 birthrate immigrants turned out to be just 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.160
 by the way in many European countries 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.530
 the influx of migrants has caused social 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.079
 tension misunderstanding and even violence 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.620
 why did this town reach such 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.960
 success 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:49.469
 one of the main reasons may well be 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.840
 be this school and poked contact she 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.120

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.970
 individual meetings 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.259

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.259
 in the first 24 hours 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.799

 treat those who are different from them and 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.530
 even a simple greeting can be 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.509
