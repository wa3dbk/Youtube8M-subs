pac-man the classic video game character

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.060 
pac-man the classic video game character
carrot<00:00:10.800> okay<00:00:11.190> so<00:00:11.490> pac-man<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.420> we<00:00:13.410> all<00:00:13.559> know<00:00:13.799> he

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
carrot okay so pac-man is we all know he

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.140 
carrot okay so pac-man is we all know he
is<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.250> circular<00:00:15.059> being<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:16.170> let<00:00:16.920> us<00:00:17.160> begin

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
is a circular being so let us begin

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.800 
is a circular being so let us begin
we<00:00:18.570> need<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.779> circle<00:00:19.410> object<00:00:20.300> to<00:00:21.300> get<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.630> right

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
we need a circle object to get the right

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.759 
we need a circle object to get the right
shape<00:00:22.279> this<00:00:23.279> circle<00:00:23.850> will<00:00:24.000> be<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.439> decor<00:00:25.439> of

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
shape this circle will be the decor of

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.700 
shape this circle will be the decor of
the<00:00:26.160> pac-man<00:00:26.480> next<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.599> need<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.900> surround<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
the pac-man next we need to surround the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:38.030 
the pac-man next we need to surround the
core<00:00:29.010> with<00:00:30.470> several<00:00:31.470> other<00:00:31.980> items<00:00:35.540> yeah<00:00:37.040> this

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
core with several other items yeah this

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.470 
core with several other items yeah this
will<00:00:38.309> do<00:00:38.550> just<00:00:39.000> nicely<00:00:40.250> stack<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.430> all<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.790> as

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
will do just nicely stack it all up as

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.660 
will do just nicely stack it all up as
you<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.840> see<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.640> have<00:00:44.640> arranged<00:00:45.300> every<00:00:45.989> item

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
you can see I have arranged every item

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.410 
you can see I have arranged every item
into<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.700> nice<00:00:48.059> circular<00:00:48.960> shape<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.730> center

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
into a nice circular shape in the center

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.350 
into a nice circular shape in the center
of<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.930> table<00:00:52.199> okay<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.190> now<00:00:53.550> all<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:54.000> have<00:00:54.210> to

of the table okay so now all we have to
do<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.809> trace<00:00:55.230> around<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:57.210> circle<00:00:59.390> it's<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
do is trace around the circle it's the

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.870 
do is trace around the circle it's the
circle<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.280> love<00:01:03.559> okay<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.860> now<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.850> have

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
circle of love okay so now that we have

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.570 
circle of love okay so now that we have
the<00:01:06.210> circle<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.869> can<00:01:07.049> clear<00:01:07.439> off<00:01:07.619> yeah<00:01:07.950> keep

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the circle you can clear off yeah keep

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.000 
the circle you can clear off yeah keep
the<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> drawing<00:01:09.540> book<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> table<00:01:10.530> because

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
the a drawing book on the table because

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.330 
the a drawing book on the table because
see<00:01:11.520> now<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:13.229> perfect<00:01:13.799> circle

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
see now that we have this perfect circle

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.600 
see now that we have this perfect circle
we<00:01:15.090> know<00:01:15.330> what<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> circle<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.650> supposed<00:01:17.460> to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
we know what a circle is supposed to

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.179 
we know what a circle is supposed to
look<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:19.140> draw<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> smaller

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
look like so just draw it like a smaller

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.530 
look like so just draw it like a smaller
version<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.869> page<00:01:22.670> okay<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:23.700> now<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.210> have

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
version on the page okay so now we have

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.270 
version on the page okay so now we have
the<00:01:25.110> pac-man's<00:01:25.740> body

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
the pac-man's body

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.109 
the pac-man's body
we<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:27.210> need<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:28.229> draw<00:01:28.500> his<00:01:28.950> sexy<00:01:29.549> Mouse<00:01:29.820> ah

we just need to draw his sexy Mouse ah
this<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.689> different<00:01:31.229> from<00:01:31.439> my<00:01:31.770> usual<00:01:32.490> drawing

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
this is different from my usual drawing

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.859 
this is different from my usual drawing
technique<00:01:34.130> wherein<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.610> usually<00:01:36.299> start<00:01:36.720> with

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
technique wherein I usually start with

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.190 
technique wherein I usually start with
the<00:01:37.079> eyeballs<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:39.630> thing<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.020> that

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the eyeballs but the thing of that

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.440 
the eyeballs but the thing of that
pac-man<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:41.070> he<00:01:41.369> he<00:01:41.759> does<00:01:42.000> not<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.390> any

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
pac-man is he he does not have any

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.160 
pac-man is he he does not have any
eyeballs<00:01:43.820> it's<00:01:44.820> kind<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.119> sad<00:01:45.329> he's<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:45.990> this

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
eyeballs it's kind of sad he's just this

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.810 
eyeballs it's kind of sad he's just this
blind<00:01:46.500> guy<00:01:47.390> running<00:01:48.390> around<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.869> maze<00:01:49.820> rough

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
blind guy running around the maze rough

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.010 
blind guy running around the maze rough
eating<00:01:51.630> pellets<00:01:52.250> being<00:01:53.250> chased<00:01:53.520> by<00:01:53.759> ghosts

eating pellets being chased by ghosts
maybe<00:01:55.770> that's<00:01:56.130> why<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.369> relate<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.119> him<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.689> much

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
maybe that's why I relate to him so much

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.639 
maybe that's why I relate to him so much
because<00:01:59.369> I'd<00:01:59.670> like<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.270> eat<00:02:00.450> pellets<00:02:01.079> okay<00:02:01.590> so

a pac-man's mouse is like a triangle one
way<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.070> do<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.759> triangle<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.200> get<00:02:07.380> like<00:02:07.590> a

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
way to do a triangle is to get like a

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.999 
way to do a triangle is to get like a
pizza<00:02:08.099> slice<00:02:08.420> so<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.869> could<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.619> could<00:02:10.770> go<00:02:10.950> to

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
pizza slice so you could you could go to

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.460 
pizza slice so you could you could go to
like<00:02:11.250> pizza<00:02:11.790> calm<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.569> just<00:02:12.840> order<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> pizza
