hundreds<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.340> dollars<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.909> just<00:01:51.750> stuff<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
hundreds of dollars on just stuff in the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.649 
hundreds of dollars on just stuff in the
game<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.700> mean<00:01:54.000> people<00:01:54.149> could<00:01:54.390> do<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.540> same

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
game so I mean people could do the same

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.810 
game so I mean people could do the same
thing<00:01:54.899> with<00:01:55.020> diablo<00:01:55.409> 3<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.829> don't<00:01:56.520> see<00:01:56.640> why<00:01:56.790> not

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
thing with diablo 3 I don't see why not

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.670 
thing with diablo 3 I don't see why not
so<00:01:57.329> actually<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.750> prices<00:01:58.140> might<00:01:58.320> be<00:01:58.530> better

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
so actually the prices might be better

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.560 
so actually the prices might be better
than<00:01:58.979> we<00:01:59.430> think<00:01:59.579> right<00:01:59.790> now<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.329> really

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
than we think right now but it's really

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.810 
than we think right now but it's really
impossible<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.350> tell<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.490> other<00:02:02.610> thing<00:02:02.790> that

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
impossible to tell the other thing that

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.149 
impossible to tell the other thing that
we<00:02:03.060> need<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.270> touch<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.009> you<00:02:05.009> always

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
world in the diablo 3 world this is the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.839 
world in the diablo 3 world this is the
exact<00:02:26.540> opposite<00:02:27.319> long<00:02:27.650> term<00:02:27.950> prices<00:02:28.489> will<00:02:28.700> be

exact opposite long term prices will be

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.910 
exact opposite long term prices will be
going<00:02:29.209> down<00:02:29.569> because<00:02:29.930> more<00:02:30.319> people<00:02:30.349> will<00:02:30.799> be

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
going down because more people will be

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.220 
going down because more people will be
playing<00:02:31.280> getting<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.329> higher<00:02:32.540> levels<00:02:32.569> gear

playing getting to higher levels gear

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.890 
playing getting to higher levels gear
becomes<00:02:33.560> more<00:02:33.799> common<00:02:34.129> so<00:02:34.640> holding<00:02:35.510> on<00:02:35.720> to

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
becomes more common so holding on to

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.190 
becomes more common so holding on to
anything<00:02:36.049> is<00:02:36.709> just<00:02:37.489> a<00:02:37.639> really<00:02:37.970> bad<00:02:38.510> idea<00:02:38.810> if

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
anything is just a really bad idea if

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
think a really cool way to make money in

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.569 
think a really cool way to make money in
this<00:02:56.840> is<00:02:57.500> what<00:02:57.919> we're<00:02:58.040> going<00:02:58.159> to<00:02:58.250> call<00:02:58.400> the

this is what we're going to call the

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.789 
this is what we're going to call the
arbitrage<00:02:59.359> position<00:03:00.019> which<00:03:00.200> could<00:03:00.409> be<00:03:00.500> really

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
arbitrage position which could be really

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.860 
arbitrage position which could be really
cool<00:03:00.950> because<00:03:01.430> what<00:03:01.760> you're<00:03:01.849> doing<00:03:01.909> is<00:03:02.299> that

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
cool because what you're doing is that

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.240

it's really going to be no easy way to

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.029 
it's really going to be no easy way to

down<00:04:59.319> the<00:04:59.560> salmon<00:05:00.039> and<00:05:00.250> then<00:05:00.370> you<00:05:00.520> could<00:05:00.639> be

that<00:07:39.120> which<00:07:39.270> I<00:07:39.390> think<00:07:39.600> would<00:07:39.810> be<00:07:39.960> kind<00:07:40.140> of<00:07:40.200> cool

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:40.260 
that which I think would be kind of cool

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.330 
that which I think would be kind of cool
to<00:07:40.620> see<00:07:41.130> them<00:07:41.310> do<00:07:41.430> um<00:07:41.720> so<00:07:42.720> basically<00:07:43.280> these<00:07:44.280> are

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:44.340 
to see them do um so basically these are

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.220 
to see them do um so basically these are
some<00:07:44.850> of<00:07:44.880> the<00:07:44.940> ways<00:07:45.060> that<00:07:45.360> you<00:07:45.420> could<00:07:45.870> possibly

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.230 
some of the ways that you could possibly

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.140 
some of the ways that you could possibly
make<00:07:46.590> some<00:07:46.800> money<00:07:46.920> off<00:07:47.010> of<00:07:47.250> it<00:07:47.340> the<00:07:47.880> other

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.150 
make some money off of it the other

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.330 
make some money off of it the other
thing<00:07:48.360> is<00:07:48.390> that<00:07:48.510> I'd<00:07:48.780> tape<00:07:48.990> here<00:07:49.290> the<00:07:49.890> best<00:07:50.100> bet

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:50.340 
thing is that I'd tape here the best bet

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.370 
thing is that I'd tape here the best bet
is<00:07:50.520> just<00:07:50.670> go<00:07:50.970> to<00:07:51.030> in<00:07:51.240> front<00:07:51.450> as<00:07:51.690> far<00:07:51.960> as<00:07:52.080> you<00:07:52.200> can

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:52.380 
is just go to in front as far as you can

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.410 
is just go to in front as far as you can
and<00:07:52.620> sell<00:07:52.890> off<00:07:53.130> those<00:07:53.400> high<00:07:53.580> level<00:07:53.880> items<00:07:54.060> as

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:54.420 
and sell off those high level items as

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.240 
and sell off those high level items as
soon<00:07:55.050> as<00:07:55.200> possible<00:07:55.590> because<00:07:55.620> prices<00:07:55.980> are

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:56.250 
soon as possible because prices are

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.340 
soon as possible because prices are
going<00:07:56.400> down<00:07:56.550> so<00:07:57.540> I<00:07:57.600> guess<00:07:57.720> the<00:07:57.810> moral<00:07:58.020> story

00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:58.350 
going down so I guess the moral story

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.110 
going down so I guess the moral story
here<00:07:58.560> it's<00:07:58.710> just<00:07:58.770> sell<00:07:59.100> sell<00:07:59.370> sell<00:07:59.400> try<00:07:59.910> to<00:07:59.970> do

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 
here it's just sell sell sell try to do

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.450 
here it's just sell sell sell try to do
some<00:08:00.330> arbitrage<00:08:00.900> but<00:08:01.500> remember<00:08:01.950> there<00:08:02.430> is

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.460 
some arbitrage but remember there is

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.240 
some arbitrage but remember there is
risk<00:08:03.120> involved<00:08:03.740> anyways<00:08:04.740> I<00:08:04.860> hope<00:08:04.890> you<00:08:05.070> guys
