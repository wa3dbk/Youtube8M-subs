and you have him over here Seaton

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:27.560 
and you have him over here Seaton
shutting<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.760> off<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.150> on<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.480> off<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.869> on

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.560 

poisoning<00:00:28.500> us<00:00:28.680> still<00:00:29.150> maybe<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.420> had<00:00:30.539> a

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
poisoning us still maybe just had a

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.090 
poisoning us still maybe just had a
bunch<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.960> rain<00:00:32.300> look<00:00:33.300> at<00:00:33.420> all<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.950> toxic<00:00:34.950> in

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
bunch of rain look at all this toxic in

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.530 
bunch of rain look at all this toxic in
the<00:00:35.220> air<00:00:35.989> see<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.230> massive<00:00:37.739> thing<00:00:41.420> bring<00:00:42.420> it

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
the air see this massive thing bring it

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:57.260 
the air see this massive thing bring it
in<00:00:42.629> moisture

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.560 

look<00:00:57.870> at<00:00:57.990> how<00:00:58.080> it<00:00:58.230> shut<00:00:58.470> it<00:00:58.590> off<00:00:59.360> that<00:01:00.360> would<00:01:00.480> be

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
look at how it shut it off that would be

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.900 
look at how it shut it off that would be
impossible<00:01:00.900> if<00:01:01.380> that's<00:01:02.040> what<00:01:02.280> these<00:01:02.520> people

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
impossible if that's what these people

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.410 
impossible if that's what these people
think<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.390> real<00:01:03.810> is<00:01:04.620> a<00:01:04.680> contrail<00:01:05.370> and<00:01:06.150> wood

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
think it's real is a contrail and wood

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.710 
think it's real is a contrail and wood
from<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.350> engines<00:01:07.890> at<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.280> moisture<00:01:08.850> that

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
from the engines at the moisture that

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.500 
from the engines at the moisture that
means<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.260> uh<00:01:10.590> she<00:01:10.890> shut<00:01:11.310> his<00:01:11.460> engine<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.910> and

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
means that uh she shut his engine on and

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.450 
means that uh she shut his engine on and
the<00:01:13.050> aircraft<00:01:13.650> do<00:01:13.770> not<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.250> in

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
the aircraft do not do that in

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:23.030 
the aircraft do not do that in
mid-flight

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.000 

march<00:01:23.670> against<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.560> geoengineering<00:01:25.560> is

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
march against the geoengineering is

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.280 
march against the geoengineering is
coming<00:01:26.370> up<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.670> hope<00:01:26.900> everybody<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.170> to

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
coming up I hope everybody is going to

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.550 
coming up I hope everybody is going to
go

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.730 

and<00:01:35.890> they're<00:01:36.250> making<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.640> Sun<00:01:36.880> incredibly

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
and they're making the Sun incredibly

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.600 
and they're making the Sun incredibly
bright<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.939> usual<00:01:40.509> it's<00:01:40.659> just<00:01:40.960> it's

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
bright like usual it's just it's

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.090 
bright like usual it's just it's
intensified<00:01:42.610> because<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.990> Sun<00:01:44.229> is<00:01:44.259> toxic<00:01:44.890> now

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
intensified because the Sun is toxic now

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.749 
intensified because the Sun is toxic now
you<00:01:45.970> mean<00:01:46.180> it<00:01:46.329> in<00:01:47.289> a<00:01:47.439> way<00:01:47.619> it<00:01:47.770> was<00:01:48.039> but<00:01:48.549> you

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
you mean it in a way it was but you

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.700 
you mean it in a way it was but you
needed<00:01:49.119> it<00:01:49.270> look<00:01:49.600> there<00:01:49.810> he<00:01:49.960> goes<00:01:50.140> shut<00:01:50.920> it<00:01:50.950> up

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
needed it look there he goes shut it up

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.820 
needed it look there he goes shut it up
there's<00:01:53.710> your<00:01:53.890> proof<00:01:54.100> off<00:01:54.460> guys<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:56.170> is<00:01:56.380> this

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
there's your proof off guys this is this

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.819 
there's your proof off guys this is this
channel<00:01:57.220> I<00:01:57.310> mean<00:01:57.520> you<00:01:58.500> roll<00:01:59.500> through<00:01:59.679> this

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
channel I mean you roll through this

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.800 
channel I mean you roll through this
channel<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.460> check<00:02:00.490> out<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.030> videos<00:02:01.360> most<00:02:01.659> of

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
channel and check out the videos most of

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.370 
channel and check out the videos most of
you<00:02:01.899> have<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:03.220> you<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:04.479> proof<00:02:04.689> is<00:02:04.899> here<00:02:04.929> in

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
you have and you the proof is here in

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.380 
you have and you the proof is here in
many<00:02:05.860> places<00:02:06.159> I'm<00:02:06.520> not<00:02:06.640> saying<00:02:06.909> I'm<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.119> only

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
many places I'm not saying I'm the only

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.919 
many places I'm not saying I'm the only
one<00:02:07.659> not<00:02:08.019> by<00:02:08.229> far<00:02:08.530> but<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:09.850> proof<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:10.630> mean

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
one not by far but the proof is I mean

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.320 
one not by far but the proof is I mean
my<00:02:11.319> channel<00:02:11.680> alone<00:02:11.920> is<00:02:12.130> enough<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.430> wake

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
my channel alone is enough to wake

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.980 
my channel alone is enough to wake
somebody<00:02:13.660> up<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:14.049> suppose<00:02:16.620> take<00:02:17.620> care<00:02:17.799> guys
