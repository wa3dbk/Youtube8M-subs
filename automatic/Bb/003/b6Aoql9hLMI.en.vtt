anything that in was presented and what
we<00:00:24.310> came<00:00:24.519> up<00:00:24.669> with<00:00:24.730> to<00:00:24.970> bring<00:00:25.090> that

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:25.329 
we came up with to bring that

we came up with to bring that
traditional<00:00:26.019> ways<00:00:26.949> of<00:00:27.099> learning<00:00:27.279> math<00:00:27.730> and

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
traditional ways of learning math and

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.389 
traditional ways of learning math and
science<00:00:28.539> and<00:00:28.779> you<00:00:29.679> find<00:00:29.919> something<00:00:30.160> as<00:00:30.309> the

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:30.399 
science and you find something as the

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.149 
science and you find something as the
older<00:00:30.669> generations<00:00:31.419> their<00:00:31.750> mental<00:00:32.199> maths<00:00:32.500> is

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:33.159 
older generations their mental maths is

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:36.689 
older generations their mental maths is
probably<00:00:33.820> far<00:00:34.720> more<00:00:34.800> astute<00:00:35.800> than<00:00:36.129> sometimes

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
probably far more astute than sometimes

probably far more astute than sometimes
some<00:00:36.970> has<00:00:37.629> been<00:00:37.989> taught<00:00:38.290> in<00:00:38.530> schools

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
some has been taught in schools

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.710 
some has been taught in schools
currently<00:00:41.610> sometimes<00:00:42.610> there's<00:00:43.300> none<00:00:43.479> that

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
currently sometimes there's none that

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.930 
currently sometimes there's none that
relate<00:00:44.019> to<00:00:44.050> them<00:00:44.949> or<00:00:45.129> they<00:00:45.250> can<00:00:45.460> see<00:00:45.640> that<00:00:45.820> we

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
relate to them or they can see that we

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.600 
relate to them or they can see that we
make<00:00:46.120> you<00:00:46.360> know<00:00:46.479> who<00:00:46.629> looks<00:00:46.870> like<00:00:47.050> them<00:00:47.610> and

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
make you know who looks like them and

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.000 
make you know who looks like them and
there's<00:00:49.000> some<00:00:49.269> creative<00:00:49.840> and<00:00:50.289> great<00:00:50.649> people

certain I thing is is such a the medium

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.200 
certain I thing is is such a the medium
that's<00:01:19.840> around<00:01:20.170> now<00:01:20.590> that<00:01:21.520> there's<00:01:21.790> so<00:01:22.030> much

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
that's around now that there's so much

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.690 
that's around now that there's so much
creativity<00:01:22.780> in<00:01:23.110> YouTube<00:01:23.649> you<00:01:23.950> know<00:01:24.070> those

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
creativity in YouTube you know those

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.630 
creativity in YouTube you know those
skills<00:01:25.149> now<00:01:25.540> all<00:01:26.470> these<00:01:26.950> young<00:01:27.189> people<00:01:27.340> could

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
skills now all these young people could

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.450 
skills now all these young people could
be<00:01:27.759> creating<00:01:28.299> and<00:01:28.890> DVDs<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.070> what<00:01:30.250> they're

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
be creating and DVDs and what they're

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.899 
be creating and DVDs and what they're
learning<00:01:30.670> as<00:01:31.090> well<00:01:31.329> and<00:01:32.290> sharing<00:01:32.740> that<00:01:32.920> and

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
learning as well and sharing that and

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.609 
learning as well and sharing that and
using<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.270> older<00:01:34.509> generation<00:01:35.140> so<00:01:35.439> they've

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
using the older generation so they've

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.130 
using the older generation so they've
got<00:01:35.649> skills<00:01:36.130> sometimes<00:01:36.729> you<00:01:37.390> know<00:01:37.570> they<00:01:37.840> may

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
got skills sometimes you know they may

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.719 
got skills sometimes you know they may
feel<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.439> bit<00:01:38.619> redundant<00:01:38.920> or<00:01:39.250> I<00:01:39.310> think<00:01:39.549> you<00:01:39.610> know

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
feel a bit redundant or I think you know

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:40.970 
feel a bit redundant or I think you know
what<00:01:39.909> I<00:01:39.939> hope<00:01:40.119> you<00:01:40.299> know<00:01:40.329> nothing

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
what I hope you know nothing

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.700 
what I hope you know nothing
now<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:42.090> know<00:01:42.240> things<00:01:42.540> like<00:01:42.630> cooking<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
now you know things like cooking and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.580 
now you know things like cooking and
dressmaking<00:01:44.370> all<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.330> that<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.870> measurements

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
dressmaking all of that the measurements

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.710 
dressmaking all of that the measurements
the<00:01:46.710> masa<00:01:46.980> insides<00:01:47.730> that's<00:01:48.090> involved<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.570> all

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the masa insides that's involved in all

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.140 
the masa insides that's involved in all
of<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:49.190> that<00:01:50.190> definitely<00:01:50.460> comes<00:01:50.970> through

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
of that that definitely comes through

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.530 
of that that definitely comes through
you<00:01:51.600> know<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:53.340> know<00:01:53.460> here<00:01:53.700> dressings<00:01:54.270> you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
you know you know here dressings you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.870 
you know you know here dressings you
know<00:01:54.690> science<00:01:55.620> you<00:01:55.770> know<00:01:55.920> right<00:01:56.370> chemicals

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
know science you know right chemicals

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.660 
know science you know right chemicals
because<00:01:57.030> otherwise<00:01:57.300> they<00:01:58.050> fry<00:01:58.520> you<00:01:59.520> know

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
because otherwise they fry you know

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.370 
because otherwise they fry you know
Friday<00:02:00.060> don't<00:02:00.360> want<00:02:00.510> it<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.690> be<00:02:00.810> done<00:02:00.960> want<00:02:01.260> to
