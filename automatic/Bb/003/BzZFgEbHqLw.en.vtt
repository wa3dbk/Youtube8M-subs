00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
after I split it into two sections I'm

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.630 
after I split it into two sections I'm
going<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.840> basically<00:01:56.110> loop<00:01:56.500> makeup<00:01:57.130> make<00:01:57.460> two

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
going to basically loop makeup make two

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.850 
going to basically loop makeup make two
loops<00:01:57.910> so<00:01:58.540> one<00:01:58.960> loop<00:01:59.110> that<00:01:59.290> goes<00:01:59.320> up<00:01:59.590> and<00:01:59.800> one

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
loops so one loop that goes up and one

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.130 
loops so one loop that goes up and one
loop<00:02:00.130> that<00:02:00.310> goes<00:02:00.340> down<00:02:00.700> like<00:02:01.510> so<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.960> car

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
loop that goes down like so the car

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.400 
loop that goes down like so the car
looks<00:02:02.350> like<00:02:02.470> a<00:02:02.560> butterfly<00:02:03.130> I<00:02:03.160> guess<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:04.410> then

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
looks like a butterfly I guess and then

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.240 
looks like a butterfly I guess and then
hold<00:02:05.980> on<00:02:06.160> to<00:02:06.310> that<00:02:06.430> and<00:02:07.890> secure<00:02:08.890> that<00:02:09.040> with

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
hold on to that and secure that with

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.870 
hold on to that and secure that with
your<00:02:09.399> hair<00:02:09.580> tie<00:02:09.869> with<00:02:10.869> your<00:02:10.990> second<00:02:11.350> hair<00:02:11.470> tie

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880
