00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
needed on it and I want I think it's the

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.900 
needed on it and I want I think it's the
only<00:02:25.320> time<00:02:25.650> I've<00:02:25.860> actually<00:02:25.980> ever<00:02:26.310> won

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
tunnel to get to the instance and then

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.830 
tunnel to get to the instance and then
you<00:03:21.540> had<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.870> fight<00:03:22.170> some<00:03:22.470> mobs<00:03:23.480> before<00:03:24.480> you

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
could could get to the boss and that it

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.400 
could could get to the boss and that it
was<00:03:28.470> just<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:29.450> super<00:03:30.450> annoying<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.049> a<00:03:31.080> lot<00:03:31.290> of

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
was just a super annoying and a lot of

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.710 
was just a super annoying and a lot of
work<00:03:32.269> but<00:03:33.470> now<00:03:34.470> it's<00:03:34.769> very<00:03:35.250> very<00:03:35.760> easy<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:36.209> to

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
work but now it's very very easy to to

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.140 
work but now it's very very easy to to
get<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:36.989> those<00:03:37.470> two<00:03:37.830> frost<00:03:38.519> emblems<00:03:38.910> that<00:03:38.970> you
