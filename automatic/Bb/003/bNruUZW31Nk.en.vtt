for a question can you at least ram
other<00:01:19.890> ships<00:01:20.689> it's<00:01:21.689> not<00:01:21.899> one<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
other ships it's not one of the

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.260 
other ships it's not one of the
objectives<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.310> game<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:23.700> if<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.060> want

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
objectives of the game but if you want

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.440 
objectives of the game but if you want
to<00:01:24.360> go<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.079> a<00:01:25.200> later<00:01:25.759> psychotic<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.939> Captain

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
to go in a later psychotic and Captain

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.209 
to go in a later psychotic and Captain
you<00:01:27.570> could<00:01:27.780> actually<00:01:28.079> do<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.590> whole<00:01:28.979> trip

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:29.219 
you could actually do this whole trip

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:30.889 
you could actually do this whole trip
yes<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.700> knew<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.909> could<00:01:30.149> find<00:01:30.359> out<00:01:30.420> how<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.689> play

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
yes I knew I could find out how to play

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.069 
yes I knew I could find out how to play
the<00:01:30.960> game<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.500> could<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.280> good<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.780> say

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
the game you could do is good but I say

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.999 
the game you could do is good but I say
focuses<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.710> simulation<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.479> main<00:01:37.009> main

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
focuses on simulation so the main main

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.499 
focuses on simulation so the main main
objective<00:01:38.399> of<00:01:38.460> vessel<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:38.939> not<00:01:39.149> to<00:01:39.299> sing

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
objective of vessel is not to sing

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.569 
objective of vessel is not to sing
another<00:01:39.810> ramp<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.500> let's<00:01:40.680> focus<00:01:41.219> on<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.430> unless

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
another ramp so let's focus on it unless

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.240 
another ramp so let's focus on it unless
yeah<00:01:42.140> ok<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.500> object<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.130> actually

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
yeah ok so the object is to actually

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.359 
yeah ok so the object is to actually
stay<00:01:44.609> afloat<00:01:44.880> yeah<00:01:45.240> that's<00:01:45.509> that's<00:01:45.750> hard<00:01:46.369> what

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
stay afloat yeah that's that's hard what

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.069 
stay afloat yeah that's that's hard what
are<00:01:47.460> we<00:01:47.520> watching<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:48.090> ok<00:01:48.659> while<00:01:48.960> you're

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
do a rescue mission in a heavy senior a

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.540 
do a rescue mission in a heavy senior a
heavy<00:05:07.600> storm<00:05:07.840> and<00:05:08.169> then<00:05:08.380> do<00:05:08.500> it<00:05:08.650> on<00:05:08.800> an<00:05:08.950> ecology

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
heavy storm and then do it on an ecology

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.490 
heavy storm and then do it on an ecology
of<00:05:09.820> course<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.660> player<00:05:10.870> has<00:05:11.020> to<00:05:11.140> take<00:05:11.320> that

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
of course the player has to take that

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
of course the player has to take that
into<00:05:11.800> account<00:05:11.830> as<00:05:12.220> well

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.280 

we<00:05:15.520> have<00:05:15.640> a<00:05:15.670> mission<00:05:16.240> editor<00:05:16.450> indicator<00:05:16.960> so

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
we have a mission editor indicator so

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.410 
we have a mission editor indicator so
players<00:05:17.740> can<00:05:17.890> create<00:05:18.370> players<00:05:18.970> can<00:05:19.180> create

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
players can create players can create

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.260 
players can create players can create
their<00:05:19.570> own<00:05:19.630> emissions<00:05:20.550> it's<00:05:21.550> very<00:05:21.790> easy<00:05:22.000> very

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
their own emissions it's very easy very

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.830 
their own emissions it's very easy very
intuitive<00:05:22.570> so<00:05:23.110> I<00:05:23.670> should<00:05:24.670> be<00:05:24.700> able<00:05:24.820> to<00:05:25.210> create

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
intuitive so I should be able to create

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.760 
intuitive so I should be able to create
a<00:05:26.050> motion<00:05:26.290> friends<00:05:26.650> also<00:05:27.640> what<00:05:27.880> what<00:05:28.420> will

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
a motion friends also what what will

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.870 
a motion friends also what what will
what<00:05:29.770> will<00:05:29.830> be<00:05:30.040> possible<00:05:30.280> is<00:05:30.550> to<00:05:30.580> exchange

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
what will be possible is to exchange

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.540 
what will be possible is to exchange
mission<00:05:31.480> through<00:05:31.720> our<00:05:31.810> website<00:05:32.050> so<00:05:32.830> people

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
mission through our website so people

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.130 
mission through our website so people
can<00:05:33.790> upload<00:05:34.120> their<00:05:34.330> mission<00:05:34.630> it<00:05:34.840> will<00:05:35.020> be

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
can upload their mission it will be

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.960 
can upload their mission it will be
ranked<00:05:35.470> by<00:05:35.590> the<00:05:35.650> other<00:05:35.830> players<00:05:36.160> and<00:05:36.730> then<00:05:36.880> you

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
ranked by the other players and then you

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.280 
ranked by the other players and then you
can<00:05:37.090> download<00:05:37.300> it<00:05:37.540> other<00:05:37.870> place<00:05:38.080> been

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
can download it other place been

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.400 
can download it other place been
downloaded<00:05:38.710> so<00:05:38.830> we<00:05:38.950> have<00:05:39.070> this<00:05:40.050> stream<00:05:41.050> of<00:05:41.260> new

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
downloaded so we have this stream of new

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.410 
downloaded so we have this stream of new
missions<00:05:41.800> coming<00:05:41.980> after<00:05:42.640> me<00:05:42.880> see<00:05:43.030> if<00:05:43.090> I<00:05:43.240> can

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
missions coming after me see if I can

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.970 
missions coming after me see if I can
get<00:05:43.510> some<00:05:43.570> more<00:05:43.870> footage<00:05:44.260> of<00:05:44.560> the<00:05:44.710> water

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
get some more footage of the water

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.180 
get some more footage of the water
effects<00:05:45.430> which<00:05:45.610> look<00:05:45.790> really<00:05:46.030> nice<00:05:46.150> on<00:05:46.390> us<00:05:46.570> I

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
effects which look really nice on us I

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.530 
effects which look really nice on us I
do<00:05:48.190> have<00:05:48.400> to<00:05:48.520> compliment<00:05:48.910> you<00:05:49.120> on<00:05:49.180> the<00:05:49.360> water

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
do have to compliment you on the water

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.990 
do have to compliment you on the water
that<00:05:49.930> is<00:05:50.140> I<00:05:50.410> can't<00:05:50.980> imagine<00:05:51.100> that's<00:05:51.520> very<00:05:51.700> easy

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
that is I can't imagine that's very easy

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.510 
that is I can't imagine that's very easy
to<00:05:52.300> do<00:05:52.420> what's<00:05:52.780> a<00:05:52.900> very<00:05:53.860> difficult<00:05:54.040> how<00:05:54.400> much

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
to do what's a very difficult how much

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.490 
to do what's a very difficult how much
time<00:05:54.760> does<00:05:54.880> it<00:05:54.940> take<00:05:55.060> to<00:05:55.210> get<00:05:55.510> like<00:05:55.870> the<00:05:56.320> water

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
time does it take to get like the water

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.260 
time does it take to get like the water
effects<00:05:56.830> right<00:05:57.040> on<00:05:57.190> something<00:05:57.550> like<00:05:57.640> this<00:05:57.790> we

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
atari yeah just pc okay you know that's

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:44.379 
atari yeah just pc okay you know that's
discrimination<00:06:38.120> is<00:06:38.810> it<00:06:42.669> nice<00:06:43.669> water<00:06:43.940> effects

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:44.389 
discrimination is it nice water effects

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:46.060 
discrimination is it nice water effects
I<00:06:44.480> assume<00:06:44.810> that<00:06:44.840> the<00:06:45.110> water<00:06:45.440> effects<00:06:45.889> are<00:06:46.040> a

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
I assume that the water effects are a

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.650 
I assume that the water effects are a
big<00:06:46.340> part<00:06:46.490> of<00:06:46.580> the<00:06:46.700> game<00:06:46.850> saying<00:06:47.180> as<00:06:47.300> how<00:06:47.419> its

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660 
big part of the game saying as how its

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.870 
big part of the game saying as how its
yeah<00:06:48.020> both<00:06:48.320> game<00:06:48.560> absolutely<00:06:49.280> that's<00:06:49.430> water

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 
yeah both game absolutely that's water

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.140 
yeah both game absolutely that's water
is<00:06:50.000> pretty<00:06:50.120> important<00:06:50.600> in<00:06:50.720> the<00:06:50.810> boat<00:06:52.150> you

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
is pretty important in the boat you

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.820 
is pretty important in the boat you
could<00:06:53.300> have<00:06:53.450> beautiful<00:06:53.870> sky<00:06:54.050> and<00:06:54.290> crab<00:06:54.500> water

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
could have beautiful sky and crab water

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.970 
could have beautiful sky and crab water
and<00:06:55.400> what<00:06:55.730> about<00:06:55.940> a<00:06:56.000> safe<00:06:56.500> there<00:06:57.500> you<00:06:57.620> go<00:06:57.710> none

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:57.980 
and what about a safe there you go none

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.470 
and what about a safe there you go none
of<00:06:58.040> the<00:06:58.100> boats<00:06:58.310> even<00:06:58.550> transform<00:06:59.030> into<00:06:59.210> thing

00:06:59.470 --> 00:06:59.480 
of the boats even transform into thing

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.480 
of the boats even transform into thing
so<00:06:59.690> that<00:06:59.810> should<00:07:00.169> be<00:07:00.260> another<00:07:00.410> round<00:07:00.620> on<00:07:00.740> I'll

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490 
so that should be another round on I'll

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.980 
so that should be another round on I'll
be<00:07:01.760> able<00:07:01.820> to<00:07:01.940> transform<00:07:02.360> into<00:07:02.570> a<00:07:02.630> robot<00:07:02.840> and

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:02.990 
be able to transform into a robot and

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.159 
be able to transform into a robot and
jump<00:07:03.320> onto<00:07:03.500> another<00:07:03.740> goes<00:07:04.040> yeah<00:07:04.310> bro<00:07:05.169> yeah

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:06.169 
jump onto another goes yeah bro yeah
