00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
know I only have a couple they actually

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.150 
know I only have a couple they actually
have<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.190> printing<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.180> them<00:00:57.360> too<00:00:58.010> with<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
have the printing on them too with the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.110 
have the printing on them too with the
grey<00:01:00.109> and<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.199> tried<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.559> set<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.859> up<00:01:01.949> where<00:01:02.219> you

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
grey and I tried to set it up where you

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.520 
grey and I tried to set it up where you
know<00:01:03.210> they<00:01:03.359> were<00:01:03.420> all<00:01:03.570> leaning<00:01:03.899> like<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.229> real

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
know they were all leaning like a real

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.710 
know they were all leaning like a real
bike<00:01:04.739> would<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.700> have<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.390> be<00:01:06.510> kind<00:01:06.689> of

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
bike would so I have to be kind of

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.859 
bike would so I have to be kind of
careful<00:01:06.869> they<00:01:07.260> all<00:01:07.380> fall<00:01:07.740> over<00:01:07.770> too<00:01:08.280> because

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
careful they all fall over too because

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.090 
careful they all fall over too because
they<00:01:09.869> don't<00:01:10.049> really<00:01:10.170> like<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.590> lean<00:01:10.799> like

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
they don't really like the lean like

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.280 
they don't really like the lean like
that<00:01:11.369> but<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.939> think<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.630> looks<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.869> lot<00:01:13.020> better

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
that but I think it looks a lot better

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.890 
that but I think it looks a lot better
when<00:01:13.470> they're<00:01:13.619> leaning<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.630> then<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.750> see

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
when they're leaning and then you see

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.899 
when they're leaning and then you see
what<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.080> did<00:01:16.140> here<00:01:16.439> with<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.740> red<00:01:17.310> one<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.549> put
