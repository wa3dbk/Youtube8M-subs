00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.500
 the chevrolet sail means a great 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.110
 bet for gm colmotores this vehicle 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.880

 produced in gm colmotores and in colombia 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.720
 When a new model arrives, 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.010
 plants have to be adaptations in 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.780
 each of the three shows they do 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.100
 part of the plant first you have to 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.739
 make an adaptation in the area of 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.940
 armed building a new cell 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.410

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.800
 Work stations and assemblies in 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.210
 general also has to guarantee 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.190
 then the entrance of that new model with

 new tools at this time 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.160
 We also have your projects 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.680
 industrial reconversion in which this 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.180
 included 6 robots that are going to do all the 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.440
 of capped area 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.480
 latonerÃ­a 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.310
 the main challenges by which 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.890
 we had to 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.810
 to exceed in the launch of the 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.540
 chevrolet 6 are represented without 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.120
 have the plant ready with the new ones 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.790
 processes and technologies that involve the 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.950
 assembly of this new model 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.040
 additionally it has to hold a hundred percent 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.450
 hundred trained our staff to 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.980
 that we can assemble within 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.200
 context of the global system of 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.260
 manufacturing and quality levels 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.440
 required for the vehicle to be a 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.450
 success in the market in addition to 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.640
 this have ready the tests and 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.190
 adaptations that you have to do 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.979
 to the vehicle in the Colombian topography 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.690
 so that our customers receive in a 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.300
 excellent quality vehicle and good 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.910
 response in the launch process 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.869
 from 'out, about 50 participated 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.340
 people 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.960
 this group are part of all the

 areas of the company where I was 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.869
 manufacturing and logistics quality purchases 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.700
 marketing actually we have a group that 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.590
 takes care of the entire launch and 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.400
 additional to this we have approximately 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.110
 in 1,100 people who have a 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.950
 special training in plant for 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.670
 to be able to receive it 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:14.120
 to the good line since it was defined 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.360
 side was approved the project took us 18 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.190
 months introduce it in the process of 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.390
 assemble until its moment to start the 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.700
 production prior to these 18 months the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.340
 preparation and approval of the project 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.450
 It took us about 2 years 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.000
 additional 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.060
 the chevrolet 6 for general motors 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.280
 Colmotores is a great bet is part 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.960
 of the industrial reconversion that 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.330
 we have been developing in the country 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.800
 when we announced 200 million 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.020
 investment dollars 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.850
 specifically in 6 we are 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.100
 investing 15 million dollars 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.980
 only in the set-up of the 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.900
 program of this product but 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.150
 additionally this is going to be one of the 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.100
 two products that are going to start being 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.100
 produced for the first time in Colombia 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.560
 good in the most important part is that 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.020
 all of us are here to do 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.760
 the things well we are proud 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.550
 to assemble a car to silence the motorcycle 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.170
 with engines a new model since this 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.959
 Colombian we are assembling it 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.330
 us and the coolest thing about this is 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.790
 when one goes out to the street and these 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.769
 circular vehicles on the streets says and 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.840
 to say that we ourselves are 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.849
 manufacturing here in the company but I 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.890
 I think we used here as we 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.900
 We feel very proud because we are going to 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.090
 have more work we will be more 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.830
 stable here in the company and most 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.750
 important of this is that we give of the 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.340
 hands with our family because that's how 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.709
 we are doing well to our families
