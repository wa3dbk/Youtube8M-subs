permissions can be a tricky beast be
sure<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.799> read<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:04.979> caveats<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.360> course

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
sure to read the caveats and of course

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.530 
sure to read the caveats and of course
you<00:01:06.810> can't<00:01:07.140> further<00:01:08.270> restrict<00:01:09.270> or

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
you can't further restrict or

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.810 
you can't further restrict or
unrestrictor<00:01:10.260> other<00:01:10.470> permissions<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.549> stuff

unrestrictor other permissions and stuff

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.190 
unrestrictor other permissions and stuff
that's<00:01:12.060> already<00:01:12.330> been<00:01:12.630> restricted<00:01:12.930> so

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
that's already been restricted so

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.960 
that's already been restricted so
something<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.560> no<00:01:13.860> copy<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.369> can't<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.760> make

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
something is no copy you can't just make

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.810 
something is no copy you can't just make
it<00:01:15.000> copyable<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.930> another<00:01:16.860> thing<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:17.340> you're

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
it copyable and another thing if you're

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.960 
it copyable and another thing if you're
wondering<00:01:18.060> where<00:01:18.869> our<00:01:19.229> photos<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.580> ones<00:01:20.790> that

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
wondering where our photos the ones that

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.370 
wondering where our photos the ones that
would<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.450> your<00:01:21.479> photo<00:01:21.780> album<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.200> this

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
would be in your photo album on this

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.630 
would be in your photo album on this
list<00:01:23.250> there<00:01:23.790> are<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.150> same<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:24.710> textures<00:01:25.710> so

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
list there are the same as textures so

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.940 
list there are the same as textures so
just<00:01:27.420> remember<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.350> you'll<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.799> good

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
just remember that and you'll be in good

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.190 
just remember that and you'll be in good
hands<00:01:29.299> let's<00:01:30.299> take<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> look<00:01:30.780> at<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.990> quick

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
hands let's take a look at a quick

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.020 
hands let's take a look at a quick
example<00:01:31.320> where<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.189> right<00:01:32.520> click<00:01:32.790> and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
example where I right click and

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.179 
example where I right click and
properties<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.900> say<00:01:34.409> for<00:01:34.619> instance<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.979> want

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
properties and say for instance I want

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.910 
properties and say for instance I want
to<00:01:35.310> restrict<00:01:35.610> everything<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.540> here<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.799> be

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
to restrict everything in here to be

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.999 
to restrict everything in here to be
modifiable<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:38.939> no<00:01:39.299> copy<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:40.409> right<00:01:40.590> now<00:01:40.619> this

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
modifiable but no copy so right now this

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.429 
modifiable but no copy so right now this
is<00:01:41.189> copyable<00:01:41.640> sure<00:01:42.210> enough<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:43.110> pose<00:01:43.409> is

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
is copyable sure enough and this pose is

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.240 
is copyable sure enough and this pose is
as<00:01:43.950> well<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:45.750> solution<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.320> simple<00:01:46.829> just

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
as well the solution is simple just

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.429 
as well the solution is simple just
select<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.390> appropriate<00:01:48.540> permissions<00:01:49.079> and

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
select the appropriate permissions and

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.520 
select the appropriate permissions and
these<00:01:49.590> two<00:01:49.829> as<00:01:50.040> well<00:01:50.340> if<00:01:50.640> necessary<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:52.290> for<00:01:52.439> an

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
these two as well if necessary so for an

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.240 
these two as well if necessary so for an
insta<00:01:53.009> since<00:01:53.340> tins<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.990> then<00:01:54.990> apply<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.799> be

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
insta since tins and then apply and be

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.060 
insta since tins and then apply and be
patient<00:01:56.460> as<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.299> applies<00:01:57.890> happens<00:01:58.890> pretty

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
patient as it applies happens pretty

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.580 
patient as it applies happens pretty
quickly<00:01:59.369> there<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.990> then<00:02:00.990> close<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.560> out
