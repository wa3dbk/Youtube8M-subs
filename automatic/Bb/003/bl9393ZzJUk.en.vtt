I<00:00:39.420> don't<00:00:40.420> know<00:00:40.540> what<00:00:40.719> the<00:00:40.899> creator<00:00:41.350> really<00:00:41.950> is

I don't know what the creator really is

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.970 
I don't know what the creator really is
I<00:00:42.989> always<00:00:43.989> felt<00:00:44.680> that<00:00:44.829> I<00:00:45.039> was<00:00:45.370> a<00:00:45.399> programmer<00:00:46.980> it

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
I always felt that I was a programmer it

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.160 
I always felt that I was a programmer it
feels<00:00:48.190> weird<00:00:48.820> to<00:00:49.000> say<00:00:49.239> that<00:00:49.570> I<00:00:49.600> was<00:00:49.809> a<00:00:49.840> pioneer

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
feels weird to say that I was a pioneer

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.600 
feels weird to say that I was a pioneer
but<00:00:50.739> I<00:00:50.770> guess<00:00:51.250> I<00:00:51.460> was<00:00:51.640> a<00:00:51.670> pioneer<00:00:52.059> I<00:00:53.190> was<00:00:54.190> living

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
but I guess I was a pioneer I was living

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.360 
but I guess I was a pioneer I was living
in<00:00:54.730> Santa<00:00:54.969> Barbara<00:00:55.090> and<00:00:55.780> I<00:00:56.620> had<00:00:56.860> a<00:00:56.890> best<00:00:57.190> friend

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.770 
have a game idea Atari would take people
on<00:03:29.790> brainstorming<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:30.810> there<00:03:31.590> was<00:03:31.800> one<00:03:32.100> idea

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
on brainstorming and there was one idea

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.720 
on brainstorming and there was one idea
described<00:03:33.780> in<00:03:34.019> one<00:03:34.200> sentence<00:03:34.680> as<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.190> multi

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
described in one sentence as a multi

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.330 
described in one sentence as a multi
segmented<00:03:36.480> insect<00:03:37.080> crawls<00:03:37.410> onto<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:38.010> screen

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
segmented insect crawls onto the screen

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.170 
segmented insect crawls onto the screen
and<00:03:38.550> is<00:03:38.730> shot<00:03:38.970> by<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.239> player

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
and is shot by the player

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.199 
and is shot by the player
it<00:03:42.180> didn't<00:03:42.540> seem<00:03:42.690> bad<00:03:43.019> to<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.890> shoot<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.400> bug<00:03:44.640> and

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
it didn't seem bad to to shoot a bug and

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.840 
it didn't seem bad to to shoot a bug and
so<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:46.170> was<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.620> one<00:03:46.769> that<00:03:47.010> that<00:03:47.400> I<00:03:47.430> picked

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
so that was the one that that I picked

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.640 
so that was the one that that I picked
and<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:49.230> was<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.560> beginning<00:03:50.010> of<00:03:50.100> it

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
and and that was the beginning of it

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.290 
and and that was the beginning of it
after<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.860> do<00:03:53.040> something<00:03:53.459> people<00:03:53.610> think<00:03:54.090> that

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
after you do something people think that

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.840 
after you do something people think that
you<00:03:54.630> knew<00:03:54.870> what<00:03:55.110> you<00:03:55.230> were<00:03:55.350> doing<00:03:55.380> but<00:03:56.220> we<00:03:56.730> had

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
you knew what you were doing but we had

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.740 
you knew what you were doing but we had
no<00:03:57.030> idea

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
no idea

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.750 
no idea
we<00:03:57.900> were<00:03:58.019> just<00:03:58.230> doing<00:03:58.650> stuff<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.280> some<00:03:59.459> of<00:03:59.489> it

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
we were just doing stuff and some of it

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.890 
we were just doing stuff and some of it
worked<00:03:59.970> out<00:04:00.180> some<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.630> it

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.690 

centipedes<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.140> it<00:04:04.740> came<00:04:05.010> out<00:04:05.220> sort<00:04:05.580> of

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
centipedes and it came out sort of

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.240 
centipedes and it came out sort of
because<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:06.450> don't<00:04:06.870> like<00:04:06.990> spiders<00:04:07.320> this<00:04:07.740> that's

because I don't like spiders this that's

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.820 
because I don't like spiders this that's
a<00:04:08.580> lot<00:04:08.850> of<00:04:09.030> how<00:04:09.270> that<00:04:09.480> happens<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.410> the

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
a spider women make up 10% of the work

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.590 
a spider women make up 10% of the work
force<00:04:23.730> in<00:04:24.060> video<00:04:24.360> games<00:04:24.690> at<00:04:25.020> this<00:04:25.320> point<00:04:25.680> and

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
force in video games at this point and

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.350 
force in video games at this point and
that<00:04:27.600> really<00:04:28.140> isn't<00:04:28.350> much<00:04:28.710> growth<00:04:29.130> after<00:04:29.430> 30

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
that really isn't much growth after 30

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.630 
that really isn't much growth after 30
years<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:33.110> think<00:04:34.110> that<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:35.100> best<00:04:35.310> thing<00:04:35.610> that

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
years I think that the best thing that

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.380 
years I think that the best thing that
ever<00:04:35.850> happened<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.390> games<00:04:36.750> is<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:38.340> app<00:04:38.550> I<00:04:38.940> play

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
ever happened to games is the app I play

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.930 
ever happened to games is the app I play
fruit<00:04:39.630> ninja<00:04:39.770> occasionally<00:04:40.770> candy<00:04:41.310> crush<00:04:41.580> I

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
fruit ninja occasionally candy crush I

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.290 
fruit ninja occasionally candy crush I
think<00:04:42.900> that<00:04:43.110> programming<00:04:43.680> apps<00:04:44.070> would<00:04:44.730> be<00:04:44.970> a

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
think that programming apps would be a

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.330 
think that programming apps would be a
lot<00:04:45.630> more<00:04:45.660> fun<00:04:46.020> because<00:04:46.260> a<00:04:46.680> woman<00:04:47.130> could

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
lot more fun because a woman could

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.490 
lot more fun because a woman could
actually<00:04:47.760> get<00:04:48.180> really<00:04:48.360> good<00:04:48.600> at<00:04:48.780> that<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.020> not

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
actually get really good at that and not

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.440 
actually get really good at that and not
have<00:04:49.770> to<00:04:49.980> involve<00:04:50.280> a<00:04:50.700> whole<00:04:51.000> lot<00:04:51.180> of<00:04:51.270> other

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
have to involve a whole lot of other

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.530 
have to involve a whole lot of other
people<00:04:51.570> I<00:04:52.140> hate<00:04:53.040> that<00:04:53.310> women<00:04:53.850> have<00:04:54.150> to<00:04:54.360> fight

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
people I hate that women have to fight

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.690 
people I hate that women have to fight
against<00:04:54.930> something<00:04:55.500> instead<00:04:56.130> of<00:04:56.190> just<00:04:56.310> being

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
against something instead of just being

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.600 
against something instead of just being
able<00:04:56.850> to<00:04:57.030> do<00:04:57.360> their<00:04:57.570> work
