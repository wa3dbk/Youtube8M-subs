00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello how are we today in the 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.210
 pantheon and it is a typical photograph of 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.590
 everyone who comes to Rome and all 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.019
 that come, of course, they do not stop 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.940
 put it on facebook on the internet with your 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.609
 contacts in the movies the movies in 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.910
 everywhere but this is more than a 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.910
 Photo 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.120
 have you ever wondered why 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.059
 many of our churches have a 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.890
 large dome just above the house 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.530
 after reading a little here and for 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.239
 there it turns out that for philosophers 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.260
 Greek as for platÃ³n 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.780
 the circle is the most perfect figure 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.239
 because then because it has no beginning nor 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.150
 purpose and each of your points is 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.370
 equidistant to the center and it is for this 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.229
 reason that they adopted the circle as 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.890
 figure that represents the world of 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:05.360
 gods but that's not all it turns out that 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.460
 the great architects from the 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.530
 seniority sought to use the figure of 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.810
 century and the semicircle in buildings 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.580
 of football as a symbol of encounter 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.979
 between the human world and the divine world 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.170
 and the most spectacular example of this 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.610
 architecture that we find here in 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.100
 Rome 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.470
 it is a building built by 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.080
 first time in the year 27 before Christ 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.820
 and of built with the current form to 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.400
 beginnings of the second century after 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.330
 credit the entire village is conserved and 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.430
 besides the world 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.190
 it is originally a temple 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.890
 dedicated to all the gods and there comes 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.930
 the name the manteo was consecrated 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.740
 originally to the seven deities 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.180
 celestial romans the sun the moon and the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.430
 other planets 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.280
 each one had assigned one of the seven 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.410
 fearsome of the interior maybe that's how they had 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.990
 and every one of you who felt 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.880
 that they were not going to visit, they took advantage of 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.890
 they saw them all together 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.200
 involutions and tectonics want 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.600
 represent the terrestrial globe and for 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.420
 it use the temple plant a 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.270
 perfect circle instead the sphere 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.910
 celeste is represented by the semi 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.470
 dome that can be extended 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.690
 perfectly within the enclosure it 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.110
 it's about a building designed to unite 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.720
 the man with the divinity besides the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.390
 module on the domes wants to join or 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.770
 communicate man with heaven in the 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.390
 year 600 8 the Byzantine emperor seals 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.760
 gave this building to Pope Boniface 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.290
 fourth and transformed it into a church 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.040
 Christian 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.689
 to all the margins is to say to all 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.450
 Men have built 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:48.450
 Your faith testified to me that the 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.450
 pattern is a great lesson from 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.670
 architecture and engineering but about 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.260
 everything is a great lesson for 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.620
 teach us what exists in the most 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.799
 intimate of the heart that desire to know 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.060
 and to love the one true god is by 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.090
 that many of our churches 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.939
 they have point on the altar that great 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.430
 dome to remind us that god is 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:13.889
 near us like a father who 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.989
 go and accompany us always and thank you 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.930
 to the sacrifice of Christ that is celebrated 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.340
 on that altar we can one day reach the 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.950
 heaven to our final peace 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.920
 is impressed or at least at least 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.040
 invites us to think and value the 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.860
 fields as soon as we know it how much 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.480
 we value and above all how we live 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.910
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.069
 this video that allows us to know a 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.340
 little more jokes but mostly we 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.340
 help to light up our grief a bit 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.340
 goodbye
