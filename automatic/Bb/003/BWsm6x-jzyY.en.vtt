tutorial for cracked Paisley this design

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.100 
tutorial for cracked Paisley this design
is<00:00:05.220> stitched<00:00:05.580> by<00:00:05.850> first<00:00:06.180> starting<00:00:06.660> with<00:00:06.990> the

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.110 
is stitched by first starting with the

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.079 
is stitched by first starting with the
teardrop<00:00:07.560> shape<00:00:07.800> and<00:00:08.069> then<00:00:08.790> you're<00:00:08.940> going<00:00:09.030> to

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:09.089 
teardrop shape and then you're going to

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:10.940 
teardrop shape and then you're going to
go<00:00:09.179> inside<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.719> that<00:00:09.990> teardrop<00:00:10.320> shape<00:00:10.740> and

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
go inside of that teardrop shape and

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.839 
go inside of that teardrop shape and
fill<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.820> with<00:00:11.849> cracks<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:13.610> basically<00:00:14.610> this

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
fill it with cracks and basically this

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.570 
fill it with cracks and basically this
is<00:00:15.030> just<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.360> straight<00:00:15.780> line<00:00:16.160> sharp<00:00:17.160> angled

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
is just a straight line sharp angled

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.550 
is just a straight line sharp angled
version<00:00:18.030> of<00:00:18.210> tree<00:00:18.750> roots<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.350> you're<00:00:19.500> just

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
version of tree roots so you're just

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.410 
version of tree roots so you're just
itching<00:00:19.770> these<00:00:20.100> kind<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.400> straight<00:00:20.790> jagged

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
itching these kind of straight jagged

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.290 
itching these kind of straight jagged
lines<00:00:21.740> filling<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.920> trying<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.640> create<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.000> very

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
lines filling in trying to create a very

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.060 
lines filling in trying to create a very
boxy<00:00:24.660> cracked<00:00:25.560> crinkly<00:00:26.430> texture<00:00:27.000> inside<00:00:27.270> that

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
boxy cracked crinkly texture inside that

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.400 
boxy cracked crinkly texture inside that
teardrop<00:00:29.070> shape<00:00:29.690> you<00:00:30.690> can<00:00:30.810> see<00:00:30.930> I'm<00:00:31.050> moving

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
teardrop shape you can see I'm moving

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.770 
teardrop shape you can see I'm moving
quite<00:00:31.770> slowly<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.399> taking<00:00:33.329> my<00:00:33.480> time<00:00:33.719> with

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
quite slowly and taking my time with

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.200 
quite slowly and taking my time with
this<00:00:34.199> it's<00:00:34.589> a<00:00:34.739> very<00:00:34.980> tiny<00:00:35.309> teardrop<00:00:35.879> so<00:00:36.059> that

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
this it's a very tiny teardrop so that

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.430 
this it's a very tiny teardrop so that
means<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.570> cracks<00:00:36.870> are<00:00:37.079> going<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.289> be<00:00:37.410> very

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
means the cracks are going to be very

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.770 
means the cracks are going to be very
tiny<00:00:38.010> as<00:00:38.159> well<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.329> make<00:00:39.449> it<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.629> lot

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
tiny as well you can make it a lot

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.329 
tiny as well you can make it a lot
easier<00:00:39.809> for<00:00:40.289> yourself<00:00:40.409> if<00:00:40.769> you<00:00:40.890> start<00:00:41.190> with<00:00:41.280> a

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
easier for yourself if you start with a

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.599 
easier for yourself if you start with a
bigger<00:00:41.670> teardrop<00:00:42.890> okay<00:00:43.890> now<00:00:44.129> you're<00:00:44.370> going<00:00:44.550> to

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609 
bigger teardrop okay now you're going to

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.119 
bigger teardrop okay now you're going to
pivot<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.179> echo<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.260> teardrop<00:00:46.499> shape<00:00:46.949> as

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
pivot and echo that teardrop shape as

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.369 
pivot and echo that teardrop shape as
many<00:00:47.370> times<00:00:47.670> as<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.999> like<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.109> going

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
many times as you like and this is going

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.819 
many times as you like and this is going
to<00:00:49.469> build<00:00:49.769> up<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.069> texture<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:51.829> throwback

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
to build up the texture it's throwback

to<00:00:52.979> Paisley<00:00:53.190> Paisley<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:54.059> created<00:00:54.569> by<00:00:54.690> simply

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
to Paisley Paisley is created by simply

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.840 
to Paisley Paisley is created by simply
stitching<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.589> teardrop<00:00:56.069> and<00:00:56.339> then<00:00:56.460> echoing

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
stitching the teardrop and then echoing

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.569 
stitching the teardrop and then echoing
that<00:00:57.149> teardrop<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:58.319> time<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.859> only<00:00:59.219> extra

that teardrop this time the only extra

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.340 
that teardrop this time the only extra
step<00:00:59.850> was<00:01:00.120> simply<00:01:00.479> filling<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:01.050> with<00:01:01.170> those

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
step was simply filling in with those

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.189 
step was simply filling in with those
cracked<00:01:01.800> jagged<00:01:02.489> lines<00:01:02.749> so<00:01:03.749> you're<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.140> to

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
cracked jagged lines so you're going to

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.200 
cracked jagged lines so you're going to
surround<00:01:04.829> that<00:01:04.979> with<00:01:05.100> several<00:01:05.579> echoes<00:01:05.969> and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
surround that with several echoes and

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.569 
surround that with several echoes and
then<00:01:06.509> branch<00:01:06.840> off<00:01:07.110> with<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> new<00:01:07.710> teardrop<00:01:08.310> and

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
then branch off with a new teardrop and

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.289 
then branch off with a new teardrop and
fill<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.780> with<00:01:09.960> cracks<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.619> well<00:01:11.180> it's<00:01:12.180> a

fill it in with cracks as well it's a

this<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> quilt<00:01:15.930> I'd<00:01:16.200> probably<00:01:16.530> say<00:01:16.979> it's

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
this on a quilt I'd probably say it's

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.120 
this on a quilt I'd probably say it's
going<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.490> work<00:01:17.640> best<00:01:17.880> on<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:19.049> wall<00:01:19.350> hanging<00:01:19.920> or

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
going to work best on a wall hanging or

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.120 
going to work best on a wall hanging or
an<00:01:20.610> art<00:01:20.880> quilt<00:01:21.210> something<00:01:21.689> decorative<00:01:22.130> mostly

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
an art quilt something decorative mostly

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.310 
an art quilt something decorative mostly
because<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.789> crack<00:01:24.119> texture<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.869> always

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
because the crack texture is always

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.319 
because the crack texture is always
going<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.649> small<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.159> tiny<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:27.180> always

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
going to be small and tiny it's always

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.389 
going to be small and tiny it's always
going<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.719> be<00:01:27.780> very<00:01:28.079> dense<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.829> that's

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
going to be very dense and that's

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.190 
going to be very dense and that's
probably<00:01:29.670> not<00:01:30.030> going<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.299> work<00:01:30.570> very<00:01:30.600> well<00:01:30.990> on

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
probably not going to work very well on

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.830 
probably not going to work very well on
a<00:01:31.380> bed<00:01:31.619> quilt<00:01:31.950> unless<00:01:32.789> of<00:01:33.000> course<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.450> left<00:01:33.719> it

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
a bed quilt unless of course you left it

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.349 
a bed quilt unless of course you left it
very<00:01:34.229> open<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.859> then<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.520> texture<00:01:35.969> wouldn't

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:36.359 
very open and then the texture wouldn't

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.539 
very open and then the texture wouldn't
really<00:01:36.570> show<00:01:36.899> up<00:01:37.049> as<00:01:37.200> well<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.590> good<00:01:38.100> choice<00:01:38.520> for

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
really show up as well a good choice for

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.209 
really show up as well a good choice for
a<00:01:38.789> bent<00:01:39.060> quilt<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.659> Paisley<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:40.979> regular

a bent quilt is Paisley just regular

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.340 
a bent quilt is Paisley just regular
Paisley<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:41.969> that's<00:01:42.390> stitch<00:01:42.719> simply<00:01:43.229> by

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
Paisley and that's stitch simply by

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.080 
Paisley and that's stitch simply by
stitching<00:01:43.679> the<00:01:43.890> teardrops<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.579> surrounding

stitching the teardrops and surrounding
them<00:01:45.240> with<00:01:45.359> that<00:01:45.539> goes<00:01:45.719> very<00:01:46.170> simple<00:01:46.670> so<00:01:47.670> now

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
them with that goes very simple so now

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.429 
them with that goes very simple so now
I'm<00:01:47.969> going<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.149> kind<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.359> work<00:01:48.539> my<00:01:48.810> way<00:01:48.990> back<00:01:49.020> to

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
I'm going to kind of work my way back to

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.669 
I'm going to kind of work my way back to
that<00:01:49.590> starting<00:01:50.070> point<00:01:50.960> pivot<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.170> echo

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
that starting point pivot and echo

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.249 
that starting point pivot and echo
around<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.399> shape<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.969> you<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.780> see<00:01:54.990> how<00:01:55.229> I

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
around this shape and you can see how I

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.859 
around this shape and you can see how I
cut<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.859> design<00:01:56.189> basically<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.909> half<00:01:57.179> to<00:01:57.630> fit

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
cut the design basically in half to fit

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.310 
cut the design basically in half to fit
it<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.109> that<00:01:58.320> weird<00:01:58.590> area<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.759> happens<00:02:00.320> our

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
it in that weird area this happens our

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.919 
it in that weird area this happens our
quilts<00:02:01.920> are<00:02:02.100> not<00:02:02.490> made<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.210> fillers<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
quilts are not made to the fillers the

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.709 
quilts are not made to the fillers the
fillers<00:02:04.679> are<00:02:04.710> made<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.369> fit<00:02:05.670> within<00:02:05.999> the<00:02:06.390> quilt

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
fillers are made to fit within the quilt

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.779 
fillers are made to fit within the quilt
that's<00:02:07.229> an<00:02:07.380> important<00:02:07.799> distinction<00:02:08.190> and

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
that's an important distinction and

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.430 
that's an important distinction and
because<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.959> you're<00:02:10.259> going<00:02:10.379> to

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
because of that you're going to

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.589 
because of that you're going to
occasionally<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.700> break<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:11.970> filler<00:02:12.330> in

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
occasionally have to break a filler in

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.010 
occasionally have to break a filler in
half

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
half

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.720 
half
you're<00:02:13.620> going<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.860> have<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.130> kind<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.430> squish

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
you're going to have to kind of squish

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.030 
you're going to have to kind of squish
it<00:02:14.880> down<00:02:14.910> make<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.480> smaller<00:02:15.750> or<00:02:16.050> just<00:02:16.860> simply

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
it down make it smaller or just simply

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.910 
it down make it smaller or just simply
stitch<00:02:17.850> only<00:02:18.210> half<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.810> design<00:02:19.260> into<00:02:19.770> the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
stitch only half of the design into the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.460 
stitch only half of the design into the
space<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.760> way<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.240> fits<00:02:21.450> properly<00:02:21.840> and

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
space so that way it fits properly and

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.620 
space so that way it fits properly and
that's<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.400> cool<00:02:23.580> thing<00:02:23.610> about<00:02:23.880> fillers<00:02:24.330> is

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
that's the cool thing about fillers is

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.590 
that's the cool thing about fillers is
once<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.110> memorize<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:26.190> basic<00:02:26.460> set<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.150> rules

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
once you memorize the basic set of rules

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.990 
once you memorize the basic set of rules
for<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.050> design<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:29.010> should<00:02:29.310> be<00:02:29.430> able<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.790> fit

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
for the design you should be able to fit

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.420 
for the design you should be able to fit
it<00:02:30.150> anywhere<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.870> your<00:02:30.990> quilts<00:02:31.440> even<00:02:32.190> if<00:02:32.310> you

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
it anywhere in your quilts even if you

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.490 
it anywhere in your quilts even if you
wanted<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.880> put<00:02:33.060> this<00:02:33.210> in<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.450> bed<00:02:33.630> quilt<00:02:34.020> it

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
wanted to put this in a bed quilt it

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.950 
wanted to put this in a bed quilt it
could<00:02:34.740> fit<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.730> long<00:02:35.970> as<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.270> memorize<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
could fit so long as you memorize the

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.230 
could fit so long as you memorize the
rules<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.530> how<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:38.010> worked<00:02:38.220> just<00:02:38.490> like<00:02:38.790> writing

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
rules of how it worked just like writing

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.170 
rules of how it worked just like writing
letters<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.840> cursive<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.470> then<00:02:41.190> use<00:02:41.940> those

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
letters in cursive and then use those

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.480 
letters in cursive and then use those
rules<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.870> apply<00:02:42.960> it<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.740> those<00:02:43.890> areas<00:02:44.130> of<00:02:44.400> your

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
rules to apply it to those areas of your

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.190 
rules to apply it to those areas of your
quilt<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.360> course<00:02:45.570> you'd<00:02:45.720> want<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:45.990> stitch

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
quilt and of course you'd want to stitch

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.680 
quilt and of course you'd want to stitch
it<00:02:46.230> on<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> very<00:02:47.040> big<00:02:47.430> scale<00:02:47.850> in<00:02:48.180> order<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.570> make

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
it on a very big scale in order to make

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.600 
it on a very big scale in order to make
sure<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:49.080> it<00:02:49.110> wasn't<00:02:49.350> too<00:02:49.710> dense<00:02:50.010> or<00:02:50.370> too

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
sure that it wasn't too dense or too

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.570 
sure that it wasn't too dense or too
uncomfortable<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.420> sleep<00:02:51.660> under<00:02:52.280> so<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.310> hope

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
uncomfortable to sleep under so I hope

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.310 
uncomfortable to sleep under so I hope
all<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:53.850> makes<00:02:54.210> sense<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.780> you've<00:02:54.960> gotten<00:02:55.260> a

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
all that makes sense and you've gotten a

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.560 
all that makes sense and you've gotten a
good<00:02:55.560> idea<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:55.980> how<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.400> stitch<00:02:56.760> cracked

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570
