brushed<00:02:39.920> out<00:02:40.160> it<00:02:40.459> has<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:40.910> fine<00:02:41.360> look<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.930> it

it's got its curls but I've brushed it

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.470 
it's got its curls but I've brushed it
out<00:02:45.760> so<00:02:46.760> she<00:02:46.820> doesn't<00:02:47.060> have<00:02:47.239> all<00:02:47.450> the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
out so she doesn't have all the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.930 
out so she doesn't have all the
wonderful<00:02:47.870> curls<00:02:48.380> because<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.519> brushed<00:02:49.790> some

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940

wonderful curls because I brushed some
of<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.120> curls<00:02:50.420> out<00:02:50.630> now<00:02:51.200> at<00:02:51.260> this<00:02:51.440> point<00:02:51.709> you

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
of the curls out now at this point you

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.890 
of the curls out now at this point you
could<00:02:52.040> use<00:02:52.310> of<00:02:52.580> even<00:02:53.030> in<00:02:53.120> conditioner<00:02:53.570> which<00:02:53.750> I

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
could use of even in conditioner which I

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
could use of even in conditioner which I
make<00:02:54.080> as<00:02:54.230> well<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:55.760> get<00:02:55.880> it<00:02:56.030> even<00:02:56.150> straighter

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
make as well to get it even straighter

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.500 
make as well to get it even straighter
to<00:02:57.920> hold<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.400> moisture<00:02:58.910> but<00:02:59.030> I<00:02:59.090> think<00:02:59.360> it's

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
to hold that moisture but I think it's

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.470 
to hold that moisture but I think it's
fine<00:02:59.750> now<00:03:00.019> I'm<00:03:00.140> going<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.440> braid<00:03:01.420> her<00:03:02.420> hair

fine now I'm going to braid her hair

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.890 
fine now I'm going to braid her hair
