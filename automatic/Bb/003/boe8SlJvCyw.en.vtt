 Hi, I'm bovine angelic and 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.639
 I am again with you in this 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.500
 I want to tell you about the archangel 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.720
 both to the bottom today in the morning when 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.640
 I woke up I asked the angels of 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.080
 what do they want to talk about today in their video and what 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.689
 first thing that comes to my mind was a 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.070
 song and the holy archangel in the background and 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.779
 is that the song comes to the bottom is a 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.029
 wonderful archangel who speaks to us 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.300
 much through music we 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.710
 he talks let us know his messages 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.080
 precisely through notes 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.350
 Musical lyrics of a song 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.120
 in other words , he is really in 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.770
 the music and what he wants is that 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.570
 we make the music vibrate 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.820
 again in our hearts and that 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.340
 we touch the joy and the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.770
 happiness who is the holy archangel to 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.750
 background his name means brother and he 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.750
 He says it like that because he thinks he was the 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.250
 twin brother of the archangel metatron 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.680

 music the physical means the media 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.140
 economics to promote their music to 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.790
 take it elsewhere to interpret 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.090
 his music 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.549
 and also of course to those who are 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.230
 Singers or interpreters help them when 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.590
 they are on a stage in front of a 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.250
 public to interpret their music and 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.810
 to take it to other people the most 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.220
 important is that the archangel gandalf on 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.500
 as I told you at the beginning of the video 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.269
 they give us messages through music 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.569
 then the next time you get up 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.519
 with a song hit or that you shut up 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.040
 yourself humming a song or 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.780
 repeating some phrase of a song 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.000
 if it is okay what the letter of the 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.819
 song and see if there is not a little message 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.859
 for you in that letter of that song in 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.019
 So many archangel must 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:02.019
 take care to send you messages like that 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.790
 as through music as through 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.889
 from the same music let you know that 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.739
 it's active that you have a lot that 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:10.720

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.359
 joy ahead and there is much joy 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.220

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.410
 arcÃ¡ngel is so hawk is left to see with 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.289
 the physical eyes what you see is like 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.060
 a turquoise blue energy then 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.010
 also when you feel this energy 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.430
 about you or when you see a reflection 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.440
 blue 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.479
 Turquoise near you asks the 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.310
 arcÃ¡ngel sand to the bottom what is what you 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.160
 you want to say and you'll see that those 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.960
 answers come to your mind finally 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.530
 it is said of the archangel so such a background that 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.229
 is so high so big that if your 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.270
 feet touched the ground would reach the 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.400
 heaven then also when you get 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.440
 presents a big angel when you get 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.300
 present a tall angel and I 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.449
 I personally see it very slender 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.940
 then also slender is surely 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.949
 the archangel good background sand to the left 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.460
 he tells them a week full of music 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:02.710
 full of joy filled with archangel sand 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.699
 alfons and that their angels come 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.699
 always blessings 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.010
 yes
