00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
it puts out some space so they can't

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.890 
it puts out some space so they can't
place<00:02:15.519> up<00:02:15.730> right<00:02:16.030> next<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.390> walls<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:19.000> then

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
place up right next to the walls so then

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.600 
place up right next to the walls so then
it<00:02:20.829> doesn't<00:02:21.010> matter<00:02:21.370> where<00:02:21.579> you<00:02:21.610> put<00:02:21.819> them<00:02:22.000> but
