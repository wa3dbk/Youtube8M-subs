00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
like watching zombie so I figured you

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.090 
like watching zombie so I figured you
know<00:02:38.610> why<00:02:38.850> not<00:02:38.880> do<00:02:39.180> more<00:02:39.420> zombies<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:40.050> do<00:02:40.620> the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
know why not do more zombies I do the

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.440 
know why not do more zombies I do the
multiplayer<00:02:41.580> maybe<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.030> guys<00:02:42.120> don't<00:02:42.180> like

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
multiplayer maybe you guys don't like

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.840 
multiplayer maybe you guys don't like
seeing<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.780> multi-player<00:02:43.260> as<00:02:43.380> much<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.830> know<00:02:44.730> a

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
seeing a multi-player as much I know a

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.220 
seeing a multi-player as much I know a
lot<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.030> my<00:02:45.150> subscribers<00:02:45.330> came<00:02:45.720> from<00:02:45.810> zombies

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
lot of my subscribers came from zombies

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.110 
lot of my subscribers came from zombies
so<00:02:46.320> I<00:02:46.380> figured<00:02:46.680> why<00:02:47.280> not<00:02:47.310> do<00:02:47.640> as<00:02:47.760> much<00:02:47.910> like

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120
