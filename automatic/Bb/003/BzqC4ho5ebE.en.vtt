gaps here for some better airflow I
don't<00:00:50.059> know<00:00:50.180> how<00:00:50.390> it's<00:00:50.510> going<00:00:50.629> to<00:00:50.720> perform<00:00:50.960> yet

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
don't know how it's going to perform yet

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.740 
don't know how it's going to perform yet
this<00:00:52.370> is<00:00:52.519> a<00:00:52.549> 70<00:00:53.239> amp<00:00:53.390> speed<00:00:53.750> control<00:00:55.059> I<00:00:56.059> left<00:00:56.600> a

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
this is a 70 amp speed control I left a

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.460 
this is a 70 amp speed control I left a
lot<00:00:56.900> of<00:00:56.960> gap<00:00:57.350> here<00:00:58.269> for<00:00:59.269> air<00:00:59.449> flow<00:00:59.629> I<00:00:59.960> didn't

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
lot of gap here for air flow I didn't

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.009 
lot of gap here for air flow I didn't
mind<00:01:00.710> that<00:01:01.339> it<00:01:02.089> that<00:01:02.479> there<00:01:02.659> was<00:01:02.780> a<00:01:02.809> gap

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
mind that it that there was a gap

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.420 
mind that it that there was a gap
because<00:01:03.229> I<00:01:03.379> really<00:01:03.589> preferred<00:01:03.949> there<00:01:04.129> to<00:01:04.250> be<00:01:04.400> a

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
because I really preferred there to be a

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.289 
because I really preferred there to be a

Sean am I supposed to hold it right

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:58.030 
Sean am I supposed to hold it right
there

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:16.850 

82<00:02:58.909> miles<00:02:59.120> an<00:02:59.299> hour

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:04:00.270 

and<00:03:17.130> boy<00:03:17.310> this<00:03:17.520> way

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:14.690 

then<00:04:01.280> I'm<00:04:01.580> slowing<00:04:02.000> up

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:31.590 

whoa

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:46.070 

whoa

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:05:30.029 

oh<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:49.270> frame<00:04:49.599> bent<00:05:21.270> I<00:05:28.650> think<00:05:29.650> I<00:05:29.710> found<00:05:29.919> the

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
oh the frame bent I think I found the

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.279 
oh the frame bent I think I found the
weak<00:05:30.219> spot<00:05:30.490> on<00:05:30.610> this<00:05:30.759> plane<00:05:31.000> I<00:05:32.969> didn't<00:05:33.969> think

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
weak spot on this plane I didn't think

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.050 
weak spot on this plane I didn't think
that's<00:05:35.289> an<00:05:35.560> unusual<00:05:35.740> spot<00:05:36.340> for<00:05:36.580> it<00:05:36.669> to<00:05:36.759> be<00:05:36.879> but

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
that's an unusual spot for it to be but

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.399 
that's an unusual spot for it to be but
it<00:05:37.180> makes<00:05:37.360> sense<00:05:37.569> because<00:05:37.840> there's<00:05:38.199> only<00:05:38.289> a

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409 
it makes sense because there's only a

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:40.830 
it makes sense because there's only a
single<00:05:38.620> piece<00:05:38.949> gone<00:05:39.250> through<00:05:39.490> there<00:05:39.840> makes

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
single piece gone through there makes

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.619 
single piece gone through there makes
tons<00:05:41.169> of<00:05:41.379> sense

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:42.629 
tons of sense

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:45.450 
tons of sense
look<00:05:43.629> at<00:05:43.719> that<00:05:43.839> flew<00:05:44.409> the<00:05:44.560> wings<00:05:44.770> off<00:05:45.009> of<00:05:45.039> it

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
look at that flew the wings off of it

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.279 
look at that flew the wings off of it
see<00:05:45.669> how<00:05:45.759> that<00:05:45.819> the<00:05:46.210> missile<00:05:46.659> comes<00:05:46.930> down<00:05:47.139> at

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
see how that the missile comes down at

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:48.719 
see how that the missile comes down at
the<00:05:47.379> same<00:05:47.589> place<00:05:47.830> that<00:05:48.039> this<00:05:48.159> comes<00:05:48.370> down<00:05:48.550> so

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
the same place that this comes down so

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.869 
the same place that this comes down so
there's<00:05:48.909> no<00:05:48.940> doubled<00:05:49.360> up<00:05:49.479> there<00:05:49.770> no<00:05:50.770> and<00:05:51.520> I<00:05:51.699> did
