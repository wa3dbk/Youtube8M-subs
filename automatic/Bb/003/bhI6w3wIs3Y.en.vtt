00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
small and first of all we think of

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.599 
small and first of all we think of
safety<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.949> we've<00:00:58.949> got<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> very<00:00:59.309> good

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
safety and we've got a very good

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.119 
safety and we've got a very good
seatbelt<00:01:00.210> arrangement<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.899> here<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.859> a

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
seatbelt arrangement in here it's a

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.899 
seatbelt arrangement in here it's a
six-point<00:01:03.059> harness<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:04.549> but<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:05.850> a

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
six-point harness it's but if you have a

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.460 
six-point harness it's but if you have a
very<00:01:06.150> large<00:01:06.330> impact<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:07.020> don't<00:01:07.229> move<00:01:07.409> very

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
very large impact you don't move very

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.310 
very large impact you don't move very
far<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.220> that's<00:01:08.580> very<00:01:08.880> important<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:10.140> get

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.240 
at about 60 you're just a little bit
above<00:01:50.100> 60<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:50.909> ideal<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:52.470> fuel<00:01:53.130> pressure

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
above 60 that is ideal the fuel pressure

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.840 
above 60 that is ideal the fuel pressure
comes<00:01:53.579> up<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.880> about<00:01:53.939> 40<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.430> we've<00:01:56.430> got<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
comes up to about 40 and we've got the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.389 
comes up to about 40 and we've got the
oil<00:01:57.149> pressure<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:58.619> don't<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.159> see<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
oil pressure we don't like to see the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.819 
oil pressure we don't like to see the
oil<00:01:59.430> pressure<00:01:59.820> drop<00:02:00.180> below<00:02:00.360> 40<00:02:01.049> then<00:02:01.259> there's

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
oil pressure drop below 40 then there's

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.069 
oil pressure drop below 40 then there's
something<00:02:02.040> wrong<00:02:02.340> with<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.640> engine<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
something wrong with the engine and the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.260 
something wrong with the engine and the
water<00:02:04.320> temp<00:02:04.680> oil<00:02:05.159> temperature<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.090> oil

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
water temp oil temperature the oil

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.740 
water temp oil temperature the oil
temperature<00:02:06.420> goes<00:02:06.869> above<00:02:07.580> 100

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
temperature goes above 100

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.330 
temperature goes above 100
20<00:02:09.110> then<00:02:09.289> we've<00:02:09.470> got<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:09.649> coming<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.100> fifth

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
20 then we've got it coming the fifth

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.310 
20 then we've got it coming the fifth
there's<00:02:10.580> also<00:02:10.729> something's<00:02:11.300> wrong<00:02:11.540> now<00:02:12.170> in

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
there's also something's wrong now in

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.320 
there's also something's wrong now in
case<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.530> a<00:02:12.770> fire<00:02:13.010> we've<00:02:13.910> got<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.090> fire

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
case of a fire we've got a fire

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.030 
case of a fire we've got a fire
extinguisher<00:02:14.360> button<00:02:15.230> we<00:02:15.560> just<00:02:15.770> press<00:02:16.010> that

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
extinguisher button we just press that

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.990 
extinguisher button we just press that
and<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:17.110> this<00:02:18.190> fire<00:02:19.190> extinguisher<00:02:19.310> spray

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
and the this fire extinguisher spray

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.180 
and the this fire extinguisher spray
comes<00:02:20.360> all<00:02:20.630> over<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:20.990> driver<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.770> all<00:02:21.980> over

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
comes all over the driver and all over

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.370 
comes all over the driver and all over
the<00:02:22.430> engine<00:02:22.750> what<00:02:23.750> we<00:02:23.840> can<00:02:24.020> do<00:02:24.170> here<00:02:24.590> we've<00:02:25.160> got

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
the engine what we can do here we've got

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.740 
the engine what we can do here we've got
adjustable<00:02:27.380> rear<00:02:27.800> roll<00:02:28.100> bar<00:02:28.370> so<00:02:28.670> we<00:02:28.850> can<00:02:28.880> while

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
adjustable rear roll bar so we can while

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.530 
adjustable rear roll bar so we can while
we're<00:02:29.870> driving<00:02:30.020> along<00:02:30.380> we<00:02:31.310> can<00:02:31.340> change<00:02:32.030> the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
we're driving along we can change the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.170 
we're driving along we can change the
setting<00:02:32.990> it's<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.680> blade<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.459> blade<00:02:34.700> turns

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
setting it's a blade and the blade turns

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.120 
setting it's a blade and the blade turns
to<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.570> hard<00:02:35.840> position<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.560> then<00:02:36.650> for<00:02:36.890> that

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
to a hard position and then for that

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.520 
to a hard position and then for that
position<00:02:37.370> we<00:02:37.790> can<00:02:37.940> also<00:02:38.090> change<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.140> front

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
position we can also change the front

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.380 
position we can also change the front
and<00:02:39.890> you'll<00:02:40.070> be<00:02:40.190> changing<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.880> all<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.239> way

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
and you'll be changing that all the way

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.360 
and you'll be changing that all the way
through<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.810> rate<00:02:41.989> try<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.560> get<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.830> maximum

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
through the rate try and get the maximum

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.880 
through the rate try and get the maximum
out<00:02:43.520> of<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.730> car<00:02:44.110> now<00:02:45.110> on<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.350> right<00:02:45.530> there

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
out of the car now on the right there

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.949 
out of the car now on the right there
we've<00:02:46.160> we've<00:02:46.790> got<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.060> gear<00:02:47.270> shift<00:02:47.570> it's<00:02:47.780> not

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
we've we've got the gear shift it's not

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.600 
we've we've got the gear shift it's not
on<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.200> normal<00:02:48.530> left-hand<00:02:48.950> side<00:02:49.190> as<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.370> road

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
on the normal left-hand side as a road

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.770 
on the normal left-hand side as a road
car<00:02:49.910> it's<00:02:50.450> on<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.660> right-hand<00:02:50.870> side<00:02:52.600> this<00:02:53.600> is

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
car it's on the right-hand side this is

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.110 
car it's on the right-hand side this is
all<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.020> movement<00:02:54.440> that<00:02:54.530> we<00:02:54.709> do<00:02:54.890> have<00:02:55.220> between

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
all the movement that we do have between

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.210 
all the movement that we do have between
say<00:02:56.690> getting<00:02:57.020> into<00:02:57.230> second<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.680> third<00:02:57.920> here

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
say getting into second and third here

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.640 
say getting into second and third here
to<00:02:58.820> moving<00:02:59.180> across<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.959> going<00:03:00.230> into<00:03:00.380> fourth

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
to moving across and going into fourth

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.250 
to moving across and going into fourth
and<00:03:00.890> fifth<00:03:01.190> now<00:03:01.820> there's<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.120> spring<00:03:02.900> there<00:03:03.110> to

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
and fifth now there's a spring there to

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.720 
and fifth now there's a spring there to
stop<00:03:03.500> you're<00:03:03.680> going<00:03:03.800> into<00:03:04.130> first<00:03:04.459> gear

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
stop you're going into first gear

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.260 
stop you're going into first gear
because<00:03:05.120> it<00:03:05.570> happens<00:03:05.900> also<00:03:06.140> quickly<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:07.550> you

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
because it happens also quickly that you

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.410 
because it happens also quickly that you
start<00:03:08.600> off<00:03:08.870> on<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:10.070> grid<00:03:10.310> in<00:03:10.550> first<00:03:10.880> so<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.209> go

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
start off on the grid in first so you go

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.360 
start off on the grid in first so you go
move<00:03:11.870> across<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.440> then<00:03:12.560> down<00:03:12.769> and<00:03:13.130> then<00:03:13.280> you

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
move across and then down and then you

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.420 
move across and then down and then you
come<00:03:13.640> up<00:03:13.850> spring<00:03:14.840> foot<00:03:15.230> sort<00:03:15.440> of<00:03:15.500> cross<00:03:15.739> so<00:03:16.340> you

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
come up spring foot sort of cross so you

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.270 
come up spring foot sort of cross so you
can<00:03:16.610> move<00:03:16.760> straight<00:03:17.000> into<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.390> second<00:03:18.280> okay

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
can move straight into the second okay

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.190 
can move straight into the second okay
if<00:03:19.820> you<00:03:19.970> think<00:03:20.180> of<00:03:20.269> an<00:03:20.360> arrow<00:03:20.540> flying<00:03:20.840> we've

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
if you think of an arrow flying we've

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.009 
if you think of an arrow flying we've
got<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.470> big<00:03:21.620> wings<00:03:21.830> outside<00:03:22.810> but<00:03:23.810> they're

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
got the big wings outside but they're

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.060 
got the big wings outside but they're
shaped<00:03:24.790> like<00:03:25.790> this<00:03:26.060> okay<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.110> that<00:03:27.680> creates

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
shaped like this okay and that creates

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.430 
shaped like this okay and that creates
lift<00:03:28.459> for<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.850> aeroplane<00:03:29.090> we<00:03:29.660> turn<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.230> wings

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
lift for the aeroplane we turn the wings

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.310 
lift for the aeroplane we turn the wings
upside<00:03:30.890> down<00:03:31.190> so<00:03:31.489> it<00:03:31.610> pushes<00:03:31.940> onto<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:33.019> ground

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
upside down so it pushes onto the ground

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.229 
upside down so it pushes onto the ground
so<00:03:33.650> when<00:03:33.980> you've<00:03:34.070> got<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.340> car<00:03:34.610> connected<00:03:35.120> to

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
so when you've got the car connected to

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.509 
so when you've got the car connected to
the<00:03:35.330> wings<00:03:35.570> it's<00:03:36.230> pushing<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.680> whole<00:03:36.980> car<00:03:37.310> on

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
the wings it's pushing the whole car on

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.759 
the wings it's pushing the whole car on
the<00:03:37.640> ground<00:03:37.870> which<00:03:38.870> makes<00:03:39.170> you<00:03:39.320> go<00:03:39.500> quick

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
the ground which makes you go quick

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.440 
the ground which makes you go quick
round<00:03:40.010> corners<00:03:40.519> now<00:03:41.090> you've<00:03:41.209> got<00:03:41.299> to<00:03:41.390> be

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
round corners now you've got to be

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.270 
round corners now you've got to be
careful<00:03:41.720> on<00:03:42.049> how<00:03:42.290> much<00:03:42.530> wind<00:03:42.829> you've<00:03:43.010> got

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
careful on how much wind you've got

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.420 
careful on how much wind you've got
because<00:03:43.970> if<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.239> you<00:03:44.840> turn<00:03:45.079> this<00:03:45.230> flap<00:03:45.560> up<00:03:45.829> it

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
because if you you turn this flap up it

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.670 
because if you you turn this flap up it
creates<00:03:46.790> drag<00:03:47.420> as<00:03:47.660> well<00:03:47.870> as<00:03:48.019> downforce

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
creates drag as well as downforce

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.920 
creates drag as well as downforce
so<00:03:48.799> you've<00:03:48.950> got<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:49.250> fine<00:03:49.760> tuner<00:03:50.269> for<00:03:50.630> every

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
so you've got a fine tuner for every

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.319 
so you've got a fine tuner for every
circuit<00:03:51.769> it's<00:03:52.100> a<00:03:52.190> Silverstone<00:03:52.790> we<00:03:52.910> have<00:03:53.090> very

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
circuit it's a Silverstone we have very

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.140 
circuit it's a Silverstone we have very
little<00:03:53.510> wing<00:03:54.310> brands<00:03:55.310> hatch<00:03:55.519> we'd<00:03:55.760> have<00:03:55.910> a<00:03:55.940> lot

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
little wing brands hatch we'd have a lot

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.410 
little wing brands hatch we'd have a lot
of<00:03:56.180> wings<00:03:56.390> try<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:56.780> get<00:03:56.870> around<00:03:57.019> the<00:03:57.110> corner

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420

of wings try and get around the corner
start<00:03:59.420> off<00:03:59.540> with<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.840> battery<00:04:00.230> it's<00:04:00.380> very

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
start off with the battery it's very

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.160 
start off with the battery it's very
small<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.190> compact<00:04:01.540> we<00:04:02.540> put<00:04:02.900> it<00:04:03.019> out<00:04:03.140> there

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
small and compact we put it out there

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.900 
small and compact we put it out there
because<00:04:03.500> it's<00:04:03.709> about<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:04.040> best<00:04:04.250> place<00:04:04.519> we<00:04:04.760> can

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
because it's about the best place we can

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.780 
because it's about the best place we can
put<00:04:05.180> it<00:04:05.440> there's<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.650> fuel<00:04:06.890> tank<00:04:07.190> we<00:04:07.489> put<00:04:07.519> the

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
put it there's the fuel tank we put the

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.610 
put it there's the fuel tank we put the
fuel<00:04:08.030> in<00:04:08.180> there<00:04:08.420> right<00:04:08.870> behind<00:04:09.049> the<00:04:09.320> driver

that<00:04:10.220> is<00:04:10.400> also<00:04:10.610> very<00:04:10.790> safe<00:04:11.360> we<00:04:12.350> got<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:13.040> fuel

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
that is also very safe we got the fuel

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.030 
that is also very safe we got the fuel

are<00:04:26.690> Volkswagen<00:04:27.380> in<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:28.010> world<00:04:28.389> we've<00:04:29.389> got

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
are Volkswagen in the world we've got

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.540 
are Volkswagen in the world we've got
we've<00:04:29.780> moved<00:04:30.050> over<00:04:30.320> here<00:04:30.350> to<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.919> oil<00:04:31.130> tank

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
we've moved over here to the oil tank

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.820 
we've moved over here to the oil tank
now<00:04:32.150> it's<00:04:32.389> a<00:04:32.449> dry<00:04:32.660> sump<00:04:32.990> engine<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.530> reason

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
now it's a dry sump engine the reason

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.520 
now it's a dry sump engine the reason
why<00:04:33.979> we<00:04:34.160> do<00:04:34.340> that<00:04:34.580> because<00:04:35.090> we<00:04:35.840> can<00:04:36.050> get<00:04:36.229> a<00:04:36.260> very

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
why we do that because we can get a very

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.650 
why we do that because we can get a very
small<00:04:36.919> Sun<00:04:37.280> we<00:04:37.460> can<00:04:37.610> lower<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:37.970> engine<00:04:38.270> which

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
small Sun we can lower the engine which

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.480 
small Sun we can lower the engine which
is<00:04:38.690> good<00:04:39.350> for<00:04:39.560> low<00:04:40.070> gravity<00:04:40.400> on<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.120> car<00:04:41.449> and

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
is good for low gravity on the car and

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.520 
is good for low gravity on the car and
also<00:04:43.490> we<00:04:43.669> can<00:04:43.820> control<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.570> amount<00:04:45.110> of<00:04:45.260> oil

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
also we can control the amount of oil

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.800 
also we can control the amount of oil
that<00:04:45.710> goes<00:04:46.010> through<00:04:46.280> the<00:04:46.430> engine<00:04:46.820> which<00:04:47.510> means

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
that goes through the engine which means

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.080 
that goes through the engine which means
that<00:04:48.110> if<00:04:48.620> we<00:04:48.800> have<00:04:48.830> more<00:04:49.220> oil<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.760> engine

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
that if we have more oil the engine

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.570 
that if we have more oil the engine
slower<00:04:50.449> and<00:04:50.900> if<00:04:51.050> we<00:04:51.199> have<00:04:51.380> less<00:04:51.650> oil<00:04:51.949> but

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
slower and if we have less oil but

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.270 
slower and if we have less oil but
enough<00:04:52.850> oil<00:04:53.090> to<00:04:53.270> keep<00:04:53.419> the<00:04:53.600> engine<00:04:53.900> running

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
enough oil to keep the engine running

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.520 
enough oil to keep the engine running
it's<00:04:55.280> going<00:04:55.520> to<00:04:55.610> be<00:04:55.699> quicker<00:04:55.990> then<00:04:56.990> we<00:04:57.110> move<00:04:57.289> on

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
it's going to be quicker then we move on

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.129 
it's going to be quicker then we move on
to<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:58.100> suspension<00:04:58.760> as<00:04:59.270> we<00:04:59.570> can<00:04:59.720> see<00:04:59.900> that

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
to the suspension as we can see that

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:01.689 
to the suspension as we can see that
it's<00:05:00.320> a<00:05:00.380> little<00:05:00.500> bit<00:05:00.590> different<00:05:00.830> layout<00:05:01.370> the

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
it's a little bit different layout the

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.029 
it's a little bit different layout the
front<00:05:01.970> still<00:05:02.479> operated<00:05:03.080> by<00:05:03.350> the<00:05:03.410> push<00:05:03.800> rod

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
front still operated by the push rod

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.850 
front still operated by the push rod
here<00:05:04.340> which<00:05:04.550> pushes<00:05:05.030> that<00:05:05.210> rocker<00:05:05.510> down<00:05:06.470> and

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
here which pushes that rocker down and

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.520 
here which pushes that rocker down and
onto<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.310> spring<00:05:07.550> and<00:05:07.850> the<00:05:08.060> damper<00:05:08.350> also<00:05:09.350> we

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
onto the spring and the damper also we

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.760 
onto the spring and the damper also we
have<00:05:09.800> here<00:05:10.090> adjustable<00:05:11.090> rear<00:05:11.900> roll<00:05:12.229> bar<00:05:12.500> like

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
have here adjustable rear roll bar like

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.379 
have here adjustable rear roll bar like
we<00:05:12.949> have<00:05:13.100> at<00:05:13.250> the<00:05:13.340> front<00:05:13.610> with<00:05:13.880> the<00:05:13.910> blades

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
we have at the front with the blades

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.330 
we have at the front with the blades
which<00:05:14.780> make<00:05:15.020> a<00:05:15.050> considerable<00:05:15.620> difference<00:05:15.860> for

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
which make a considerable difference for

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.870 
which make a considerable difference for
the<00:05:16.460> handling<00:05:17.710> now<00:05:18.710> we<00:05:18.770> we<00:05:19.310> come<00:05:19.520> into<00:05:19.789> the

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
the handling now we we come into the

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.180 
the handling now we we come into the
pits<00:05:20.150> the<00:05:20.360> tires<00:05:20.630> are<00:05:20.900> very<00:05:21.110> hard

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
pits the tires are very hard

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.760 
pits the tires are very hard
they<00:05:22.490> put<00:05:22.729> a<00:05:22.760> pyro<00:05:23.419> in<00:05:23.840> to<00:05:24.380> check<00:05:24.620> the

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
they put a pyro in to check the

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.210 
they put a pyro in to check the
temperature<00:05:25.150> across<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.360> tire<00:05:26.570> and<00:05:27.099> leaves<00:05:28.099> a

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
temperature across the tire and leaves a

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.820 
temperature across the tire and leaves a
radial<00:05:28.639> tire<00:05:28.669> so<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.690> radial<00:05:30.050> tires<00:05:30.289> needs<00:05:30.710> a

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
radial tire so the radial tires needs a

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.890 
radial tire so the radial tires needs a
little<00:05:30.979> bit<00:05:31.130> more<00:05:31.190> Campbell<00:05:31.820> cancer<00:05:32.539> than<00:05:32.720> the

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
little bit more Campbell cancer than the

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.950 
little bit more Campbell cancer than the
normal<00:05:33.380> cross<00:05:33.770> product<00:05:34.460> so<00:05:35.270> if<00:05:35.570> you<00:05:35.660> look<00:05:35.840> at

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
normal cross product so if you look at

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.589 
normal cross product so if you look at
the<00:05:36.050> tire<00:05:36.289> and<00:05:36.650> it<00:05:37.010> says<00:05:37.280> it's<00:05:37.760> not<00:05:38.090> quite<00:05:38.419> flat

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
the tire and it says it's not quite flat

enough on the inside we can undo the

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.290 
enough on the inside we can undo the
nuts<00:05:42.410> here<00:05:42.680> and<00:05:42.919> adjust<00:05:43.280> the<00:05:43.700> cam<00:05:43.910> put<00:05:44.090> a

nuts here and adjust the cam put a

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.510 
nuts here and adjust the cam put a
little<00:05:44.510> bit<00:05:44.660> more<00:05:44.720> in<00:05:45.139> go<00:05:45.500> out<00:05:45.680> there<00:05:45.979> again<00:05:46.130> on

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
little bit more in go out there again on

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.219 
little bit more in go out there again on
the<00:05:46.610> track<00:05:46.880> and<00:05:47.150> then<00:05:47.630> see<00:05:47.900> what<00:05:48.110> the

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
the track and then see what the

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:49.659 
the track and then see what the
temperatures<00:05:48.710> like<00:05:48.919> because<00:05:49.340> it's<00:05:49.520> so

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
temperatures like because it's so

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:50.950 
temperatures like because it's so
critical<00:05:49.880> to<00:05:50.210> get<00:05:50.330> that<00:05:50.510> right

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
critical to get that right

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.930 
critical to get that right
so<00:05:51.349> you've<00:05:51.530> lost<00:05:51.740> the<00:05:52.039> whole<00:05:52.250> race<00:05:52.520> without<00:05:52.789> a

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
so you've lost the whole race without a

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.409 
so you've lost the whole race without a
blistering<00:05:53.690> a<00:05:53.750> tire<00:05:55.120> but<00:05:56.120> all<00:05:56.240> that

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
blistering a tire but all that

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.839 
blistering a tire but all that
technology<00:05:57.139> can<00:05:57.349> be<00:05:57.530> wiped<00:05:57.740> out<00:05:57.979> in<00:05:58.280> moments

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:58.849 
technology can be wiped out in moments
