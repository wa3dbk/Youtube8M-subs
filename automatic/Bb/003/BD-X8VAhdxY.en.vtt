00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.370
 you always walk with us 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.740
 in the alleys of the retromobile lounge 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.599
 we are with alain and alain it is 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.510
 the opportunity for you to give us a 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.520
 little history lesson on in any 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.520
 modesty on an important mark then 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.100
 yes alpine of course 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.500
 for all fans of the brand 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.870
 alpine is above all legendary 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.580
 berlinette who would climb on the 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.950
 rallies we have three beautiful behind 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.330
 we in addition pretty emblematic of the 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.060
 brand with different engines 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.710
 which marks the evolution of the 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.059
 berlinette stranding the ambitions of the 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.830
 brand in rally with motorcycles are 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.870
 more and more powerful but alpine it's 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:49.040
 also a circuit adventure 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.450
 started as early as 1963 Alpine alpine good and 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.710
 actually it's still very popular 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.629
 in the audience's image 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.400
 but here it is also a hymn a tribute 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.130
 to jean the founder of the brand 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.390
 with a collection of automobiles that 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.280
 are part of the jean collection 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.320
 charles his son who gather by 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.960
 this day charles and jean charles is 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.280
 also a historic race driver and 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.729
 so practically all these cars 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.350
 are aligned very regularly and 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.420
 promises with jean-charles and 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.550
 is at the wheel both in circuit and 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.140
 we are in rally here to him it's still 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.670
 very recently in the first story 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.350
 if we had to do a little focus is 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.300
 would be on which greenhouse has already already 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.910
 the 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.790
 at the very first obviously the 63 n 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:31.160
 who is the first who is the first 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.290
 alpine circuit the first time or 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.930
 alpine arrived at the 24 hours of mans 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.850
 so the beginnings was and is still 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.980
 very modest it was a car 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.870
 who is in philosophy already in the 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.580
 alpine philosophy with a superb 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.220
 very very effective profiling for 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.050
 that together to compensate for the drag 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.400
 but finally the modesty of mechanics 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.200
 so these are small engines 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.270
 usually we feel or thirteen 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.729
 cubic centimeters around 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.310
 to go from a hundred a 110 horsepower 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.050
 at the time but we arrive thanks to this 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.580
 profiling and lightness of the whole 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.470
 we arrive at very fast speeds 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.390
 well above 200 km / h 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.580
 so this one is still the 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.259
 first time or alpine comes to mans and 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.660
 after it goes to the next step where 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.730
 we are late 1967 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.860
 alas the ambitions of the brand are in 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.840
 rise because we're gone it's a 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.760
 hybrid model between models 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.950
 Intermediates that are mechanical 1 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.200
 between 13 cents and 15 cubic centimeters 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.180
 there we modified the rear part to 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.660
 receive their astonishment the very first 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.650
 gorgini v8 engine of 3000 centimeters 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.850
 cubes so here we come in the 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.730
 higher category 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.280
 and it's an intermediate model 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.349
 but which is finally quite well designed 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.030
 because this car despite its side 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.700
 Hybrid it's a car anyway 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.900
 borders the 300 km / h peak and 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.310
 say of those pious who was 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.980
 relatively stable and all for one 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.930
 somewhat intermediate model was rather 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.989
 well born and it was the beginnings of the 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.910
 here is a big prototype category the 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.280
 category queen 3000 cubic centimeters 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.849
 so starts at montlhÃ©ry in 1900 miles 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.849
 kilometers from Paris in 1967 and after 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:08.569
 leads to the real 3 liters of the mark 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:11.840
 who is there at 220 and who ran two 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.030
 successive years in 1968 and 1969 to 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.349
 24 hours of mans in particular since 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.129
 some trials to his loved ones as 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:21.859
 monza or spa and that was so animated 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.019
 by the v8 3 the ipc unfortunately a 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.670
 car also extremely well and very 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.349
 aerodynamically efficient very 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.359
 very fast in tip but 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.470
 unfortunately served by an engine 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.200
 gordini 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.060
 a bit of another age without being 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.090
 irreverent for amedee gordini but 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.950
 who was in another era was a 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.120
 powerful enough to play 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.120
 allow them to play a leading role
