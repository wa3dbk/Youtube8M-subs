00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
is quite unique for Yamaha what we

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.060 
is quite unique for Yamaha what we
actually<00:00:57.630> did<00:00:57.960> was<00:00:58.260> use<00:00:59.040> European<00:00:59.870> designers

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
actually did was use European designers

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.830 
actually did was use European designers
European<00:01:02.070> technicians<00:01:02.579> European<00:01:03.210> artisans

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
European technicians European artisans

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.880 
European technicians European artisans
to<00:01:04.760> specify<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.090> design<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:07.440> they<00:01:07.650> thought

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
to specify and design what they thought

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.280 
to specify and design what they thought
would<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.190> the<00:01:08.340> best<00:01:08.370> possible<00:01:09.210> upright<00:01:09.960> piano

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
would be the best possible upright piano

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.800 
would be the best possible upright piano
they<00:01:10.470> could<00:01:10.620> make<00:01:10.800> so<00:01:11.790> using<00:01:12.479> European

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
they could make so using European

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.770 
they could make so using European
components<00:01:13.940> which<00:01:14.940> is<00:01:15.090> quite<00:01:15.330> different<00:01:15.600> from

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
components which is quite different from

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.140 
components which is quite different from
us<00:01:16.049> because<00:01:16.530> we're<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> Japanese<00:01:17.190> company<00:01:17.370> so

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
us because we're a Japanese company so

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.210 
us because we're a Japanese company so
we<00:01:18.390> took<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.900> board<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.010> piano

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
we took that on board and in this piano

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.360 
we took that on board and in this piano
you<00:01:20.460> will<00:01:20.670> actually<00:01:20.850> find<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:22.320> best<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:23.100> our

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
you will actually find the best of our

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.160 
you will actually find the best of our
Japanese<00:01:23.640> manufacturing<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.570> terms<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.930> maybe

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
Japanese manufacturing in terms of maybe

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.560 
Japanese manufacturing in terms of maybe
the<00:01:25.320> best<00:01:25.470> action<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:25.979> world<00:01:26.280> Yamaha<00:01:26.850> but

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
the best action in the world Yamaha but

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.230 
the best action in the world Yamaha but
many<00:01:28.140> components<00:01:28.799> sourced<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.880> Europe

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
many components sourced here in Europe

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.620 
many components sourced here in Europe
to<00:01:30.869> create<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.530> sound<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.250> tone<00:01:32.580> which<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.240> very

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
to create a sound a tone which is very

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.090 
to create a sound a tone which is very
much<00:01:33.690> at<00:01:33.930> home<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.440> think<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:34.799> most<00:01:34.920> European

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
much at home I think for most European

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.510 
much at home I think for most European
customers<00:01:35.850> sounds<00:01:36.690> are<00:01:36.780> very<00:01:36.810> unique<00:01:37.520> very

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
customers sounds are very unique very

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.539 
customers sounds are very unique very
unique<00:01:38.729> I've<00:01:39.600> seen<00:01:39.900> yeah<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.070> could<00:01:41.190> call<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
unique I've seen yeah you could call the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.000 
unique I've seen yeah you could call the
big<00:01:41.729> brother<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.750> piano<00:01:43.080> let's<00:01:43.890> walk

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
big brother of this piano let's walk

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.270 
big brother of this piano let's walk
over<00:01:44.130> there<00:01:44.400> well<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.510> is<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> 122<00:01:46.650> centimeter

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
over there well this is a 122 centimeter

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.170 
over there well this is a 122 centimeter
piano<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.299> 132<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.760> size<00:01:50.760> matters

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
piano and this is 132 and size matters

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.200 
piano and this is 132 and size matters
so<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.320> bigger<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:53.310> bigger<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> sound

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
so the bigger it is the bigger the sound

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.020 
so the bigger it is the bigger the sound
the<00:01:54.600> more<00:01:54.750> powerful<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.530> sound<00:01:55.799> if<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.909> have

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
the more powerful the sound if you have

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.910 
the more powerful the sound if you have
a<00:01:57.060> maybe<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.570> slightly<00:01:57.810> bigger<00:01:58.080> room<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.710> will

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
a maybe a slightly bigger room this will

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.160 
a maybe a slightly bigger room this will
fill<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.310> you<00:02:00.210> know<00:02:00.330> maybe<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.689> little<00:02:00.780> bit<00:02:00.900> more

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
fill it you know maybe a little bit more

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.530 
fill it you know maybe a little bit more
than<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.470> one<00:02:01.680> but<00:02:01.860> at<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.880> level<00:02:03.060> both<00:02:03.420> of

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
than this one but at this level both of

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.510
