I<00:00:31.859> have<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> code<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.969> it's<00:00:33.630> been<00:00:33.840> when<00:00:34.050> it

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
I have a code and it's been when it

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.600 
I have a code and it's been when it
stopped<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.890> won't<00:00:35.130> go<00:00:35.370> away

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
stopped on it won't go away

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.280 
stopped on it won't go away
but<00:00:36.600> these<00:00:37.110> tutorials<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.980> go<00:00:38.129> out<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
but these tutorials have to go out and

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
let's take a look at how to create this

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.180 
let's take a look at how to create this
light<00:00:46.260> setup<00:00:46.579> this<00:00:48.350> type<00:00:49.350> which<00:00:49.860> were<00:00:49.980> looking

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
light setup this type which were looking

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.310 
light setup this type which were looking
at<00:00:50.280> right<00:00:50.430> now<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.910> from<00:00:51.510> one<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.050> our<00:00:52.140> other

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
at right now is from one of our other

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.590 
at right now is from one of our other
tutorials<00:00:52.590> called<00:00:53.460> how<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.000> create<00:00:54.390> a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
tutorials called how to create a

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.279 
tutorials called how to create a
chiseled<00:00:55.250> text<00:00:56.660> effect<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.840> if<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.079> haven't

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
chiseled text effect so if you haven't

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.750 
chiseled text effect so if you haven't
seen<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.829> can<00:01:00.890> probably<00:01:01.890> look<00:01:02.129> forward<00:01:02.609> to

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
seen it you can probably look forward to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
seen it you can probably look forward to
it<00:01:02.850> because<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.510> pretty<00:01:03.629> awesome

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
it because it's a pretty awesome

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.700 
it because it's a pretty awesome
tutorial<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:04.949> don't<00:01:05.220> mean<00:01:05.309> let's<00:01:06.680> set<00:01:07.680> up

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
tutorial but I don't mean let's set up

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.080 
tutorial but I don't mean let's set up
the<00:01:07.890> lighting<00:01:08.100> I'm<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.850> remove

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
the lighting I'm just going to remove

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.510 
the lighting I'm just going to remove
all<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.900> for<00:01:10.049> now<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.220> what<00:01:11.400> we

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
all of it for now so this is what we

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.080 
all of it for now so this is what we
have<00:01:11.700> by<00:01:11.970> default<00:01:12.950> let<00:01:13.950> me<00:01:14.159> get<00:01:14.610> any<00:01:14.820> light<00:01:15.619> and

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
have by default let me get any light and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.840 
have by default let me get any light and
I'm<00:01:18.090> gonna<00:01:18.330> go<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.320> array<00:01:19.590> icon<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.280> get

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
I'm gonna go to the array icon and get

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.010 
I'm gonna go to the array icon and get
array<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.890> drop<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.040> light<00:01:23.220> into<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.540> array

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
array and drop the light into the array

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.170 
array and drop the light into the array
and<00:01:26.450> this<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.780> what<00:01:28.080> we<00:01:28.229> have<00:01:28.790> what<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> array

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
and this is what we have what the array

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.499 
and this is what we have what the array
does<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.659> basically<00:01:31.049> make<00:01:31.439> clones<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.509> put

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
does is basically make clones and put

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.670 
does is basically make clones and put
them<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.869> circular<00:01:34.409> shape<00:01:35.509> so<00:01:36.509> if<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.110> set<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
them in a circular shape so if I set the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.590 
them in a circular shape so if I set the
number<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.070> copies<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:39.000> nine<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:41.060> actually<00:01:42.060> end

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
number of copies to nine I actually end

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.020 
number of copies to nine I actually end
up<00:01:42.780> with<00:01:43.170> ten<00:01:43.799> lights<00:01:44.070> because<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.729> doesn't

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
up with ten lights because it doesn't

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.469 
up with ten lights because it doesn't
count<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.630> first<00:01:45.869> one<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.149> way<00:01:48.420> to

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
count the first one and this is a way to

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.440 
count the first one and this is a way to
bright<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.439> if<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:50.009> go<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.759> light<00:01:50.970> let's

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
bright so if we go to the light let's

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.380 
bright so if we go to the light let's
change<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.229> intensity<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:53.450> ten

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
change the intensity to ten

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.720 
change the intensity to ten
and<00:01:56.140> let's<00:01:56.380> increase<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.920> radius<00:01:57.100> of<00:01:57.550> the

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
and let's increase the radius of the

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.610 
and let's increase the radius of the
array<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:59.010> maybe<00:02:00.010> 600<00:02:01.110> as<00:02:02.110> long<00:02:02.290> as<00:02:02.440> it's

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
array to maybe 600 as long as it's

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.510 
array to maybe 600 as long as it's
enough<00:02:02.980> to<00:02:03.600> cover<00:02:04.600> your<00:02:04.960> entire<00:02:05.200> logo<00:02:05.830> or<00:02:06.070> text

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
enough to cover your entire logo or text

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.180 
enough to cover your entire logo or text
you'll<00:02:06.700> be<00:02:06.850> fine<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.720> I<00:02:08.440> want<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.649> change<00:02:08.830> the

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
you'll be fine and I want to change the

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.190 
you'll be fine and I want to change the
page<00:02:09.580> rotation<00:02:10.210> to<00:02:10.630> 90<00:02:11.620> degrees<00:02:12.070> so<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:13.660> have

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
page rotation to 90 degrees so I have

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.190 
page rotation to 90 degrees so I have
this<00:02:17.700> okay<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.090> then<00:02:19.270> from<00:02:19.480> here<00:02:19.510> what<00:02:19.960> I<00:02:19.990> can

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
this okay and then from here what I can

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.850 
this okay and then from here what I can
do<00:02:20.380> is<00:02:20.680> duplicate<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:22.420> RA<00:02:22.600> and<00:02:22.990> just<00:02:23.500> bring

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
do is duplicate the RA and just bring

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.050 
do is duplicate the RA and just bring
this<00:02:24.040> out<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:25.750> about<00:02:25.780> here<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.850> lower<00:02:27.850> the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
this out to about here and lower the

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.780 
this out to about here and lower the
radius<00:02:28.450> attached<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:30.010> then<00:02:30.370> do<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.640> same

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
radius attached and then do the same

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.699 
radius attached and then do the same
again<00:02:31.120> just<00:02:31.480> duplicate<00:02:31.959> bring<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:32.860> out<00:02:33.100> and

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
again just duplicate bring this out and

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:42.090 
again just duplicate bring this out and
lower<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:36.520> radius<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:39.250> if<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:40.560> zero<00:02:41.560> out<00:02:41.860> my

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
lower the radius so if I zero out my

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.550 
lower the radius so if I zero out my
camera<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:44.440> return<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:45.190> just<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.760> front<00:02:46.560> maybe

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
camera to return to just the front maybe

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.540 
camera to return to just the front maybe
move<00:02:47.830> it<00:02:47.980> up<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.930> I<00:02:50.230> hit<00:02:50.350> random<00:02:50.800> you<00:02:51.190> can<00:02:51.340> see

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
move it up and I hit random you can see

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.250 
move it up and I hit random you can see
we<00:02:51.700> still<00:02:51.910> don't<00:02:52.090> have<00:02:52.150> anything<00:02:52.450> but

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
we still don't have anything but

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.280 
we still don't have anything but
interesting<00:02:54.100> yet<00:02:54.360> I'm<00:02:55.360> gonna<00:02:55.540> go<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.780> the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
interesting yet I'm gonna go to the

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.870 
interesting yet I'm gonna go to the
lights<00:02:56.770> and<00:02:57.959> add<00:02:58.959> a<00:02:59.410> shadow<00:03:00.220> Maps<00:03:00.670> soft<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.730> now

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
lights and add a shadow Maps soft so now

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.630 
lights and add a shadow Maps soft so now
we<00:03:03.940> have<00:03:04.239> some<00:03:04.450> last<00:03:04.660> shadows<00:03:05.140> in<00:03:05.470> between<00:03:05.980> the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
we have some last shadows in between the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.240 
we have some last shadows in between the
letters<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.660> this<00:03:07.989> is<00:03:08.140> kinda<00:03:08.560> like<00:03:08.590> a<00:03:08.830> fake

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
letters and this is kinda like a fake

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.810 
letters and this is kinda like a fake
ambient<00:03:09.970> occlusion<00:03:10.299> effect<00:03:11.070> only<00:03:12.070> it's<00:03:12.549> a<00:03:12.610> lot

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
ambient occlusion effect only it's a lot

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.320 
ambient occlusion effect only it's a lot
faster<00:03:13.299> and<00:03:14.430> I'm<00:03:15.430> also<00:03:15.580> going<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:15.880> increase

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
faster and I'm also going to increase

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.050 
faster and I'm also going to increase
the<00:03:16.510> contrast<00:03:16.780> of<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:18.459> slide<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:19.269> maybe<00:03:19.709> 50%

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
the contrast of the slide to maybe 50%

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.199 
the contrast of the slide to maybe 50%
and<00:03:22.620> thing<00:03:23.620> that<00:03:23.650> just<00:03:23.950> helps<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.400> separate

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
and thing that just helps to separate

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.190 
and thing that just helps to separate
the<00:03:25.390> highlights<00:03:25.810> from<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.470> shadows<00:03:27.989> anyway

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
the highlights from the shadows anyway

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.430 
the highlights from the shadows anyway
let's<00:03:29.410> carry<00:03:30.070> on<00:03:30.180> we're<00:03:31.180> gonna<00:03:31.390> get<00:03:34.440> another

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
let's carry on we're gonna get another

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.050 
let's carry on we're gonna get another
light<00:03:36.000> let's<00:03:37.000> bring<00:03:37.299> this<00:03:37.450> one<00:03:37.690> out<00:03:38.260> here<00:03:39.060> just

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
light let's bring this one out here just

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.370 
light let's bring this one out here just
past<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:41.019> third<00:03:41.320> set<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.860> lights<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:43.380> let's

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
past the third set of lights and let's

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.900 
past the third set of lights and let's
set<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:44.940> type<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.450> spot<00:03:47.580> let's<00:03:48.580> really

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
set the type to spot let's really

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.140 
set the type to spot let's really
increase<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.660> width<00:03:50.340> let's<00:03:51.340> go<00:03:51.610> to<00:03:51.670> details

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
increase the width let's go to details

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.560 
increase the width let's go to details
and<00:03:52.480> add<00:03:52.720> a<00:03:52.989> a<00:03:53.620> fall-off<00:03:54.220> so<00:03:54.940> a<00:03:54.970> linear

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
and add a a fall-off so a linear

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.280 
and add a a fall-off so a linear
fall-off<00:03:55.989> and<00:03:57.360> let's<00:03:58.360> put<00:03:58.930> that<00:03:59.079> bad

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
fall-off and let's put that bad

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.210 
fall-off and let's put that bad
I<00:04:00.550> think<00:04:01.550> maybe<00:04:02.480> an<00:04:02.810> inverse-square<00:04:03.290> fall<00:04:04.010> off

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
I think maybe an inverse-square fall off

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:11.440 
I think maybe an inverse-square fall off
my<00:04:04.370> de<00:04:04.430> better<00:04:05.260> in<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.500> square<00:04:06.980> clout<00:04:10.450> okay

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
my de better in the square clout okay

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.780 
my de better in the square clout okay
that<00:04:11.630> looks<00:04:11.750> pretty<00:04:11.959> good<00:04:12.080> to<00:04:12.230> me

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
that looks pretty good to me

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.039 
that looks pretty good to me
and<00:04:13.790> I'm<00:04:13.910> gonna<00:04:14.060> reduce<00:04:14.270> the<00:04:14.959> intensity<00:04:15.560> to<00:04:15.920> 35

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
and I'm gonna reduce the intensity to 35

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:24.840 
and I'm gonna reduce the intensity to 35
and<00:04:18.049> increase<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.859> contrast<00:04:19.310> to<00:04:21.310> 250<00:04:22.310> and

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.080 

that<00:04:25.850> just<00:04:26.030> adds<00:04:26.210> like<00:04:27.400> an<00:04:28.400> ambient<00:04:28.880> lighting

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
that just adds like an ambient lighting

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.650 
that just adds like an ambient lighting
so<00:04:29.450> everything<00:04:29.840> is<00:04:29.960> just<00:04:30.290> generally<00:04:31.660> brighter

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
so everything is just generally brighter

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.230 
so everything is just generally brighter
and<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:34.010> center<00:04:34.340> is<00:04:34.370> brighter<00:04:34.850> than<00:04:35.000> the

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
and the center is brighter than the

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
and the center is brighter than the
outside<00:04:35.660> so<00:04:35.990> it<00:04:36.110> brings<00:04:36.260> more<00:04:36.530> attention<00:04:37.000> to

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
outside so it brings more attention to

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.920 
outside so it brings more attention to
the<00:04:39.260> middle<00:04:39.530> of<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:39.830> frame<00:04:40.720> anyway<00:04:41.720> we're

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
the middle of the frame anyway we're

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.730 
the middle of the frame anyway we're
gonna<00:04:42.110> get<00:04:42.350> one<00:04:42.530> more<00:04:42.560> light<00:04:44.260> and<00:04:45.260> let's<00:04:45.470> move

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
gonna get one more light and let's move

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.760 
gonna get one more light and let's move
this<00:04:45.919> one<00:04:46.100> out<00:04:46.600> slightly<00:04:47.980> move<00:04:48.980> it<00:04:50.560> and<00:04:51.560> move

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
this one out slightly move it and move

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.300 
this one out slightly move it and move
it<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:52.220> there<00:04:52.520> right<00:04:53.060> so<00:04:53.980> it's<00:04:54.980> gonna<00:04:55.100> be

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
it to there right so it's gonna be

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.930 
it to there right so it's gonna be
beaming<00:04:56.210> down<00:04:56.419> from<00:04:56.480> up<00:04:56.960> here<00:04:57.370> let's<00:04:58.370> go<00:04:58.910> to

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
beaming down from up here let's go to

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.350 
beaming down from up here let's go to
the<00:04:59.480> general<00:04:59.990> settings<00:05:00.380> and<00:05:00.740> add<00:05:01.040> an<00:05:01.400> area

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
the general settings and add an area

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.659 
the general settings and add an area
shadow<00:05:03.490> so<00:05:04.490> now<00:05:04.910> when<00:05:05.120> I<00:05:05.150> render<00:05:05.419> I<00:05:06.430> have<00:05:07.430> this

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
shadow so now when I render I have this

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.340 
shadow so now when I render I have this
really<00:05:08.060> cool<00:05:08.180> shadow<00:05:09.080> down<00:05:10.040> here<00:05:10.850> I<00:05:11.229> think<00:05:12.229> I'm

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
really cool shadow down here I think I'm

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.370 
really cool shadow down here I think I'm
gonna<00:05:12.669> maybe<00:05:13.669> lengthen<00:05:14.240> that<00:05:14.600> shadow<00:05:14.870> so<00:05:15.200> just

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
gonna maybe lengthen that shadow so just

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.159 
gonna maybe lengthen that shadow so just
move<00:05:15.590> this<00:05:15.800> closer<00:05:16.040> to<00:05:16.280> the<00:05:16.400> back<00:05:16.610> all<00:05:17.169> I'm

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
move this closer to the back all I'm

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.570 
move this closer to the back all I'm
just<00:05:18.229> gonna<00:05:18.440> push<00:05:18.680> it<00:05:18.800> to<00:05:18.830> their<00:05:19.070> left<00:05:19.370> a

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
just gonna push it to their left a

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.980 
just gonna push it to their left a
little<00:05:21.580> so<00:05:22.580> the<00:05:22.700> shadow<00:05:22.940> is<00:05:23.060> gonna<00:05:23.240> be<00:05:23.450> much

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
little so the shadow is gonna be much

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.190 
little so the shadow is gonna be much
much<00:05:24.260> larger<00:05:25.150> I'm<00:05:26.150> also<00:05:26.450> gonna<00:05:26.690> brighten<00:05:26.990> this

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
much larger I'm also gonna brighten this

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.960 
much larger I'm also gonna brighten this
light<00:05:27.380> up<00:05:27.590> to<00:05:27.860> maybe<00:05:28.630> 125<00:05:30.010> and<00:05:31.010> increase<00:05:31.760> the

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
light up to maybe 125 and increase the

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.830 
light up to maybe 125 and increase the
contrast<00:05:32.540> to<00:05:32.990> maybe<00:05:33.229> 35<00:05:34.130> and<00:05:34.490> then<00:05:35.390> hit<00:05:35.630> render

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
contrast to maybe 35 and then hit render

contrast to maybe 35 and then hit render
again<00:05:36.710> and<00:05:38.260> there<00:05:39.260> we<00:05:39.290> have<00:05:39.560> it<00:05:39.729> as<00:05:40.729> you<00:05:40.820> can

again and there we have it as you can
see<00:05:41.120> it<00:05:41.750> doesn't<00:05:41.930> take<00:05:42.169> long<00:05:42.380> to<00:05:42.410> set<00:05:42.800> this<00:05:42.950> up

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
see it doesn't take long to set this up

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.560 
see it doesn't take long to set this up
and<00:05:43.780> with<00:05:44.780> this<00:05:45.020> particular<00:05:46.300> type<00:05:47.300> that<00:05:47.539> I

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
and with this particular type that I

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.700 
and with this particular type that I
have<00:05:47.840> the<00:05:48.380> search<00:05:48.620> is<00:05:48.890> over<00:05:48.919> text<00:05:50.440> it<00:05:51.440> does<00:05:51.680> a

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
have the search is over text it does a

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.860 
have the search is over text it does a
good<00:05:51.950> job<00:05:52.010> of<00:05:52.430> catching<00:05:52.700> the<00:05:53.180> highlights<00:05:53.600> and

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
good job of catching the highlights and

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.890 
good job of catching the highlights and
some<00:05:54.050> really<00:05:54.260> nice<00:05:54.729> places<00:05:55.729> and<00:05:56.060> it<00:05:56.479> really

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
some really nice places and it really

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.409 
some really nice places and it really
creates<00:05:57.289> some<00:05:57.500> good<00:05:57.770> form<00:05:58.310> and<00:05:58.520> shape<00:05:58.940> and

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
creates some good form and shape and

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.700 
creates some good form and shape and
just<00:06:00.380> in<00:06:00.500> general<00:06:00.680> I<00:06:00.979> think<00:06:01.250> this<00:06:02.440> works<00:06:03.440> is<00:06:03.620> a

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
just in general I think this works is a

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.170 
just in general I think this works is a
very<00:06:03.919> good

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
very good

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.460 
very good
balanced<00:06:06.080> composition<00:06:06.380> because<00:06:07.070> you<00:06:07.250> have

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
balanced composition because you have

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.400 
balanced composition because you have
some<00:06:09.470> dark<00:06:09.970> on<00:06:10.970> this<00:06:11.150> side<00:06:11.420> and<00:06:11.600> then<00:06:11.780> it's

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
some dark on this side and then it's

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.140 
some dark on this side and then it's
lighter<00:06:12.710> on<00:06:13.040> the<00:06:13.190> left<00:06:13.400> side<00:06:13.670> and<00:06:13.910> the<00:06:14.000> thing

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
lighter on the left side and the thing

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.060 
lighter on the left side and the thing
that<00:06:14.180> just<00:06:14.450> balances<00:06:14.960> out<00:06:15.140> and<00:06:15.440> then<00:06:15.770> we<00:06:15.890> have

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
that just balances out and then we have

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.810 
that just balances out and then we have
the<00:06:16.190> logo<00:06:16.400> in<00:06:16.790> the<00:06:17.660> middle<00:06:18.280> so<00:06:19.280> anyway<00:06:19.580> I<00:06:19.610> hope

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
the logo in the middle so anyway I hope

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.120 
the logo in the middle so anyway I hope
you<00:06:19.880> found<00:06:20.120> this<00:06:20.540> tutorial<00:06:20.720> helpful<00:06:21.110> and<00:06:21.740> I
