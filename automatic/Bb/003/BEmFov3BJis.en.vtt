but<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.259> kind<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.530> makes<00:01:46.680> sense<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.220> they

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
but it kind of makes sense that they

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.980 
but it kind of makes sense that they
don't<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.970> know<00:01:48.060> you're<00:01:48.390> not<00:01:48.540> going<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.810> end

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
don't you know you're not going to end

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.499 
don't you know you're not going to end
up<00:01:49.170> making<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.860> million<00:01:50.250> each<00:01:50.460> or<00:01:50.850> multiple

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
up making a million each or multiple

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.630 
up making a million each or multiple
millions<00:01:51.659> each<00:01:52.079> because<00:01:52.470> then<00:01:53.130> you've<00:01:53.340> kind

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
millions each because then you've kind

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.090 
millions each because then you've kind
of<00:01:53.759> completed<00:01:54.390> GTA<00:01:54.960> online<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.710> can<00:01:55.890> buy

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
of completed GTA online and you can buy

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.410 
of completed GTA online and you can buy
anything<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.490> want<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.119> kind<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.299> makes

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
anything you want so it kind of makes

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.910 
anything you want so it kind of makes
sense<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.810> gotta<00:01:57.990> work<00:01:58.200> for<00:01:58.229> stuff<00:01:58.619> but

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
sense you gotta work for stuff but

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.310 
sense you gotta work for stuff but
that's<00:01:59.040> pretty<00:01:59.280> cool<00:01:59.570> so<00:02:00.570> overall<00:02:00.960> I'm

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
that's pretty cool so overall I'm

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.200 
that's pretty cool so overall I'm
actually<00:02:01.500> really<00:02:01.950> excited<00:02:02.100> voice<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:03.000> think

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
actually really excited voice I think

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.060 
actually really excited voice I think
it's<00:02:03.329> going<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.509> be<00:02:03.570> absolutely<00:02:03.950> fantastic<00:02:04.950> I

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
it's going to be absolutely fantastic I

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.160 
it's going to be absolutely fantastic I
think<00:02:05.100> playing<00:02:05.670> with<00:02:05.909> NPCs<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.540> playing<00:02:06.960> with

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
think playing with NPCs and playing with

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.460 
think playing with NPCs and playing with
people<00:02:07.560> will<00:02:08.429> be<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.610> really<00:02:09.149> will<00:02:09.959> be<00:02:10.110> there'll

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
people will be a really will be there'll

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.380 
people will be a really will be there'll
be<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.590> huge<00:02:10.920> difference<00:02:11.250> between<00:02:11.849> playing<00:02:12.060> it

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
be a huge difference between playing it

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.970 
be a huge difference between playing it
in<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.569> camp

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
in the camp

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.130 
in the camp
like<00:02:13.310> this<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.909> playing<00:02:14.360> with<00:02:14.659> people

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
like this and playing with people

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.750 
like this and playing with people
because<00:02:15.290> people<00:02:15.709> are<00:02:15.830> unpredictable<00:02:16.310> I'm

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
because people are unpredictable I'm

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.399 
because people are unpredictable I'm
sure<00:02:17.330> there's<00:02:17.569> going<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.810> be<00:02:17.840> plenty<00:02:18.110> of

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
sure there's going to be plenty of

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.470 
sure there's going to be plenty of
entertainment<00:02:18.700> playing<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.879> game<00:02:19.909> and<00:02:20.090> also

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
entertainment playing the game and also

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.149 
entertainment playing the game and also
watching<00:02:21.080> me<00:02:21.230> play<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.650> game<00:02:21.830> so<00:02:22.040> I'm

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
watching me play the game so I'm

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.680 
watching me play the game so I'm
definitely<00:02:22.430> going<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.879> be<00:02:22.970> uploading<00:02:23.360> videos

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
definitely going to be uploading videos

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.170 
definitely going to be uploading videos
when<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:23.989> high<00:02:24.110> scum<00:02:24.620> available<00:02:25.310> in<00:02:25.670> terms<00:02:26.060> of

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
when the high scum available in terms of

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.670 
when the high scum available in terms of
when<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:26.420> think<00:02:26.720> it's<00:02:26.840> going<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:27.019> be<00:02:27.080> available

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
when I think it's going to be available

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.680 
when I think it's going to be available
I<00:02:27.860> think<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.370> must<00:02:28.610> be<00:02:28.849> this<00:02:29.239> month<00:02:29.510> or<00:02:29.660> next

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
I think it must be this month or next

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.509 
I think it must be this month or next
month<00:02:30.080> like<00:02:30.319> really<00:02:30.830> really<00:02:30.950> hoping<00:02:31.340> it's

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
month like really really hoping it's

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.670 
month like really really hoping it's
this<00:02:31.700> month<00:02:31.970> because<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.840> we've<00:02:33.110> been<00:02:33.349> waiting

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
this month because it we've been waiting

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.619 
this month because it we've been waiting
a<00:02:33.769> long<00:02:33.799> time<00:02:33.980> for<00:02:34.190> hice<00:02:34.549> to<00:02:34.910> be<00:02:35.030> honest<00:02:35.390> so

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
a long time for hice to be honest so

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.420 
a long time for hice to be honest so
yeah<00:02:36.319> I<00:02:36.349> mean<00:02:36.470> some<00:02:36.799> people<00:02:37.040> have<00:02:37.129> been<00:02:37.160> saying

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
yeah I mean some people have been saying

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.190 
yeah I mean some people have been saying
things<00:02:37.700> like<00:02:37.790> they're<00:02:38.360> worried<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:38.810> it's

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
things like they're worried that it's

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.080 
things like they're worried that it's
going<00:02:39.379> to<00:02:39.470> be<00:02:39.560> restricted<00:02:40.129> to<00:02:40.160> next-gen<00:02:40.730> only

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
going to be restricted to next-gen only

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.479 
going to be restricted to next-gen only
I<00:02:41.269> doubt<00:02:41.629> that<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.409> think<00:02:42.950> there<00:02:43.099> will<00:02:43.250> be<00:02:43.310> some

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
I doubt that I think there will be some

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.520 
I doubt that I think there will be some
improvements<00:02:44.420> when<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:44.750> next<00:02:44.959> generation

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
improvements when the next generation

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.890 
improvements when the next generation
comes<00:02:45.799> out<00:02:46.010> in<00:02:46.190> terms<00:02:46.610> of<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:47.269> size<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.810> the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
comes out in terms of the size of the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.440 
comes out in terms of the size of the
heists<00:02:48.349> or<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.860> amount<00:02:49.069> of<00:02:49.160> NPCs<00:02:49.760> on<00:02:50.000> the

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
heists or the amount of NPCs on the

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.300 
heists or the amount of NPCs on the
screen<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.079> all<00:02:51.530> of<00:02:51.709> those<00:02:51.829> sort<00:02:52.099> of<00:02:52.129> things

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
screen and all of those sort of things

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.860 
screen and all of those sort of things
but<00:02:52.519> I<00:02:52.579> don't<00:02:52.910> think<00:02:53.150> they'll<00:02:53.390> restrict

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
but I don't think they'll restrict

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.920 
but I don't think they'll restrict
features<00:02:54.769> to<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.280> specific<00:02:55.660> platform<00:02:56.660> or

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
features to a specific platform or

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.500 
features to a specific platform or
generation<00:02:57.829> of<00:02:57.920> consoles<00:02:58.310> so<00:02:58.609> yeah<00:02:59.090> there's

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
generation of consoles so yeah there's

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.030 
generation of consoles so yeah there's
my<00:02:59.690> two<00:02:59.780> cents<00:03:00.170> there's<00:03:00.440> some<00:03:00.709> leaked

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
my two cents there's some leaked

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.920 
my two cents there's some leaked
information<00:03:01.400> that<00:03:01.790> came<00:03:01.940> out<00:03:02.150> yesterday<00:03:02.180> or
