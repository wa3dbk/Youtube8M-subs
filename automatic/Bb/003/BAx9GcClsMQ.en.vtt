00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.900
 I told myself, but that's how it is 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.360
 and I'm going to add a pinch of salt as 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:37.120
 we always know why 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.120

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.379
 eggs already ready very very cold in this 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.379
 I will ask for cold eggs 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.899
 because because we need it where 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:54.269
 it was a subject we need you to be because 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.269
 I do not know why but I need good cold 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.589
 for the temperature so that it breaks for 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.610
 I break this summer to stay 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.520
 for want was invented for what you want 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.900
 not clear that of course it is not 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.380
 saying that so that it does not cook 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.380
 not right now 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:19.100
 because it will be so that it is not I go but 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.350
 I do not think he has his reason and the truth is not 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.149
 invent I imagined why but not 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.520
 but it was not really a 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:28.940
 explanation that I do not but I do not prefer 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.880
 and soon find out this or if they 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.189
 It seems 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.979
 because he wanted or because he did not have 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.350
 refrigerated and I took it out because we wanted 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.110
 the cold babies 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.380
 ok I'm in the band that dissolves 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:48.329
 little bit of sugar crystals 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.329

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.560
 it's good 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.450

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.019

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.670
 fighting with the staff or arguing 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.170
