00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:12.290
 so and again it goes on 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:14.690
 my video for slapshot 12 32 and yes 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.450
 I have in the main video or in the video 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.000
 before a few innovations forgotten or 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.830
 There were a few new things added 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 and I would only do that to you now 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.380
 demonstrate 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.089
 on the one hand the zombies the infected one 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.380
 Villagers can be cured again 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:35.390
 are in fact struggling with an off nest 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.010
 drank on weakness you just throw it 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.860
 on the zombie on it then pushes the 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.940
 here such gray bubbles and then give 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.770
 Just give her a golden one 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.140
 apple then you should still red so 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.149
 babbels and then you wait 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.100
 just that takes a while I hope 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.899
 that is until the end of the video 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.920
 calmed down and then normal again 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.210
 Villagers is it takes a while so 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.039
 long time I'll put you the rest 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.870
 innovations before this unknown block 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.940
 Einstein does not seem ready yet 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.320
 it was finished you only knew 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.510
 not how it works now you know 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.030
 that too and you just have to go here 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.830
 build such pyramids underneath and then 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.119
 comes up here so a ray out and 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.790
 you can new with this blog 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.619
 skills acquired as her the block 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.020
 he orders your blocks here as you do 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.180
 No matter you could either gold iron 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.840
 Diamond or emerald blocks for it 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.850
 use 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.479
 only the pyramids are important 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.790
 that means not only those are massive 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.619
 walls outside here so must from this 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.900
 material but also inside 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.540
 Everything must be solid in this metal 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.189
 blocks exist what the course 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.979
 this pyramid makes quite valuable 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.540
 yes what can you do with it if that 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.340
 part here only one high you can 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.329
 for once your running speed 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.079
 Increase and your deceleration rate 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:53.090
 you can also add yours here 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:55.340
 increase resistance and shampoos 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.780
 activate that means you do not just jump 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.490
 a block high but one and a half 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.710
 blocks high moment I go fast 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.659
 again day 20 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.050
 Here you can then additionally her 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.210
 Increase Attack Strength and yours 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.950
 Regeneration in normal mode that is 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.510
 yours will generate your life again 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.340
 Of course it's pretty cool 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.350
 yes how do you activate such a 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.450
 enchantment you just go to here 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.700
 the blog is here any of the 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.520
 so you emerald the man 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.980
 gold or iron sets a world here 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.230
 here the desired ability from me 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.870
 first my speed clicks 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.150
 here on then and then we come it 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.040
 you babbels around you and you are running 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.350
 faster and it will be here too 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.880
 speed is still displayed for five seconds 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.680
 is then raised again and again as it is 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.270
 infinitely long and you can already see me 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.200
 run much faster here I run 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.970
 here completely normal 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.500
 and if I sprint then it already is 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.910
 very quickly yes so many times this and here 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.730
 can you then just as I said yet 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.720
 add more skills to book more 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.520
 or less for example now shampoos 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.600
 I'll do it fast now 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.280
 now I can jump up here with 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.540
 can be used here as for example a 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.790
 jump over the fence 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.800
 yes okay so far as to fire this signal 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.330
 and, of course, they serve you as well 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.490
 be far away from your house pretty much 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.170
 good as an orientation because you have this 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.910
 Parts here really looks extremely far 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.260
 the commando blog you get by 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.550
 her poison name and then 137 enters thank you 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.040
 to the user I pointed out 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.120
 have it working that way and in 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.620
 then you can either 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.190
 enter any command to 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.770
 example part since 1400 that is 14,000 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.200
 that is, it will be the night that was 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:47.700
 now once and it's already at night 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.930
 if you can give 0 1 here then you can 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.470
 Of course, I'll come back with it, too 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.980
 do 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.720
 and yes you can of course others 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.150
 So right redstone signal once 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.320
 new again then day is you can then 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.090
 of course other things with it 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.130
 make items for example 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.840
 give experience and the game mode 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.610
 So change that pretty cool update 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.880
 pretty much intended for adventure maps 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.470
 cool zoo brings the zombie 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.400
 here is still not finished with 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.400
 his convalescence 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.390
 is it a bit stupid we can 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.100
 wait a bit now but now 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.870
 exactly and now he has recovered 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.220
 and is a normal again 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.470
 Villagers very nice that you can 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.580
 have yet seen 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.800
 yes I believe that I have then all 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.750
 Innovations finally finished except 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.310
 Zombie Babies There is now zombie too 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.060
 babys hesse now in the background 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.500
 in screenshot and there are new commands 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.180
 you can now also the the 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.960
 difficulty paul command 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.690
 to adjust 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.960
 this works like this i can 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.380
 Now here's a quick look at where you are 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.970
 here 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:54.480
 the fi culti and then just normal heart 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.460
 or something else 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.080
 new command is the spawn point there 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.370
 can you now the coordinates of 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:06.540
 spawn point so enter sport and then 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:09.420
 is born friend and then comes first 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.280
 iks worth torque from the iks worth of 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.380
 the y value and the fair value of the 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.690
 coordinates of spawn points brings as 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:20.520
 for example, 1230 something and then 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:26.880
 can you still adjust weather so 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:30.570
 the rain or lightning so very normal 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:34.050
 nice weather rain or thunderstorm so 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.760
 sander then and then I demonstrate 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.220
 you too and now it should be 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.520
 Koran himself thunders after 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:44.070
 condemned because the course has different 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.320
 then zack zack 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.140
 changing train and sander and that's it 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.780
 Rain and lightning and so on 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.620
 so the innovations work 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.780
 I hope now I really have 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.760
 finally everything said i hope it has 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.940
 you like the video again and up 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.940
 then
