little<00:04:10.840> bit<00:04:11.139> and<00:04:11.290> make<00:04:11.440> sure<00:04:11.620> that<00:04:11.769> this<00:04:11.980> ace

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
little bit and make sure that this ace

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.059 
little bit and make sure that this ace
ends<00:04:12.459> up<00:04:12.549> on<00:04:12.669> top<00:04:12.940> then<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:14.019> can<00:04:14.230> mention<00:04:14.920> that

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
ends up on top then you can mention that

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.710 
ends up on top then you can mention that
the<00:04:15.340> rest<00:04:15.730> of<00:04:15.879> the<00:04:15.970> deck<00:04:16.150> they<00:04:16.479> could<00:04:16.630> have

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
moving a little bit make sure that's

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.410

slide all three of these off on top of
the<00:05:09.490> deck<00:05:09.700> and<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.870> same<00:05:11.140> motion<00:05:11.970> separate

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
the deck and the same motion separate

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.070 
the deck and the same motion separate
your<00:05:13.900> four<00:05:14.170> aces<00:05:15.420> okay<00:05:16.420> so<00:05:16.480> that's<00:05:16.750> all<00:05:16.900> you're

doing
when<00:05:19.000> done<00:05:19.210> a<00:05:19.450> little<00:05:19.810> faster<00:05:21.420> can<00:05:22.420> look

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
when done a little faster can look

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.810 
when done a little faster can look
something<00:05:23.020> like<00:05:23.050> that

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.730 

okay<00:05:27.820> so<00:05:29.640> sliding<00:05:30.640> off<00:05:31.000> the<00:05:31.750> three<00:05:32.140> cards<00:05:32.560> onto

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
okay so sliding off the three cards onto

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.250 
okay so sliding off the three cards onto
the<00:05:32.920> top<00:05:33.130> of<00:05:33.280> the<00:05:33.340> tech<00:05:33.550> and<00:05:35.370> showing<00:05:36.370> bases

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
the top of the tech and showing bases

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.540 
the top of the tech and showing bases
just<00:05:38.260> try<00:05:38.440> to<00:05:38.500> keep<00:05:38.740> the<00:05:38.860> deck<00:05:39.040> as<00:05:39.190> square<00:05:39.460> as

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
just try to keep the deck as square as

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.230 
just try to keep the deck as square as
you<00:05:39.610> can<00:05:40.920> if<00:05:41.920> you<00:05:42.070> need<00:05:42.220> to<00:05:42.460> you<00:05:42.640> can<00:05:42.820> turn<00:05:43.060> the

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
you can if you need to you can turn the

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.940 
you can if you need to you can turn the
deck<00:05:43.450> a<00:05:43.480> little<00:05:43.780> more<00:05:44.050> face<00:05:44.320> down<00:05:46.680> like<00:05:47.680> that

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
deck a little more face down like that

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.040 
deck a little more face down like that
and<00:05:48.220> then<00:05:48.640> square<00:05:49.270> it<00:05:49.330> up<00:05:49.390> before<00:05:49.690> you<00:05:49.750> turn<00:05:49.930> it

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
and then square it up before you turn it

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.850 
and then square it up before you turn it
over<00:05:50.190> so<00:05:51.190> just<00:05:51.370> experiment<00:05:51.730> with<00:05:51.970> that<00:05:52.350> if<00:05:53.350> you

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
over so just experiment with that if you

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.610 
over so just experiment with that if you
want<00:05:54.100> to<00:05:54.160> you<00:05:54.400> can<00:05:54.580> just<00:05:54.730> start<00:05:54.940> with<00:05:55.330> the<00:05:56.290> aces

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
want to you can just start with the aces

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.100 
want to you can just start with the aces
on<00:05:56.800> top<00:05:57.190> of<00:05:57.370> the<00:05:57.460> deck<00:05:57.640> you<00:05:58.420> have<00:05:58.600> time<00:05:58.780> to<00:05:58.930> set

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
on top of the deck you have time to set

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.430 
on top of the deck you have time to set
up<00:05:59.140> and<00:05:59.700> then<00:06:00.700> just<00:06:01.030> have<00:06:01.390> somebody<00:06:01.900> pick<00:06:02.380> a

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
up and then just have somebody pick a

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.070 
up and then just have somebody pick a
card<00:06:02.800> and<00:06:03.040> you<00:06:03.730> could<00:06:03.910> do<00:06:04.030> like<00:06:04.270> having<00:06:04.960> to

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
card and you could do like having to

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.440 
card and you could do like having to
pick<00:06:05.200> three<00:06:05.560> regular<00:06:05.980> cards<00:06:06.340> and<00:06:06.580> then<00:06:07.270> do

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
pick three regular cards and then do

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.300 
pick three regular cards and then do
like<00:06:07.630> a<00:06:07.660> slip<00:06:08.050> force<00:06:08.440> or<00:06:08.710> something<00:06:09.070> like<00:06:09.250> that

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
like a slip force or something like that

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.590 
like a slip force or something like that
have<00:06:09.880> them<00:06:10.120> pick<00:06:10.300> an<00:06:10.420> ace<00:06:11.160> and<00:06:12.330> be<00:06:13.330> creative

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
have them pick an ace and be creative
