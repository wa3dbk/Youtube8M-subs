 the 01net techno chain here for the medpi 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.700
 we stop on the samsung stand 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.320
 with an interesting novelty a 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.780
 strong interaction between your 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.880
 smartphone and your samsung pc and that 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.330
 is called side sync and demonstrations 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.330
 right now 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.730
 what's the point and in fact it's a 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.020
 I'm going to plug my phone into my 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.939
 computer i will have an application 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.610
 who will launch and who will give a 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.949
 interactivity between my phone and my 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.530
 pc I will be able to exchange the 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.489
 information between my computer and my 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.870
 phone simply 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.449
 that is to say that concretely I will 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.260
 have the display of my smartphone on 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.089
 the screen of my pc 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.800
 yes exactly and I will be able 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.140
 navigate with the mouse go on my 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.850
 phone and sent information 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.530
 on the phone takes hold of the 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.839
 phone is sent have simply 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.850
 clicking on a file send it 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.019
 on my pc is so and so on 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.830
 and we will transfer the information 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.750
 quite simply 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.030
 then we can send a text message from 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.549
 his pc and we will be able to use 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.689
 so the keyboard and be able to type 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.790
 directly on the phone 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.490
 we will also be able to do everything 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.700
 simply integrated insert a photo 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.159
 in his text by dragging a picture of them 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.939
 on the on the sms simply the 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.369
 other things we can find 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.650
 otherwise it is for example a backup 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.729
 automatic data necessarily the 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.460
 charge of the phone that will be done 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.610
 since we are going to be in usb connection and 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.320
 after we will be able to grow 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.720
 the screen what are we going to see the display of 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.670
 the phone on the on the notebook 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.380
 we will be able to enlarge and if we 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.580
 wants to sail or even play everything 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.650
 simply on his phone we can 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.360
 do it on the screen of the notebook 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.250
 I will be able to launch a game since my 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.380
 pc on the smartphone screen and play it 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.370
 since the pc is exactly that and so 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.080
 also use all the others 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.810
 applications 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.640
 Whether sms whether it pictures 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.260
 either video that it is I see there 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.610
 really nice this innovation signed 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.560
 samsung and for all who are 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.210
 bulimic sms and who are tired of the 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.890
 small touch screen is there you 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.380
 you can type your thousands of text messages 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.580
 since the keyboard of the pc is 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.769
 not bad yeah so that said attention 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.569
 it does not work with all 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.190
 market products only pc 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.480
 samsung is only certain 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.459
 smartphones yes then all 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.400
 android smartphones that have to 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.060
 less version 4.1 that is samsung or 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.470
 no, by the way 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.629
 and then the little novelty is that 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.769
 soon it will work even in wifi since 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.269
 there for now it does not work 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.540
 with a cable number a proud roof 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.769
 as well 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.599
 but for now no version 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.159
 windows phone no version ios no 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.390
 the more he did not have a version he told me 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.310
 no doubt this is the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.340
 here is the techno channel 01net has everything from 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.340
