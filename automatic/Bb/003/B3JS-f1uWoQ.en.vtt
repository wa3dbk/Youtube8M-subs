would<00:01:34.979> still<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.790> most<00:01:36.090> basic

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
would still have it be the most basic

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.600 
would still have it be the most basic
entry<00:01:36.780> level<00:01:37.290> model<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.770> still<00:01:37.860> be<00:01:38.430> able<00:01:38.520> to

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
entry level model and still be able to

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.399 
entry level model and still be able to

any<00:01:43.799> camera<00:01:43.939> Ralpha<00:01:44.939> bat<00:01:45.119> see<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.720> little

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
any camera Ralpha bat see the little

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.230 
any camera Ralpha bat see the little
thing<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.500> says<00:01:46.710> shutter<00:01:47.579> speed<00:01:47.939> if<00:01:48.149> you

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
thing that says shutter speed if you

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.910 
thing that says shutter speed if you
raise<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.780> number<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.409> make<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.770> longer

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
raise that number to make it longer

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.160 
raise that number to make it longer
whenever<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.880> take<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.149> picture<00:01:51.270> now<00:01:51.630> your

whenever you take a picture now your

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.440 
whenever you take a picture now your
camera<00:01:52.229> will<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:53.159> several<00:01:53.579> seconds

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
camera will be on for several seconds

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.230 
camera will be on for several seconds
taking<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.380> picture<00:01:55.439> for<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.250> amount<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:57.030> time

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
taking a picture for that amount of time

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.940

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
now this is really cool because what you

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.950 
now this is really cool because what you
can<00:01:58.979> do<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.430> take<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.670> light<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.329> then<00:02:00.659> move<00:02:00.869> it

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
can do is take a light and then move it

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.450 
can do is take a light and then move it
around<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.320> frame<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.219> actually

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
around the frame and you can actually

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.550 
around the frame and you can actually
record<00:02:02.759> light<00:02:03.600> trails<00:02:03.899> with<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.320> people

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
