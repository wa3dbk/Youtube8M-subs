00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
very often you find any collector basis

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.490 
very often you find any collector basis
it's<00:00:40.739> really<00:00:41.309> rare<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:42.210> some<00:00:42.629> people<00:00:42.899> do<00:00:43.110> and

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
it's really rare but some people do and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.590 
it's really rare but some people do and
you<00:00:44.100> know<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.430> there<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> chance<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.360> get<00:00:45.480> it

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
you know so there is a chance to get it

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.690 
you know so there is a chance to get it
up<00:00:45.719> here<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:46.620> i<00:00:46.739> said<00:00:46.770> it's<00:00:47.160> super<00:00:47.520> rare

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
up here but like i said it's super rare

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.430 
up here but like i said it's super rare
so<00:00:48.030> definitely<00:00:48.629> farming<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> lower

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
so definitely farming in the lower

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.830 
so definitely farming in the lower
leagues<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:50.039> advisable<00:00:50.910> especially<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.780> you

quite<00:01:23.670> an<00:01:23.850> unusual<00:01:23.939> find<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.960> mean<00:01:25.140> there's

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
quite an unusual find and I mean there's

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.690 
quite an unusual find and I mean there's
a<00:01:25.409> lot<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.590> people<00:01:25.770> attacking<00:01:26.189> around<00:01:26.610> this

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
a lot of people attacking around this

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.310 
a lot of people attacking around this
range<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.330> there's<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.810> lot<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:27.960> people<00:01:28.140> that

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
range so there's a lot of people that

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.660 
range so there's a lot of people that
could<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.590> got<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:28.920> base<00:01:29.130> before<00:01:29.340> him

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
could have got to this base before him

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.969 
could have got to this base before him
but<00:01:30.150> somehow<00:01:30.509> he<00:01:30.720> was<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.890> he's

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
but somehow he was the one so he's

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.499 
but somehow he was the one so he's
coming<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.310> here<00:01:32.460> with<00:01:32.549> balloons<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.090> minions

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
coming in here with balloons and minions

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.300 
coming in here with balloons and minions
and<00:01:33.720> as<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.229> guys<00:01:34.350> know<00:01:34.380> that's<00:01:34.979> always<00:01:35.280> a

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
and as you guys know that's always a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.190 
and as you guys know that's always a
good<00:01:35.700> combination<00:01:36.210> especially<00:01:36.630> when<00:01:37.079> you're

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
good combination especially when you're

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.960 
good combination especially when you're
working<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.560> base<00:01:37.770> that's<00:01:38.009> been<00:01:38.220> not

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
working on a base that's been not

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.310 
working on a base that's been not
playing<00:01:39.270> for<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> while<00:01:39.570> they<00:01:40.140> haven't

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
playing for a while they haven't

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.289 
playing for a while they haven't
replenished<00:01:40.950> any<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.430> their<00:01:41.579> infernos<00:01:42.090> or

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
replenished any of their infernos or

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.940 
replenished any of their infernos or
expose<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:42.990> he<00:01:43.170> was<00:01:43.259> pretty<00:01:43.500> lucky<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:43.860> that

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
expose so he was pretty lucky in that

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.580 
expose so he was pretty lucky in that
sense<00:01:44.100> again<00:01:45.000> here's<00:01:45.509> another<00:01:45.840> base<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.409> guys

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
sense again here's another base you guys

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.410 
sense again here's another base you guys
will<00:01:46.770> notice<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.340> lot<00:01:47.700> if<00:01:47.850> you're<00:01:48.000> pushing

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
will notice this a lot if you're pushing

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.630 
will notice this a lot if you're pushing
or<00:01:49.140> even<00:01:49.380> just<00:01:49.409> watching<00:01:49.829> these<00:01:49.979> videos<00:01:50.070> you

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
or even just watching these videos you

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.609 
or even just watching these videos you
will<00:01:50.729> notice<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.210> lot<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.750> bases<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.439> done

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
will notice a lot of bases have done

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.889 
will notice a lot of bases have done
this<00:01:52.799> now<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:54.090> kind<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.390> annoying<00:01:54.600> for

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
this now and it's kind of annoying for

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.179 
this now and it's kind of annoying for
someone<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:55.259> me<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.740> really<00:01:55.920> likes

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
someone like me that really likes

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.819 
someone like me that really likes
balloon<00:01:56.520> yin<00:01:56.700> because<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.060> really<00:01:57.360> does

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
balloon yin because it really does

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.109 
balloon yin because it really does
completely<00:01:58.829> stop<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.670> just<00:01:59.700> can't

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
completely stop it like you just can't

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.719 
completely stop it like you just can't
do<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.439> rushing<00:02:02.009> expose<00:02:02.490> and

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
do it and that is rushing expose and

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.310 
do it and that is rushing expose and
inferno<00:02:03.149> towers<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.630> what<00:02:03.780> people<00:02:04.049> are<00:02:04.140> doing

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
inferno towers so what people are doing

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.920 
inferno towers so what people are doing
is<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.850> don't<00:02:05.850> know<00:02:05.939> if<00:02:06.060> they've<00:02:06.240> previously

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
is I don't know if they've previously

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.869 
is I don't know if they've previously
gone<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.619> town<00:02:07.740> all<00:02:07.920> 10<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.280> they<00:02:08.340> realized<00:02:08.759> it

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
gone to town all 10 and they realized it

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.880 
gone to town all 10 and they realized it
was<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> mistake<00:02:09.119> or<00:02:09.629> maybe<00:02:10.229> they<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:10.440> rushed

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
was a mistake or maybe they just rushed

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.680 
was a mistake or maybe they just rushed
and<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.610> was<00:02:11.760> one<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.150> things<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.510> they

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
and that was one of the things that they

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
and that was one of the things that they
thought<00:02:12.900> looked<00:02:13.200> cool

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
thought looked cool

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.670 
thought looked cool
something<00:02:14.100> like<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.460> um<00:02:15.080> but<00:02:16.080> there's<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.500> lot

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
something like that um but there's a lot

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.500 
something like that um but there's a lot
of<00:02:16.710> bases<00:02:17.160> where<00:02:17.310> they<00:02:17.400> have<00:02:17.550> max<00:02:17.790> out<00:02:18.060> expose

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
of bases where they have max out expose

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.780 
of bases where they have max out expose
maxed<00:02:18.960> out<00:02:19.080> inferno<00:02:19.440> towers<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:20.070> then<00:02:20.370> really

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
maxed out inferno towers and then really

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.940 
maxed out inferno towers and then really
low-level<00:02:20.970> walls<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.900> defenses<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.710> even

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
low-level walls and defenses and even

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.070 
low-level walls and defenses and even
and<00:02:23.190> especially<00:02:23.250> air<00:02:23.820> defenses<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.540> what

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
and especially air defenses and what

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.110 
and especially air defenses and what
this<00:02:25.200> means<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.710> that<00:02:25.770> even<00:02:26.580> without<00:02:26.670> those

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
this means is that even without those

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.290 
this means is that even without those
defenses<00:02:27.900> you're<00:02:28.350> still<00:02:28.650> able<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.370> get<00:02:29.700> and

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
defenses you're still able to get and

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.450 
defenses you're still able to get and
destroy<00:02:31.020> any<00:02:31.440> troops<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.070> come<00:02:32.250> your<00:02:32.280> way

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
destroy any troops that come your way

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.940 
destroy any troops that come your way
especially<00:02:32.850> air<00:02:33.390> troops<00:02:33.720> um<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.620> something

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
especially air troops um that something

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.410 
especially air troops um that something
about<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.190> max<00:02:35.400> expose<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:35.970> inferno<00:02:36.210> towers

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
about the max expose and inferno towers

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.780 
about the max expose and inferno towers
do<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:37.020> much<00:02:37.230> damage<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:38.220> it's<00:02:38.490> actually

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
do so much damage that it's actually

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.330 
do so much damage that it's actually
still<00:02:39.360> really<00:02:39.810> hard<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.260> attack<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.710> bases<00:02:41.130> so

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
still really hard to attack the bases so

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.010 
still really hard to attack the bases so
you<00:02:41.820> know<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.090> might<00:02:42.300> look<00:02:42.510> like<00:02:42.570> a<00:02:42.750> really

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
you know it might look like a really

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.120 
you know it might look like a really
easy<00:02:43.170> base<00:02:43.440> because<00:02:43.680> they<00:02:43.770> have<00:02:43.890> all<00:02:44.010> these

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
easy base because they have all these

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.340 
easy base because they have all these
low<00:02:44.340> air<00:02:44.490> defenses<00:02:45.000> are<00:02:45.150> low<00:02:45.360> different

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
low air defenses are low different

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.830 
low air defenses are low different
defenses<00:02:46.890> but<00:02:47.370> those<00:02:47.670> expose<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.570> inferno

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
defenses but those expose in the inferno

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.570 
defenses but those expose in the inferno
towers<00:02:49.140> they<00:02:49.470> just<00:02:49.800> burn<00:02:50.250> through<00:02:50.520> your

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
towers they just burn through your

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.700 
towers they just burn through your
troops<00:02:50.880> I<00:02:51.030> gets<00:02:51.210> crazy<00:02:51.510> guess<00:02:52.020> on<00:02:52.230> this<00:02:52.380> attack

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
troops I gets crazy guess on this attack

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.130 
troops I gets crazy guess on this attack
the<00:02:52.950> hero<00:02:53.340> instead<00:02:54.270> of<00:02:54.420> going<00:02:54.660> for<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.870> middle

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
the hero instead of going for the middle

amazing like they do so much damage uh

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.110 
amazing like they do so much damage uh
something<00:03:49.560> about<00:03:49.920> that<00:03:50.190> extra<00:03:50.670> little<00:03:50.790> bit<00:03:51.030> of

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
something about that extra little bit of

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.850 
something about that extra little bit of
damage<00:03:51.270> and<00:03:51.540> little<00:03:51.810> bit<00:03:51.900> of<00:03:51.990> health<00:03:52.170> really

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
damage and little bit of health really

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.460 
damage and little bit of health really
does<00:03:53.040> show<00:03:53.430> because<00:03:54.120> before<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:54.540> mean<00:03:54.960> it<00:03:55.230> only

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
does show because before I mean it only

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.100 
does show because before I mean it only
took<00:03:55.680> one<00:03:55.920> mortar<00:03:56.250> shell<00:03:56.490> and<00:03:56.760> now<00:03:57.120> I'm<00:03:57.450> with

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
took one mortar shell and now I'm with

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.720 
took one mortar shell and now I'm with
the<00:03:58.350> lower<00:03:58.590> level<00:03:58.890> mortars<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.400> does<00:03:59.550> actually

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
the lower level mortars it does actually

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.090 
the lower level mortars it does actually
take<00:04:00.090> two<00:04:00.330> I<00:04:00.540> think<00:04:00.990> these<00:04:01.110> max<00:04:01.440> ones<00:04:01.740> will

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
take two I think these max ones will

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.730 
take two I think these max ones will
still<00:04:02.130> kill<00:04:02.730> them<00:04:02.940> outright<00:04:03.180> but<00:04:03.810> sometimes

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
still kill them outright but sometimes

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.200 
still kill them outright but sometimes
you<00:04:04.920> get<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.070> little<00:04:05.160> lucky<00:04:05.460> Owen<00:04:05.880> it<00:04:06.000> as<00:04:06.090> you

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210
