goes to here and there different energy

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.230 
goes to here and there different energy
centers<00:02:00.409> if<00:02:01.040> that<00:02:01.220> makes<00:02:01.460> any<00:02:01.579> sense<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.150> then

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
centers if that makes any sense and then

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.429 
centers if that makes any sense and then
so<00:02:02.390> it's<00:02:02.540> like<00:02:02.630> if<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:02.869> notice<00:02:03.170> when<00:02:03.320> you

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
so it's like if you notice when you

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.260 
so it's like if you notice when you
breathe<00:02:03.680> I<00:02:03.920> know<00:02:03.979> most<00:02:04.490> of<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:04.759> here<00:02:04.909> taking

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
breathe I know most of you here taking

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.060 
breathe I know most of you here taking
the<00:02:05.329> foundation<00:02:05.840> class<00:02:06.079> and<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.680> first<00:02:06.920> thing

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
the foundation class and the first thing

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.339 
the foundation class and the first thing
is<00:02:07.220> learning<00:02:07.670> how<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:08.119> breathe<00:02:08.569> here<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.259> to

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
is learning how to breathe here and to

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.960 
is learning how to breathe here and to
breathe<00:02:09.560> low<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.789> get<00:02:11.209> the

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
breathe low and to get the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.640 
breathe low and to get the
the<00:02:13.030> focus<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.630> concentration<00:02:14.140> right

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
the focus and the concentration right

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.110 
the focus and the concentration right
right<00:02:14.860> around<00:02:15.040> your<00:02:15.220> first<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:15.760> second

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
right around your first and second

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.590 
right around your first and second
chakra<00:02:16.660> as<00:02:16.960> opposed<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.560> this<00:02:17.740> stuff<00:02:18.570> like<00:02:19.570> a

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
chakra as opposed to this stuff like a

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.170 
chakra as opposed to this stuff like a
high<00:02:19.960> like<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.500> high<00:02:20.770> chest<00:02:21.190> breathing<00:02:21.670> and

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
high like a high chest breathing and

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.850 
high like a high chest breathing and
this<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:22.510> know<00:02:22.630> so<00:02:22.810> we<00:02:22.930> start<00:02:23.290> here<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.800> then

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
this you know so we start here and then

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.710 
this you know so we start here and then
we<00:02:24.400> actually<00:02:24.790> work<00:02:24.970> our<00:02:25.150> way<00:02:25.180> up<00:02:25.300> with<00:02:25.630> the

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
we actually work our way up with the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.020 
we actually work our way up with the
chacras<00:02:26.170> but<00:02:26.380> before<00:02:26.710> that<00:02:26.920> let's<00:02:27.640> just<00:02:27.850> start

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
chacras but before that let's just start

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.570 
chacras but before that let's just start
with<00:02:28.120> this<00:02:29.040> Ian<00:02:30.040> in<00:02:30.960> young<00:02:32.040> ok<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:33.100> this<00:02:33.400> is

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
with this Ian in young ok so this is

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.700 
with this Ian in young ok so this is
called<00:02:33.760> this<00:02:34.210> will<00:02:34.360> be<00:02:34.450> Ian<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.020> young<00:02:35.200> made

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
called this will be Ian and young made

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.330 
called this will be Ian and young made
simple<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:37.680> raise<00:02:38.680> your<00:02:38.740> hand<00:02:38.980> if<00:02:39.070> you've<00:02:39.190> seen

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
simple so raise your hand if you've seen

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.100 
simple so raise your hand if you've seen
this<00:02:39.490> symbol<00:02:39.640> before<00:02:39.790> like<00:02:40.300> before<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.930> class

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
this symbol before like before the class

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.860 
this symbol before like before the class
ok<00:02:41.500> so<00:02:41.920> yeah<00:02:42.550> you<00:02:42.760> have<00:02:43.120> yin<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.480> young<00:02:43.630> and

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
ok so yeah you have yin and young and

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.949 
ok so yeah you have yin and young and
actually<00:02:44.320> what<00:02:44.920> this<00:02:45.100> is<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.700> see<00:02:45.880> when<00:02:46.840> it

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
actually what this is you see when it

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.470 
actually what this is you see when it
ties<00:02:47.170> into<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.530> chakras<00:02:48.010> is<00:02:48.190> that<00:02:48.480> anything

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
ties into the chakras is that anything

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.699 
ties into the chakras is that anything
that<00:02:49.510> you<00:02:49.810> write<00:02:50.080> is<00:02:50.320> going<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.560> be

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
that you write is going to be

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.530 
that you write is going to be
two-dimensional<00:02:51.600> so<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.990> yin<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.410> yang<00:02:53.620> is<00:02:53.980> a

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
two-dimensional so the yin and yang is a

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.000 
two-dimensional so the yin and yang is a
two-dimensional<00:02:55.860> representation<00:02:56.860> of

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
two-dimensional representation of

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.710 
two-dimensional representation of
something<00:02:57.220> that's<00:02:57.490> actually

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
something that's actually

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.120 
something that's actually
three-dimensional<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:59.560> when<00:02:59.740> you<00:02:59.830> picture

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
three-dimensional so when you picture

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.470 
three-dimensional so when you picture
this<00:03:00.610> picture<00:03:00.970> a<00:03:01.510> ball<00:03:01.840> or<00:03:02.200> an<00:03:02.709> orb<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.480> that

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
this picture a ball or an orb and that

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.010 
this picture a ball or an orb and that
orb<00:03:04.780> spins<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:06.100> mean<00:03:06.820> we<00:03:06.970> have<00:03:07.209> you<00:03:08.110> do<00:03:08.260> this<00:03:10.020> you

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
orb spins I mean we have you do this you

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.900 
orb spins I mean we have you do this you
know<00:03:11.110> that's<00:03:11.380> like<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:11.730> traditional<00:03:12.730> way<00:03:12.880> of

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
know that's like a traditional way of

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.490 
know that's like a traditional way of
writing<00:03:13.420> in<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:13.810> young<00:03:13.959> but<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.320> got<00:03:14.470> to

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
writing in and young but you got to

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.979 
writing in and young but you got to
think<00:03:14.740> of<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:15.010> in<00:03:15.190> terms<00:03:15.250> of<00:03:15.880> a<00:03:16.000> ball<00:03:16.240> and<00:03:16.810> what

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
think of it in terms of a ball and what

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.190 
think of it in terms of a ball and what
that<00:03:17.140> does<00:03:17.380> is<00:03:17.739> it<00:03:17.830> throws<00:03:18.310> off<00:03:18.489> a<00:03:18.550> proton<00:03:19.200> into

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
that does is it throws off a proton into

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.310 
that does is it throws off a proton into
Neutron<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:20.830> it<00:03:21.610> spins<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.510> it's<00:03:22.630> like<00:03:22.810> some

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
Neutron and it spins and it's like some

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.270 
Neutron and it spins and it's like some
of<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.470> most<00:03:23.650> stop<00:03:23.890> let's<00:03:24.610> say<00:03:24.790> fundamental

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
of the most stop let's say fundamental

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.310 
of the most stop let's say fundamental
building<00:03:27.280> blocks<00:03:27.730> of<00:03:28.000> form<00:03:28.390> another<00:03:28.870> way<00:03:29.140> of

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
building blocks of form another way of

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.740 
building blocks of form another way of
looking<00:03:29.620> at<00:03:30.040> this<00:03:30.280> is<00:03:30.519> you<00:03:31.180> have<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.390> positive

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
looking at this is you have a positive

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.300 
looking at this is you have a positive
and<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:33.010> negative<00:03:33.040> charge<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.600> what<00:03:35.320> young<00:03:36.100> is

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
and a negative charge and what young is

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.110 
and a negative charge and what young is
because<00:03:36.640> if<00:03:36.790> you<00:03:37.080> break<00:03:38.080> down<00:03:38.380> like<00:03:38.980> form<00:03:39.820> or

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
because if you break down like form or

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.960 
because if you break down like form or
matter<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:40.989> and<00:03:41.140> I<00:03:41.370> everything<00:03:42.370> this<00:03:42.549> this

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
matter you and I everything this this

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.539 
matter you and I everything this this
pen<00:03:43.239> this<00:03:43.510> mat<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.049> everything<00:03:44.500> is<00:03:44.920> you<00:03:45.340> will

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
pen this mat and everything is you will

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.820 
pen this mat and everything is you will
break<00:03:46.180> it<00:03:46.330> down<00:03:46.450> to<00:03:46.750> like<00:03:46.870> its<00:03:47.110> fundamental

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
break it down to like its fundamental

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.370 
break it down to like its fundamental
level<00:03:48.580> is<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:48.880> get<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.030> positive<00:03:49.780> charge<00:03:50.049> and

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
level is you get a positive charge and

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.009 
level is you get a positive charge and
you<00:03:50.769> get<00:03:50.920> a<00:03:50.950> negative<00:03:51.519> charge<00:03:51.820> if<00:03:52.810> you<00:03:52.840> get

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
you get a negative charge if you get

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.570 
you get a negative charge if you get
into<00:03:53.140> quantum<00:03:53.560> physics<00:03:53.860> you<00:03:53.980> get<00:03:54.100> into<00:03:54.280> cork

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
into quantum physics you get into cork

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.560 
into quantum physics you get into cork
so<00:03:54.730> you<00:03:54.790> probably<00:03:55.000> won't<00:03:55.180> get<00:03:55.330> into<00:03:55.480> that

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
so you probably won't get into that

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.050 
so you probably won't get into that
today<00:03:55.840> but<00:03:56.410> very<00:03:56.830> simply<00:03:57.280> is<00:03:57.400> you<00:03:57.580> you<00:03:57.850> have

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
today but very simply is you you have

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.509 
today but very simply is you you have
this<00:03:58.330> and<00:03:58.600> so<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.320> yin-yang<00:03:59.860> symbol<00:03:59.890> is

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
this and so the yin-yang symbol is

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.729 
this and so the yin-yang symbol is
symbolic<00:04:01.120> of<00:04:01.239> that<00:04:01.450> and<00:04:01.690> it's<00:04:02.049> symbolic<00:04:02.620> of

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
symbolic of that and it's symbolic of

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.800 
symbolic of that and it's symbolic of
all<00:04:02.950> form<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:03.670> then<00:04:04.090> it's<00:04:04.269> what<00:04:04.510> it<00:04:04.600> also

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
all form and then it's what it also

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.720 
all form and then it's what it also
means<00:04:05.260> is<00:04:07.170> like<00:04:08.170> opposites<00:04:08.830> night<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.580> day

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
means is like opposites night and day

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.259 
means is like opposites night and day
masculine<00:04:10.690> feminine<00:04:11.140> good<00:04:11.950> bad<00:04:12.310> you<00:04:13.150> know

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
masculine feminine good bad you know

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.479 
masculine feminine good bad you know
everything<00:04:14.200> that<00:04:14.350> has<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.739> do<00:04:14.860> with<00:04:15.010> opposites

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
everything that has to do with opposites

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.479 
everything that has to do with opposites
because<00:04:15.670> it's<00:04:15.820> kind<00:04:15.940> of<00:04:16.030> like<00:04:16.209> there<00:04:16.660> can't<00:04:16.989> be

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
because it's kind of like there can't be

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.890 
because it's kind of like there can't be
night<00:04:18.489> without<00:04:18.820> day<00:04:19.209> because<00:04:19.570> there's<00:04:19.750> no

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
night without day because there's no

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:20.699 
night without day because there's no

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
contrast

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.920 
contrast
and<00:04:20.829> then<00:04:21.459> even<00:04:21.669> yet<00:04:22.000> another<00:04:22.389> way<00:04:22.660> of<00:04:22.690> looking

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
and then even yet another way of looking

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.969 
and then even yet another way of looking
at<00:04:23.289> you<00:04:23.350> need<00:04:23.590> young<00:04:25.410> because<00:04:26.410> here's<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.680> fun

concept and there's many different
viewpoints<00:04:30.340> on<00:04:30.490> it<00:04:30.610> is<00:04:30.940> you<00:04:31.150> can<00:04:31.330> look<00:04:31.509> at<00:04:31.660> it

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
viewpoints on it is you can look at it

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:38.610 
viewpoints on it is you can look at it
as<00:04:31.960> a<00:04:32.699> classification<00:04:33.699> system<00:04:34.560> for<00:04:35.560> example

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.290 

if<00:04:39.160> I<00:04:39.340> say<00:04:39.610> like<00:04:39.940> is<00:04:40.150> a<00:04:40.210> mouse<00:04:40.600> yen<00:04:41.380> or<00:04:41.680> young

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
what's the answer what is a mouse anyone

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.909 
what's the answer what is a mouse anyone
yes<00:04:47.979> it<00:04:48.490> does<00:04:48.550> answer<00:04:49.150> is<00:04:49.500> compared<00:04:50.500> to<00:04:50.560> what

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
yes it does answer is compared to what

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.159 
yes it does answer is compared to what
it'd<00:04:51.790> be<00:04:51.820> like<00:04:51.940> saying<00:04:52.300> is<00:04:52.479> a<00:04:52.510> mouse<00:04:52.750> big<00:04:53.020> or

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
it'd be like saying is a mouse big or

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.890 
it'd be like saying is a mouse big or
small<00:04:53.669> well<00:04:54.669> compared<00:04:55.060> to<00:04:55.180> what<00:04:55.360> compared<00:04:55.810> to

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
small well compared to what compared to

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.570 
small well compared to what compared to
an<00:04:55.990> elephant<00:04:56.229> and<00:04:56.500> small<00:04:56.770> compared<00:04:57.190> to<00:04:57.280> an<00:04:57.370> ant

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
an elephant and small compared to an ant

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.909 
an elephant and small compared to an ant
is<00:04:57.790> very<00:04:58.000> big<00:04:58.270> and<00:04:58.510> so<00:04:59.020> yin<00:04:59.290> and<00:04:59.470> yang<00:04:59.620> works

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
is very big and so yin and yang works

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.700 
is very big and so yin and yang works
the<00:05:00.100> same<00:05:00.130> way<00:05:00.340> you<00:05:00.970> can't<00:05:01.300> have<00:05:01.540> in<00:05:02.050> without

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
the same way you can't have in without

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.400 
the same way you can't have in without
young<00:05:03.070> and<00:05:03.550> vice<00:05:03.820> versa<00:05:04.150> so<00:05:04.810> if<00:05:04.900> you<00:05:05.020> do<00:05:05.169> this

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
young and vice versa so if you do this

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.050 
young and vice versa so if you do this
if<00:05:05.710> you<00:05:05.830> think<00:05:06.070> of<00:05:06.190> this<00:05:06.340> as<00:05:06.400> e<00:05:06.610> in<00:05:07.139> and<00:05:08.880> this<00:05:09.880> is

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
if you think of this as e in and this is

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.740 
if you think of this as e in and this is
young<00:05:10.360> it's<00:05:10.870> kind<00:05:11.169> of<00:05:11.229> like<00:05:11.350> a<00:05:11.410> binary<00:05:12.449> way<00:05:13.449> of

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
young it's kind of like a binary way of

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.980 
young it's kind of like a binary way of
just<00:05:13.990> classifying<00:05:15.419> something<00:05:16.419> that's<00:05:16.600> here

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
just classifying something that's here

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.040 
just classifying something that's here
well<00:05:17.620> is<00:05:17.770> it<00:05:17.919> you<00:05:18.070> nor<00:05:18.280> young<00:05:18.960> compared<00:05:19.960> to

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
well is it you nor young compared to

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.650 
well is it you nor young compared to
what<00:05:20.729> compared<00:05:21.729> to<00:05:21.850> something<00:05:22.060> here<00:05:22.419> it<00:05:22.539> would

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
what compared to something here it would

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.029 
what compared to something here it would
be<00:05:22.780> in<00:05:23.880> compared<00:05:24.880> to<00:05:25.000> this<00:05:25.150> it<00:05:25.360> would<00:05:25.479> be<00:05:25.600> young

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
be in compared to this it would be young

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.740 
be in compared to this it would be young
and<00:05:27.039> so<00:05:27.250> that<00:05:27.490> would<00:05:27.669> be<00:05:27.699> that's<00:05:28.180> Ian<00:05:28.570> and

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
and so that would be that's Ian and

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.540 
and so that would be that's Ian and
young<00:05:28.900> so<00:05:29.229> know<00:05:29.440> that<00:05:29.470> yin<00:05:29.979> and<00:05:30.160> yang<00:05:30.310> is

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
young so know that yin and yang is

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.779 
young so know that yin and yang is
constantly<00:05:31.240> changing<00:05:32.020> and<00:05:32.789> constantly

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
constantly changing and constantly

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.240 
constantly changing and constantly
moving<00:05:34.120> and<00:05:34.419> so<00:05:35.020> there's<00:05:35.229> no<00:05:35.440> let's<00:05:36.100> say

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
moving and so there's no let's say

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.500 
moving and so there's no let's say
absolute<00:05:36.970> of<00:05:37.320> yin<00:05:38.320> and<00:05:38.680> Yan<00:05:38.860> and<00:05:39.250> so<00:05:39.789> what<00:05:40.360> this

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
absolute of yin and Yan and so what this

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.450 
absolute of yin and Yan and so what this
also<00:05:40.840> means<00:05:41.260> is<00:05:41.530> a<00:05:41.560> symbol<00:05:42.070> and<00:05:42.160> that's<00:05:42.310> why<00:05:42.430> we

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
also means is a symbol and that's why we

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.089 
also means is a symbol and that's why we
have<00:05:42.729> the<00:05:42.849> symbol<00:05:43.180> here<00:05:43.360> is<00:05:43.539> it<00:05:44.229> means<00:05:44.680> mind

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
have the symbol here is it means mind

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:47.100 
have the symbol here is it means mind
and<00:05:45.310> body<00:05:45.460> is<00:05:46.419> what<00:05:46.599> that<00:05:46.750> means<00:05:46.960> because

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
and body is what that means because

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.719 
and body is what that means because
sometimes<00:05:47.650> mind<00:05:47.950> and<00:05:48.130> body<00:05:48.220> work<00:05:48.580> in

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
sometimes mind and body work in

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.240 
sometimes mind and body work in
opposites<00:05:49.710> anyone<00:05:50.710> had<00:05:50.860> that<00:05:51.010> experience

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
opposites anyone had that experience
