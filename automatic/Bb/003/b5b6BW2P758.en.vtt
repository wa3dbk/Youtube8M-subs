00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.430
 what's going on people welcome 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.290
 I'll show you the game again today 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.260
 something from minecraft on their laptops 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.670
 liquid hinbekommt and indeed in the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.380
 Most of the time it is yours 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.269
 laptop just the wrong video card 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.039
 take most of the time you have a laptop 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.830
 onboard video card and one not 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.570
 is stuck on the mainboard as one 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.820
 external a not on board graphics card 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.330
 so in minecraft then takes mostly 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.670
 always the onboard graphics card 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.230
 why always but mostly because in 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.610
 minecraft is running but yes were yes 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.879
 Actually, I know it's called engine 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.980
 for a game and that takes that 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.420
 mostly the answer graphics card like this and 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.340
 This can lead to leaks from yours 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.950
 play because most of them are actually 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.710
 just for your desktop and so thought so 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.480
 now to change the whole thing ended 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.070
 first minecraft then you can if you 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.050
 for example minecraft loud and desktop 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.660
 you can right click on it 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.350
 and then here is with graphics processor 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.090
 To run 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.280
 depending on what you want for a graphics card 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.110
 you stand here for one is with me 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.780
 i have nvidia you need a media 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.250
 high-performance processor does not use flour 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.409
 integrated graphics could because that 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.180
 the onboard graphics card is so if 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.060
 but you the nvidia high performance 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.020
 processor selects then he starts that 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.840
 do not stop over this on board 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.600
 graphics card and you can minecraft 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.090
 much better play the leaks 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:34.470
 are not as violent anymore if at all 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.630
 there is nothing there and yes I show you 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.729
 the climate in which you also recognize that 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.520
 so i can find myself here now 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.439
 again on the minecraft server and that 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.899
 if you press f3 I have to do that well 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.210
 make map away what am I doing so you see 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.450
 top right what you for a java 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.680
 version and above all what 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.030
 you take with me for the graphics cards 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.259
 now stands display 1920 x 1200 notes 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.119
 nvidia corporation 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.009
 if you have something of intel 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.290
 do you know already or in yes 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.000
 mostly it's when you know you already 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.879
 that it really is the onboard 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.180
 graphics card is and that it thereby too 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.650
 the leaks come many laptops have too 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.879
 no applications 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.709
 graphics cards but only and 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.510
 graphics card of it you are the whole 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.129
 Of course, not everything 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.439
 case with the laptops as with me 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.760
 For example, the ticket is an extra 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.010
 it works on everyone 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.170
 case if you still have questions and 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.430
 something just puts in the bottom 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.040
