00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 yes i am mitsuaki starting the round of 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.140
 tutorials for halloween that already only 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.820
 there's a month left in today's section 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.000
 try in make up tutorial 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.370
 I'm going to try one of michelle phan's other 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.250
 once since you said it is the most 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.460
 you liked the two I wanted to choose what 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.750
 is a tutorial that has vampire what 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.390
 only that I have changed from this tutorial 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.660
 have been the lips since I prefer the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:35.190
 lifting like a flu doll 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:37.680
 purple lipstick and I like it more 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.500
 this blood tone that the purple really 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.230
 so that's the only thing I've changed for 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.270
 everything else is almost equal is 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.789
 pretty simple to do but os 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.410
 I recommend that I started preparing a 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:55.170
 hour before as it requires a little bit of 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:58.379
 practice like one hour one and a half ago 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.670
 and well I hope that the video you like it 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.500
 first thing I'm going to use is a prize 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.060
 so that the makeup lasts a lot 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.950
 plus 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.690
 I extend it like a cream but 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.430
 you can spread it with a brush 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.530
 if you like more 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.570
 as vampires are known for their 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.310
 perfect face I'm going to cover all my 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.140
 imperfections in a clear tone that 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.590
 match the base I'm going to use 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.590
 after 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.990
 I'm going to use a white base though 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.780
 michelle phan does not recommend it since my 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.940
 tone and the whitest bases that I have 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.550
 I just have white skin and 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.980
 not give much feeling of dead vampire 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.330
 but however it is not recommended that 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.430
 the ocs and if you have a skin tone 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.320
 dark since the only thing he would do would be 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.720
 clarify your tone to the target 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.820
 skin and you wanted it would stay a very 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.880
 rare the advisable thing is in this case 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.270
 use a clear tone base but not 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.270
 white 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.630
 remember also give base to the ears and 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.370
 around the neck to make it look like it's 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.470
 our skin and not just makeup 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.640
 recognizing to cover the dark circles we want 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.510
 give the impression that we have not slept 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.510
 in a while 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.000
 as the makeup that used is already 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.829
 too white I'm just going to use 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.360
 my normal translucent powders for 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:21.360
 seal and modify makeup 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.340
 let's use a colored eyeshadow 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.880
 dark oxide to look like that 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.440
 feeling sick not sleeping well 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.750
 what vampires are supposed to have 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.920
 we are applying in the shade in the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.920
 end of the basin 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.650
 to blur by tearing it a little 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.970
 with a dark brown color let's give it 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.310
 more depth in the eye just 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.060
 applying the right shade just at the end 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.060
 from our basin 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.840
 do not 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.400
 with the round brush let's blur 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.400
 already mix the colors very well 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.150
 with the eyeliner if possible 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.430
 existing creamy water so that we 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.620
 last longer we will delineate the lines 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.620
 water both the lower and upper 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.650
 then let's delineate the eye so much 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.650
 formerly as superior mind 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.950
 nothing happens if everything has been left 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:15.239
 homogeneous since with a skewed brush 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.239
 let's make it so 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.480
 very bad 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.230
 to seal in the pineapple also fill 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.480
 Hollows and give it a smoky feel 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.070
 let's review the alignment with a 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.620
 black eyeshadow tearing the one 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.620
 little bit like a little cat 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.140
 one 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:50.069
 how 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.400
 ah 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.199
 for the mascara we can 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.120
 use a two or three layers if not 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.860
 they have naturally curly eyelashes 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.960
 as it is my case that I do not curl them 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.180
 because then I give myself in the eye itself 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.349
 with the eyelashes, it is recommended 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.349
 curl fabrics before 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.220
 I will use the lifetime especially in 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.500
 both lips centers to blur 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.630
 very well and then to put cocoa 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.670
 over 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.260
 I do not have a wine-colored blush 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.530
 I'm going to mix these two colors in my 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.530
 hand 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:52.880
 you 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.169
 downloading someone the brush to be able 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.770
 blur blusher 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:57.770
 i 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.569
 and we put the finishing touches to the lifting 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:11.380
 and finally we put on the wig 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.330
 I hope you liked it I was going to 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.160
 do it first with the red contact lenses 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.320
 but unfortunately my eyes 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.330
 today they have not risen with humor 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.240
 to tolerate them and I could not 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:29.510
 put then I tried with the ones I had 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.870
 of husky style and I was not chosen either 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:37.400
 and the only claritas I have are 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:39.800
 these and well obviously they do not give so much 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.460
 hair as it could be any of the 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.080
 other two but if you have some contact lenses 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.330
 more appropriate than what I am 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.240
 taking the tutorial right now 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.340
 infinitely better remember to leave me in 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.320
 the comments what kind of tutorials 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.449
 you want to halloween I'm already 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.440
 taking a look at the options that I 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:02.750
 they go when I need to buy a little more 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.610
 of materials to make some but 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.010
 I hope that the next few weeks I hope 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.900
 and to be able to have everything and good to follow 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:11.150
 doing tutorials and well that's it 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.010
 for today's video remember to watch the 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.039
 information box because sometimes 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:18.139
