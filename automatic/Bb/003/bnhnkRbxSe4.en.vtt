00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.450
 The first thing we will do is wet it 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.650
 thread tip in nail polishes 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.559
 this is necessary for it to harden and 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:47.600
 we could calmly string our beads or 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:53.720
 beads just neatly lubricate 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.720
 so that the thread is soaked in varnish 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.530
 it was like this 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:12.950
 and for a while we will leave to dry 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:17.270
 our thread is desirable here in this 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.210
 suspended drying time can 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.030
 be different i will leave about minutes 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.630
 at 15 20 so that later I could 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.450
 continue working with the thread if you have 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.070
 thick thread do not try to dry 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.900
 tip to the end 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.090
 when he dries a little 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.759
 you can just twist it like this 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.479
 flatten him out 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:46.880
 then the thread itself will be thinner 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:51.979
 further as we recruit bead itself or 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:57.860
 beads and here everything is very simple we take 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:02.060
 bead or beads and insert the tip 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:05.140
 our thread is neat but since I have 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.540
 thick enough thread here 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:13.850
 additional difficulties are available 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:19.010
 however we just take and pass and so 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.930
 no it is not the hall from the first beads 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.940
 little white little blue little white 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.850
 blue white little blue 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:31.660
 white little blue little white this 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:34.250
 first row and then goes exactly the same 2 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:40.450
 after we strung beads 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:48.170
 lower them along the thread and cut off our 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:51.530
 the tip is solid like this and now 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.829
 proceed to knitting in the second row we 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.730
 start knitting with beads do one 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:03.590
 lift loop turn over knitting 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.530
 and knit the first loop with a column 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.209
 nakida 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.500
 the second loop we will knit beads 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:20.170
 for this we pull the first bead to 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.170
 our knitting like this 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:35.440
 hook for her so that the bead was 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:41.960
 front and knit column without nakida 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:44.840
 so we try to knit more tightly 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.620
 so that the bead does not hang out next 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:52.190
 knit the loop again just 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:55.360
 nakida column then pull up 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.360
 next bead 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.700
 like this 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:21.510
 knit a column without nakida again 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:21.510
 single crochet without bead and again 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.699
 we tighten 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.699
 this time already a white bead 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:39.930
 and knit so knit to the end of the row we 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.710
 knit the second row and if done 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:47.270
 right that should turn out like this 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.270
 bead pattern
