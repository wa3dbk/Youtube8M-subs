anything<00:01:55.950> matching<00:01:56.490> they<00:01:56.610> all<00:01:56.700> match<00:01:56.909> fine

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
anything matching they all match fine

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.819 
anything matching they all match fine
but<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> lower<00:01:57.750> arms<00:01:58.140> are<00:01:58.259> painted<00:01:58.649> they're

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
but the lower arms are painted they're

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.310 
but the lower arms are painted they're
molded<00:01:59.009> black<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.759> painted<00:02:00.509> skin<00:02:00.780> tone<00:02:00.990> same

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
molded black and painted skin tone same

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.980 
molded black and painted skin tone same
thing<00:02:01.500> as<00:02:01.619> warpath<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:03.030> forearm<00:02:03.600> doesn't

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
thing as warpath so the forearm doesn't

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.969 
thing as warpath so the forearm doesn't
really<00:02:04.140> match<00:02:04.350> with<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.619> rest<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
really match with the rest of the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.719 
really match with the rest of the
forearm<00:02:06.110> it's<00:02:07.110> not<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.439> bad<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.310> guy<00:02:08.550> it

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
forearm it's not that bad on this guy it

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.729 
forearm it's not that bad on this guy it
matches<00:02:08.940> close<00:02:09.239> enough<00:02:09.629> but<00:02:10.229> it's<00:02:10.530> not

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
matches close enough but it's not

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.360 
matches close enough but it's not
perfect

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
perfect

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.670 
perfect
unfortunately

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
unfortunately

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.490 
unfortunately
so<00:02:13.040> that's<00:02:14.000> kind<00:02:14.239> of<00:02:14.299> a<00:02:14.420> thing<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.870> mention

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
so that's kind of a thing to mention

this one have it it does but it's just

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.500 
this one have it it does but it's just
barely<00:02:33.640> can't<00:02:34.640> really<00:02:34.819> make<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.000> out<00:02:35.209> but<00:02:35.390> it's

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
barely can't really make it out but it's

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.630 
barely can't really make it out but it's
on<00:02:35.629> the<00:02:35.659> grip<00:02:36.409> of<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.620> pistol<00:02:37.040> there's<00:02:37.519> no

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.089 
paint on these at all it's just molded
plastic<00:02:39.799> so<00:02:40.760> they're<00:02:41.629> good<00:02:42.140> enough<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.650> he

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.880 
him well enough but they're just kind of
bland<00:02:49.599> I'll<00:02:50.599> go<00:02:50.780> over<00:02:50.900> articulation<00:02:51.590> before<00:02:51.859> I

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
bland I'll go over articulation before I

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.229 
bland I'll go over articulation before I
talk<00:02:52.099> about<00:02:52.129> anything<00:02:52.400> else<00:02:52.760> his<00:02:53.030> head

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
as far as an ab crunch he does show you

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.409 
as far as an ab crunch he does show you

that he does have an ab crunch in there

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:27.819 
that he does have an ab crunch in there
it<00:03:26.419> doesn't<00:03:26.750> have<00:03:26.959> a<00:03:26.989> whole<00:03:27.200> lot<00:03:27.380> of<00:03:27.410> motion

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
it doesn't have a whole lot of motion

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.940 
it doesn't have a whole lot of motion
when<00:03:28.010> you<00:03:28.099> have<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.370> best<00:03:28.579> on<00:03:29.950> because

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
when you have the best on because

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.229 
when you have the best on because
obviously<00:03:31.099> the<00:03:31.430> best<00:03:31.549> gets<00:03:31.790> in<00:03:31.879> the<00:03:31.940> way<00:03:32.060> but

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
obviously the best gets in the way but

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:33.640 
obviously the best gets in the way but
it<00:03:32.329> does<00:03:32.419> move<00:03:32.599> a<00:03:32.690> little<00:03:32.840> bit<00:03:33.049> he<00:03:33.290> has<00:03:33.319> a<00:03:33.410> waist

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
it does move a little bit he has a waist

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.970 
it does move a little bit he has a waist
twist<00:03:34.780> ball<00:03:35.780> jointed<00:03:36.109> hips<00:03:36.319> as<00:03:36.560> you<00:03:36.620> would

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
twist ball jointed hips as you would

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.720 
twist ball jointed hips as you would
expect<00:03:37.450> type<00:03:38.450> guy<00:03:39.200> rotation<00:03:39.620> double<00:03:40.430> jointed

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
expect type guy rotation double jointed

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.430 
expect type guy rotation double jointed
knee<00:03:42.010> no<00:03:43.010> rotation<00:03:43.730> in<00:03:43.849> the<00:03:44.000> shin<00:03:44.440> regular

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
knee no rotation in the shin regular

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.159 
knee no rotation in the shin regular
foot<00:03:45.709> ankle<00:03:46.220> foot<00:03:46.849> and<00:03:47.060> ankle<00:03:47.239> in<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.720> toe

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.169 
foot ankle foot and ankle in the toe

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.849 
foot ankle foot and ankle in the toe
ankle<00:03:49.000> no<00:03:50.000> rocker<00:03:50.329> no<00:03:51.049> ankle<00:03:51.379> rocker<00:03:51.560> at<00:03:51.769> all

ankle no rocker no ankle rocker at all

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.460 
ankle no rocker no ankle rocker at all
so<00:03:52.760> he's<00:03:53.060> not<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.449> most<00:03:53.569> articulated<00:03:54.290> but<00:03:54.440> I

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
so he's not the most articulated but I

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.830 
so he's not the most articulated but I
think<00:03:54.680> he<00:03:54.769> has<00:03:54.919> enough<00:03:54.949> as<00:03:55.489> you<00:03:56.090> kind<00:03:56.480> of<00:03:56.660> saw

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
think he has enough as you kind of saw

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.780 
think he has enough as you kind of saw
the<00:03:57.139> vest<00:03:57.470> does<00:03:57.739> come<00:03:58.010> off<00:03:58.220> and<00:03:58.549> then

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
the vest does come off and then

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.580 
the vest does come off and then
underneath<00:03:59.329> you<00:03:59.540> have<00:03:59.599> the<00:03:59.660> hulking<00:04:00.109> torso

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
underneath you have the hulking torso

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.000 
underneath you have the hulking torso
with<00:04:01.549> the<00:04:01.790> little<00:04:02.299> padded<00:04:02.540> quilted<00:04:03.139> thing<00:04:03.859> up

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
with the little padded quilted thing up

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.369 
with the little padded quilted thing up
there<00:04:04.220> he<00:04:04.760> actually<00:04:05.000> looks<00:04:05.150> fine<00:04:05.840> with<00:04:06.079> it<00:04:06.199> off

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
there he actually looks fine with it off

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.170 
there he actually looks fine with it off
it's<00:04:06.709> a<00:04:06.859> little<00:04:07.099> narrow<00:04:07.280> his<00:04:07.760> chest<00:04:08.030> is<00:04:08.150> a

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
it's a little narrow his chest is a

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.110 
it's a little narrow his chest is a
little<00:04:08.449> narrow<00:04:08.629> for<00:04:08.900> these<00:04:09.019> big<00:04:09.260> shoulders

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
little narrow for these big shoulders

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.089 
little narrow for these big shoulders
but<00:04:11.120> actually<00:04:11.780> when<00:04:12.349> you<00:04:12.379> take<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.739> vest<00:04:12.889> off

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
but actually when you take the vest off

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.520 
but actually when you take the vest off
it<00:04:13.310> makes<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.579> legs<00:04:13.790> kind<00:04:14.209> of<00:04:14.389> more<00:04:14.810> in<00:04:15.440> a

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
it makes the legs kind of more in a

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.620 
it makes the legs kind of more in a
better<00:04:15.709> proportion<00:04:16.310> with<00:04:16.849> the<00:04:16.970> vest<00:04:17.150> on<00:04:17.359> in<00:04:17.510> my

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
better proportion with the vest on in my

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.990 
better proportion with the vest on in my
opinion<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.829> I<00:04:18.979> think<00:04:19.340> I<00:04:19.459> kind<00:04:19.699> of<00:04:19.729> feel<00:04:19.940> the

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
opinion and I think I kind of feel the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.480 
opinion and I think I kind of feel the
same<00:04:20.060> way<00:04:20.329> on<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.870> warpath<00:04:21.229> body<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:22.250> legs

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
same way on the warpath body the legs

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.950 
same way on the warpath body the legs
just<00:04:22.610> don't<00:04:23.030> seem<00:04:23.270> to<00:04:23.300> match<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.750> body

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
just don't seem to match the body

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.409 
just don't seem to match the body
they're<00:04:24.950> kind<00:04:25.789> of<00:04:25.880> skinny

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
they're kind of skinny

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.629 
they're kind of skinny
I<00:04:26.870> don't<00:04:27.770> know<00:04:27.830> maybe<00:04:28.009> that's<00:04:28.249> just<00:04:28.430> me

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
I don't know maybe that's just me

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.129 
I don't know maybe that's just me
they're<00:04:28.879> not<00:04:28.999> terrible<00:04:29.539> but<00:04:29.599> they're<00:04:29.930> just

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139

anyway<00:04:34.009> he's<00:04:34.280> I<00:04:34.699> think<00:04:34.999> he's<00:04:35.479> worth<00:04:35.659> buying<00:04:35.990> it

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
anyway he's I think he's worth buying it

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.989 
anyway he's I think he's worth buying it
depends<00:04:37.189> if<00:04:37.249> you<00:04:37.340> have<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.550> money<00:04:37.669> to<00:04:37.879> spend

depends if you have the money to spend
on<00:04:38.300> him<00:04:38.479> or<00:04:38.629> not<00:04:38.749> and<00:04:39.580> if<00:04:40.580> you<00:04:40.669> can<00:04:40.759> get<00:04:40.849> a

on him or not and if you can get a
really<00:04:41.060> good<00:04:41.180> deal<00:04:41.569> obviously<00:04:42.259> that<00:04:42.439> helps<00:04:42.620> he

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
really good deal obviously that helps he

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.309 
really good deal obviously that helps he

worth if you bought them at retail it
depends<00:04:59.599> how<00:04:59.689> much<00:04:59.810> you<00:04:59.870> get<00:05:00.110> him<00:05:00.229> for<00:05:00.469> in<00:05:01.009> the

depends how much you get him for in the

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:03.070 
depends how much you get him for in the
aftermarket<00:05:01.610> I<00:05:01.879> guess<00:05:02.090> that's<00:05:02.419> up<00:05:02.569> to<00:05:02.719> you<00:05:02.870> I

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
aftermarket I guess that's up to you I

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.990 
aftermarket I guess that's up to you I
do<00:05:03.529> like<00:05:03.889> the<00:05:04.069> figure<00:05:04.340> and<00:05:04.460> I<00:05:04.490> do<00:05:04.550> recommend

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
do like the figure and I do recommend

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.790 
do like the figure and I do recommend
getting<00:05:05.389> it<00:05:05.599> it's<00:05:05.719> all<00:05:05.870> about<00:05:06.469> the<00:05:06.620> price

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
getting it it's all about the price

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.619 
getting it it's all about the price
though<00:05:07.099> that's<00:05:07.699> completely<00:05:08.120> up<00:05:08.300> to<00:05:08.330> you<00:05:08.509> it

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:08.629 
though that's completely up to you it

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:09.879 
though that's completely up to you it
would<00:05:08.719> have<00:05:08.840> been<00:05:08.960> nice<00:05:09.139> if<00:05:09.349> the<00:05:09.379> knife<00:05:09.650> came

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
would have been nice if the knife came

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.019 
would have been nice if the knife came
out<00:05:10.129> but<00:05:10.340> it<00:05:10.460> does<00:05:10.610> not<00:05:10.819> unfortunately

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:13.029 
out but it does not unfortunately

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:15.610 
out but it does not unfortunately
so<00:05:14.029> your<00:05:14.210> call<00:05:14.449> it's<00:05:14.810> getting<00:05:15.259> harder<00:05:15.529> and

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
so your call it's getting harder and

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.420 
so your call it's getting harder and
harder<00:05:15.710> to<00:05:15.979> find

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
harder to find

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.010 
harder to find
especially<00:05:17.120> with<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.360> new<00:05:17.389> movies<00:05:17.839> coming

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
especially with the new movies coming

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.079 
especially with the new movies coming
out<00:05:18.199> people<00:05:18.469> are<00:05:18.919> trying<00:05:19.189> to<00:05:19.279> find<00:05:19.490> more<00:05:19.879> guys

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:20.089 
out people are trying to find more guys

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:21.269 
out people are trying to find more guys
that<00:05:20.120> are<00:05:20.389> connected<00:05:20.689> to<00:05:20.750> those<00:05:20.870> characters

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:21.279 
that are connected to those characters

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:24.010 
that are connected to those characters
so<00:05:22.279> being<00:05:22.610> a<00:05:22.699> Hydra<00:05:23.029> guy<00:05:23.210> he's<00:05:23.750> definitely

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
so being a Hydra guy he's definitely

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.420 
so being a Hydra guy he's definitely
gonna<00:05:24.469> be<00:05:24.650> harder<00:05:24.949> and<00:05:25.069> harder<00:05:25.310> to<00:05:25.370> find

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
gonna be harder and harder to find

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.309 
gonna be harder and harder to find
prices<00:05:26.060> are<00:05:26.180> gonna<00:05:26.270> get<00:05:26.479> higher<00:05:26.689> so<00:05:26.960> if<00:05:27.050> you<00:05:27.139> do

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 
prices are gonna get higher so if you do

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:29.559 
prices are gonna get higher so if you do
want<00:05:27.589> him<00:05:27.740> now<00:05:28.669> would<00:05:28.879> be<00:05:28.909> the<00:05:28.999> time<00:05:29.120> to<00:05:29.449> get

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:29.569 
want him now would be the time to get

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.269 
want him now would be the time to get
him<00:05:29.719> don't<00:05:29.870> wait<00:05:30.080> any<00:05:30.229> longer<00:05:30.529> unless<00:05:31.039> you

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:31.279 
him don't wait any longer unless you
