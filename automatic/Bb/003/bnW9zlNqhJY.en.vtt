00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.299
 rafa nadal talked today about the 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.250
 Tendinitis that has you out of 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.230
 circuit and that will prevent you from participating in 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.850
 the open uses attended to television 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.040
 Spanish in Manacor, its place of 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.570
 habitual residence will only return when 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.570
 be fully recovered 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.150
 life will die until it has 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.090
 past that work to recover what 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.940
 as soon as possible in view of a race 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.890
 long 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.170
 when it's not time to throw overland 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.510
 this this time that is standing but 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.570
 recover very well to try to make my 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.520
 race is as long as possible and this 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.489
 is this is my illusion not to regulate the 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.780
 Medievo that when well 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.309
 Well, it has been the Balearic Islands 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.350
 manacor where he spoke today with 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.750
 Spanish television rafa nadal after 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.900
 to announce that he will not go to the open usa 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.670
 He has not yet recovered from his tendinitis 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.620
 so until I can not compete at 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.620
 maximum level and without reservations will not return 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.450
 and nothing does not complicate occasional 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.070
 fist 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.630
 today race has confessed that the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.190
 knee discomfort started in 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.410
 February shortly after the opening of 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.620
 australia and that came to paris very touched 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.600
 now you must give up the usopen not you 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.880
 like to give up such a tournament 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.690
 important and beautiful as is the Portuguese but 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.470
 good also because of the 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.470
 circumstances of what 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.100
 after quite a few problems in the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.600
 left knee 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.850
 and now lost the Olympic games not 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.619
 it's time to shoot because this is 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.619
 time that is stopped but recover 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.350
 well to try that my career is what 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.869
 longest possible and this is our 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.280
 illusion a long career that allows 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.750
 remove the thorn of not being able to 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.500
 participate in london games 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.350
 well this is the goal my illusion 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.540
 and my maximum longer focus 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.890
 possible of my career and obviously the 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.060
 illusion of being in a river 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.220
 a table after 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.079
 went to work for them rafa wait 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.530
 go back to the tracks long before 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.530
 finish the year
