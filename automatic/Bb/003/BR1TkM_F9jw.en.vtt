00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.840
 I am Gerardo, and I am an auxiliary of this university for more than 30 years. 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.400
 I met Raúl here, he was an architecture student. 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.300
 Just in those days began the return to classes and came the tuft 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.060
 That's why I was very struck by the sight of a student in his wheelchair. 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.060
 A little isolated from the rest of the students. 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.420
 He felt that they did not take him into account. 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:44.040
 Then he pulled some water pumps out of his purse, and threw them at the students, 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.480
 to provoke them to approach him and, well, proceed to the tuft that famous. 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.120
 They threw eggs at him, threw things at his clothes. 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.640
 And they threw it into a dirty water source. 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.580
 Well, after the tuft was finished, I approached him. 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.380
 "How did you feel?" I asked. 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.440
 "Well, I felt very good ... 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.760
 Because I felt one more. " 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.060
 Then there was friendship with him. 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.200
 Look, Raúl, after the first year of his career, 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.340
 He said goodbye to me, and said: 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.360
 "Don Gerardo come, I want to give you a gift" 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.180
 in gratitude that I expected it every night to be able to sweep. 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.740
 Then he said "Take, this is for you. 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.880
 This model I want you to keep it, that reminds me of me. "
