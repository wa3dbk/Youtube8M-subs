watch if you've been waiting to watch
them<00:01:02.430> too<00:01:02.609> because<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.449> know<00:01:03.480> maybe<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.930> just

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
them too because you know maybe you just

want to watch it on TV and said I don't

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.890 
want to watch it on TV and said I don't
think<00:01:06.600> many<00:01:06.750> people<00:01:06.869> did<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.439> at<00:01:07.560> all<00:01:07.770> but<00:01:08.100> I

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
think many people did that at all but I

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.420 
think many people did that at all but I
think<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.650> very<00:01:10.860> good<00:01:11.130> one<00:01:11.310> to

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
think it's just it's a very good one to

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.800 
think it's just it's a very good one to
watch<00:01:11.610> because<00:01:12.260> as<00:01:13.400> you<00:01:14.400> may<00:01:14.640> most<00:01:15.420> likely

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
watch because as you may most likely

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.710 
watch because as you may most likely
know<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.710> explains<00:01:17.400> more<00:01:17.850> about<00:01:18.150> what<00:01:18.330> happens
