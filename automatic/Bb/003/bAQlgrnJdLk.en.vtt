00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.740 
almost like an impeachment process where
they<00:01:44.280> come<00:01:44.520> down<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.909> floor<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.479> they<00:01:45.600> go

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
they come down on the floor and they go

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.359 
they come down on the floor and they go
on<00:01:45.869> every<00:01:46.110> TV<00:01:46.290> show<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.710> they<00:01:46.799> make<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.130> case

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
on every TV show and they make the case

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.010 
on every TV show and they make the case
except<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.090> at<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.270> end<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.630> making<00:01:48.930> that

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
except that at the end of making that

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.600 
except that at the end of making that
case<00:01:49.229> what<00:01:49.409> happens<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:49.950> impeachment

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
case what happens is not impeachment

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.889 
case what happens is not impeachment
what<00:01:50.759> happens<00:01:51.119> at<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.329> end<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.540> making<00:01:51.810> that

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
what happens at the end of making that

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.210 
what happens at the end of making that
case<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.380> not<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.680> Republicans<00:01:53.100> do

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
case it's not that Republicans do

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.130 
case it's not that Republicans do
something<00:01:53.520> extremely<00:01:54.090> stupid<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.869> did<00:01:55.049> they

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
something extremely stupid it did they

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.080 
something extremely stupid it did they
do<00:01:55.200> something<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:56.549> kind<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.820> probably

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
do something it is just kind of probably

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.200 
do something it is just kind of probably
a<00:01:57.210> waste<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.509> time

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
a waste of time

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.270 
a waste of time
