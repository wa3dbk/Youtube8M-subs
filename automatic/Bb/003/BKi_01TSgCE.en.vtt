gonna go 18 0 15 0 15 1 in and in this

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.600 
gonna go 18 0 15 0 15 1 in and in this
game<00:03:37.549> it<00:03:37.640> doesn't<00:03:37.760> really<00:03:38.090> matter<00:03:38.360> you<00:03:39.610> know

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
game it doesn't really matter you know

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.849 
game it doesn't really matter you know
and<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:40.820> think<00:03:41.030> across<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.049> board<00:03:42.200> a<00:03:42.590> lot<00:03:42.739> of

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
and I think across the board a lot of

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.440 
and I think across the board a lot of
people<00:03:42.980> are<00:03:43.280> seeing<00:03:43.609> in<00:03:43.940> modern<00:03:44.150> warfare<00:03:44.180> 3

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
people are seeing in modern warfare 3

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.970 
people are seeing in modern warfare 3
that<00:03:44.989> your<00:03:45.109> stats<00:03:45.470> with<00:03:46.370> your<00:03:46.519> KD<00:03:47.000> are<00:03:47.450> really

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
that your stats with your KD are really

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.860 
that your stats with your KD are really
skewed<00:03:48.980> their<00:03:49.430> scheme<00:03:49.730> because<00:03:49.940> people<00:03:50.510> know

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
skewed their scheme because people know

modern warfare 2 a lot of the maps like
this<00:04:20.780> map<00:04:20.989> is<00:04:21.019> it<00:04:21.919> reflects<00:04:22.400> oh<00:04:22.729> god<00:04:23.419> I<00:04:23.539> don't

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
this map is it reflects oh god I don't

even<00:04:23.720> know<00:04:23.870> what<00:04:23.930> it<00:04:24.080> reflects<00:04:24.409> but

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
even know what it reflects but

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.379 
even know what it reflects but
or<00:04:25.940> maybe<00:04:26.540> this<00:04:26.720> reflects<00:04:27.080> storm<00:04:28.030> all<00:04:29.030> the

or maybe this reflects storm all the

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.180 
or maybe this reflects storm all the
maps<00:04:29.570> reflects<00:04:29.930> some<00:04:30.110> type<00:04:30.259> of<00:04:30.290> old<00:04:30.560> map<00:04:30.830> you

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
maps reflects some type of old map you

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.010 
maps reflects some type of old map you
can<00:04:31.310> tell<00:04:31.520> like<00:04:31.699> by<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:31.940> color<00:04:32.479> ski<00:04:32.810> in<00:04:32.990> the

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
can tell like by the color ski in the

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.400 
can tell like by the color ski in the
scenario<00:04:34.630> that<00:04:35.630> kind<00:04:35.840> of<00:04:35.900> stuff<00:04:36.080> they<00:04:36.229> all

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
scenario that kind of stuff they all

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.890 
scenario that kind of stuff they all
reflect<00:04:36.680> some<00:04:36.949> type<00:04:37.280> of<00:04:37.310> previous<00:04:38.060> map<00:04:38.300> that

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
reflect some type of previous map that

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.110 
reflect some type of previous map that
was<00:04:38.990> made<00:04:39.259> and<00:04:39.830> I<00:04:39.860> really<00:04:40.100> like<00:04:40.250> that<00:04:40.280> and<00:04:41.030> I

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
was made and I really like that and I

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.850 
was made and I really like that and I
think<00:04:41.150> this<00:04:41.509> game<00:04:41.720> plays<00:04:42.050> a<00:04:42.080> lot<00:04:42.320> like<00:04:42.500> 10<00:04:42.680> mph

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
think this game plays a lot like 10 mph

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.300 
think this game plays a lot like 10 mph
or<00:04:42.979> two<00:04:43.300> but<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:44.419> feeling<00:04:44.780> I<00:04:44.870> get<00:04:44.930> from<00:04:45.080> it<00:04:45.440> is

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
or two but the feeling I get from it is

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.540 
or two but the feeling I get from it is
from<00:04:46.880> cod4<00:04:47.150> I<00:04:47.780> palm<00:04:48.050> I<00:04:48.320> will<00:04:48.710> play<00:04:48.949> a<00:04:48.979> ground

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.159 
out but in general I don't want to make
a<00:06:03.380> video<00:06:03.530> that's<00:06:03.830> too<00:06:04.070> simple<00:06:04.430> or<00:06:04.580> too<00:06:05.389> boring
