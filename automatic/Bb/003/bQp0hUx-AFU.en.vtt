00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
all right I understand this it doesn't

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.340

make it right you have to drive these
stakes<00:01:07.619> all<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> way<00:01:08.159> into<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.490> ground

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
stakes all the way into the ground

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.320 
stakes all the way into the ground
there's<00:01:09.360> no<00:01:09.659> point<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.350> having<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.159> 36<00:01:11.850> inch<00:01:12.060> or

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
there's no point in having a 36 inch or

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.679 
there's no point in having a 36 inch or
40<00:01:12.780> inch<00:01:12.930> stake<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.590> only<00:01:14.340> using<00:01:14.790> 18<00:01:15.299> inches

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
40 inch stake and only using 18 inches

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.560 
40 inch stake and only using 18 inches
of<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:17.250> second<00:01:17.670> problem<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.240> have

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
of it the second problem that I have

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.990 
of it the second problem that I have
here<00:01:18.930> with<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.530> people<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.520> tie<00:01:20.759> their

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
here with this is people that tie their

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.260 
here with this is people that tie their
knots<00:01:21.030> off<00:01:21.540> at<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.170> top<00:01:22.670> all<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:24.000> does<00:01:24.240> is

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
knots off at the top all that does is

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.890 
knots off at the top all that does is
create<00:01:24.960> what's<00:01:25.320> called<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.830> long<00:01:26.430> moment<00:01:27.299> arm

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
create what's called a long moment arm

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.859 
create what's called a long moment arm
and<00:01:28.350> basically<00:01:29.189> what<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.420> my<00:01:30.630> arm

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
and basically what that is is if my arm

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.200 
and basically what that is is if my arm
was<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.140> stake<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.610> try<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:32.970> push<00:01:33.180> my

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
was the stake and you try and push my

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.370 
was the stake and you try and push my
hand<00:01:33.689> here

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
hand here

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.770 
hand here
I<00:01:34.409> have<00:01:34.950> less<00:01:35.280> resistance<00:01:35.549> than<00:01:36.270> if<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.509> try

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
I have less resistance than if you try

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.660 
I have less resistance than if you try
and<00:01:36.840> push<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.290> here<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.920> hold<00:01:38.130> back<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.549> my

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
and push it here I can hold back up my

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.690 
and push it here I can hold back up my
elbow<00:01:38.820> much<00:01:39.750> easier<00:01:40.200> than<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.740> at<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> top

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
elbow much easier than I can at the top

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.389 
elbow much easier than I can at the top
of<00:01:41.880> my<00:01:41.970> hand<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.960> higher<00:01:43.200> up<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.560> go<00:01:44.040> the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
of my hand so the higher up you go the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.170 
of my hand so the higher up you go the
less<00:01:45.119> holding<00:01:45.630> power<00:01:45.869> you're<00:01:46.170> gonna<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:47.180> not

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
less holding power you're gonna have not

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.609 
less holding power you're gonna have not
to<00:01:48.420> mention<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.869> fact<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.290> you're<00:01:49.470> going<00:01:49.590> to

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
to mention the fact that you're going to

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.800 
to mention the fact that you're going to
have<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.860> bin<00:01:50.220> full<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.520> bent<00:01:50.939> stakes<00:01:51.360> when<00:01:51.689> you

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
have a bin full of bent stakes when you

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.590 
have a bin full of bent stakes when you
get<00:01:51.990> done<00:01:52.229> okay<00:01:52.920> what<00:01:53.880> you're<00:01:54.000> gonna<00:01:54.149> see<00:01:54.450> when

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
get done okay what you're gonna see when

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.990 
get done okay what you're gonna see when
I<00:01:54.659> pull<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.799> initial<00:01:56.070> failure<00:01:56.790> is

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
I pull this the initial failure is

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.690 
I pull this the initial failure is
basically<00:01:57.600> going<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.899> be<00:01:58.079> due<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.829> bending

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
basically going to be due to the bending

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.760 
basically going to be due to the bending
of<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.909> steel<00:02:00.270> because<00:02:01.079> we'll<00:02:01.259> move<00:02:01.469> this

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
of the steel because we'll move this

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.130 
of the steel because we'll move this
probably<00:02:02.280> about<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.820> far<00:02:03.149> before<00:02:03.810> it

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
probably about that far before it

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.709 
probably about that far before it
actually<00:02:04.290> fails<00:02:04.829> at<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.219> ground<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.880> then

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
actually fails at the ground and then

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.240 
actually fails at the ground and then
it'll<00:02:06.899> fail<00:02:07.200> at<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.500> ground<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.009> then<00:02:08.099> it'll

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
it'll fail at the ground and then it'll

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.750 
it'll fail at the ground and then it'll
fail<00:02:08.550> totally<00:02:09.619> so<00:02:10.619> let's<00:02:10.979> go<00:02:11.220> ahead<00:02:11.340> did<00:02:11.640> we

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
fail totally so let's go ahead did we

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.030 
fail totally so let's go ahead did we
reset<00:02:12.150> this

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
reset this

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.190 
reset this
okay<00:02:13.849> let's<00:02:14.090> go<00:02:14.269> ahead<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.540> pull<00:02:14.720> this<00:02:14.900> slowly

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
okay let's go ahead and pull this slowly

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.920 
okay let's go ahead and pull this slowly
please<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:16.670> guys<00:02:16.849> watching<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.450> end<00:02:17.599> you<00:02:17.750> can

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
please you guys watching the end you can

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.559 
please you guys watching the end you can
see<00:02:17.959> stop<00:02:18.470> there<00:02:18.799> you<00:02:19.549> can<00:02:19.700> see<00:02:19.909> we<00:02:20.060> bent<00:02:20.329> that

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
see stop there you can see we bent that

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.259 
see stop there you can see we bent that
in<00:02:20.840> probably<00:02:21.530> that<00:02:21.680> far<00:02:22.040> with<00:02:22.370> only<00:02:22.579> 200

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
in probably that far with only 200

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.979 
in probably that far with only 200
pounds<00:02:23.659> of<00:02:23.720> force<00:02:24.310> now<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.909> should<00:02:26.360> have<00:02:26.689> held

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
pounds of force now it should have held

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.350 
pounds of force now it should have held
at<00:02:27.560> least<00:02:28.099> as<00:02:28.400> good<00:02:28.579> as<00:02:28.640> that<00:02:28.939> because<00:02:29.209> it's

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
at least as good as that because it's

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.680 
at least as good as that because it's
the<00:02:29.420> same<00:02:29.629> diameter<00:02:29.989> right<00:02:30.440> we're<00:02:31.280> at<00:02:31.790> less

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
the same diameter right we're at less

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.229 
the same diameter right we're at less
than<00:02:32.930> half<00:02:33.290> of<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.590> holding<00:02:34.099> power<00:02:34.310> just

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
than half of that holding power just

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.110 
than half of that holding power just
because<00:02:35.599> of<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.900> fact<00:02:36.110> that<00:02:36.620> we<00:02:37.370> tied<00:02:37.640> off<00:02:37.909> at

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
because of the fact that we tied off at

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.849 
because of the fact that we tied off at
the<00:02:38.239> top<00:02:38.480> instead<00:02:38.959> of<00:02:39.109> tying<00:02:39.319> off<00:02:39.590> at<00:02:39.769> the

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
the top instead of tying off at the

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.860 
the top instead of tying off at the
bottom<00:02:40.280> go<00:02:41.000> ahead<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.239> pull<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.420> forward<00:02:41.510> a

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
bottom go ahead and pull it forward a

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.649 
bottom go ahead and pull it forward a
little<00:02:41.989> bit<00:02:42.230> more<00:02:42.790> you<00:02:43.790> can<00:02:43.939> see<00:02:44.150> we're<00:02:44.629> just

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
little bit more you can see we're just

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.770 
little bit more you can see we're just
starting<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.319> plow<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:46.220> earth<00:02:46.489> now<00:02:46.819> but<00:02:47.569> we've

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
starting to plow the earth now but we've

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.220 
starting to plow the earth now but we've
moved<00:02:48.049> this<00:02:48.379> how<00:02:48.680> far<00:02:49.060> six<00:02:50.060> inches<00:02:50.510> seven

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
moved this how far six inches seven

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.160 
moved this how far six inches seven
inches<00:02:51.670> can<00:02:52.670> you<00:02:52.760> imagine<00:02:52.879> seven<00:02:53.629> inches<00:02:54.049> of

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
inches can you imagine seven inches of

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.050 
inches can you imagine seven inches of
slop<00:02:54.470> in<00:02:54.709> your<00:02:54.859> tie<00:02:55.069> down<00:02:55.310> how<00:02:55.579> loose<00:02:55.849> would

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
slop in your tie down how loose would

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.860 
slop in your tie down how loose would
you<00:02:56.209> can't<00:02:56.450> be<00:02:57.250> extremely<00:02:58.250> loose<00:02:58.489> and<00:02:58.870> then

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
you can't be extremely loose and then

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.899 
you can't be extremely loose and then
what<00:03:00.049> happens<00:03:00.500> is<00:03:00.709> Mother<00:03:01.010> Nature<00:03:01.430> over<00:03:01.700> here

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
what happens is Mother Nature over here

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.720 
what happens is Mother Nature over here
decides<00:03:02.389> to<00:03:02.599> go<00:03:02.750> ha<00:03:03.019> ha<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.680> starts<00:03:04.459> blowing

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
decides to go ha ha and starts blowing

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.000 
decides to go ha ha and starts blowing
and<00:03:05.030> blowing<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:05.569> blowing<00:03:05.629> and<00:03:06.500> what's<00:03:06.889> going

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
and blowing and blowing and what's going

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.160 
and blowing and blowing and what's going
to<00:03:07.069> happen<00:03:07.159> is<00:03:07.579> that<00:03:07.609> steak<00:03:08.299> guy<00:03:08.690> is<00:03:08.750> going<00:03:09.079> to

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
to happen is that steak guy is going to

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.500 
to happen is that steak guy is going to
jerk<00:03:09.470> a<00:03:09.590> jerk<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:10.010> jerk<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.489> this<00:03:10.940> is<00:03:11.060> exactly

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
jerk a jerk and jerk and this is exactly

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.119 
jerk a jerk and jerk and this is exactly
what's<00:03:11.750> going<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:11.959> happen<00:03:12.379> the<00:03:12.739> steak<00:03:13.010> is

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
what's going to happen the steak is

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.369 
what's going to happen the steak is
going<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.340> pull<00:03:13.489> out<00:03:13.639> of<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:14.239> ground<00:03:14.420> well

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
going to pull out of the ground well

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.539 
going to pull out of the ground well
yeah<00:03:15.849> okay<00:03:16.849> so<00:03:16.909> we<00:03:17.180> went<00:03:17.419> from<00:03:17.629> 200<00:03:18.549> initial

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
yeah okay so we went from 200 initial

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.589 
yeah okay so we went from 200 initial
failure<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.569> 400<00:03:21.230> pounds<00:03:21.410> total<00:03:22.069> failure<00:03:22.599> all

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
failure to 400 pounds total failure all

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.009 
failure to 400 pounds total failure all
right

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
right

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.199 
right
on<00:03:24.349> a<00:03:24.620> steak<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.280> should<00:03:25.609> have<00:03:25.879> at<00:03:26.150> least

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
on a steak that should have at least

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.039 
on a steak that should have at least
held<00:03:27.139> the<00:03:27.829> same<00:03:28.040> as<00:03:28.250> that<00:03:28.459> only<00:03:29.269> because<00:03:29.870> we

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
held the same as that only because we

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.369 
held the same as that only because we
got<00:03:30.260> lazy<00:03:30.560> or<00:03:30.859> tired<00:03:31.099> and<00:03:31.690> only<00:03:32.690> because<00:03:33.049> we

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
okay the IFA I study has defined all the

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.159 
okay the IFA I study has defined all the
way<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.109> the<00:03:48.440> ground<00:03:48.680> as<00:03:49.220> one<00:03:50.209> to<00:03:50.569> two<00:03:50.599> inches

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
way to the ground as one to two inches

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.890 
way to the ground as one to two inches
above<00:03:51.349> the<00:03:51.560> ground<00:03:52.329> okay<00:03:53.329> so<00:03:53.389> if<00:03:53.599> you're<00:03:53.720> if

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
above the ground okay so if you're if

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.720 
above the ground okay so if you're if
you're<00:03:53.959> still<00:03:54.410> using<00:03:54.620> rope<00:03:55.040> and<00:03:55.340> you're<00:03:55.430> using

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
you're still using rope and you're using

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.420 
you're still using rope and you're using
a<00:03:55.849> rolling<00:03:56.599> hitch<00:03:56.959> or<00:03:57.199> a<00:03:57.260> slip<00:03:57.530> knot<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:57.949> you

a rolling hitch or a slip knot and you

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.280 
a rolling hitch or a slip knot and you
and<00:03:58.609> your<00:03:58.730> procedure<00:03:59.209> is<00:03:59.359> to<00:03:59.569> push<00:03:59.780> that<00:03:59.989> knot

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
and your procedure is to push that knot

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.589 
and your procedure is to push that knot
down<00:04:00.530> to<00:04:00.769> get<00:04:00.889> the<00:04:01.010> last<00:04:01.220> bit<00:04:01.400> of<00:04:01.639> tightness<00:04:01.879> if

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
down to get the last bit of tightness if

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.210 
down to get the last bit of tightness if
you<00:04:02.750> can't<00:04:03.019> hit<00:04:03.169> the<00:04:03.230> ground<00:04:03.530> you're<00:04:03.709> good<00:04:03.980> one
