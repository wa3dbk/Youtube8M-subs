 You know my name on the hill, his and me. 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.200
 I have a channel here on youtube where I 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.349
 I talk about fashion and beauty of the day 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.739
 tutorials and more 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.840
 and today I came here all from pink to 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.480
 pay homage to a dear friend my friend 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.780

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.320
 that she is a barbie youtube one of the 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.989
 notes the island guard of the club and I have 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.520
 a very gracious friendship with her I 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:54.550
 I really like her and when I discovered the 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.010
 her channel when I saw her channel and 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.840
 I never left a message for her 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.760
 never had the courage to leave a 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:06.490
 wink talking about the video of her and such 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.500
 because I was very afraid that I would find 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.070
 that it was in my interest for people 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.800
 who knew my channel and one day she 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.830
 called me on facebook that I liked 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.720
 much of me who had liked the 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.819
 my channel and I was very very 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.060
 surprise because when we know 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:30.220
 people like this on the small screen 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.250
 we think they are of the type of 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.399
 person, actually when I know 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.310
 that she talking to her I saw that 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.099
 She was a person far beyond what I 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.979
 I was waiting for her to go there. 

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:47.800

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.239
 belief is that we learned 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.580
 I really like to talk to her for 

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:57.069
