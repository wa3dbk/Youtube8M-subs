00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.920
 and which design 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.890
 today 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.200
 these themes light up the dark 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.129
 both days, precedent is already needed more towards home 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.069
 I have a guest in the Tjitske studio 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:16.230
 in hello hello article 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.630
 You and the interior architect 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.189
 is correct and you think you have specified origination 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.109
 in buildings 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.000
 we actually do that master 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.289
 throwing wrong he died 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.320
 and thereby not starting too negatively but what a lot that made mistake is in 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.890
 home is that people don't think about light 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.040
 that the use of closing post in interior we think about color and 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.160
 about atmosphere and about furniture but being light is often a poor child 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.420
 say emmen for what often happens very often is that people lie there 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.420
 marijn a point in a room in the room 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.760
 and rightly agents went to lie on the spot 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.930
 that's my husband who thinks a fluorescent tube is all right 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.820
 for info, for example, not good for the fire no viagra yes I would 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.660
 say 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.630
 but what is for example in a living room that you should pay attention to 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.820
 of course 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.940
 it is very important that you 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.390
 that you think of several lamps at various heights in one go 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.369
 there are three types of lighting, think of general lighting 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.760
 the mood lighting and functional lighting above it open for an hour 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.660
 you that is the functional lighting he wants you to have focused light on you 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.140
 on you the newspaper 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.970
 or on your computer that you are good 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.920
 get there and see everything 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.420
 but next to a next to a couch it is nice to hossen or it is nice to see the vacancy 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.890
 to have if you want to read a book 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.760
 do even if you then the offer 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.770
 and very often not on Dutch frugality and I think 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.080
 when i walk down the street and i now look again 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.440
 that is now often only one or two lamps coming up, although it is actually so beautiful 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.930
 various lighting in your home rienk room put a corner behind this car 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.650
 student from prague 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.910
 that makes your living room a bit bigger than just having an adventure 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.310
 socializing yes 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.850
 so many people so many incidents are classical and interiors very intense 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.340
 For example, the third month is the first thing to put in place for lighting 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.359
 and modern interior 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.540
 the modern self here you often see that people make use of ridicule 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.899
 in that cunt I built in very nicely so that the fallen away had a ceiling 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:24.009
 we have mounted a spotlight on the ceiling 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.859
 I think everyone says but the rails campers forces and then 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:32.079
 you can say very nicely, but in that space you can do more in the tub very nicely 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.119
 align my paintings 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.309
 Of course you also find myself always in a modern interior that one 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:39.669
 table lamp also adds some heat 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:44.229
 and me but I'm going to choose you and and there is no country with too big a foot 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:48.519
 just like you are sitting here on the table oh yes that is a very nice thing 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:49.480
 plate yes 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.670
 but it is really just a classic schedule but due to the declining 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.809
 continue 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:57.279
 yes you can not drive anything modern to your interior it is one 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:59.769
 lots of table lamps are like this 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.579
 the force unleashed to extend that say but the teacher 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:07.339
 are you now in a modern or in one 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.250
 after first saying anti of a fat lake and in a classic interior afterwards 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:16.480
 you actually at home all you say today to more but not for many 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.669
 something of stones that people who are very classic are modern elements 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:23.349
 and add the classic elements in a more modern way 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:27.849
 but in principle if you can give a couple to sit and one for the classic 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:28.849
 country yes 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.239
 well before what are all these lamps with the habit of being the first 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.149
 training day but definitely from the streams but I will be on the table again something quite 

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:37.959
 interesting and it was the same 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.309
 this is one and also had no lighting 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:44.439
 and the one that lasts 8 weeks or terrace the light bulb 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:48.290
 and it is especially very very hot in backfield not to touch because then it becomes 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.469
 that fat and hamilton does it no longer comes into action 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:53.189
 it gives something 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.709
 and with regard to its bright light and what is so beautiful is that you can sail 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.119
 shares 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:02.789
 and you use that especially when reading about the rose yes 

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:05.529
 that much applied in a commercial 

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:07.340
 peacock is not lighting yet 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.000
 the tub never in my life that is very nice to keep reading because of it 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.579
 just whole 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.169
 gives clear and good light afterwards I was last seen in Amsterdam to pick them up 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.199
 no lamps on the wall in total 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.639
 but when the entire restaurant is full of different colors of light 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.090
 December owner then started as very cheerful as the afternoon with the Rossoneri 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.100
 drawn and sector offers but sets the tires projected and at the end of 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.850
 the evening it was purple or green or blue it is also giving information 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.500
 determined 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.230
 4 yes absolutely 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.810
 while the real latest trend has a let it lie with very small lights 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.040
 which is also expected a lot in the car behind the own people 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.059
 the lamps of cars 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:48.930
 it will last a very long time 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.349
 are what prices now say in the purchase 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:55.240
 but you can actually sit his bikes you can do very nice things with that is 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.059
 get a very many colors cancan 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:01.529
 and with that you can highlight a beautiful roadster on a tire 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:05.870
 what that same tendency yes that his mother flares power wires atmosphere to come 

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:06.680
 through 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.880
 well i have prepared in the attack his story want to thank you very much 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.860
 she comes to the school to inquire about the game
