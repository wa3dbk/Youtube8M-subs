apart<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:58.199> will<00:00:58.379> cause<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.949> spiral<00:00:59.640> to

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
apart and that will cause the spiral to

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.740 
apart and that will cause the spiral to
roll<00:01:00.030> across<00:01:00.899> itself<00:01:02.149> just<00:01:03.149> kind<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.420> let<00:01:03.629> that

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
roll across itself just kind of let that

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.600 
roll across itself just kind of let that
roll<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.110> try<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.320> keep<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.559> neat<00:01:04.769> pinch<00:01:05.460> it

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
roll and try to keep it neat pinch it

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.070 
roll and try to keep it neat pinch it
down<00:01:05.640> with<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> thumb<00:01:07.430> simple<00:01:08.430> half<00:01:08.640> hitch

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
down with the thumb simple half hitch

down with the thumb simple half hitch
over<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:11.610> closed<00:01:11.939> side<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> loop<00:01:13.729> pull

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
over the closed side of the loop pull

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.999 
over the closed side of the loop pull
that<00:01:14.880> tight<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.450> will<00:01:15.540> secure<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.530> spiral

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
that tight that will secure the spiral

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.679 
that tight that will secure the spiral
now<00:01:17.729> we're<00:01:17.880> going<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.030> do<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> same<00:01:18.420> thing

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
now we're going to do the same thing

over the far side of the loop simple
half<00:01:21.240> hitch<00:01:22.610> pull<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.790> tight<00:01:24.290> and<00:01:26.030> now<00:01:27.030> we're

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
half hitch pull that tight and now we're

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.670 
half hitch pull that tight and now we're
going<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.600> do<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> half<00:01:28.020> hitch<00:01:28.259> over<00:01:28.650> both

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
going to do a half hitch over both

going to do a half hitch over both
lengths<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> loop<00:01:32.100> there<00:01:33.890> now<00:01:34.890> we're

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
lengths of the loop there now we're

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.109 
lengths of the loop there now we're
going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> pull<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.369> tight<00:01:37.820> have<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.939> say<00:01:39.090> I

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
going to pull that tight have to say I

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.660 
going to pull that tight have to say I
was<00:01:39.299> scared<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:39.960> knot<00:01:40.140> for<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.500> while<00:01:41.340> but

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
was scared of this knot for a while but

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.190 
was scared of this knot for a while but
after<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.970> few<00:01:42.150> brake<00:01:42.390> offs<00:01:42.630> last<00:01:42.960> year<00:01:43.170> I

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
after a few brake offs last year I

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.280 
after a few brake offs last year I
decided<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.860> try<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.340> tackle<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:46.079> not

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
decided to try to tackle it and it's not

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.880 
decided to try to tackle it and it's not
as<00:01:46.470> not<00:01:46.979> as<00:01:47.009> hard<00:01:47.340> as<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:48.380> first<00:01:49.380> appears<00:01:49.619> um

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
as not as hard as it first appears um

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.020 
as not as hard as it first appears um
pretty<00:01:52.890> simple<00:01:53.250> once<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.610> do<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.880> couple

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
pretty simple once you do it a couple

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.990 
pretty simple once you do it a couple
times<00:01:54.240> you'll<00:01:55.079> have<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.350> down<00:01:55.439> pat<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.000> great

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
times you'll have it down pat and great

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.350 
times you'll have it down pat and great
double<00:01:57.329> line<00:01:57.799> not<00:01:58.799> there<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.960> break<00:02:00.960> strength

earlier<00:02:14.880> where<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.330> response<00:02:15.690> engine<00:02:16.140> that

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
earlier where to response engine that

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.370 
earlier where to response engine that
spiraled<00:02:16.680> down<00:02:16.770> just<00:02:16.980> compacting<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.550> spiral

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
spiraled down just compacting the spiral

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.220 
spiraled down just compacting the spiral
just<00:02:19.380> compact<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:19.950> as<00:02:20.069> much<00:02:20.250> as<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.430> can<00:02:20.790> and

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
just compact that as much as you can and

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.180 
just compact that as much as you can and
then<00:02:22.230> once<00:02:22.440> that's<00:02:22.620> done<00:02:22.800> we're<00:02:23.040> going<00:02:23.130> to

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
then once that's done we're going to

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.850 
then once that's done we're going to
pull<00:02:23.400> apart<00:02:23.520> on<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.810> loop<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.560> stay<00:02:25.800> in

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
pull apart on the loop and the stay in

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.420 
pull apart on the loop and the stay in
the<00:02:26.010> end<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.490> just<00:02:27.709> stretch<00:02:28.709> those<00:02:28.980> apart<00:02:29.310> and

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
the end and just stretch those apart and

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.980 
the end and just stretch those apart and
you'll<00:02:29.550> see<00:02:29.730> how<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.000> kind<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.270> rolls<00:02:30.510> back

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
you'll see how it kind of rolls back

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
you'll see how it kind of rolls back
over<00:02:31.350> itself<00:02:31.680> as<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.040> pull<00:02:32.370> those<00:02:32.580> apart

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
over itself as you pull those apart

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.559 
over itself as you pull those apart
right<00:02:35.010> here<00:02:35.070> we're<00:02:35.820> going<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:35.970> just<00:02:36.209> grab<00:02:36.540> a

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
right here we're going to just grab a

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.830 
right here we're going to just grab a
hold<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.959> that<00:02:37.020> so<00:02:37.319> it<00:02:37.380> doesn't<00:02:37.410> unwind<00:02:38.840> and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
hold of that so it doesn't unwind and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.660 
hold of that so it doesn't unwind and
this<00:02:40.380> is<00:02:40.530> where<00:02:40.680> we<00:02:40.770> place<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.130> half<00:02:41.340> half

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
this is where we place the half half

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.600 
this is where we place the half half
hitch<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.390> first<00:02:42.600> half<00:02:42.810> hitch<00:02:46.459> we're<00:02:47.459> just

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
hitch the first half hitch we're just

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.670

going<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.760> put<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:47.940> half<00:02:48.150> hitch<00:02:48.330> there<00:02:48.750> half

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
going to put a half hitch there half

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.470 
going to put a half hitch there half
hitch<00:02:49.890> on<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.130> other<00:02:50.280> side<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:51.120> half<00:02:51.330> inch
