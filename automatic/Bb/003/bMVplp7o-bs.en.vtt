00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
year right now I don't really need to

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.440 
year right now I don't really need to
have<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.650> on<00:03:28.769> I<00:03:29.190> actually<00:03:29.850> turned<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.329> off

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
have it on I actually turned it off

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.880 
have it on I actually turned it off
around<00:03:30.750> noon<00:03:31.109> it's<00:03:31.410> been<00:03:31.560> on<00:03:31.650> for<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.829> last

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
around noon it's been on for the last

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.539 
around noon it's been on for the last
six<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.400> half<00:03:32.430> hours<00:03:33.049> and<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:35.100> temperature

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
six and a half hours and the temperature

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.660 
six and a half hours and the temperature
has<00:03:35.970> only<00:03:36.150> dropped<00:03:36.510> about<00:03:36.690> four<00:03:37.230> degrees<00:03:37.670> in

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
has only dropped about four degrees in

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.569 
has only dropped about four degrees in
that<00:03:38.880> time<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:39.870> it's<00:03:40.260> actually<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.250> places

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
that time so it's actually the places

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:42.979 
that time so it's actually the places
seem<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.819> hold<00:03:41.940> it<00:03:42.090> so<00:03:42.390> I<00:03:42.420> temperature<00:03:42.780> pretty

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
seem to hold it so I temperature pretty

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.130 
seem to hold it so I temperature pretty
well<00:03:43.170> provided<00:03:43.890> there's<00:03:44.040> no<00:03:44.220> wind<00:03:45.109> but<00:03:46.109> I

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
well provided there's no wind but I

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.330 
well provided there's no wind but I
turned<00:03:46.470> out<00:03:46.590> right<00:03:46.739> now<00:03:46.829> so<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.040> can<00:03:47.190> see<00:03:47.280> what

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
turned out right now so you can see what

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.550 
turned out right now so you can see what
it<00:03:47.459> looks<00:03:47.579> like<00:03:47.670> beneath<00:03:48.600> that<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:49.079> have<00:03:49.319> a

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
it looks like beneath that I have a

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.740 
it looks like beneath that I have a
garbage<00:03:49.920> pail<00:03:50.069> and<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:52.760> radiator<00:03:53.760> here<00:03:54.090> which<00:03:54.389> I

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
garbage pail and a radiator here which I

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.650 
garbage pail and a radiator here which I
haven't<00:03:55.350> had<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.590> use<00:03:55.829> in<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.280> few<00:03:56.489> months<00:03:56.700> so<00:03:57.359> I

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
haven't had to use in a few months so I

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.930 
haven't had to use in a few months so I
had<00:03:58.200> that<00:03:58.410> for<00:03:58.620> auxiliary<00:03:58.950> heating<00:03:59.340> when<00:03:59.910> I

had that for auxiliary heating when I

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.970 
had that for auxiliary heating when I
realized<00:04:00.329> how<00:04:00.450> much<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.720> costs<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.290> run<00:04:01.650> I

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
realized how much it costs to run I

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.550 
realized how much it costs to run I
turned<00:04:02.519> it<00:04:02.639> off<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:03.060> realized<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:03.959> with<00:04:04.260> the
