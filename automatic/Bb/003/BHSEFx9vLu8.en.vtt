00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.600
 trick of common makeup of lips 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:47.770

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.770
 red mars ok and some magazines 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.879

 red lips 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.290

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.850
 I have a red lipstick I love 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.860
 invest I say is mac and put a little bit 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.930
 more clearly than some others that I have 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.020
 bought but I like it a lot because it's 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.900
 like red mate and I love it but 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.090
 I also have one that I left in my 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.280
 monterrey house I have not bought it again 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.440

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.149
 mark jordan yes yes also red mars and 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.670
 the truth does not ask for anything nothing but 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.490
 This may last a little longer than the 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.590
 another I said good that it is like also to 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.030
 I dedicate myself to make up many times 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.580
 I have to invest a little more of my 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.440
 cosmetics but this one if you can not 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.200
 buy this because I'm going to spend 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.020
 so much money in a lipstick that was the 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.610
 red do not put it every day you can 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.530
 convert a little bit into one more 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.259
 economic and it's not good to be jordan at 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.110
 that is mate mate means that it is 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.179
 no shine that also put proud 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.049
 both are fashionable but in this 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:05.049
 I will use one that is mate 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.049
 good 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.370
 first I'm going to outline my lips 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.700
 the father of the delineated is very large 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.440
 after line inside and you see more 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.870
 chiquitos and chiles delgadito is like 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.140
 I the one above have thin I can 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.330
 fill out and move this with the 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.459
 bigger lip but I liked it 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.330
 much the big mouth smell it the 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.520
 revealed outside 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.850
 because it's good to delineate it when we use 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.120
 these kinds of colors that are very very 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.900
 dark or a dark coffee by adif 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.360
 I'm dark a racing because we have a lot 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.910
 so I told you we went out 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.010
 we were walking suddenly there are tenés bars 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.080
 that you take copies with him walks the 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.650
 mission the plane to the office and that now 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.390
 together and now you get that heat and what 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.940
 thing that you shake and we all put on 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.520
 hot you touch yourself like 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.200
 you do not have this condition and it is that they are 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.560
 the stairs arrive the work credited 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:13.060
 doubts then this gets hot and 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:16.690
 this is cream and our lips have 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.640
 cracks have cracks this as it 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.200
 Flame and we're going to drip suddenly 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.200
 from the lines of the map 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.220
 all run and do not be pretty as your 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.840
 color is that you have much pigment 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:36.560
 you come to saná boat, you do not have any more 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.420
 or naranjito here in the little shore 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.800
 they may not know either so bad but I 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.459
 I'm seeing what I wanted then 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:47.150
 better let's delineate so that this is 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:51.189
 come and do not get our lipstick or what 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.189
 I'm going to start today to delineate 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.209
 being this barbarian 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:18.180

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.889

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:39.280
 Martin Diaz Senate 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:42.740
 martínez and the old lady that's good 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.190
 Medellin and now I'm going to make up my 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.680
 lips but I'm going to make up the arrivals 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.259
 of delineated basilea iii but because 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.810
 It can be said that if you do not run then 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:56.110
 but keep in mind that this also 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.479
 another color is not exactly this color 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.720
 it does not matter what I'm going to cover then 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:07.070
 I want reinforcement is reinforced 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:11.110
 if it has entered well then it is more 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.110
 protected from the man thing 28 king 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:42.760
 good that they manage to see on my lips that 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:46.090
 such is not the same color in all the dawn 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.130
 it looks like that dark and in red I 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.550
 If I see it, nothing else, I'm seeing it 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.110
 here and I do notice it here is the 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.760
 effect that I wanted to create in the month 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.350
 lips or that you do not always have to 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:01.169
 serve us colors either to put a 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:05.659
 coffee and in a what's it called 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:10.110
 a coffee and purple inside as not true 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:12.810
 never was up put a little cup of coffee 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:16.289
 clarito but to cover everything that does not 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.849
 be the delineated yes or that is to leave 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.310
 Well, if I told him that they have to go 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:23.090
 blurring the colors here I have one 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:26.729
 stronger it gets clearer and inside 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.590
 It seems that I ate a pint no longer 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:31.439
 it seems that nothing on our part like that 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.659
 like that more lit and it's the effect 

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:36.120
 that I want to create my lips 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:38.490

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.469
 very fashionable White looks pretty 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.439
 the brunettes to the pretty ones are 

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:45.569
 colors that are very scary to wear 

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:47.729
 very afraid very afraid typical 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:50.099
 Robert someone who is going to force you 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:53.670
 criticize seeing a friend or acquaintance 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:57.490
 today in your office or a boy 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:07:00.190
 the lips there is tv 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:03.130
 and current because the truth so 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:05.070
 but if you say you feel you from 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:09.810
 beautiful 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:11.520
