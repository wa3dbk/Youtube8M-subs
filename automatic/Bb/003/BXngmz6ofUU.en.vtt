00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
start off with the handling test

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.600 
start off with the handling test
snarling<00:00:31.800> up<00:00:31.920> between<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.369> out<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
handling would be between these two we

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.810 
handling would be between these two we
notice<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.620> MSA<00:00:37.890> my<00:00:38.070> brother<00:00:38.370> had<00:00:38.610> better

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
notice that MSA my brother had better

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.569 
notice that MSA my brother had better
handling<00:00:39.600> than<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.899> table<00:00:40.050> 6x6<00:00:40.559> which<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.040> saw

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
handling than the table 6x6 which I saw

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.180 
handling than the table 6x6 which I saw
I<00:00:41.610> was<00:00:41.700> expecting<00:00:42.120> though<00:00:42.210> because<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.690> I

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
I was expecting though because of that I

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.619 
I was expecting though because of that I
expected<00:00:44.190> at<00:00:44.309> normal<00:00:44.579> Dobbs<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.879> here<00:00:45.030> food<00:00:45.450> or

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
expected at normal Dobbs to here food or

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.069 
expected at normal Dobbs to here food or
SUV<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.789> be<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> same<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.750> see<00:00:48.870> pretty

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
SUV to be the same you can see pretty

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.470 
SUV to be the same you can see pretty
much<00:00:49.200> easy<00:00:49.410> waving<00:00:50.039> through<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.329> out<00:00:51.390> of

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
much easy waving through in and out of

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.990 
much easy waving through in and out of
these<00:00:51.570> obstacles<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.280> u-turn<00:00:53.610> was

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
these obstacles and in the u-turn was

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.779 
these obstacles and in the u-turn was
perfectly<00:00:54.570> close<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.010> apex<00:00:56.520> or<00:00:56.670> that

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
perfectly close to that apex or that

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.229 
perfectly close to that apex or that
obstacle<00:00:57.180> sorry<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.949> going<00:00:58.949> back<00:00:59.239> pretty

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
obstacle sorry and going back pretty

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.750 
obstacle sorry and going back pretty
much<00:01:00.329> managing<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.260> come<00:01:02.070> back<00:01:02.219> quicker<00:01:02.489> than

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
much managing to come back quicker than

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.810 
much managing to come back quicker than
the<00:01:02.940> double<00:01:03.329> 6x6<00:01:03.930> by<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> second<00:01:05.280> actually<00:01:05.610> so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the double 6x6 by a second actually so

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.789 
the double 6x6 by a second actually so
your<00:01:06.750> handling<00:01:06.990> was<00:01:07.140> significantly<00:01:07.619> better

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
your handling was significantly better

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.980 
your handling was significantly better
on<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.490> normal<00:01:08.880> table<00:01:09.090> stuff<00:01:09.330> 4-door<00:01:09.840> version

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
on the normal table stuff 4-door version

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.010 
on the normal table stuff 4-door version
so<00:01:10.590> for<00:01:11.549> top<00:01:11.670> speed<00:01:11.939> you'd<00:01:12.240> expect<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.840> table

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
so for top speed you'd expect the table

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.130 
so for top speed you'd expect the table
6<00:01:13.290> by<00:01:13.409> 6<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.950> dominate<00:01:14.909> here<00:01:15.119> which<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.600> does<00:01:15.810> so

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
6 by 6 to dominate here which it does so

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.609 
6 by 6 to dominate here which it does so
currently<00:01:17.070> 1-1<00:01:17.610> that's<00:01:18.619> rather

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
currently 1-1 that's rather

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.910 
currently 1-1 that's rather
self-explanatory<00:01:20.600> now<00:01:21.600> moving<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.619> towards

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
self-explanatory now moving on towards

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.190 
self-explanatory now moving on towards
the<00:01:22.979> brake<00:01:23.189> test<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.270> another

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the brake test this is just a another

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.600 
the brake test this is just a another
one<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.470> those<00:01:25.530> things<00:01:25.860> where<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.310> sort<00:01:26.580> of

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
one of those things where you sort of

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.480 
one of those things where you sort of
test<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.479> both<00:01:28.470> these<00:01:28.710> hit<00:01:28.950> wolf<00:01:29.159> gear<00:01:29.400> and

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
test it both these hit wolf gear and

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.310 
test it both these hit wolf gear and
completely<00:01:30.000> full<00:01:30.299> stop<00:01:30.630> there<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.049> have<00:01:31.200> it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
completely full stop there you have it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.800 
completely full stop there you have it

dubstep version sort of the normal
version<00:01:34.140> gets<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.890> point<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.640> obviously<00:01:35.939> for

is what it is you really wanted to use

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.319 
is what it is you really wanted to use
the<00:01:43.829> normal<00:01:44.009> Dobbs<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.520> go<00:01:44.700> up<00:01:44.790> hills<00:01:45.000> with<00:01:45.180> it

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
the normal Dobbs to go up hills with it

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.660 
the normal Dobbs to go up hills with it
quiet<00:01:46.229> 3-2<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:46.799> damage<00:01:47.130> test<00:01:47.399> this

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
quiet 3-2 but damage test this

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.700

you'd<00:01:51.720> expect<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.290> take<00:01:52.530> more<00:01:52.710> damage<00:01:52.860> in

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189
