00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:11.780 
it's apparent uselessness is compounded

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790

thing<00:04:19.020> I<00:04:19.229> have<00:04:19.349> to<00:04:19.470> say<00:04:19.620> about<00:04:19.739> it<00:04:19.890> is<00:04:20.099> that<00:04:20.250> at

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
thing I have to say about it is that at

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.250 
thing I have to say about it is that at
the<00:04:20.580> very<00:04:20.609> least<00:04:21.090> it's<00:04:21.299> a<00:04:21.390> passive<00:04:21.840> item<00:04:22.109> and

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
the very least it's a passive item and

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.510 
the very least it's a passive item and
thus<00:04:22.410> doesn't<00:04:22.860> occupy<00:04:23.130> the

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
thus doesn't occupy the

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.369 
thus doesn't occupy the
all<00:04:23.580> important<00:04:24.030> spacebar<00:04:24.479> slot<00:04:24.750> however

all important spacebar slot however
apart<00:04:25.800> from<00:04:25.889> that<00:04:26.129> I<00:04:26.310> don't<00:04:26.580> see<00:04:26.699> much<00:04:26.849> reason

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
apart from that I don't see much reason

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.610 
apart from that I don't see much reason
for<00:04:27.180> cat-o'-nine-tails<00:04:27.509> to<00:04:28.080> be<00:04:28.199> better<00:04:28.440> than

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
what I think is the fourth worst item in

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:33.800 
what I think is the fourth worst item in

that giving him the poop as a starting

that giving him the poop as a starting
item<00:04:37.889> just<00:04:38.099> seems<00:04:38.310> cruel<00:04:38.669> there's<00:04:39.330> exactly

two<00:04:39.840> positive<00:04:40.500> things<00:04:40.680> I<00:04:40.800> can<00:04:40.919> say<00:04:41.039> about<00:04:41.159> the

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
two positive things I can say about the
