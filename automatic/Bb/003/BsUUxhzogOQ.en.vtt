this is a blue all sided stud piece and

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.070 
this is a blue all sided stud piece and
then<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.760> take<00:00:21.029> one<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.769> these<00:00:22.769> pieces

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
then you take one of these pieces

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.750 
then you take one of these pieces
t-shaped

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
t-shaped

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.500 
t-shaped
thing<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.900> turn<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:29.160> way<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:30.359> it's

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
thing and you turn this this way so it's

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.160 
thing and you turn this this way so it's
facing<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.880> stick<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.120> into<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
facing you like that stick this into the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.660 
facing you like that stick this into the
bottom<00:00:34.530> like<00:00:35.370> that

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
bottom like that

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.080 
bottom like that
then<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.809> take<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.500> heavily<00:00:38.489> shortened

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
then you take a heavily shortened

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:47.330 
then you take a heavily shortened
modified<00:00:40.219> rod<00:00:42.770> right<00:00:43.770> here<00:00:44.180> that<00:00:46.340> you'll

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
modified rod right here that you'll

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.799 
modified rod right here that you'll
figure<00:00:47.579> out<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.940> length<00:00:48.090> as<00:00:48.300> soon<00:00:48.450> as<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.629> put

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
figure out the length as soon as I put

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.790 
figure out the length as soon as I put
on<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> body<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:50.460> stick<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.530> same<00:00:52.530> with<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
on the body so stick it on same with the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.459 
on the body so stick it on same with the
other<00:00:52.920> side<00:00:53.219> we<00:00:53.460> need<00:00:53.550> two<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.730> these<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.899> stick

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
other side we need two of these so stick

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.680 
other side we need two of these so stick
em<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.100> when<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.699> when<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.180> finish<00:00:57.510> it

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
em in and it when you when you finish it

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.860 
em in and it when you when you finish it
it<00:00:57.780> should<00:00:58.050> be<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.410> length<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.190> normal<00:00:59.219> rod

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
it should be this length of a normal rod

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.660 
it should be this length of a normal rod
like<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.559> sand<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.070> edges<00:01:02.250> to

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
like that and you can sand the edges to

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.880 
like that and you can sand the edges to
make<00:01:02.699> them<00:01:02.850> look<00:01:03.120> straight<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.660> nice<00:01:03.840> if<00:01:04.379> you

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
make them look straight and nice if you

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.179 
make them look straight and nice if you
cut<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.280> out<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:05.840> diagonally<00:01:06.840> your<00:01:07.189> squish

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
cut it out like diagonally your squish

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.039 
cut it out like diagonally your squish
or<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.640> gets<00:01:08.729> squished<00:01:09.090> when<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.479> cut<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.810> like

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
or it gets squished when you cut it like

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:10.969 
or it gets squished when you cut it like
that

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
that

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.950 
that

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
notice this is my first figure with

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.900 
notice this is my first figure with
decals<00:04:02.049> so<00:04:02.440> you<00:04:03.040> decal<00:04:03.700> here<00:04:04.299> and<00:04:04.510> here<00:04:05.410> and

is made from a plate from the
snowspeeder<00:04:21.250> set<00:04:21.789> that<00:04:22.659> helps<00:04:22.960> it<00:04:23.110> slide<00:04:23.349> on

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
snowspeeder set that helps it slide on

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.010
