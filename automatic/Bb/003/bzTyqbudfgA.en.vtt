of things that go into this I am sorry
so<00:00:48.329> yeah<00:00:48.840> let's<00:00:49.559> started<00:00:49.829> off<00:00:49.950> very<00:00:50.129> simple

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
so yeah let's started off very simple

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.510 
so yeah let's started off very simple
paper<00:00:50.969> gunpowder<00:00:51.480> equals<00:00:52.170> firework<00:00:52.829> rocket

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
paper gunpowder equals firework rocket

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.439 
paper gunpowder equals firework rocket
firework<00:00:54.120> rocket<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:55.079> very<00:00:56.070> plain<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.730> shoots

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
firework rocket is very plain it shoots

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.529 
firework rocket is very plain it shoots
up<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.800> goes<00:00:59.340> away<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.730> one<00:00:59.879> second<00:01:00.329> so

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
up and it goes away in one second so

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.330 
up and it goes away in one second so
that's<00:01:00.780> pretty<00:01:01.050> boring<00:01:01.289> that's<00:01:02.129> all<00:01:02.250> they

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
that's pretty boring that's all they

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.160 
that's pretty boring that's all they
would<00:01:02.399> I'd<00:01:02.579> be<00:01:02.699> pretty<00:01:02.820> disappointed<00:01:03.110> but<00:01:04.110> if

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
would I'd be pretty disappointed but if

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.530 
would I'd be pretty disappointed but if
you<00:01:04.260> put<00:01:04.379> three<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.549> firework<00:01:06.240> start<00:01:06.479> at

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
you put three and a firework start at

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.420 
you put three and a firework start at
the<00:01:06.600> top<00:01:06.799> which<00:01:07.799> I'll<00:01:07.920> show<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.100> how<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.220> craft

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
the top which I'll show you how to craft

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.969 
the top which I'll show you how to craft
in<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.640> second<00:01:09.290> you<00:01:10.290> come<00:01:10.439> up<00:01:10.560> with<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.740> little

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
in a second you come up with a little

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.039 
in a second you come up with a little
bit<00:01:11.070> more<00:01:11.220> exciting<00:01:11.610> they<00:01:12.180> go<00:01:12.299> up<00:01:12.450> further<00:01:12.689> and

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
bit more exciting they go up further and

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.600 
bit more exciting they go up further and
they<00:01:13.409> spin<00:01:13.680> all<00:01:13.770> around<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.070> little<00:01:14.159> bit<00:01:14.400> but

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
they spin all around a little bit but

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.880 
they spin all around a little bit but
still<00:01:14.970> not<00:01:15.210> much<00:01:15.330> no<00:01:15.750> color<00:01:16.110> nothing<00:01:16.619> like

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
still not much no color nothing like

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.219 
still not much no color nothing like
that<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.369> that's<00:01:17.490> not<00:01:17.970> excited<00:01:18.750> very<00:01:19.020> much

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
that so that's not excited very much

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:19.490 
that so that's not excited very much
either

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
either

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.499 
either
but<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.369> gets<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.670> little<00:01:20.759> bit<00:01:20.909> more<00:01:21.119> exciting

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
but this gets a little bit more exciting

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.899 
but this gets a little bit more exciting
here<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.979> those<00:01:22.979> firework<00:01:23.460> stars<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.790> was

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
here and those firework stars I was

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:24.410 
here and those firework stars I was
telling<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.210> about

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
telling you about

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.170 
telling you about
they<00:01:24.960> one<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.310> craft<00:01:26.580> them<00:01:26.820> different

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
they one you can craft them different

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.910 
they one you can craft them different
colors<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.960> would<00:01:28.080> expect<00:01:28.229> they

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
colors and as you would expect they

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.109 
colors and as you would expect they
create<00:01:29.250> different<00:01:29.610> color<00:01:29.850> fireworks<00:01:31.009> so<00:01:32.119> for

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
create different color fireworks so for

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.499 
create different color fireworks so for
example<00:01:33.570> grey<00:01:33.900> plus<00:01:34.460> gunpowder<00:01:35.460> equals<00:01:36.030> great

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
example grey plus gunpowder equals great

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.420 
example grey plus gunpowder equals great
start

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
start

at the same time

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.470 
at the same time
as<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.489> can<00:02:11.610> see<00:02:11.790> here<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.459> bam<00:02:14.459> let's<00:02:15.239> say<00:02:15.359> it

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
as you can see here and bam let's say it

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.030 
as you can see here and bam let's say it
starts<00:02:15.510> out<00:02:15.870> as<00:02:15.989> green<00:02:16.260> then<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.590> goes<00:02:16.769> down<00:02:16.799> to

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
starts out as green then it goes down to

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.819 
starts out as green then it goes down to
magenta<00:02:17.549> and<00:02:18.000> orange<00:02:18.900> as<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.379> can<00:02:19.530> see<00:02:19.650> there

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
magenta and orange as you can see there

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.440 
magenta and orange as you can see there
so<00:02:19.859> the<00:02:20.010> middlemost<00:02:20.519> is<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:20.969> color<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.359> you

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
so the middlemost is the color that you

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.039 
so the middlemost is the color that you
put<00:02:21.629> in<00:02:21.750> last<00:02:22.099> and<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:24.180> yeah<00:02:24.390> colors<00:02:24.810> now<00:02:24.989> you

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
put in last and so yeah colors now you

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.330 
put in last and so yeah colors now you
have<00:02:25.260> different<00:02:25.500> bars<00:02:25.650> now<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:25.950> can<00:02:26.159> make

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
have different bars now you can make

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.890 
have different bars now you can make
four<00:02:26.640> colors<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.120> can<00:02:27.239> put<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.659> into

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
four colors and you can put that into

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.330 
four colors and you can put that into
there<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.379> then<00:02:28.500> you'd<00:02:28.620> have<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.769> magenta<00:02:29.189> one

simple<00:03:13.019> but<00:03:13.680> lime<00:03:13.919> +<00:03:14.669> lime<00:03:15.569> color<00:03:15.810> gunpowder

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
simple but lime + lime color gunpowder

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.149 
simple but lime + lime color gunpowder
equals<00:03:16.859> lime<00:03:17.250> large<00:03:17.849> ball<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.599> I<00:03:19.530> think<00:03:20.129> I

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
equals lime large ball and I think I

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.860 
equals lime large ball and I think I
have<00:03:20.280> an<00:03:20.340> example<00:03:20.639> here<00:03:20.790> yeah<00:03:21.209> right<00:03:21.479> here

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
have an example here yeah right here

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.110 
have an example here yeah right here
here's<00:03:22.109> what<00:03:22.379> that<00:03:22.409> looks<00:03:22.680> like

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
here's what that looks like

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.699 
here's what that looks like
BAM<00:03:24.120> large<00:03:24.569> ball<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:25.079> lot<00:03:25.229> bigger<00:03:25.440> than<00:03:25.620> the

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
BAM large ball a lot bigger than the

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.000 
BAM large ball a lot bigger than the
smaller<00:03:26.010> one<00:03:26.250> as<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.549> can<00:03:26.699> see<00:03:26.909> in<00:03:27.209> comparison

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
smaller one as you can see in comparison

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.670 
smaller one as you can see in comparison
so<00:03:29.419> yeah<00:03:30.419> that's<00:03:30.720> what<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.019> fire<00:03:31.169> charge<00:03:31.470> does

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
so yeah that's what the fire charge does

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.089 
so yeah that's what the fire charge does
now<00:03:32.099> if<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.459> interchange<00:03:32.729> this<00:03:33.209> with<00:03:33.269> here<00:03:33.840> I

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
now if I interchange this with here I

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.640 
now if I interchange this with here I
would<00:03:35.099> come<00:03:35.879> out<00:03:36.180> with<00:03:36.419> this<00:03:36.959> here<00:03:37.319> it's<00:03:37.530> a

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
would come out with this here it's a

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.890 
would come out with this here it's a
lime<00:03:37.829> I<00:03:38.129> know<00:03:38.639> it<00:03:38.849> doesn't<00:03:39.090> go<00:03:39.150> directly<00:03:39.449> to

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
lime I know it doesn't go directly to

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.289 
lime I know it doesn't go directly to
the<00:03:40.069> firework<00:03:41.069> but<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.370> just<00:03:41.639> felt<00:03:41.819> like<00:03:41.849> doing

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
the firework but I just felt like doing

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.490 
the firework but I just felt like doing
this<00:03:42.389> for<00:03:42.599> demonstration<00:03:43.169> purposes

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
this for demonstration purposes

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.319 
this for demonstration purposes
obviously<00:03:43.949> you<00:03:44.040> come<00:03:44.190> up<00:03:44.310> with<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.489> a<00:03:45.530> starred

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
obviously you come up with a a starred

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.309 
obviously you come up with a a starred
green<00:03:48.329> ball<00:03:48.569> then<00:03:48.780> you'd<00:03:48.900> have<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.079> mix<00:03:49.199> that

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
green ball then you'd have to mix that

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.050 
green ball then you'd have to mix that
with<00:03:49.379> paper<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:50.010> gunpowder<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.669> grade<00:03:50.879> this

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
with paper and gunpowder to grade this

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.869 
with paper and gunpowder to grade this
but<00:03:51.359> like<00:03:51.599> I<00:03:51.720> said<00:03:51.840> I'm<00:03:51.930> simplifying<00:03:52.199> it<00:03:52.500> here

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
but like I said I'm simplifying it here

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:57.409 
but like I said I'm simplifying it here
so<00:03:53.879> yeah<00:03:54.599> star-shaped<00:03:55.290> looks<00:03:56.220> like<00:03:56.790> it<00:03:56.939> sounds

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
so yeah star-shaped looks like it sounds

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:02.240 
so yeah star-shaped looks like it sounds
no<00:03:57.689> tricks<00:03:58.079> there<00:03:58.319> a<00:03:58.560> star<00:03:59.489> yes<00:04:00.180> a<00:04:00.389> 1<00:04:01.019> 2<00:04:01.319> 3<00:04:01.620> I

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
no tricks there a star yes a 1 2 3 I

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.140 
no tricks there a star yes a 1 2 3 I
can't<00:04:02.909> count

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
can't count

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.050 
can't count
I<00:04:03.180> think<00:04:03.359> it's<00:04:03.449> a<00:04:03.479> 6<00:04:03.689> 6<00:04:04.260> tie<00:04:04.349> to<00:04:04.530> start<00:04:04.889> 1<00:04:05.430> 2<00:04:05.729> 3

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
I think it's a 6 6 tie to start 1 2 3

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.800 
I think it's a 6 6 tie to start 1 2 3
but<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.900> six-sided<00:04:07.439> star<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:08.659> so<00:04:09.659> yeah

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
but the six-sided star and so yeah

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.610 
but the six-sided star and so yeah
that's<00:04:10.019> cool<00:04:11.209> now<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.750> feather<00:04:12.959> if<00:04:13.229> you<00:04:13.379> put

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
that's cool now the feather if you put

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.499 
that's cool now the feather if you put
the<00:04:13.680> feather<00:04:13.859> there<00:04:14.209> instead<00:04:15.209> of<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.359> fire

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:15.509 
the feather there instead of the fire

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:17.120 
the feather there instead of the fire
charge<00:04:15.810> of<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.049> goal<00:04:16.199> you<00:04:16.470> get<00:04:16.799> with<00:04:16.889> a<00:04:16.919> burst

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
charge of the goal you get with a burst

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.979 
charge of the goal you get with a burst
in<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.820> first<00:04:18.060> it's<00:04:18.570> hard<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.810> tell<00:04:18.930> the

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
in the first it's hard to tell the

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.089 
in the first it's hard to tell the
difference<00:04:19.079> a<00:04:19.320> little<00:04:19.500> bit<00:04:19.620> I'll<00:04:19.829> put<00:04:20.070> a

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
difference a little bit I'll put a

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.390 
difference a little bit I'll put a
little<00:04:20.219> comparison<00:04:20.579> here

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
little comparison here

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.730 
little comparison here
so<00:04:21.549> it<00:04:22.000> spreads<00:04:22.389> out<00:04:22.510> a<00:04:22.570> little<00:04:22.750> bit<00:04:22.900> more<00:04:23.080> in<00:04:23.470> a

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
so it spreads out a little bit more in a

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.110 
so it spreads out a little bit more in a
little<00:04:23.830> bit<00:04:24.040> less<00:04:24.400> uniform<00:04:25.000> and<00:04:25.830> yeah<00:04:26.830> so<00:04:27.400> not

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
little bit less uniform and yeah so not

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.909 
little bit less uniform and yeah so not
the<00:04:28.240> coolest<00:04:28.419> but<00:04:28.840> you<00:04:28.990> know<00:04:29.110> it<00:04:29.560> gives<00:04:29.740> a

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
the coolest but you know it gives a

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.159 
the coolest but you know it gives a
little<00:04:30.070> bit<00:04:30.250> variety<00:04:30.630> so<00:04:31.630> take<00:04:31.810> out<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.020> first

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
little bit variety so take out the first

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.219 
little bit variety so take out the first
and<00:04:32.639> then<00:04:33.639> you<00:04:33.970> put<00:04:34.150> in<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.540> glow<00:04:34.780> desk<00:04:35.050> which

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
and then you put in the glow desk which

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.300 
and then you put in the glow desk which
is<00:04:35.260> pretty<00:04:35.560> cool<00:04:35.740> it<00:04:35.860> gives<00:04:36.010> it<00:04:36.100> a<00:04:36.130> little

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
is pretty cool it gives it a little

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.189 
is pretty cool it gives it a little
twinkle<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:36.880> it<00:04:37.000> Twinkle<00:04:37.780> Twinkle<00:04:37.900> Twinkle

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
twinkle to it Twinkle Twinkle Twinkle

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.689 
twinkle to it Twinkle Twinkle Twinkle
and<00:04:39.300> fan<00:04:40.500> say<00:04:41.500> after<00:04:41.979> works<00:04:42.160> the<00:04:42.310> kind<00:04:42.520> of<00:04:42.580> it's

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
and fan say after works the kind of it's

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.189 
and fan say after works the kind of it's
kinda<00:04:42.880> like<00:04:42.970> those<00:04:43.090> fireworks<00:04:43.750> that<00:04:43.990> they

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
kinda like those fireworks that they

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.200 
kinda like those fireworks that they
used<00:04:44.530> actually<00:04:45.010> in<00:04:45.220> like<00:04:45.490> real<00:04:45.699> life<00:04:45.940> and<00:04:46.150> they

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
used actually in like real life and they

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.750 
used actually in like real life and they
fall<00:04:46.449> and<00:04:46.570> lick<00:04:46.840> crackle<00:04:47.229> which<00:04:48.130> it's<00:04:48.550> pretty

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
fall and lick crackle which it's pretty

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.870 
fall and lick crackle which it's pretty
cool<00:04:49.380> so<00:04:50.380> yeah<00:04:50.500> now<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:50.740> diamond<00:04:51.190> this<00:04:51.729> is

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
cool so yeah now the diamond this is

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.550 
cool so yeah now the diamond this is
kind<00:04:52.090> of<00:04:52.150> a<00:04:52.240> waste<00:04:52.479> I<00:04:52.690> really<00:04:53.050> don't<00:04:53.199> see<00:04:53.290> the

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
kind of a waste I really don't see the

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.529 
kind of a waste I really don't see the
purpose<00:04:53.800> of<00:04:54.039> this<00:04:54.130> one<00:04:54.340> to<00:04:54.550> be<00:04:54.699> perfectly

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
purpose of this one to be perfectly

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.210 
purpose of this one to be perfectly
honest<00:04:55.870> with<00:04:55.990> you<00:04:56.199> it<00:04:56.710> leaves<00:04:56.889> a<00:04:56.979> little<00:04:57.070> bit

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
honest with you it leaves a little bit

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.010 
honest with you it leaves a little bit
of<00:04:57.310> a<00:04:57.400> trail<00:04:57.729> that<00:04:58.030> it<00:04:58.120> trails<00:04:58.389> down<00:04:58.660> a<00:04:58.720> little

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
of a trail that it trails down a little

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.730 
of a trail that it trails down a little
bit<00:04:59.110> like<00:05:00.180> okay<00:05:01.180> there's<00:05:01.419> that<00:05:01.690> and<00:05:02.020> then

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
bit like okay there's that and then
