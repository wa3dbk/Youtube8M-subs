there's<00:01:16.470> only<00:01:16.649> one<00:01:17.369> animatronic<00:01:18.149> left<00:01:18.390> which

when<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.039> game<00:01:56.250> was<00:01:56.280> first<00:01:56.789> published<00:01:57.239> on

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
when the game was first published on

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.960 
when the game was first published on
greenlight<00:01:58.080> we<00:01:58.590> saw<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.429> in<00:01:59.610> one<00:01:59.819> of<00:01:59.910> the

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
greenlight we saw that in one of the

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.869 
greenlight we saw that in one of the
images<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.660> fan<00:02:01.020> was<00:02:01.500> not<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:02.099> the<00:02:02.310> desk<00:02:02.550> and

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:02.879 
images the fan was not on the desk and

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:06.589 
images the fan was not on the desk and
was<00:02:03.300> actually<00:02:03.629> moving<00:02:04.590> that's<00:02:05.399> right<00:02:05.789> moving

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:06.599 
was actually moving that's right moving

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:10.550 
was actually moving that's right moving
so<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.530> led<00:02:07.800> me<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:08.160> think<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.810> hmm<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
so this led me to think that hmm is the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.470 
so this led me to think that hmm is the
