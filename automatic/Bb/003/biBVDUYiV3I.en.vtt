00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.110
 and looks controversial starting again played 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.910
 knows that the problem of 2014 only left the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.160
 I wish in the past but this year I'm 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.320
 coming with everything said no value yes 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.180
 to win this match with fifa this year 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.060
 Let's go back to being the best game of 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.800
 world's best sea soccer game 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.500
 Brazil is because the people are going to play 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.720
 you're just a graphic beauty then 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.910
 the guy named adam barth who is 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.759
 responsible for you only in the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.040
 europa he said the following play fifa is 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.719
 the same as playing ping pong the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.510
 logic was greatly exaggerated in this 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.820
 comparison even to draw attention to 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.129
 his statements but what he said 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.100
 even his pronouncement to the fifa nation 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.200
 loc in a more real football game and 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.910
 can do the best against attack 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.160
 thing you can not do 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.620
 fifa real way into something else in fifa 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.610
 according to the slaughter that I want for you 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.320
 okay you said 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.359
 in fifa everything revolves around marking 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.609
 goals they want was concentrated 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.100
 just score goals and that's such a thing 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.900
 bad but many people just want to score 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.150
 goals of nothing else in real life 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.920
 for example with the ball in the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.200
 midfield which is to make the ball 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.880
 reach the close in this case or another 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.979
 that will try to block the lines of 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.930
 pass and defense is to press and everything 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.119
 so this makes it difficult 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.729
 passing the ball and rarely a step 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.159
 direct would be successful is exactly 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.500
 what happens in fifa or who 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.810
 is talking here about fifa the deal is a 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.119
 little easier and no respect 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.460
 exactly what is real from a game of 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.229
 football and a green propeller wants to do 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.560
 most real business possible 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.759
 the biggest simulation even in football what 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.700
 they say they found none 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.439
 Difficulty for you only is that the game 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.060
 is very truncated because 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.700
 because it is a game really changed 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.220
 difficult then they want so much to leave 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.240
 this real gameplay how much to leave 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.430
 funny 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.590
 then this will be the proposal is to 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.939
 you only want 2015 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.090
 remembering that it will be released at the end 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.790
