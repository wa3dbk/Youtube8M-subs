manipulate to go around because it is

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.479 
manipulate to go around because it is
one<00:00:26.619> of<00:00:26.770> the<00:00:26.860> smallest<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:29.220> getting<00:00:30.220> easy

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
one of the smallest so getting easy

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.819 
one of the smallest so getting easy
routes<00:00:30.849> on<00:00:31.029> this<00:00:31.239> is<00:00:31.480> not<00:00:31.899> simple<00:00:32.380> but<00:00:32.559> you

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
routes on this is not simple but you

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.130 
routes on this is not simple but you
know<00:00:32.920> what<00:00:33.100> I<00:00:33.280> think<00:00:33.340> and<00:00:34.180> I<00:00:34.600> think<00:00:34.630> spider

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
know what I think and I think spider

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.530 
know what I think and I think spider
bite<00:00:35.410> likely<00:00:36.190> would<00:00:36.340> take<00:00:36.550> a<00:00:36.790> very<00:00:36.940> similar

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
bite likely would take a very similar

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.200 
bite likely would take a very similar
approach<00:00:38.050> because<00:00:38.440> his<00:00:38.739> rush<00:00:39.100> series<00:00:39.579> kind<00:00:40.090> of

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
approach because his rush series kind of

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.850 
approach because his rush series kind of
uses<00:00:40.540> the<00:00:40.660> same<00:00:40.810> mentality<00:00:41.050> and<00:00:41.530> it<00:00:41.650> comes

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
uses the same mentality and it comes

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.960 
uses the same mentality and it comes
this<00:00:42.040> way<00:00:42.280> almost<00:00:42.790> exactly<00:00:43.360> what<00:00:43.570> I<00:00:43.600> did<00:00:43.900> there

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
this way almost exactly what I did there

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.940 
this way almost exactly what I did there
would<00:00:45.970> be<00:00:46.000> his<00:00:46.390> like<00:00:46.750> back<00:00:47.020> in<00:00:47.050> the<00:00:47.230> days<00:00:47.920> when

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
would be his like back in the days when

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.710 
would be his like back in the days when
we<00:00:48.280> played<00:00:48.580> this<00:00:48.700> hardcore<00:00:49.120> from<00:00:49.360> search<00:00:49.600> and

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
we played this hardcore from search and

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.000 
we played this hardcore from search and
destroy<00:00:49.900> because<00:00:50.380> that's<00:00:50.530> usually<00:00:50.680> what<00:00:50.980> we

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
destroy because that's usually what we

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.819 
destroy because that's usually what we
predominantly<00:00:51.370> played<00:00:51.940> so<00:00:52.540> all<00:00:53.170> of<00:00:53.230> my<00:00:53.560> roots

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
predominantly played so all of my roots

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.420 
predominantly played so all of my roots
that<00:00:54.070> I<00:00:54.130> follow<00:00:54.690> usually<00:00:55.690> sort<00:00:56.560> of<00:00:56.650> mirror

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
that I follow usually sort of mirror

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.740 
that I follow usually sort of mirror
image<00:00:58.320> search<00:00:59.320> and<00:00:59.500> destroy<00:00:59.620> games<00:01:00.750> except

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
image search and destroy games except
