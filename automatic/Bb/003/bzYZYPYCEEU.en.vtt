00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.980
 now 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.840
 all people prefer hunter nature friends the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.500
 trend from the other video that is 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.840
 a so-called pocket oven that finds 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.080
 what to do and do it in the bag or 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.670
 an approach says sleeping bag and now 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.790
 then stay outside for a bit longer 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.530
 So when you sit or were 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.110
 Although we were really cold, so 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.879
 He knows that and I will search 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.470
 Of course, still some 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.699
 alternatives and there I have now 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.699
 again found a little something 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.979
 then as the next alternative with me 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.590
 again the chemistry club opened and that 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.920
 it is from the company it is there 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:19.119
 multi warmer they do not react 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.190
 Oxygen costs, however, and euro 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.420
 so there are so-called multi 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.190
 warmer all over China or tangible 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.929
 Then there are the so-called hand warmers 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:34.210
 breakfast respect and then there's here 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.099
 even the so-called foot warmers that comes 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.440
 to be in the title race 

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:41.920
 one submits to it the the 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.599
 old six hours to quermann twelve 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.190
 hours 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:49.929
 the multiplayer 20 hours 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:54.090
 I will share the parts with you tonight 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:02:00.099
 start trying using as an alternative 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:02.619
 and then let's see if they are here 

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:06.420
 is now 100 percent natural 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.420
 enveloped you and odorless 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.660
 Dispose of with household waste after use 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.250
 Let's look at the composition of iron 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:23.610
 Powder water activated carbon for Nico song 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.610
 and salt is a chemical reaction 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.989
 until now so at first glance must 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:35.340
 Now look at what to do 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:39.810
 of course a lot of plastic ecologically 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.519
 is too valuable because just keep it 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.970
 It is also on the plastic 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:47.129
 again the question if the stuff in there 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.659
 that's all right 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.579
 you see, inform me now 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:56.150
 Let me have you today 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:56.150
 take along and test chemistry club 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:10.299
 my people and if you have that now 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:14.440
 tests half past three to set and then 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:21.849
 things will open up, how nice 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:32.650
 Officials will be what we have now 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:35.799
 comfortable with two out of the packaging 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:41.220
 rausgeholt and now they would have 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.220
 Actually react 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.450
 no kneading shakes well today 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.450
 attack
