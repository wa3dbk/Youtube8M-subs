over<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.239> past<00:02:51.830> you<00:02:52.830> know<00:02:52.860> year<00:02:53.849> I<00:02:53.880> suppose

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
over the past you know year I suppose

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.830 
over the past you know year I suppose
it's<00:02:55.709> very<00:02:56.040> affordable<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.849> very<00:02:57.209> guitarist

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
it's very affordable a very guitarist

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.110 
it's very affordable a very guitarist
friendly<00:02:58.319> loop<00:02:58.560> pedal<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:59.069> was<00:02:59.250> designed

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
friendly loop pedal that was designed

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.630 
friendly loop pedal that was designed
just<00:03:00.540> for<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:01.050> for<00:03:01.349> guitar<00:03:01.680> players<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:02.580> it

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
just for that for guitar players so it

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.580 
just for that for guitar players so it
couldn't<00:03:02.970> be<00:03:03.030> more<00:03:03.239> simpler<00:03:03.750> has<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.260> very

electronic<00:03:09.600> mini<00:03:09.780> pedals<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:11.310> has<00:03:11.489> one<00:03:12.000> dial

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
electronic mini pedals it has one dial

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.780 
electronic mini pedals it has one dial
for<00:03:12.930> loop<00:03:13.140> level<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.709> sets<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.340> volume

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
for loop level so that sets the volume

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.809 
for loop level so that sets the volume
of<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.209> loops<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:16.440> are<00:03:16.560> played<00:03:16.799> back<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.580> it

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
of the loops that are played back and it

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.050 
of the loops that are played back and it
has<00:03:17.970> one<00:03:18.330> foot<00:03:18.989> switch<00:03:19.230> for<00:03:20.220> all<00:03:20.370> operations

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
has one foot switch for all operations

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.850 
has one foot switch for all operations
so<00:03:21.690> how<00:03:22.080> this<00:03:22.260> works

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
so how this works

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.449 
so how this works
let<00:03:23.849> me<00:03:23.940> just<00:03:24.120> sorry<00:03:24.540> let<00:03:25.080> me<00:03:25.170> just<00:03:25.380> delete<00:03:26.190> the

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
let me just sorry let me just delete the

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.309 
let me just sorry let me just delete the
loop<00:03:26.640> that<00:03:26.819> I<00:03:26.880> just<00:03:27.120> recorded<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:27.840> did<00:03:28.110> that

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
loop that I just recorded and I did that

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.229 
loop that I just recorded and I did that
by<00:03:28.590> just<00:03:28.799> pressing<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.519> holding<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:30.000> foot

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
by just pressing and holding the foot

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.690 
by just pressing and holding the foot
switch<00:03:30.480> for<00:03:30.780> two<00:03:30.900> seconds<00:03:31.319> then<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.069> LED

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
switch for two seconds then the LED

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.770 
switch for two seconds then the LED
blinks<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:35.130> pedal<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:36.360> loop<00:03:36.569> that

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
blinks and the the pedal the loop that

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.849 
blinks and the the pedal the loop that
was<00:03:36.870> stored<00:03:37.290> inside<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:37.920> pedal<00:03:38.190> is<00:03:38.310> now<00:03:38.519> gone

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
was stored inside the pedal is now gone

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.770 
was stored inside the pedal is now gone
what<00:03:40.859> you<00:03:41.010> do<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:42.090> start<00:03:42.299> playing<00:03:42.630> and

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
what you do is you start playing and

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.390 
what you do is you start playing and
then<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:43.019> just<00:03:43.230> hit<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.530> foot<00:03:43.739> switch<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.310> as

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
then you just hit the foot switch and as

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.849 
then you just hit the foot switch and as
you<00:03:44.489> can<00:03:44.609> see<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.910> red<00:03:45.120> LED<00:03:45.150> comes<00:03:45.930> on<00:03:46.140> so<00:03:46.709> that

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
you can see the red LED comes on so that

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.759 
you can see the red LED comes on so that
means<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.430> ditto<00:03:47.640> is<00:03:47.850> in<00:03:48.030> record<00:03:48.450> mode<00:03:48.769> and

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
means the ditto is in record mode and

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.830 
means the ditto is in record mode and
then<00:03:49.920> you<00:03:49.950> just<00:03:50.280> play<00:03:50.489> something<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.269> then<00:03:51.600> as

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
then you just play something and then as

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.569 
then you just play something and then as
soon<00:03:51.989> as<00:03:52.109> you<00:03:52.230> hit<00:03:52.350> it<00:03:52.500> again<00:03:52.579> it

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
soon as you hit it again it

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.289 
soon as you hit it again it
automatically<00:03:54.569> starts<00:03:54.959> playback<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:56.400> then

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
automatically starts playback and then

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.780 
automatically starts playback and then
the<00:03:58.079> loop<00:03:58.319> that<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:58.799> record<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.340> plays<00:03:59.579> back

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
the loop that you record it plays back

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.550 
the loop that you record it plays back
infinitely<00:04:00.420> now<00:04:00.989> if<00:04:01.200> you<00:04:01.350> pay<00:04:01.500> close

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
infinitely now if you pay close

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.470 
infinitely now if you pay close
attention<00:04:01.859> to<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.400> LED<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:02.910> see<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.359> it

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
attention to the LED you see that it

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.270 
attention to the LED you see that it
just<00:04:03.510> blinked<00:04:04.200> that<00:04:04.380> means<00:04:04.590> that<00:04:04.829> was<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.100> end

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
just blinked that means that was the end

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.129 
just blinked that means that was the end
of<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.670> loop<00:04:05.880> and<00:04:06.090> then<00:04:06.480> it's<00:04:06.660> repeating

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
of the loop and then it's repeating

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.650 
of the loop and then it's repeating
itself<00:04:07.470> right<00:04:07.769> so<00:04:08.010> if<00:04:08.549> I<00:04:08.700> want<00:04:09.329> to<00:04:09.450> add<00:04:09.630> another

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
itself right so if I want to add another

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.780 
itself right so if I want to add another
part<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.620> commit<00:04:10.920> that<00:04:10.950> to<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.430> loop<00:04:11.639> would

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
part and commit that to the loop would

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.509 
part and commit that to the loop would
just<00:04:11.970> hit<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.269> foot<00:04:12.480> switch<00:04:13.010> again<00:04:14.010> goes<00:04:14.280> back

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
just hit the foot switch again goes back

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.250 
just hit the foot switch again goes back
into<00:04:14.730> record<00:04:15.269> mode<00:04:15.329> and<00:04:15.660> I<00:04:15.720> can<00:04:15.870> play<00:04:16.079> the

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
into record mode and I can play the

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.640 
into record mode and I can play the
second<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:17.880> second<00:04:18.269> part<00:04:18.690> until<00:04:19.320> that's

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
second the second part until that's

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.710 
second the second part until that's
finished<00:04:20.160> and<00:04:20.430> hit<00:04:20.579> it<00:04:20.669> again<00:04:20.729> if<00:04:21.209> I<00:04:21.329> just<00:04:21.359> want

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
finished and hit it again if I just want

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.990 
finished and hit it again if I just want
to<00:04:21.810> play<00:04:22.079> over<00:04:22.350> it<00:04:22.440> if<00:04:22.860> I<00:04:22.979> want<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:23.310> stop<00:04:23.700> the

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
to play over it if I want to stop the

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.360 
to play over it if I want to stop the
ditto<00:04:24.180> looper<00:04:24.270> I<00:04:24.600> just<00:04:24.840> double<00:04:25.830> tap<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.220> foot

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
ditto looper I just double tap the foot

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.480 
ditto looper I just double tap the foot
switch<00:04:26.580> like<00:04:27.479> that<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.860> then<00:04:28.979> you<00:04:29.100> can<00:04:29.280> see

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
switch like that and then you can see

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.100 
switch like that and then you can see
the<00:04:29.669> LEDs<00:04:30.030> blinking<00:04:30.539> that<00:04:30.690> means<00:04:30.750> that

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
the LEDs blinking that means that
