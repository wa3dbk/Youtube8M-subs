00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello I'm Ricardo the deputy director and one of 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.540
 the founding partners gave town this the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.150
 america house so they can make me a 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.630
 interview and then we will make a table 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.850
 debate responds to the need as 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.500
 we have said enough times 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.170
 the anger that caused us to have to 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.020
 buy many magazines or read in many 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.250
 different ways to find everything 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.400
 that interested us so we decided 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.750
 create a product that will combine 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.310
 everything we liked 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.770
 very different people 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.580
 We shared some tastes and others did not and 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.910
 combine in a single volume let's say everything 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.140
 what we liked if in fact I think of 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.180
 moment is working I do not know how much 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.390
 will work but the new means that 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.070
 are emerging that we are emerging 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.780
 it's going relatively well inside 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.329
 how are the circumstances 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.829
 us in our Mongolian area in 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.989
 libero humor in yorokobu sport 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.550
 many many means are coming out 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.280
 although some have been longer but 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.320
 they have more visibility and it is that I 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.700
 I think this is the inside of everything 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.490
 that there are so many great media so 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.649
 similar in the background and with so many 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.479
 servitudes to economic powers and 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.170
 politicians the small media 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.790
 independent are those 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.000
 those that offer something new and those that 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.229
 We move forward as units 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.860
 I will not speak for journalists 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.690
 why not 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.820
 we do not want to give journalism lessons 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.020
 and many of us some yes but 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.330
 many others we are not journalists 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.880
 neither 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.400
 What I think is that regarding the 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.780
 ask what are you doing to me concretely 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.070
 the value that a 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.050
 journalist whatever you want to dedicate to 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.060
 journalism that comes from another world is 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.520
 yours 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.070
 its value let's say its writing and its 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.800
 talent not your resume not your 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.240
 curriculum or its degree or why 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.800
 Information sources are easy to 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.120
 get relatively or whatever 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.120
 news is on twitter at 10 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.670
 seconds and almost all the stories 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.530
 they are already counted they have been counted a thousand 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.690
 Sometimes what can be offered is to have 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.150
 a 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.060
 a different style when telling 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.680
 those stories yes yes indeed we 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.110
 We consider our collaborators 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.150
 and authors are more important than 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.770
 we, although they are part of us 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.050
 but we as you will have seen 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.450
 let's say the controls of yota not yet 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.840
 we want to be very much, nor are we very 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.610
 we are not very aware and we are not 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.990
 we are not very public like others 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.810
 directors of great media who are very 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.700
 protagonists we think that the 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.180
 author the contributor the photographer the 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.010
 The cartoonist the viÃ±etista are those who 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.570
 what are they that have to have the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.500
 protagonism and who are the brand other 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.820
 thing is that certain means we have some 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.320
 characteristics that attract certain 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.600
 authors and other media but 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.580
 basically we believe that the one that yes the 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.580
 the author is the brand itself
