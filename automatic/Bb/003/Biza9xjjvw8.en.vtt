00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
what I want to see you know because I

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.729 
what I want to see you know because I
was<00:03:13.000> with<00:03:14.000> when<00:03:14.209> I<00:03:14.359> read<00:03:14.569> this<00:03:14.690> I<00:03:14.750> read<00:03:15.560> that

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
was with when I read this I read that

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.789 
was with when I read this I read that
less<00:03:16.069> less<00:03:17.060> than<00:03:17.329> ten<00:03:17.660> percent<00:03:18.170> of<00:03:18.349> sports

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
less less than ten percent of sports

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.940 
less less than ten percent of sports
bike<00:03:19.069> owners<00:03:19.609> actually<00:03:20.359> take<00:03:21.200> their<00:03:21.440> their

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
bike owners actually take their their

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.470
