 Ural machine installation Rhodian 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.929
 engine piston went bankrupt on the seventh 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:29.179
 cylinder here it shows how 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:32.480
 burned out in half and must have split like 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:37.640
 gradually began to burn out 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:41.910
 gradually the white smoke from our nozzle 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:47.430
 so these claps and such gradually 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.070
 more more began to go smoke and right here 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.550
 even cotton wool cracks 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.760
 hard to see here or crack 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.730
 scratched 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.579
 and such a piston is a defective 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.239
 what I do not know here it is piston kbk 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.660
 written clearly and on other pistons no 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.660
 bk 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:23.520
 the beginning of the cycle and where are you 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:30.000
 238 I disassembled the head for the engine 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:32.490
 knew how many hours in often a half 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.210
 this head took off the pallet took off now 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:46.170
 piston pull out and change everything will be in 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:52.640
 chocolate here and so we just have 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.640
 sneaks load toy toy only 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:04.560
 playground in the woods straight repair do any 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:11.070
 conditions like we will see later 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:13.820
 shot nothing is visible of course nothing 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.820
 there is no interesting 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.269
 Luke 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.980
 such situation 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.430
 for close- ups
