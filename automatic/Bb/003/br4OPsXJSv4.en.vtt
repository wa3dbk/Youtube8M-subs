00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.340 
get into it so you have to have three
cards<00:00:13.860> one<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.460> says<00:00:14.610> other<00:00:15.059> one<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:15.960> this

cards one it says other one this is this
this<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.890> back<00:00:17.539> so<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:18.900> have<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.289> one<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
this is back so you have to one the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.170 
this is back so you have to one the
specific<00:00:20.550> order<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:21.029> other<00:00:21.890> this<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.430> best<00:00:23.670> so

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
specific order of other this the best so

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.370 
specific order of other this the best so
when<00:00:24.269> you're<00:00:24.390> fooling<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.779> over<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.170> don't

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
when you're fooling it over you don't

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.720 
when you're fooling it over you don't
tell<00:00:25.859> them<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.010> have<00:00:30.590> and<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.340> double

iftikhar the two other and this so I

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.830
