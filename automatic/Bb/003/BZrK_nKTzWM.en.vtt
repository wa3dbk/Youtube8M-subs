for we get into the structure were

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.050 
for we get into the structure were
thinking<00:01:59.040> about<00:01:59.219> and<00:02:01.700> it's<00:02:02.700> an<00:02:02.790> interesting

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
thinking about and it's an interesting

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.080 
thinking about and it's an interesting
version<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.750> because<00:02:04.100> at<00:02:05.100> black<00:02:05.729> can<00:02:05.909> use

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
version of it because at black can use

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.670 
version of it because at black can use
the<00:02:06.299> default<00:02:06.630> graph<00:02:06.840> for<00:02:06.990> his<00:02:07.079> Bishop<00:02:07.380> but<00:02:07.560> not

for his night is night would maybe be

at all but Tim I think the problem from

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
this Queen four to Brooks and then

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:33.010 
this Queen four to Brooks and then
pushes<00:05:32.120> pawn<00:05:32.300> in<00:05:32.450> the<00:05:32.510> middle<00:05:32.690> of<00:05:32.750> the<00:05:32.840> board

so<00:05:33.169> that<00:05:33.200> you<00:05:33.320> five<00:05:33.530> is<00:05:33.710> very<00:05:33.950> logical<00:05:35.110> t5i

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
so that you five is very logical t5i

so this night looks very well placed but

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.570 
so this night looks very well placed but
the<00:05:42.440> problem<00:05:42.650> is<00:05:42.740> that<00:05:42.950> it's<00:05:43.160> ultimately

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
the problem is that it's ultimately

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.200 
the problem is that it's ultimately
vulnerable<00:05:44.090> to<00:05:44.350> to<00:05:45.350> Bishop<00:05:45.650> b2<00:05:46.120> attacking<00:05:47.120> the

night and the night doesn't really have
