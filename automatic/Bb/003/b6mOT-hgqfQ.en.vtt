you can get a day well hit a big roll a
razor<00:02:02.920> blade<00:02:03.159> knife<00:02:03.900> and<00:02:04.900> you'll<00:02:05.439> need<00:02:05.590> some

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
razor blade knife and you'll need some

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.830 
razor blade knife and you'll need some
glue<00:02:06.070> you<00:02:06.670> can<00:02:06.700> use<00:02:06.790> regular<00:02:07.090> Elmer's<00:02:07.479> glue

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840

glue you can use regular Elmer's glue
rubber<00:02:08.170> cement<00:02:08.380> will<00:02:08.679> probably<00:02:09.009> also<00:02:09.130> work

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
rubber cement will probably also work

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.400 
rubber cement will probably also work
very<00:02:09.519> well<00:02:09.880> that's<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.810> only<00:02:10.929> thing<00:02:11.170> we<00:02:11.290> need

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
very well that's the only thing we need

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.840 
very well that's the only thing we need
-<00:02:11.590> one<00:02:11.830> thing<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:12.040> can<00:02:12.190> do<00:02:12.280> after<00:02:12.459> you<00:02:12.640> get<00:02:12.760> the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
- one thing you can do after you get the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.910 
- one thing you can do after you get the
whole<00:02:13.000> project<00:02:13.209> done<00:02:13.540> or<00:02:14.170> before<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.620> start

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
whole project done or before you start

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.380 
whole project done or before you start
really<00:02:15.190> probably<00:02:15.519> you<00:02:15.610> could<00:02:15.760> paint<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.150> black

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
really probably you could paint it black

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.270 
really probably you could paint it black
so<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:17.079> box<00:02:17.290> itself<00:02:17.709> will<00:02:17.920> actually

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
so that the box itself will actually

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.819 
so that the box itself will actually
absorb<00:02:18.370> more<00:02:18.880> heat<00:02:19.079> but<00:02:20.079> you<00:02:20.140> don't<00:02:20.320> have<00:02:20.590> to

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
absorb more heat but you don't have to

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.080 
absorb more heat but you don't have to
do<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.100> in<00:02:21.280> order<00:02:21.459> to<00:02:21.549> get<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.910> thing<00:02:22.060> to

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
do that in order to get the thing to

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.880 
do that in order to get the thing to
cook<00:02:22.329> one<00:02:22.989> of<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.170> nice<00:02:23.320> things<00:02:23.560> about<00:02:23.650> these

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
with me for a second and we'll see how

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:12.640 
with me for a second and we'll see how
this<00:06:03.080> works<00:06:03.349> so<00:06:10.060> that's<00:06:11.060> it<00:06:11.270> give<00:06:11.900> this<00:06:12.110> a<00:06:12.349> shot

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
this works so that's it give this a shot

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.770 
this works so that's it give this a shot
because<00:06:13.430> in<00:06:13.819> the<00:06:14.000> time<00:06:14.180> you<00:06:14.330> eat<00:06:14.509> a<00:06:14.539> whole

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
because in the time you eat a whole

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.140 
because in the time you eat a whole
pizza<00:06:14.960> you<00:06:15.650> can<00:06:15.800> make<00:06:15.949> one<00:06:16.190> of<00:06:16.340> these<00:06:16.460> and<00:06:16.699> you

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
pizza you can make one of these and you

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.420
