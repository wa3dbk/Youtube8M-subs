00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.580
 hello very good we are in a new 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.280
 Various video gamers a new analysis 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.279
 this time we bring you the headset 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.650
 to 30 with mix to my included it's about 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.200
 little brother of the astro family but 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.210
 it does not stop being a headset 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.869
 very high quality characteristics 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.180
 interesting for everything for every player 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.950
 let's let's start now to open the 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.489
 product while we comment that it is 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.860
 multiplatform is 7.1 has a micro 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.060
 removable and we will see that the criticisms 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.760
 they are very very very interesting 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.700
 Here we can see the box opens 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.810
 easily and she discovers everything 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.970
 that contains the headset as we see the 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.950
 30 comes completely loose without any 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.170
 placed cable we can place you 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.820
 us the cable manually and in addition 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.730
 includes as we said the mix to the 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.980
 2013 all edition of the 2012 edition 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.050
 it was already discontinued to the right 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.970
 as here we can check are all 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.130
 the all the cables that we are going to go 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.560
 let's go pulling one by one for 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.590
 that you know what it is and what it is 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.100
 is its use to start the headset is 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.549
 the 30 is the small 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.460
 that very comfortable moldable with the headband 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.479
 adjustable also for any kind of 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.640
 head without any problem 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.619
 also includes the mixed as we said 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.170
 which is the main characteristic of 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.850
 all the stars is a device 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.310
 simply exceptional for all types 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.700
 of platforms and to do any 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.140
 type of action that we want here in the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.320
 part in the cable part we are going to 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.729
 center it a little bit we have in first 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.619
 place on the outside that we're 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.750
 taking out the micro that is removable but 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.850
 we already say that it is of very good quality 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.630
 then we will comment a little more but 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.819
 incredible quality in principle we're going 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.369
 to remove the first cable that is the cable 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:03.789
 optical for both for the xbox 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.580
 playstation 3 and pc serves for the 3 here 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.500
 we have a normal jack cable 3 of 3.5 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.750
 to get audio to another platform like this 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.950
 that if we wanted here we have a 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.810
 cable set 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.890
 I'm going to separate it a little so that 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.750
 we can see one by one 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.150
 this is the headphone cable to the mix 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.230
 amp 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:25.019
 and in here we have the usb cable for pc 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.569
 xbox and plate is also and also the 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.890
 cable for controlling the xbox by 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.780
 Last thing we have taken out is the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.750
 adapter to use the helmet without 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.909
 no type of mix so simply 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.500
 directly connecting it to start 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.930
 we'll talk about the sound quality of 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.840
 the headphones is about a sound 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.489
 7.1 if used with mix amp or stereo 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.900
 if you do not use it with him still in 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.120
 either of the two cases a sound of 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.370
 quality does not suffer distortion 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.290
 no type of volume the microphone is 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.930
 removable with great quality also 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.859
 will be among the top five 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.560
 gaming microphones today 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:01.709
 together with his brothers to 40 and 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.720
 50 as we can see below the 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.349
 headset presents a stable below 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.939
 with a velvety contact in our 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.079
 head with what provides a 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:14.790
 community after incredible long uses 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.620
 we are also going to comment a bit on the mix 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.790
 although he is the great the great architect of 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:24.480
 this from this to 30 is an article that you 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.780
 allows you to enjoy your headphones 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.790
 xbox playstation 3 pc lets you take out 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.890
 sounds to another platform like that if 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.659
 we want you to listen to others 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.370
 your companions and we had four stars 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.379
 for example for example we can listen 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.000
 to the four companions connecting the 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.269
 between them without any problem 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.250
 In short, it is a unique device and 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.500
 makes these headphones increase 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.379
 much its quality due to simply 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.569
 because they include this this device that 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.360
 we are seeing at this moment that it is not 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.790
 more than a sound decoder now 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.030
 we will talk about the connection to 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.519
 different platforms first on xbox 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.430
 although it is equivalent for all there will be 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.230
 that connect the removable microphone is 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.609
 will connect to the helmets and then this 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.470
 cable that we are seeing here connects 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:13.200
 in the helmets also the back 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.739
 of the microphone and in the back 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.729
 also from the mix up everything comes 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.989
 included as we then give you the 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.280
 instructions in itself that there is no 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.680
 kind of problem in case you lose 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.120
 also for xbox we are also going to 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.639
 roll the cable a little here for 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.160
 that does not bother in xbox you have to connect 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.050
 the usb cable to give you the power 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.139
 necessary to perform the functions 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.270
 7.1 equalizer settings 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.180
 and therefore the usb is also necessary 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.650
 and here we are seeing here then 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.020
 also here we have the cable for 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.930
 connect it to the command of the xbox that like 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.180
 we know is necessary and also includes 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.240
 the cable and it is placed to the right side 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.460
 of the cable of the helmets and finally 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.700
 you will have to connect the cable of the cable 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.740
 optical this cable serves to get 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.350
 the sound of the game directly to the 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.870
 mix amp and be able to mix them embed 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.889
 with the sound of the players in 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.710
 our helmets 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.409
 now we will go to the playstation3 that 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.210
 we already have it assembled and it's simply 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:16.939
 removing as to whom we point the cable 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.969
 for the control of the xbox has the cable 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:22.159
 optical the usb cable and we connect the 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:23.719
 helmets cable and likewise 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:25.789
 what we have done in the xbox 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:27.439
 simply remove network we have removed the 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:30.430
 cable that goes to the control since in 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:34.480
 Playstation 3 is not necessary 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:37.480
 I started we have three alternatives we can 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.130
 find that our pc has output 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.240
 optics then we can comment on it from 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.250
 same way as the prestige between 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.020
 it would be with that cable but if it is not 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.850
 our tower has no optical output 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.000
 we can also use them only 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.740
 connecting them by usb and helmets to 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.260
 mix am would also work though 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.970
 we would lose some of the options of 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.950
 minsap but function without any type 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.170
 of problem and we also have a third 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.290
 option for pc that is with the adapter 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.790
 which includes what causes us to have 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.010
 two exits that like here we have it 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.020
 simply by connecting the already 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.270
 we could use these these helmets 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.960
 no mixup on the pc without any kind of 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:16.990
 problem as you see is everything very simple 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.030
 and still and it includes a manual like 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.010
 we can see below that does not give 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:24.490
 no kind of doubt and it's very very clear 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:26.260
 for for these situations definitive 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.240
 an earpiece that despite having 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.400
 certain limitations with respect to 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.960
 40 of the 50 especially on the subject of 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.690
 design and wireless system in 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.969
 50 has two common utilities with 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.309
 them as they are 7.1 sound 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:41.829
 of high quality exists to multiplatform 

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:43.809
 and that includes the 2013 mix so it's 

00:06:41.829 --> 00:06:46.539
 a very valid option at a little cost 

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:48.939
 younger than his two brothers conclusion 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:51.159
 that these all about 30 in 

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:52.719
 mixer included let's hope that we have 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:54.519
 clarified a bit how is the system 

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:56.709
 configuration and what utilities can 

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:58.149
 have because it's a bit complicated for 

00:06:56.709 --> 00:07:00.129
 people who do not understand that they do not 

00:06:58.149 --> 00:07:01.479
 know the brand and therefore let's wait 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:02.860
 that you have been useful only 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:04.959
 tell you what is on offer until the 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.339
 next Tuesday and if you are interested in their 

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:08.769
 characteristics you can acquire it in 

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:10.509
 our shop up here the analysis of 

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:11.679
 the 30 with mixon included 

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:13.419
 let's hope you liked it and 

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:15.099
 We hope our next Friday 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:17.279
 new analysis a greeting and until the 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:17.279
 next
