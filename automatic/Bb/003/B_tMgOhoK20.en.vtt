00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.940
 Hello everyone stuck to a new video 

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:07.830
 the 254 demand your favorites you help a 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.460
 lots at this time and well you know 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.990
 what the infamous infamous live flash gave 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.840
 because he asked me for a bad way 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.030
 we could say for the creator no longer 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.699
 you know the controversy that had to be 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.460
 He ended up retiring at the end and others because 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.960
 good cause this cute little bird a 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.449
 how to say it 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.890
 according to its creator because it was very addictive 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.300
 and how good they decided to remove it 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.399
 remember that it generated a quantity of 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.640
 money thanks to the publicity of this 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.649
 game 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.970
 immense I do not remember the figure but it was 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:43.579
 a creepy practice just be for 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.440
 flipar nobody ever understood because he 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.390
 ended up removing some say they were 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.120
 a threat is another because I know 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.739
 because I had such great support already 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.350
 full of money he said then I withdraw it 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.030
 because my balls come out and others do not 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.790
 they have no idea why good 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.190
 basically flavivirus comes back from 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:06.009
 a rather strange way we could 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.009
 say come back in the form of arcade machine 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.450
 on screen as you see 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.360
 the mechanism is quite simple we put 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.400
 the currency things that we go imagine 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.550
 this is going to raise a lot of money where 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.490
 put 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.960
 if I am a lying owner or whatever 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.750
 I highly recommend looking to see where 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.080
 you can buy this because really the 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.910
 people start playing on court 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.880
 basically has a button just 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.770
 what is it with that how would we see the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.780
 bird not like no original game or with 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.270
 a simple button because we make it fly 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.400
 more or we stop pressing it so that it leaves 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.170
 to fly and fall good this is the 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.990
 flap mechanism and see is not necessary 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:53.330
 that what we modify now what 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.740
 let's apply much that we say what 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.230
 let's modify suddenly I get that 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.580
 word because it 's too late already good 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.700
 Now I'm looking at an image of more 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.050
 up close maybe the little button this red 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.360
 and he would have no do not know when 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.720
 I will have put and well basically 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.790
 that the button that is the key 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.990
 then we put the coin I do not know how many 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.710
 attempts are and well basically 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.510
 we can beat two records that of the 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.310
 whenever you carry the machine and the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.590
 day we do not understand these rich for 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.460
 choose me the truth on the screen has 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.460
 about 42 inches 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.130
 in size and nothing else simply this 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.810
 It is not where it ends the notion of 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.940
 throwing or anything like that does not put 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.010
 nothing here but well imagine 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.810
 Whoever wants to buy it does not 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.490
 pretty good for your place I'm going 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.200
 ensuring so good nothing more boys 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.910
 this has been all of nothing see you in 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.420
 the next video until the next up 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.420
 the builder
