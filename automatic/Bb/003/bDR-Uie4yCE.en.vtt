thought you know psychic is stabbed and

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.730 
thought you know psychic is stabbed and
it's<00:01:36.640> super<00:01:36.939> effective<00:01:37.030> on<00:01:37.509> this<00:01:37.689> thing<00:01:37.929> so<00:01:38.200> I

it's super effective on this thing so I

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.999 
it's super effective on this thing so I
know<00:01:38.829> it'll<00:01:39.280> probably<00:01:39.549> do<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:39.759> lot<00:01:39.929> to<00:01:40.929> it<00:01:41.140> but<00:01:41.979> I

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
know it'll probably do a lot to it but I

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.190 
know it'll probably do a lot to it but I
do<00:01:42.100> ended<00:01:42.429> up<00:01:42.520> being<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:42.850> crit<00:01:43.119> but<00:01:44.109> it

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
do ended up being the crit but it

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.849 
do ended up being the crit but it
doesn't<00:01:44.530> kill<00:01:44.770> it<00:01:44.920> so<00:01:45.189> I'm<00:01:45.280> thinking<00:01:45.600> hmm<00:01:46.859> I'm

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859

will<00:02:00.009> be<00:02:00.100> a<00:02:00.130> deadlock<00:02:00.729> so<00:02:01.740> um<00:02:02.740> yeah<00:02:03.249> pretty

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609 
will be a deadlock so um yeah pretty

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:06.419 
will be a deadlock so um yeah pretty
good<00:02:03.700> start<00:02:04.060> for<00:02:04.149> me<00:02:04.359> I<00:02:04.389> guess<00:02:05.130> trick<00:02:06.130> room<00:02:06.249> is

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
good start for me I guess trick room is

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.160 
good start for me I guess trick room is
now<00:02:06.579> down<00:02:06.880> so<00:02:07.240> I'm<00:02:07.600> in<00:02:07.780> a<00:02:07.810> really<00:02:08.050> good

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
now down so I'm in a really good

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.559 
now down so I'm in a really good
position<00:02:08.440> right<00:02:08.830> now<00:02:09.030> hands<00:02:10.030> are<00:02:10.149> bringing<00:02:10.390> a

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
position right now hands are bringing a

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.930 
position right now hands are bringing a
prenup<00:02:11.019> luff<00:02:11.200> now<00:02:11.409> and<00:02:11.920> I<00:02:12.280> don't<00:02:12.370> know<00:02:12.700> what<00:02:12.879> he

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
prenup luff now and I don't know what he

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.699 
prenup luff now and I don't know what he
wants<00:02:13.209> to<00:02:13.239> do<00:02:13.480> with<00:02:13.659> this<00:02:13.810> thing<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.290> end<00:02:14.590> up

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
wants to do with this thing and end up

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:15.930 
wants to do with this thing and end up
going<00:02:15.010> for<00:02:15.159> a<00:02:15.190> grass<00:02:15.459> not

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
going for a grass not

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.880 
going for a grass not
no<00:02:16.000> just<00:02:16.270> do<00:02:16.510> some<00:02:16.810> damage<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.530> thing

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
no just do some damage to that thing

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.440 
no just do some damage to that thing
because<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.250> is<00:02:18.490> super<00:02:18.820> effective<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.300> all

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
because it is super effective and all

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.050 
because it is super effective and all
the<00:02:20.050> ends<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.380> setting<00:02:20.680> up<00:02:20.770> at<00:02:20.920> agility<00:02:21.250> now<00:02:21.640> so

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
the ends of setting up at agility now so

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.730 
the ends of setting up at agility now so
I'm<00:02:22.150> thinking<00:02:22.540> this<00:02:22.660> is<00:02:22.810> like<00:02:22.990> I<00:02:23.170> want<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.560> be<00:02:23.710> a

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
I'm thinking this is like I want to be a

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.460 
I'm thinking this is like I want to be a
pulley<00:02:24.640> on<00:02:24.910> set<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:25.570> know<00:02:25.690> what<00:02:25.960> sub<00:02:26.350> amp

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
pulley on set you know what sub amp

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.800 
pulley on set you know what sub amp
attire<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:26.980> all<00:02:27.130> so<00:02:27.910> he's<00:02:28.270> going<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.480> set<00:02:28.630> up<00:02:28.720> a

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
attire and all so he's going to set up a

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.630 
attire and all so he's going to set up a
sub<00:02:29.080> now<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.650> was<00:02:29.800> probably<00:02:30.040> like<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.340> big

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
sub now and that was probably like a big

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.090 
sub now and that was probably like a big
mistake<00:02:30.820> right<00:02:31.210> there<00:02:31.270> in<00:02:31.720> my<00:02:31.780> opinion<00:02:32.350> he

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
mistake right there in my opinion he

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.890 
mistake right there in my opinion he
should<00:02:33.130> what<00:02:33.910> I<00:02:33.940> think<00:02:34.300> he<00:02:34.450> should<00:02:34.690> have<00:02:34.780> done

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
should what I think he should have done

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.540 
should what I think he should have done
is<00:02:35.170> go<00:02:35.380> for<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.620> surf<00:02:35.800> because<00:02:35.950> he<00:02:36.130> knows<00:02:36.370> i

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
is go for the surf because he knows i

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.060 
is go for the surf because he knows i
cannot<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> kale<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:38.200> thing<00:02:38.470> with<00:02:38.830> grass

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
cannot to a kale that thing with grass

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.600 
cannot to a kale that thing with grass
thought<00:02:39.370> um<00:02:40.740> so<00:02:41.740> he<00:02:42.130> probably<00:02:42.340> should<00:02:42.550> have

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
thought um so he probably should have

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.090 
thought um so he probably should have
wet<00:02:42.760> for<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.000> SERP<00:02:43.240> there<00:02:43.450> because<00:02:44.140> even<00:02:44.530> if

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
wet for the SERP there because even if

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.880 
wet for the SERP there because even if
he<00:02:45.310> does<00:02:45.550> sub<00:02:45.880> down<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.210> his<00:02:46.330> pitaya<00:02:46.750> my<00:02:47.650> lip

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
he does sub down to his pitaya my lip

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.370 
he does sub down to his pitaya my lip
tease<00:02:48.070> will<00:02:48.310> raise<00:02:49.300> my<00:02:49.330> health<00:02:49.810> even<00:02:50.080> higher

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
tease will raise my health even higher

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.170 
tease will raise my health even higher
which<00:02:50.680> gives<00:02:51.010> me<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.220> better<00:02:51.460> chance<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:52.000> live

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
which gives me a better chance to live

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.390 
which gives me a better chance to live
his<00:02:52.500> towards<00:02:53.500> surfwear<00:02:54.100> pitaya<00:02:54.880> so<00:02:55.720> um<00:02:56.400> yeah

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
his towards surfwear pitaya so um yeah

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.580 
his towards surfwear pitaya so um yeah
now<00:02:58.120> I'm<00:02:58.180> going<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.450> get<00:02:58.630> some<00:02:58.960> more<00:02:59.140> lefties

now I'm going to get some more lefties

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.340 
now I'm going to get some more lefties
as<00:02:59.890> I<00:03:00.070> keep<00:03:00.310> breaking<00:03:00.700> his<00:03:00.910> sub<00:03:01.180> now<00:03:02.110> he's

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
as I keep breaking his sub now he's

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.320 
as I keep breaking his sub now he's
going<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.590> go<00:03:02.680> for<00:03:02.890> that<00:03:02.920> surf<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.610> which<00:03:04.030> that

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
going to go for that surf and which that

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.450 
going to go for that surf and which that
+1<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.350> torn<00:03:05.890> all<00:03:06.130> that<00:03:06.460> jazz<00:03:06.790> um<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.950> will<00:03:09.220> do

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
+1 and torn all that jazz um it will do

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.880 
+1 and torn all that jazz um it will do
a<00:03:09.490> lot<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.060> damage<00:03:10.420> but<00:03:10.840> it<00:03:10.900> will<00:03:11.140> not<00:03:11.320> take<00:03:11.650> me

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
a lot of damage but it will not take me

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.400 
a lot of damage but it will not take me
out<00:03:12.070> um<00:03:12.400> that<00:03:13.120> was<00:03:13.300> probably<00:03:13.960> why<00:03:14.200> I<00:03:14.260> think

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
out um that was probably why I think

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.130 
out um that was probably why I think
that<00:03:14.830> he<00:03:15.670> showed<00:03:15.940> why<00:03:16.120> for<00:03:16.300> a<00:03:16.330> surf<00:03:16.660> right<00:03:16.900> to

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
that he showed why for a surf right to

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.699 
that he showed why for a surf right to
begin<00:03:17.560> after<00:03:17.920> he<00:03:18.340> got<00:03:18.520> the<00:03:18.670> agility<00:03:18.940> so<00:03:19.900> that

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
begin after he got the agility so that

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.620 
begin after he got the agility so that
might<00:03:21.340> have<00:03:21.489> screw<00:03:21.820> him<00:03:21.910> over<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:22.180> little<00:03:22.450> bit

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
might have screw him over a little bit

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.070 
might have screw him over a little bit

this thing i think um and just because i

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.750 
this thing i think um and just because i
predict<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.209> trick<00:03:46.660> room<00:03:46.810> coming<00:03:47.080> so<00:03:47.760> he's

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
predict the trick room coming so he's

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.400 
predict the trick room coming so he's
going<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.000> go<00:03:49.120> for<00:03:49.300> his<00:03:49.390> n<00:03:49.510> head<00:03:49.810> but<00:03:50.050> I<00:03:50.230> was

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
going to go for his n head but I was

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.620 
going to go for his n head but I was
actually<00:03:50.560> predicting<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.340> surf<00:03:51.730> but<00:03:52.150> Zen

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
actually predicting the surf but Zen

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.140 
actually predicting the surf but Zen
head<00:03:52.840> but<00:03:53.050> works<00:03:53.320> fine<00:03:53.530> i<00:03:53.709> guess<00:03:53.890> because<00:03:54.820> now

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
head but works fine i guess because now

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.400 
head but works fine i guess because now
he's<00:03:55.360> going<00:03:55.510> to<00:03:55.570> get<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.810> thirty<00:03:56.080> percent

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
he's going to get the thirty percent

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.630 
he's going to get the thirty percent

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:10.089 
going for a calm mind so I'm like hmm

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:12.689 
going for a calm mind so I'm like hmm
does<00:07:11.049> this<00:07:11.259> thing<00:07:11.439> really<00:07:11.679> have<00:07:11.979> slack<00:07:12.249> off<00:07:12.489> or

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:17.079 
he keeps on com-mine and so I'm thinking
