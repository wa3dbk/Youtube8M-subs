00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:23.140
 with the already grow with the other 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:25.760
 Now this time from patients 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.130
 I had waterslide some time ago 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.570
 the kids at android etc 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.160
 flickr therefore ordered with system 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.489
 seized for me 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.250
 yes, another sense came to me 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.850
 have that still open but not with 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:54.320
 the board finished and there he sees himself 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:59.559
 so that better on a few figures not 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.559
 So almost 3 against the knicks I 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:26.869
 read if that is still a costly and 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:31.180
 not so easy yes and no 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.180
 already out of this one 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.960
 I am very curious what this time in 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.880
 three figures each envelope and mine 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.180
 three figures sometimes from the types 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.180
 Out 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:38.160
 So take the first figure out 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:40.080
 must and the third figure yes and that 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.750
 he has the three figures once he has me 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.620
 from white blocks to republic commando 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.720
 helmet of everlight a commando gaga 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.140
 will have sent in the kittens 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.150
 I think that is really very 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.520
 So good for the circumstances 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.010
 how difficult but also about the fans 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.420
 look like that 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.060
 especially if you look at me 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.049
 I know how much that is from you 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.030
 eradicated light vehicles on it too 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.360
 It's really hard to do that 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.540
 can and how you can recognize here 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.799
 by democrats stick on and do not know 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.350
 whether it is clear that it is not 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.950
 so it is more likely to be chosen 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.170
 good and maybe i will give them 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.410
 in the future somehow against 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.060
 bit payment figures send 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.560
 maybe we want it again 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.100
 but on whether he do it again 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.660
 would 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.690
 I am not sure if I am 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.840
 In any case, it would be very 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.790
 nice but I do not know so first 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.930
 Thanks a lot to you now for this 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.940
 figurines here 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:48.750
 becker knows very nicely done then 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:53.190
 commander cody also really very much 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.209
 Well, it is really clear that 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.310
 You can not beatles one hundred percent 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.670
 just like a logo on it 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.560
 do 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.510
 But everyone has to understand that too 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.100
 even two times again a memory 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.049
 full 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.120
 I was at poldi exactly as I said 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.980
 very nicely made on the helmet 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.599
 you always have to realize that 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.210
 are round shapes that is already at 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.100
 paint hard if you still have 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.740
 sticker on it must do so too 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.750
 you do not have to keep it that easy 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.830
 really really good 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.930
 then we made guest appearances has still 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.370
 Fox has his head again 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.010
 Mistress that is because in which the 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.020
 cats goes by andrew as no cell phone 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.310
 it's in there 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.230
 I also foxed myself once before 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.580
 but maybe I'll make another one 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.830
 bright red variant and make it 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:41.210
 as well as from the harry reid hellroten m and 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.370
 then I make two variants of 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.600
 fox and decide afterwards or leave 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.570
 maybe you decide which one 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.660
 is to take the bus in future 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:54.560
 So that's too fox their times the three 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.030
 along with her the 96 of the 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.160
 I have just made of unboxing it 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:03.070
 is quite high nee here 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:07.280
 namely, that you record and so, yes 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.740

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.020
 yet but a great recommendation to him 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:18.320
 So he makes really good boxes 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:20.300
 also makes good max and yes and that would 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.250
 I just say that they are very good 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.970

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:30.410

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.640

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:44.540
