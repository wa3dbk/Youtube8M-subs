00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.070
 hello we are gym battle and good in another 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.940
 We were teaching how to install 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.160
 samsung kies on your computer and this 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.860
 We want you to see how we can 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.380
 synchronize contacts or update 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.650
 our phone for example then 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.240
 good 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.590
 simply what we are going to do is going to 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.720
 be 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.930
 open the samsung kies once you already 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.330
 we had downloaded 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.940
 and once we are opened then what 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.150
 let's do is going to be connect our 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.150
 phone 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.370
 It is always important to connect the 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.470
 phone after having installed 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.750
 samsung kies 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.880
 because those are the ones who already install the 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.860
 drivers required for the 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.860
 computer does not recognize 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.490
 here we have the option that is 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.490
 connecting 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.740
 it will take a little bit and within a 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.720
 moment we will see the model here 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.720
 are they are 55 70 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.350
 and good look at this occasion because I already 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.180
 says directly that there is a new one 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.760
 new version of 5 available for me 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.550
 phone according to the updated 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.580
 directly right now or cancel and 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.680
 then give it later let's give it 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.320
 cancel and good 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.290
 For example, it is still here 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.760
 loading 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.760
 let's let it finish 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.430
 and once it's over then we'll see 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.430
 the menus that appear 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:58.079
 well I will know the first window that 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.520
 is the main equal in this gives us 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.670
 the name of the device that in this 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.990
 case is between 650 and 570 and already here 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.869
 We update appear 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.550
 firmware if I want to click on it I give it and 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.970
 half will update the phone the new 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.250
 version is worth then for example we have 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.560
 here if we have changed phone 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.740
 with models like the samsung galaxy s2 and 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.720
 s3 if this option allows us to 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.690
 let pass the information that 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.420
 we have in another phone either because of 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.890
 example an iphone and copy all the 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.620
 contacts and all the things you have 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.970
 that iphone on the new phone in the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.610
 hanson 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.210
 well then here we have the option to 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.210
 synchronization 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:49.600
 that gives us the power to choose between the three 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:52.870
 options to choose all contacts 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.130
 create the option of the google yahoo blog and 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.930
 windows contacts 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.060
 when you synchronize all contacts 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.769
 the outlook programming and the notes 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.870
 with the outlook or all of this 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.620
 synchronize already with the outlook if it were 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.480
 in this option which we put or in 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.909
 change the schedule and the notes 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.909
 only with the outlook or 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.760
 ah 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.190
 import equally in the copies of 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.290
 security backups that in 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.120
 this case we can make contacts and 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.030
 of favorites according to the phone model 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.610
 samsung that allows us to do more things 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.680
 or less in this model of mine 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.750
 only gives me the option of contacts and 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.050
 favorites but other models like the 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.209
 Galaxy S2 Galaxy S3 already gives you the option 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.730
 to be able to back up 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:50.260
 all of contacts of photographs of 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.260
 videos and so on 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.620
 here we had to make the copy of 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.880
 security and then here below and we 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.880
 appears to recover 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.610
 so initially good that's all and 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.110
 I hope you have helped 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.110
 thank you very much hello gym gym
