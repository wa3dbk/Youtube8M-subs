00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
then we do we do the top which I do a

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.259 
then we do we do the top which I do a
lattice<00:02:27.560> which<00:02:27.830> is<00:02:27.860> just<00:02:28.220> kind<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.820> you<00:02:29.150> know

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
lattice which is just kind of you know

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.540 
lattice which is just kind of you know
weaving<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:29.959> all<00:02:30.080> across<00:02:30.320> and<00:02:30.830> making<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.340> look

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
weaving it all across and making it look

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.550 
weaving it all across and making it look
like<00:02:31.820> a<00:02:32.690> pretty<00:02:33.290> holiday<00:02:34.040> pie<00:02:34.310> my<00:02:34.790> mom<00:02:35.030> does
