00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
career and I think that's really where

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.430 
career and I think that's really where
he<00:00:41.129> felt<00:00:41.370> comfortable<00:00:41.579> with<00:00:42.510> me<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.989> Phelps

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
is not one now you can tell that he's

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.229 
is not one now you can tell that he's
been<00:00:45.809> very<00:00:45.960> guarded<00:00:46.579> by<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> media<00:00:47.940> because

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
been very guarded by the media because

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.000 
been very guarded by the media because
as<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.780> followed<00:00:49.110> his<00:00:49.289> career<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.800> watched

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
as we followed his career and watched

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.369 
as we followed his career and watched
and<00:00:50.250> grow<00:00:50.399> he's<00:00:50.730> had<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> couple<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.449> bumps<00:00:52.170> in

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
and grow he's had a couple of bumps in

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.619 
and grow he's had a couple of bumps in
the<00:00:52.410> road<00:00:52.620> right<00:00:53.010> but<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:54.120> was<00:00:54.300> one<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.480> the
