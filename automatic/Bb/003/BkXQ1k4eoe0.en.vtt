00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.890
This week's drill is meant to counter-balance our series on paddle drills,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.200
just to make sure everyone knows we're not schilling for the paddle companies!

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.440
It's also a reminder that the best paddles are once in the arms, your hands.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.600
By manipulating the shape of your hands, you can learn all kinds of things about your stroke.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.600
And you can even get the feel of wearing paddles without spending a dime.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.160
Why do it?:

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.360
Experimenting with and understanding how you already use your hands is a good thing.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.060
Far too many swimmers don't even think about with what hands are doing.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.940
And they surprise when they discover how small changes and a little bit of focus can improve their feel for the water.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.060
How to do it?:

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.340
We're going to show six quick exercises with focal points you can incorporate in your practices today.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.300
Counting strokes is always good to compare how you're doing.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.300
1. Fist, the old standby.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.980
Close your hands into a very tight fist swim.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.010
You'll be surprised how horrible this feels when you do it right.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.660
You'll lose the feel of connection out front, and feel like your arm is plummeting through the water barely moving you forward at all.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.260
Why is this a good thing?

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.580
Because it forces you to use the rest of your arm to grab the water,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.400
and makes you connect with your forearm biceps and encourages body rotation to connect better.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.080
And it teaches you how to power through the water.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.200
Don't cheat by opening the hand even slightly. Trust us. We know that one.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.180
One way to avoid opening the hand is to hold two pennies in each hand when you swim.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.720
2. Tight. This gives you back some of your hand but not enough to feel really good.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.340
Open your palms and hold all your fingers together very tightly, even your thumb.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.600
Many people actually swim like this and even cup their hand,

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.540
which is about as effective a swimming with the fist, only not so useful.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.260
Again you'll have to learn how to use your entire arm for this one.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.320
3. Relaxed. Ah, doesn't that feel good?

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.320
Just allowing your hands to freely connect with the water, the small spaces between the fingers are now productive,

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.000
capturing the thick water and giving you a larger surface area.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.220
When you start to get a feel for this, watch the fingers wavering or fluttering, as the pull through water.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.260
It just feels nice.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.280
4. Splayed. I like to think that this is palming a basketball, okay, a small basketball.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.980
But if my hands were bigger, this is probably what it would feel like.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.000
While this looks crazy, it feels pretty good and gets you thinking about what you do with your hands.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.740
How each finger can do its part to hook and help you go forward.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.240
Besides with all this hand play going on, this actually stretches out your fingers.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.080
5. Pinky. Well, this could also be called the out sweep.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.760
Thinking of this is a pinky drill, helps you understand what to lead with.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.760
Slow your stroke rate down just a bit and allow your pinky to slide out prior to the catch.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.500
Somehow this simple move makes it easy to engage the muscles needed for high elbow catch.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.120
It also awakens the connection all the way down the side of your body.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.920
Never knew the pinky was so powerful, did you?

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.140
6. Roland. Sure, I could call this thumb.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.800
But after watching Roland's video, how could I really call this anything else?

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.240
Stick at your thumb as you begin the catch, and try not to feel aggressive.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.880
You just feel like you're grabbing onto something.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.440
And for some reason, that grasping instinct also helps you connect the hand and arm to your entire body.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.420
It's almost as if your mind links the grab with the sensation of pulling yourself forward.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.270
And you just start using everything. It's pretty cool.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.340
How to do it really well? (the fine points) :

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.420
Make sure you give each of the hand positions a chance.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.240
Each one will feel weird when you first try it.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.780
But if you give the weird chance, sometimes it starts to feel great.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.960
Try at least a 100 yard of each and really think about what you're feeling.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.840
You could use one per day at the start and then mix them up in a single set when you get the feel for.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.900
Have fun and powers are coming, if you still need them.
