00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
simple so if you were to attach this

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.330 
simple so if you were to attach this
food<00:02:12.239> in<00:02:12.360> tank<00:02:12.599> we<00:02:12.780> have

food in tank we have

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.059

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
for bananas half a cantaloupe a huge

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.949 
for bananas half a cantaloupe a huge
cabbage<00:02:16.370> salad<00:02:16.730> with<00:02:16.940> one<00:02:17.270> head<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.630> cabbage

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
cabbage salad with one head of cabbage

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.440 
cabbage salad with one head of cabbage

two<00:02:21.200> handfuls<00:02:21.560> of<00:02:21.830> cashew<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.280> some<00:02:22.430> honey

two handfuls of cashew and some honey

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.229 
two handfuls of cashew and some honey
so<00:02:23.360> I<00:02:23.390> estimated<00:02:23.840> that<00:02:24.020> roughly<00:02:24.220> around<00:02:25.239> 1200

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
so I estimated that roughly around 1200

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.320 
so I estimated that roughly around 1200
calories<00:02:26.750> with<00:02:27.650> approximately<00:02:28.430> 30%<00:02:29.000> of

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
calories with approximately 30% of

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.690 
calories with approximately 30% of
calories<00:02:29.780> coming<00:02:30.110> from<00:02:30.260> fat<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:31.220> eating<00:02:31.400> too

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
calories coming from fat so eating too

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.790 
calories coming from fat so eating too
much<00:02:31.849> fat<00:02:32.180> calories<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.260> we're<00:02:33.440> not<00:02:33.590> getting

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
much fat calories and we're not getting

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.559 
much fat calories and we're not getting
enough<00:02:33.920> carbohydrates<00:02:34.370> calories<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.480> we're

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
enough carbohydrates calories and we're

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.360 
enough carbohydrates calories and we're
not<00:02:35.630> getting<00:02:35.750> enough<00:02:35.959> overall<00:02:36.709> calories<00:02:37.190> so

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
not getting enough overall calories so

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.890 
not getting enough overall calories so
we've<00:02:37.489> got<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:38.060> tripleheader<00:02:38.569> they're

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
we've got the the tripleheader they're

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.589 
we've got the the tripleheader they're
too<00:02:39.410> much<00:02:39.590> fat<00:02:39.920> not<00:02:40.489> enough<00:02:40.700> calories<00:02:40.970> overall

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
too much fat not enough calories overall

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.860 
too much fat not enough calories overall
and<00:02:42.010> not<00:02:43.010> enough<00:02:43.340> carbohydrate<00:02:44.239> calories<00:02:44.390> and

and not enough carbohydrate calories and

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.050

then<00:02:44.959> Natasha<00:02:45.350> rode<00:02:45.709> two<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.519> a<00:02:46.549> half<00:02:46.760> hours

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
then Natasha rode two and a half hours

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.690 
then Natasha rode two and a half hours
on<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.450> bike<00:02:47.780> that<00:02:47.810> day<00:02:48.260> which<00:02:48.470> is<00:02:48.680> a<00:02:48.950> lot

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
on the bike that day which is a lot

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.940 
on the bike that day which is a lot
that's<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.420> lot<00:02:50.720> of<00:02:50.750> exercise<00:02:51.350> two<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.769> a<00:02:51.830> half

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
that's a lot of exercise two and a half

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.580 
that's a lot of exercise two and a half
hours<00:02:52.549> that's<00:02:53.120> what<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.360> average

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
hours that's what the average

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.949 
hours that's what the average
professional<00:02:54.590> cyclist<00:02:55.430> would<00:02:55.970> do<00:02:56.209> in<00:02:56.510> an

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959

average day in India during the season

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.750 
average day in India during the season
