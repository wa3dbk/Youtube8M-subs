talk to you about this
Apple's<00:00:08.429> lightning<00:00:09.030> connector<00:00:09.440> this

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
Apple's lightning connector this

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.670 
Apple's lightning connector this
particular<00:00:11.130> one<00:00:11.370> has<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.730> problem<00:00:12.240> where<00:00:12.860> they

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
particular one has a problem where they

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.140 
particular one has a problem where they
as<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.920> can<00:00:17.130> see<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.820> area<00:00:18.180> right<00:00:18.779> here<00:00:18.949> has

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
as you can see this area right here has

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.490 
as you can see this area right here has
experienced<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.270> lot<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.480> flexing<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.850> is<00:00:24.500> not

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
experienced a lot of flexing and is not

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.849 
experienced a lot of flexing and is not
charging<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.789> device<00:00:27.949> now<00:00:28.949> just<00:00:29.640> for<00:00:29.939> kicks<00:00:30.240> I

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
charging the device now just for kicks I

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:37.310 
charging the device now just for kicks I
thought<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.099> would<00:00:32.520> take<00:00:32.880> care<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:34.219> and<00:00:36.320> try

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
thought I would take care of it and try

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.340 
thought I would take care of it and try
and<00:00:37.469> fix<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.100> proper<00:00:38.670> way

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
and fix it the proper way

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.209 
and fix it the proper way
I've<00:00:40.710> seen<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.489> fixes<00:00:41.910> online<00:00:42.420> where<00:00:43.219> people

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
I've seen the fixes online where people

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.260 
I've seen the fixes online where people
just<00:00:44.969> put<00:00:45.210> shrink<00:00:45.600> tubing<00:00:46.110> over<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:47.090> it's<00:00:48.090> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
just put shrink tubing over it it's a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.350 
just put shrink tubing over it it's a
good<00:00:48.450> repair<00:00:48.930> probably<00:00:49.770> for<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.579> connector

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
good repair probably for a connector

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.510 
good repair probably for a connector
that<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:52.050> still<00:00:52.410> working<00:00:53.360> this<00:00:54.360> connector<00:00:54.960> is

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
that is still working this connector is

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.549 
that is still working this connector is
very<00:00:56.520> flaky<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.239> does<00:00:57.449> work<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:57.989> very<00:00:58.020> flaky

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
very flaky it does work but very flaky

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.700 
very flaky it does work but very flaky
and<00:00:58.949> putting<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.969> shrink<00:01:00.750> tubing<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.469> it's

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
and putting a shrink tubing on it it's

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.520 
and putting a shrink tubing on it it's
like<00:01:01.859> putting<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.460> cast<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> arm<00:01:03.530> it's

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
like putting a cast on the arm it's

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.380 
like putting a cast on the arm it's
really<00:01:05.280> not<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.790> repair<00:01:06.330> where<00:01:07.790> it<00:01:08.790> will<00:01:09.090> still

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
really not a repair where it will still

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.320 
really not a repair where it will still
continue<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:10.080> flex<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.430> shrink<00:01:11.939> tubing

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
continue to flex with the shrink tubing

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.640 
continue to flex with the shrink tubing
and<00:01:12.540> end<00:01:13.439> up<00:01:13.909> just<00:01:14.909> as<00:01:15.150> bad<00:01:17.780> eventually<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.170> I

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
and end up just as bad eventually so I

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.700 
and end up just as bad eventually so I
think<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.939> proper<00:01:21.210> repair<00:01:21.780> would<00:01:22.110> be<00:01:22.350> to

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
think that the proper repair would be to

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.210 
think that the proper repair would be to
cut<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.450> wire<00:01:24.689> here<00:01:25.430> open<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.610> thing<00:01:26.670> up<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
cut the wire here open this thing up and

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.710 
cut the wire here open this thing up and
insert<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:30.000> wire<00:01:30.240> all<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.229> way<00:01:32.360> that<00:01:33.360> should

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
insert the wire all the way that should

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.010 
insert the wire all the way that should
require<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.619> lot<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.070> trickery<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:36.210> not<00:01:36.750> know

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
require a lot of trickery I do not know

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.149 
require a lot of trickery I do not know
at<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.380> time<00:01:37.680> if<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.610> can<00:01:38.880> be<00:01:38.909> opened<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:40.159> did

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
at this time if this can be opened I did

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.990 
at this time if this can be opened I did
notice<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:42.119> if<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.720> insert<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.740> pin<00:01:44.310> between

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
notice that if you insert a pin between

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.109 
notice that if you insert a pin between
the<00:01:45.270> gray<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.990> white<00:01:46.430> they<00:01:47.430> do<00:01:47.490> separate

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
the gray and the white they do separate

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:58.170 
the gray and the white they do separate
I<00:01:49.640> don't<00:01:50.640> know<00:01:50.700> how<00:01:50.939> well<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.360> can<00:01:51.390> be<00:01:51.810> seen

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.430 

you<00:01:59.180> can<00:01:59.420> see<00:01:59.690> the<00:01:59.840> small<00:02:00.170> separation<00:02:02.440> this

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
you can see the small separation this

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.410 
you can see the small separation this
leads<00:02:03.920> me<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.190> believe<00:02:04.490> that<00:02:04.700> these<00:02:05.210> are<00:02:06.340> not

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
leads me to believe that these are not

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.050 
leads me to believe that these are not
glued<00:02:08.420> together<00:02:08.860> but<00:02:09.860> rather<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.760> this

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
glued together but rather that this

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.190 
glued together but rather that this
piece<00:02:11.420> of<00:02:11.450> plastic<00:02:11.900> is<00:02:12.620> actually<00:02:13.340> shrunk<00:02:13.760> or

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
piece of plastic is actually shrunk or

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.400 
piece of plastic is actually shrunk or
very<00:02:15.200> tightly<00:02:15.680> fitted<00:02:16.390> over<00:02:17.390> other<00:02:17.840> pieces

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
very tightly fitted over other pieces

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.430 
very tightly fitted over other pieces
that<00:02:18.860> are<00:02:19.010> on<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.310> inside<00:02:19.690> so<00:02:20.690> far<00:02:20.990> on<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.200> You

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
that are on the inside so far on a You

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.480 
that are on the inside so far on a You
Tube<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.860> have<00:02:22.100> not<00:02:22.340> seen<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:23.000> single<00:02:24.040> video<00:02:25.040> of

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
Tube I have not seen a single video of

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.970 
Tube I have not seen a single video of
what<00:02:25.940> this<00:02:26.240> thing<00:02:26.510> looks<00:02:26.810> inside<00:02:27.350> if<00:02:27.680> there<00:02:27.860> is

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
what this thing looks inside if there is

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.430 
what this thing looks inside if there is
any<00:02:28.600> electronics<00:02:29.600> in<00:02:29.810> there<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:32.170> will<00:02:33.170> do<00:02:33.410> a

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
any electronics in there so I will do a

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.310 
any electronics in there so I will do a
little<00:02:33.710> more<00:02:35.800> research<00:02:36.800> on<00:02:37.600> how<00:02:38.600> to<00:02:38.660> open<00:02:38.990> this

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
little more research on how to open this

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.100 
little more research on how to open this
up<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:39.970> then<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.120> next<00:02:41.150> video<00:02:41.780> I'll<00:02:42.050> be

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
up and then the next video I'll be

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.420 
up and then the next video I'll be
opening<00:02:42.890> it<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:43.370> front<00:02:43.820> of<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.150> camera<00:02:45.430> thank

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
opening it in front of the camera thank

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.150 
opening it in front of the camera thank
