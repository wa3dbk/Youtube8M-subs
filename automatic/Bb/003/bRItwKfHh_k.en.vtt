00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
hey everybody its Tracy and Amy and we

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.649 
hey everybody its Tracy and Amy and we
are<00:00:02.190> outside<00:00:02.580> of<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.820> dnews<00:00:03.060> studio<00:00:03.389> because

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
are outside of the dnews studio because

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.030 
are outside of the dnews studio because
the<00:00:03.899> holidays<00:00:04.259> I<00:00:04.500> thought<00:00:04.740> we<00:00:04.799> would<00:00:04.920> have<00:00:04.950> a

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
the holidays I thought we would have a

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.769 
the holidays I thought we would have a
little<00:00:05.250> fun<00:00:05.460> and<00:00:05.640> Thanksgiving<00:00:06.330> is<00:00:06.450> typically

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
little fun and Thanksgiving is typically

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.540 
little fun and Thanksgiving is typically
a<00:00:06.899> time<00:00:07.109> for<00:00:07.379> revisiting<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:08.040> reconnecting

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
a time for revisiting and reconnecting

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.190 
a time for revisiting and reconnecting
with<00:00:08.580> family<00:00:08.700> but<00:00:09.179> pretty<00:00:09.660> often<00:00:10.050> those

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
with family but pretty often those

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.020 
with family but pretty often those
family<00:00:10.559> dinners<00:00:10.830> can<00:00:11.040> become<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> little<00:00:11.820> bit

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
family dinners can become a little bit

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.299 
family dinners can become a little bit
on<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.360> explosive<00:00:12.929> side<00:00:13.110> right<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.950> that's

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
on the explosive side right and that's

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.760 
on the explosive side right and that's
not<00:00:14.490> as<00:00:14.969> fun<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.660> we<00:00:16.049> thought<00:00:16.289> we<00:00:16.470> would<00:00:16.500> bring

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
not as fun so we thought we would bring

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.859 
not as fun so we thought we would bring
it<00:00:16.890> back<00:00:17.070> little<00:00:17.490> fun<00:00:17.760> little<00:00:17.910> science<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.690> a

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
it back little fun little science and a

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.510 
it back little fun little science and a
little<00:00:19.199> bit<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.410> google<00:00:19.890> par<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> little<00:00:20.340> bit<00:00:20.430> of

exploding<00:00:21.119> pie<00:00:21.390> well<00:00:21.810> uh<00:00:22.789> pyrotechnics<00:00:27.380> so

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
exploding pie well uh pyrotechnics so

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.779 
exploding pie well uh pyrotechnics so
the<00:00:28.590> pie<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:29.039> we're<00:00:29.189> gonna<00:00:29.310> explode<00:00:29.609> it's

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the pie that we're gonna explode it's

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.310 
the pie that we're gonna explode it's
not<00:00:29.880> really<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.390> pie<00:00:30.599> for<00:00:30.660> eating<00:00:31.109> it's

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
not really a pie for eating it's

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.900 
not really a pie for eating it's
specifically<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.009> pie<00:00:32.219> for<00:00:32.279> exploding

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
specifically a pie for exploding

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.000 
specifically a pie for exploding
so<00:00:33.149> for<00:00:33.540> these<00:00:33.690> pyrotechnic<00:00:34.410> pies<00:00:34.590> we<00:00:34.890> are

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
so for these pyrotechnic pies we are

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.280 
so for these pyrotechnic pies we are
going<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.190> use<00:00:35.370> potassium<00:00:36.059> nitrate<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.690> natural

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
going to use potassium nitrate a natural

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.619 
going to use potassium nitrate a natural
source<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.710> which<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.100> bat<00:00:38.610> guano<00:00:38.940> found<00:00:39.480> in

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
source of which is bat guano found in

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.420 
source of which is bat guano found in
caves<00:00:39.960> because<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.620> know<00:00:40.739> bat<00:00:41.100> poop

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
caves because you know bat poop

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.250 
caves because you know bat poop
potassium<00:00:42.120> nitrate<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.510> typically<00:00:42.870> used<00:00:43.050> in

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
potassium nitrate is typically used in

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.080 
potassium nitrate is typically used in
rocket<00:00:43.500> propellant<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.160> fireworks<00:00:44.640> we're

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
rocket propellant and fireworks we're

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.490 
rocket propellant and fireworks we're
about<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.420> make<00:00:45.539> our<00:00:45.600> pie<00:00:45.870> using<00:00:46.140> potassium

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
about to make our pie using potassium

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.170 
about to make our pie using potassium
nitrate<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.219> sugar<00:00:47.489> but<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:47.789> do<00:00:47.969> not

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
nitrate and sugar but we do not

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.880 
nitrate and sugar but we do not
recommend<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.899> do<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.230> at<00:00:49.440> home<00:00:49.620> so

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
recommend that you do this at home so

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.310 
recommend that you do this at home so
this<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.160> not<00:00:50.280> really<00:00:50.670> going<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.030> catch<00:00:51.210> fire

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
this is not really going to catch fire

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.900 
this is not really going to catch fire
no<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.379> know<00:00:52.620> how<00:00:52.770> sugar<00:00:53.070> has<00:00:53.340> energy<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.820> it

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
no you know how sugar has energy in it

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.369 
no you know how sugar has energy in it
that<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.180> measure<00:00:54.420> as<00:00:54.600> calories<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.320> we

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
that we measure as calories and we

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.990 
that we measure as calories and we
experience<00:00:55.890> our<00:00:56.010> body<00:00:56.219> using<00:00:56.610> those<00:00:56.730> calories

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
experience our body using those calories

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.180 
experience our body using those calories
every<00:00:57.600> single<00:00:57.899> day<00:00:58.050> well<00:00:58.530> that's<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> similar

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
every single day well that's the similar

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
every single day well that's the similar
thing<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.460> what<00:00:59.579> we're<00:00:59.850> going<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.030> see

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
thing to what we're going to see

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.630 
thing to what we're going to see
happening<00:01:00.600> right<00:01:00.750> here<00:01:01.140> yeah<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> kno3<00:01:02.250> or

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
happening right here yeah the kno3 or

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.640 
happening right here yeah the kno3 or
potassium<00:01:02.940> nitrate<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.719> going<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.409> take

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
potassium nitrate is going to take

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.320 
potassium nitrate is going to take
oxygen<00:01:05.100> out<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> air<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:05.850> it's<00:01:05.970> also<00:01:06.119> an

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
oxygen out of the air but it's also an

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.480 
oxygen out of the air but it's also an
oxidizer<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.110> brings<00:01:07.350> its<00:01:07.530> own<00:01:07.680> oxygen<00:01:08.250> in

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
oxidizer so it brings its own oxygen in

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.359 
oxidizer so it brings its own oxygen in
the<00:01:08.880> reaction<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.750> O<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:10.409> there<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.280> is

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
the reaction the O in there so this is

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.830 
the reaction the O in there so this is
really<00:01:11.549> going<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.790> get<00:01:11.880> kicked<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:12.360> once<00:01:12.689> it

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
really going to get kicked up once it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.870 
really going to get kicked up once it
gets<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.170> there's<00:01:13.530> no<00:01:13.799> way<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:13.979> stop<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.430> so

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
gets going there's no way to stop it so

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.399 
gets going there's no way to stop it so
it's<00:01:15.090> white<00:01:15.390> right<00:01:15.420> now<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.320> to

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
it's white right now but it's going to

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.810 
it's white right now but it's going to
turn<00:01:16.560> brown<00:01:16.799> because<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.280> sugar<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.670> going

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
turn brown because that sugar is going

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.340 
turn brown because that sugar is going
to<00:01:17.880> caramelize<00:01:18.180> as<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:18.869> heat<00:01:19.049> it

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
to caramelize as we heat it

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.750 
to caramelize as we heat it
