00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 I want to travel at high speed with mopeds. / Part 1 / December 31, 2014 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 We have received the following comment on the previously uploaded video. / "This road can only legally run at 60 km / h. However, the design corresponds to 80 km / h." 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 NSR can run faster. But the law must be observed. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Motorbikes that can legally drive on freeways are not favored by insurance or taxes. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 A two-stroke motorcycle in good condition is not available, and it is difficult to maintain as no repair parts are available. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Before that, it makes sense to drive on the NSR with the highway. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 If I surfed the web thinking of something like that, I found the following statement on the police homepage. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Some of the "YOKOHAMASHINDOU" can also be moped. However, there are more and more cases where you are driving in a no-travel zone. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Is "YOKOHAMASHINDOU" a way that suddenly becomes a traffic ban when running on Route 1? 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 You have to pay a high rate for short distances and traffic jams, right? 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 I did not know that the moped could pass. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Moreover, it seems to be the only road in Japan that can travel at 70 km / h with moped. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 The guidance display is green and there is also an automatic payment gate. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Like a highway! 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 There is not much traffic because the traffic volume is low during the New Year holidays. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 The route on the way is also likely to be fast, with many crossings. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 There is no traffic jam in passing Tokyo during consecutive holidays. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 The distance is 4 km. It's short, but it should go. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 So I went out after checking NSR. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 I will reply to your comment. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 "Have you legally altered the way you can drive on the highway?" 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Thank you for your comment as expected. I was waiting for such a comment. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 "Can this section run legally with a moped?" / "YOKOHAMASHINDOU" 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Correct! . Exactly! 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 It is the next comment that was unexpectedly many. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Are you "MAGNA KID"? . / "Look at your speedometer!" / (Japanese internet urban legend, with similar stories) 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 I searched and found the story and laughed. 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 From Ring 7, move to Route 1. 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 I want to move from Route 1 to Ring 2 But there is no good way. 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 There is "MITSUIKE park" on the way. I will stop at this park to relay the break. 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 After passing Shin-Yokohama, Ring 2 changes to a road that is easy to drive. 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 It is "YOKOHAMASHINDOU". From "IMAI Interchange", head towards Totsuka City. 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 The car ahead is slow. 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 The car ahead may not be able to join well. Keep the distance between cars longer. 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 It is on the way, but it is "adult situation". / I wanted to see after this! 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 I am not traveling at 100 km / h. / Did you run? 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Someone seems to have come. 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Is it possible to run even 50cc? . /Is possible. However, the speed limit is 30 km / h. 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 A fast car is traveling at 100 km / h. Driving at 30 km / h is dangerous. 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 You may feel danger even if you drive at 60 km / h. 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 It is better not to run at 50cc. 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 I took a break at the shopping center. 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 Next time, that scene is !!! 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 Note. / I use Japanese homonyms. There are expressions that can not be understood except in Japanese language. 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 Friday Chaban Theater. / "Love and Betrayal" 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 "high speed!" 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 It was the best ever. 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 too fast. And it's too short ... 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 too fast. And it's too short !! Dissatisfied!
