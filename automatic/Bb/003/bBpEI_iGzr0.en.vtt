00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.660
 Liquid cooling for smartphones and a 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.040
 The bracelet should treat the cancer 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.000
 all for a little bit more 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.730
 now going on in the news It's htc manager 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.970
 mowasi announced via twitter that the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.160
 htc hd7 no update on android 5.1 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.170
 lollipop only affects the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.180
 google play the zion will probably be about 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.460
 in april enjoy the new version 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.529
 what should be considered here 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.449
 htc uses its own with sense 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.790
 software and can thereby also bugs and 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.989
 offer features without looking for a new one 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.969
 to jump Android version 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.160
 However, not even now 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.410
 sure how much amon m7 anymore 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.170
 is optimized and which features still 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.300
 I find that one is in 7 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.739
 still a very good smartphone though 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.600
 she htc with this decision 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.110
 I did not like it 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.059
 imagine 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.890
 I still have a tariff tip for 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.449
 you eteleon just offers a whole 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.090
 nice offer with a monthly 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.789
 callable tariffs which means lte mini 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.460
 1000 with 50 free minutes and free sms and 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.270
 1 gb internet-flat with up to 21 mbit 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.689
 for now it comes only three euro 99 im 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.670
 month 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.040
 who wants something more of everything 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.380
 also to lg mini 2000 plus what a 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.570
 stupid name grab and had 100 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.210
 free minutes 100 free sms and 2gb 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.310
 internetflat google labs 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.070
 Real became a patent with the name 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.320
 nanoparticles four aces approved 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.600
 it is a bracelet which 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.340
 Analyzing harmful cells in the body 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.290
 and should treat by means of 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.360
 radiofrequency infrared signals 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.130
 magnetic fields and acoustic pulses 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.720
 the proteins can be used for one 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.729
 appropriate illness responsible 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.920
 are detected and even decomposed 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.200
 within a few years this can be 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.509
 level already marketable and cancer or 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.530
 Parkinson's patients quietly on 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.530
 treat poor 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.750
 Microsoft itself plans in China Windows 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.340
 10 custom roms for various android 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.380
 to publish smartphones 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.689
 that's what the boys from redmond want 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.320
 clear market shares of android to windows 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.850
 get a phone 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.380
 I think the idea is not even that way 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.030
 bad and also hope that I very 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.420
 try it out in the future 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.000
 can 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.360
 hey i was a samsung galaxy s 6 with 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.110
 humble and windows 10 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.850
 my husband not only last as the htc 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.780
 Generally , smartphones are becoming very popular 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.700
 quickly warm 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.930
 the computing power and the bigger the 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.760
 Chips are getting smaller 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.100
 the heat has to go somewhere 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.480
 disadvantage if a smartphone or a 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.340
 then the chip has to be upheld 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.170
 performance be throttled fujitsu 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.580
 could help here because they 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.260
 have a pretty small one 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.570
 liquid cooling for smartphones 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.430
 and it works that way 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.770
 heat of a processor heats up 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.600
 a special coolant that 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.880
 evaporates and is through lines to 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.890
 Condenser led here cools the steam 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.560
 again , it becomes liquid and goes to the lab 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.010
 evaporate will be forwarded from 2017 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.150
 So we with the first liquid cooling 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.680
 can expect smartphones what a 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.120
 crazy time we live in 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.290
 Write your opinion on the 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.790
 single themes below in the 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.140
 comments I'm looking forward to it 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.550
 to discuss it with you 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.500
 Here you can see ours now 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.850
 last news there you can us 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.750

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.750
 but a nice weekend
