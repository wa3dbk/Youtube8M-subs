I<00:02:00.970> had<00:02:01.510> my<00:02:01.659> advisor<00:02:01.930> say<00:02:02.229> that<00:02:02.470> if<00:02:03.190> I<00:02:03.430> if<00:02:03.700> I<00:02:03.880> work

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
I had my advisor say that if I if I work

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.600 
I had my advisor say that if I if I work

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
hard I'm allowed to play hard so that's

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.940

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
singlet state and then what happens is

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.009 
singlet state and then what happens is
the<00:03:12.160> triplet<00:03:12.579> state<00:03:12.850> is<00:03:13.209> exactly<00:03:13.600> half<00:03:13.840> the

the triplet state is exactly half the

the triplet state is exactly half the

energy or close to have energy of the
excited<00:03:16.989> singlet<00:03:17.170> state<00:03:17.500> so<00:03:18.040> fission<00:03:18.400> occurs

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
excited singlet state so fission occurs

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.190 
excited singlet state so fission occurs
and<00:03:18.850> you<00:03:18.910> break<00:03:19.120> off<00:03:19.299> into<00:03:19.329> two<00:03:19.780> separate

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
and you break off into two separate

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.440 
and you break off into two separate
triplet<00:03:20.560> states<00:03:20.829> and<00:03:21.100> then<00:03:21.549> you're<00:03:22.060> trying<00:03:22.329> to

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
triplet states and then you're trying to

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.759 
triplet states and then you're trying to
get<00:03:22.570> two<00:03:22.720> hundred<00:03:22.840> percent<00:03:23.230> efficiency<00:03:23.620> out

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
get two hundred percent efficiency out

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.170 
get two hundred percent efficiency out
of<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.070> material<00:03:24.579> rather<00:03:24.790> than<00:03:24.910> one<00:03:25.090> hundred

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
of the material rather than one hundred

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.940 
of the material rather than one hundred
percent<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:26.500> then<00:03:26.620> there<00:03:26.769> are<00:03:26.799> some

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
percent and then there are some

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.900 
percent and then there are some
materials<00:03:27.310> where<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.489> triplets<00:03:27.790> will

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
materials where the triplets will

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.580 
materials where the triplets will
recombine<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:28.600> that's<00:03:28.810> call<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.410> then<00:03:29.500> you

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
recombine and that's call and then you

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.620 
recombine and that's call and then you
get<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:29.739> wait<00:03:29.980> fluorescence<00:03:30.519> from<00:03:30.610> that<00:03:30.850> so

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
get to wait fluorescence from that so

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.530 
get to wait fluorescence from that so

from that you can you can measure you

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.910 
from that you can you can measure you

can measure what kind of fission you're

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.140 
can measure what kind of fission you're
