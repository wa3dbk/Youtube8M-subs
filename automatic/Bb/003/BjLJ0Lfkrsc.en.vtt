 what are you drawing fiction 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.070
 scientists predict if the next 300 years 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.260
 humanity 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.410

 what was planned 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.040

 Has that frontier come when mankind with 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.510
 can proudly say 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.610

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.720
 if you look at the silent film stars 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.610
