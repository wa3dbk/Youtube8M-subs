00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:38.320

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.030
 hello guys is welcome guys 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.830
 this new video the first of the year 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:49.150
 new 2013 and I'm here to introduce you to a 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:51.940
 wonderful product that serves everyone 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.730
 how many to wear make-up and what it is 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.770
 treats the luminous mirror and 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.000
 there are lots of mirrors around 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.250
 but the most popular ever 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.220
 from make up to who sense but who to 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.340
 profession or passion is make-up is 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.790
 this one of the babyliss you see here it is 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.689
 here is super and mega professional with the 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:21.030
 plug with three is practically positions 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:24.490
 of lights and then with the 8x8 of 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.890
 enlargement that I show you immediately 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.909
 this and the normal one can be seen 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:35.860
 and then the ride is huge look ie 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:38.140
 I know if you see it is too big 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.790
 that I cannot, that is, be my own 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.619
 so to see everything that goes 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.950
 very well that to make eyebrows 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.630
 because with a normal mirror you don't 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.220
 sees some hair that you bank with 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:54.790
 this one does not go unnoticed 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.220
 nothing nothing so if you see them with 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.490
 this 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.770
 mirror and not those who smoke stops smoking 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.430
 because he sees all the little wrinkles me 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.190
 maybe here around the base and from many 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.750
 years that was but I show you anyway 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.990
 sideways here is this here is a 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.660
 normal enlargement this is me and 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.820
 I show you in the gradations of light 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.390
 then this is the position of light 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.850
 normal interior you see a little warm then 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.160
 there this is neon lights you see that 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.350
 colder than I do not like to wear makeup 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.810
 with this kind of light and then there is the 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.580
 daylight and alone and from outside 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.890
 see that it is much more as I can tell 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.470
 suffused more from one aspect more 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.970
 natural than the first you see that 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:47.330
 we see that more size but artificial and 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.080
 let's see if I can actually turn around 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.600
 Wow 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.620
 make an account of seeing him thus count 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:00.090
 he can enlarge this mirror and he has it 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.790
 paid 39 euros because it was on sale though 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.820
 the actual price is 60 euros 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.920
 roughly and some areas of thor melo 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.430
 seen by the Chinese is not this of Chinese 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.409
 may be similar but babyliss e 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.200
 the price is the one there unless I know 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:19.280
 if you find it on offer on ebay that is 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.659
 however in short it is heavy for me 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.299
 correspondence to take a kind of 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:27.060
 I generally don't trust because you see how 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:30.180
 big it breaks me then it imports some 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.760
 bad luck maybe a mirror and therefore that 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.849
 what have you seen I recommend 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.680
 it is an expense that you will make one 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.599
 time and then you won't do it anymore is not that 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.480
 every day you go to buy is 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:45.239
 dedicated so try to position 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.560
 in a part I speak good nation or evil 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.510
 because I am a desk there 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.939
 all so I'll put it up and down though a 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.669
 who can keep it in one place e 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.379
 then leave it there eventually if not 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:58.290
 use to cover it with some 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.480
 piece of cloth something so 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.209
 don't let the dust come on it 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.939
 anyway some girls I saw a 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.409
 place we said is but dear 39 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:11.879
 EUR 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:16.109
 I of the mirrors that I show you the 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:17.880
 his mirror that the apparatus 12 is a theme 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.280
 roughly, that is, it has nothing to do with 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.099
 do a lot of magnification when 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.470
 like this, it's not written though 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.550
 in short, in the same thing as this 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.530
 which if we have to make a purchase 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.539
 let's do it well once and then mica 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.880
 I have to do it, we can do it 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.790
 contests for the birthday for Valentine's Day 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.710
 that arrives and so on 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.720
 I hope you like let me know i 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:44.030

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:46.230
 or what you use to make up 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.050
 however you have seen having three 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.870
 locations is super convenient so you can 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.990
 make a type of make up well e 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.510
 I must say that it is also to apply the e 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:01.650
 laner as I applied here 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:03.870
 see with absolute precision 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.540
 I feel great with even more 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:10.380
 this mirror is lively everybody 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:14.550
