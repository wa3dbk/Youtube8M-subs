announced last year I was pretty upset

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.990 
announced last year I was pretty upset
because<00:06:50.630> I<00:06:51.139> had<00:06:51.889> just<00:06:52.099> gotten<00:06:52.190> this<00:06:52.490> phone

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
because I had just gotten this phone

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.150 
because I had just gotten this phone
just<00:06:53.420> gotten<00:06:53.690> in<00:06:53.750> a<00:06:53.840> contract<00:06:54.350> a<00:06:54.470> new<00:06:54.650> contract
