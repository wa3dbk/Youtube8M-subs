00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.130
 Hello everyone, I am Olga and in this 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.660
 video i would like to tell you how 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.379
 get rid of your background noise 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.470
 microphone when mounting stream example about a 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.600
 we will need the effect rather 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.600
 standard plugin which is called 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.930
 dan lake just styling effect in searching 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.550
 you can write d'azyr and here we are 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.210
 just apply to our audiophile 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.920
 but since I have a lot of them and 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.660
 do not copy this effect on each of 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.520
 I will remove them from here if you have everything 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.420
 one fragment you can apply 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.090
 click on it and we already see 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.640
 interface of the plugin itself to it we 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.860
 come back later my situation needs 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.590
 apply effect to the whole track for 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.809
 we need this audio track panel 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:04.049
 mixer that is, here it is, we choose 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.080
 our sequence here it is with us 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.540
 is a set of audio tracks 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.210
 which we have a regulator here their him 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.820
 level we can lower it manually 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.659
 inscribe and last drunk is the master 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.479
 that is, we are found here 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.470
 already let's say so of course i'm a track which 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.130
 will be after the render 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.080
 that is, if we make it to minus 8 and 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.820
 decibel then every track will be on minus 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.970
 8 decibels and accordingly if we 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.079
 count on her some effect he 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.700
 will accept the whole sound finite but me 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.810
 I need this first track 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.550
 so I press here on a triangle here 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.320
 by the way 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.610
 you can turn off this button to write 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.680
 I have one effect already applied here 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.720
 to raise the volume of the movie and and 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.300
 align to hear the background itself 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.300
 noise by the way let's hear my recording 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.980
 123 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.660
 by the way why is she so chopped 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.310
 because I specifically cut my own 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.850
 straight horse because you will hear 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.500
 this entry during the lesson many times and 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.970
 so that it bothers me 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.350
 especially in this place which is now 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.040
 show which current time 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.280
 very noticeable background noise here from him we 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.180
 we will get rid 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.730
 click here on the triangle and 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.550
 choose from the drop down list we need 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.410
 effect so need to find it but because 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.340
 reduction times elders here have 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.710
 us dan lake we use it double click 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.910
 so that the interface opens again 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.550
 the plugin itself and what it does with us 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.370
 If I let I still do 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:55.410
 lower the volume of the premiere to record 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.820
 I do not block it somewhere so now 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.890
 if i turn on 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:04.560
 one in our window but from the trucks will 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.360
 show the noise level which 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.650
 defines plugin if lose 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.020
 the moment where your voice that is where 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.150
 he can you take your voice for example 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.980
 cut it a little so for 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.400
 convenience as we do we can even 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.260
 separate the fragment with noise 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.870
 away so that she does not accidentally hit 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.580
 play palagin here for example on this 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.430
 the place here he determined the noise level 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.370
 we can press the frieze and now itâ€™s the same 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:40.140
 all the tracks will hit the noise let 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:44.330
 here we can listen i was sitting on a noise like 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:47.360
 if I am not mistaken 100 be quiet 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.620
 so but this is such an optional feature 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.480
 which in principle is not necessary 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.110
 enjoy that is let principle i 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.260
 the program itself determines the noise level 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.020
 reduction 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.290
 it is actually how much we have 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:04.900
 noise is cut that is, we have a maximum of 20 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:08.660
 decibel if we make one as much as possible 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.540
 now there is no noise at all probably all 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.190
 still stella louder to you all very 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:20.180
 well heard let's listen again 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:23.660
 one appeared such a hum very weak 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.430
 some kind of low frequency probably but he 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.590
 less noticeable than let's give a noise for 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.430
 interest turn off the plugin plugin 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.650
 I apologize and listen to one that's what 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.640
 the noise was and 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:41.180
 and 1 where did he go ? 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:44.210
 good result but if you have at 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.550
 all this will greatly affect the voice you 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.830
 can make the parameter value 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.610
 reduction a little bit smaller 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:55.190
 for example, you can put on 10 decibels and 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.350
 also if you are very sharply cut off 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.570
 noise that is again can see 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.720
 that way to treat hair makes sense 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:08.180
 twist the parameter and set it with us 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:12.230
 responsible for all the noise that is 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:15.620
 will be cut off that's the principle and we all 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.690
 learned to cut noise standard 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.000
 plug like this video 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.690
 subscribe to my channel and you 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.680
 was me 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.680
 where bye
