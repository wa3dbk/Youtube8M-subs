I'm gonna be doing over the next couple
of<00:00:48.870> days<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.230> my<00:00:49.410> goal<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.829> hit<00:00:49.950> 4,000

as<00:00:54.539> long<00:00:54.570> as<00:00:54.870> I'm<00:00:55.020> patient<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.590> make<00:00:56.129> sure<00:00:56.250> I

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
as long as I'm patient and make sure I

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.740 
as long as I'm patient and make sure I
find<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> right<00:00:56.850> type<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.059> basis<00:00:57.600> because

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
find the right type of basis because

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.689 
find the right type of basis because
honestly<00:00:58.350> sometimes<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.309> just<00:00:59.460> takes<00:00:59.520> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
honestly sometimes it just takes a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.369 
honestly sometimes it just takes a
little<00:00:59.879> bit<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.120> luck<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.840> find<00:01:01.079> those<00:01:01.199> right

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
little bit of luck to find those right

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.439 
little bit of luck to find those right
bases<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.949> attack<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.640> if<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.390> put

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
bases to attack and if you just put

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.609 
bases to attack and if you just put
enough<00:01:03.750> time<00:01:03.899> into<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.500> definitely

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
enough time into it you can definitely

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.100 
enough time into it you can definitely
hit<00:01:04.890> 4,000<00:01:05.430> trophies<00:01:05.729> if<00:01:06.000> you're<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:06.630> yeah<00:01:07.080> a

you<00:02:51.630> guys<00:02:51.810> might<00:02:51.990> have<00:02:52.020> seen<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.440> I've<00:02:52.560> used

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
you guys might have seen that I've used

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.500 
you guys might have seen that I've used
to<00:02:52.860> jump<00:02:53.220> spells<00:02:53.460> before<00:02:53.610> I'm<00:02:54.120> trying<00:02:54.360> out

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
to jump spells before I'm trying out

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.910 
to jump spells before I'm trying out
like<00:02:54.660> two<00:02:54.840> rage<00:02:55.050> spells<00:02:55.320> now<00:02:55.500> which<00:02:55.740> is<00:02:55.890> more

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
like two rage spells now which is more

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.220 
like two rage spells now which is more
effective<00:02:56.460> against<00:02:57.090> bases<00:02:57.480> like<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:57.900> I've

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
effective against bases like this I've

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.020 
effective against bases like this I've
thrown<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.590> Pekka<00:02:58.920> in<00:02:59.250> there<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.640> sometimes

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
thrown a Pekka in there and sometimes

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.390 
thrown a Pekka in there and sometimes
I'll<00:03:00.180> bring<00:03:00.330> even<00:03:00.630> more<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.930> those<00:03:01.050> guys<00:03:01.400> by

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
I'll bring even more of those guys by

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.400 
I'll bring even more of those guys by
taking<00:03:02.790> out<00:03:02.910> like<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.120> witch<00:03:03.420> or<00:03:03.600> two<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:04.020> still

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
taking out like a witch or two I still

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.230 
taking out like a witch or two I still
have<00:03:04.560> been<00:03:04.680> sticking<00:03:04.890> with<00:03:05.100> four<00:03:05.340> golems<00:03:05.760> that

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
have been sticking with four golems that

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.760 
have been sticking with four golems that
usually<00:03:06.630> seems<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.960> be<00:03:07.050> about<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.350> sweet<00:03:07.560> spot

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
usually seems to be about the sweet spot

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.020 
usually seems to be about the sweet spot
especially<00:03:08.310> for<00:03:08.460> those<00:03:08.550> multi<00:03:08.880> target

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
especially for those multi target

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.480 
especially for those multi target
inferno<00:03:09.630> towers<00:03:09.980> but<00:03:10.980> yeah<00:03:11.130> I've<00:03:11.250> just<00:03:11.310> been

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
inferno towers but yeah I've just been

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.130 
inferno towers but yeah I've just been
switching<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.000> up<00:03:12.090> most<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.570> them<00:03:12.690> have<00:03:12.990> the

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
switching it up most of them have the

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.600 
switching it up most of them have the
same<00:03:13.170> amount<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.710> success<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.340> mean<00:03:14.490> they're

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
same amount of success I mean they're

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.340 
same amount of success I mean they're
gonna<00:03:14.730> be<00:03:14.880> different<00:03:15.660> depending<00:03:16.140> on<00:03:16.230> what

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
gonna be different depending on what

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.710 
gonna be different depending on what
type<00:03:16.530> of<00:03:16.560> basis<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.070> attack<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:18.360> sometimes

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
type of basis you attack so sometimes

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.120 
type of basis you attack so sometimes
the<00:03:18.870> Pekka<00:03:19.080> will<00:03:19.290> be<00:03:19.380> more<00:03:19.560> useful<00:03:19.890> if<00:03:20.010> you're

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
the Pekka will be more useful if you're

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.260 
the Pekka will be more useful if you're
destroying<00:03:20.459> these<00:03:20.610> big<00:03:20.820> buildings<00:03:21.180> like

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
destroying these big buildings like

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.699 
destroying these big buildings like
against<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.690> base<00:03:21.840> like<00:03:22.050> this<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.380> pec<00:03:22.560> are

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
against a base like this the pec are

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.260 
against a base like this the pec are
definitely<00:03:23.160> better<00:03:23.310> than<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.910> witches

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
definitely better than the witches

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.580 
definitely better than the witches
because<00:03:24.450> they<00:03:24.750> can<00:03:24.930> just<00:03:25.080> get<00:03:25.200> in<00:03:25.350> there<00:03:25.500> and

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
because they can just get in there and

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.830 
because they can just get in there and
destroy<00:03:25.709> everything<00:03:26.330> but<00:03:27.330> sometimes<00:03:27.750> the

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
destroy everything but sometimes the

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.970 
destroy everything but sometimes the
witches<00:03:28.110> can<00:03:28.260> be<00:03:28.350> better<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:28.650> just<00:03:28.680> really

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
witches can be better it just really

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.290 
witches can be better it just really
depends<00:03:29.340> on<00:03:29.370> what<00:03:29.520> type<00:03:29.640> of<00:03:29.760> base<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:30.030> attack

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
depends on what type of base you attack

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.390 
depends on what type of base you attack
so<00:03:30.540> still<00:03:31.110> things<00:03:31.590> are<00:03:31.709> fine<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:32.070> really

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
so still things are fine you really

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.520 
so still things are fine you really
shouldn't<00:03:32.640> lose<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:32.970> raid<00:03:33.260> unless<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.380> have

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
shouldn't lose the raid unless you have

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.980 
shouldn't lose the raid unless you have
some<00:03:34.680> crazy<00:03:34.920> sort<00:03:35.190> of<00:03:35.280> AI<00:03:35.490> where<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.540> skeleton

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
some crazy sort of AI where the skeleton

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.930 
some crazy sort of AI where the skeleton
traps<00:03:37.170> mess<00:03:37.470> up<00:03:37.620> your<00:03:37.770> queen<00:03:38.010> which<00:03:38.310> seems<00:03:38.820> to

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
traps mess up your queen which seems to

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.710

I'd like the that clan castle troops

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.910 
I'd like the that clan castle troops
have<00:03:42.510> something<00:03:42.810> weird<00:03:42.990> happened<00:03:43.320> mainly<00:03:43.800> the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920

only<00:03:44.100> thing<00:03:44.250> I'm<00:03:44.340> looking<00:03:44.430> for<00:03:44.580> is<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.060> giant

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
only thing I'm looking for is the giant

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.850 
only thing I'm looking for is the giant
bombs<00:03:45.600> that<00:03:45.840> can<00:03:45.990> blow<00:03:46.110> up<00:03:46.200> my<00:03:46.320> wizards<00:03:46.650> in<00:03:46.770> my

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
bombs that can blow up my wizards in my

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.199 
bombs that can blow up my wizards in my

at this guy's base seems like I can

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.680 
at this guy's base seems like I can
attack<00:03:56.310> him<00:03:56.340> from<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.670> bottom<00:03:57.030> again<00:03:57.300> usually

giant bombs can be and if you look in
that<00:04:00.720> main<00:04:01.020> compartment<00:04:01.740> you<00:04:01.890> don't<00:04:02.160> see<00:04:02.400> any

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
that main compartment you don't see any

2x2<00:04:03.060> squares<00:04:03.630> where<00:04:03.870> a<00:04:03.900> giant<00:04:04.140> bomb<00:04:04.680> could<00:04:04.890> be

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
2x2 squares where a giant bomb could be

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.490 
2x2 squares where a giant bomb could be
except<00:04:05.760> for<00:04:05.910> that<00:04:06.000> expo<00:04:06.480> on<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.780> top<00:04:06.959> right<00:04:07.260> so

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
except for that expo on the top right so

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.050 
except for that expo on the top right so
as<00:04:07.620> long<00:04:07.800> as<00:04:07.860> my<00:04:08.040> wizards<00:04:08.520> and<00:04:08.700> witches<00:04:08.760> aren't

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
as long as my wizards and witches aren't

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.580 
as long as my wizards and witches aren't
getting<00:04:09.300> blown<00:04:09.480> up<00:04:09.630> by<00:04:09.750> those<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:10.140> think<00:04:10.350> I

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
getting blown up by those I think I

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.260 
getting blown up by those I think I
should<00:04:10.770> be<00:04:10.860> okay<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.400> one<00:04:11.880> final<00:04:12.150> thing

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
should be okay and one final thing

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.060 
should be okay and one final thing
before<00:04:12.540> I<00:04:12.930> attack<00:04:13.260> this<00:04:13.410> guy's<00:04:13.590> base<00:04:13.800> is<00:04:14.010> I

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
before I attack this guy's base is I

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.620 
before I attack this guy's base is I
actually<00:04:14.220> dropped<00:04:14.580> two<00:04:14.760> barbarians<00:04:15.239> just<00:04:15.510> to

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
actually dropped two barbarians just to

barbarians<00:04:28.520> and<00:04:28.730> now<00:04:29.090> I'm<00:04:29.150> just<00:04:29.240> gonna<00:04:29.360> go<00:04:29.540> in

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
barbarians and now I'm just gonna go in

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.640 
barbarians and now I'm just gonna go in
through<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.840> bottom<00:04:30.080> of<00:04:30.170> the<00:04:30.230> base

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
through the bottom of the base

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.620 
through the bottom of the base
alright<00:04:31.610> so<00:04:31.730> things<00:04:31.970> are<00:04:32.060> going<00:04:32.240> decent<00:04:32.510> right

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
alright so things are going decent right

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.050 
alright so things are going decent right
now<00:04:32.720> my<00:04:32.900> troops<00:04:33.200> are<00:04:33.380> looking<00:04:34.340> like<00:04:34.520> I'm<00:04:34.850> at

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
now my troops are looking like I'm at

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.190 
now my troops are looking like I'm at
least<00:04:35.270> destroying<00:04:35.690> some<00:04:35.870> of<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.020> garbage

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
least destroying some of the garbage

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.930 
least destroying some of the garbage
buildings<00:04:36.650> on<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:36.800> outside<00:04:36.830> so<00:04:37.610> my<00:04:37.700> troops

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
buildings on the outside so my troops

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.340 
buildings on the outside so my troops
don't<00:04:38.060> get<00:04:38.240> distracted<00:04:38.540> and<00:04:38.900> it<00:04:39.050> looks<00:04:39.200> like

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
don't get distracted and it looks like

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.750 
don't get distracted and it looks like
most<00:04:39.560> of<00:04:39.650> my<00:04:39.740> troops<00:04:40.010> are<00:04:40.100> going<00:04:40.280> towards<00:04:40.610> the

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
most of my troops are going towards the

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.270 
most of my troops are going towards the
center<00:04:41.180> and<00:04:41.420> that<00:04:42.020> should<00:04:42.320> look<00:04:42.710> pretty<00:04:43.010> good

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
center and that should look pretty good

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.250 
center and that should look pretty good
for<00:04:43.520> me<00:04:43.610> like<00:04:43.790> I<00:04:43.940> said<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.510> giant<00:04:44.870> bombs<00:04:44.960> are

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
for me like I said the giant bombs are

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.540 
for me like I said the giant bombs are
likely<00:04:45.560> gonna<00:04:45.620> be<00:04:45.830> next<00:04:46.010> to<00:04:46.160> those<00:04:46.280> hidden

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
likely gonna be next to those hidden

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.100 
likely gonna be next to those hidden
Tesla's<00:04:46.940> right<00:04:47.270> next<00:04:47.510> to<00:04:47.600> the<00:04:47.720> Town<00:04:47.900> Hall

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
Tesla's right next to the Town Hall

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.450 
Tesla's right next to the Town Hall
because<00:04:48.710> that's<00:04:48.890> where<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:49.160> two<00:04:49.310> by<00:04:49.430> two

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
because that's where the two by two

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.760 
because that's where the two by two
spots<00:04:49.910> are<00:04:50.090> located<00:04:50.600> there's<00:04:51.110> one<00:04:51.350> giant<00:04:51.680> bomb

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
spots are located there's one giant bomb

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:52.930 
spots are located there's one giant bomb
right<00:04:51.950> there<00:04:52.010> it<00:04:52.280> actually<00:04:52.610> doesn't<00:04:52.850> look

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
right there it actually doesn't look

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.190 
right there it actually doesn't look
like<00:04:53.120> it's<00:04:53.270> gonna<00:04:53.330> hit<00:04:53.540> too<00:04:53.660> many<00:04:53.810> of<00:04:53.930> my<00:04:54.020> guys

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
like it's gonna hit too many of my guys

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.750 
like it's gonna hit too many of my guys
because<00:04:54.620> they<00:04:54.710> were<00:04:54.770> focusing<00:04:55.250> on<00:04:55.370> some<00:04:55.550> stuff

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
because they were focusing on some stuff

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.700 
because they were focusing on some stuff
near<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:56.780> beginning<00:04:56.900> of<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.200> compartment

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
near the beginning of the compartment

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.770 
near the beginning of the compartment
and<00:04:57.890> then<00:04:58.580> right<00:04:58.910> now<00:04:59.030> looks<00:04:59.360> like<00:04:59.480> they're

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
and then right now looks like they're

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.450 
and then right now looks like they're
gonna<00:04:59.870> go<00:05:00.080> in<00:05:00.230> towards<00:05:00.470> the<00:05:00.560> center<00:05:01.040> start

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
gonna go in towards the center start

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.250 
gonna go in towards the center start
attacking<00:05:01.700> that<00:05:01.970> Town<00:05:02.210> Hall<00:05:02.450> and<00:05:02.660> that<00:05:03.170> we

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
attacking that Town Hall and that we

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.630 
attacking that Town Hall and that we
should<00:05:03.530> have<00:05:03.650> a<00:05:03.680> pretty<00:05:03.920> good<00:05:04.160> shot<00:05:04.370> of

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
should have a pretty good shot of

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.340 
should have a pretty good shot of
getting<00:05:04.760> the<00:05:05.000> 50%<00:05:05.780> all<00:05:05.960> right<00:05:06.050> things<00:05:06.260> are

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
getting the 50% all right things are

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.660 
getting the 50% all right things are
