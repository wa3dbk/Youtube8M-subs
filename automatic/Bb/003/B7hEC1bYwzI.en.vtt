00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
letters in sketchup tutorial this was

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.550 
letters in sketchup tutorial this was
just<00:00:06.060> really<00:00:06.299> cool<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:06.810> straightforward<00:00:07.410> and

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
just really cool and straightforward and

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.780 
just really cool and straightforward and
clean<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.389> i<00:00:09.980> wanted<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.099> add<00:00:11.280> on<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.759> that

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
with what you could do in blender

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.390 
with what you could do in blender

exasperated with my now i am a total
blender<00:00:17.640> nut<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.350> i'm<00:00:19.350> going<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.650> shift<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.340> add

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
blender nut so i'm going to shift a add

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.960 
blender nut so i'm going to shift a add
some<00:00:21.449> text<00:00:22.400> textures<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.460> really<00:00:23.730> small

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
some text textures of really small

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.880 
some text textures of really small
because<00:00:24.150> I'm<00:00:24.269> zoomed<00:00:24.510> way<00:00:24.630> out<00:00:24.990> because<00:00:25.470> at

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
because I'm zoomed way out because at

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.250 
because I'm zoomed way out because at
this<00:00:26.160> scale<00:00:26.910> were<00:00:27.210> more<00:00:27.449> sort<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.900> on<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
this scale were more sort of on the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.169 
this scale were more sort of on the
scale<00:00:28.500> you'd<00:00:28.740> see<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.310> 3d<00:00:29.640> printer<00:00:29.970> world

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
scale you'd see in the 3d printer world

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.910 
scale you'd see in the 3d printer world
each<00:00:30.480> one<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.689> these<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.869> one<00:00:31.170> centimeter<00:00:31.740> in

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
each one of these is one centimeter in

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.790 
each one of these is one centimeter in
length<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.550> maybe<00:00:33.020> nine<00:00:34.020> centimeters

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
length so this is maybe nine centimeters

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.250 
length so this is maybe nine centimeters
wide<00:00:35.040> worth<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.640> text<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.120> when<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.870> generate

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
wide worth of text and when I generate

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.020 
wide worth of text and when I generate
this<00:00:37.380> text<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.860> very<00:00:38.010> flat<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.910> know

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
this text it's a very flat you know

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.299 
this text it's a very flat you know
perfectly<00:00:39.480> flat<00:00:40.170> two-dimensional<00:00:40.530> objects

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
perfectly flat two-dimensional objects

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.680 
perfectly flat two-dimensional objects
so<00:00:41.489> too<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:42.469> this<00:00:43.469> panel<00:00:44.160> here<00:00:44.190> under<00:00:44.640> F<00:00:44.850> which

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
so too in this panel here under F which

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.100 
so too in this panel here under F which
stands<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.219> the<00:00:47.219> object<00:00:47.700> data<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.239> text<00:00:48.750> I'm

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
stands for the object data of text I'm

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.560 
stands for the object data of text I'm
going<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:50.160> do<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:51.140> extrude<00:00:52.140> option<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.570> maybe

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
going to do the extrude option and maybe

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.729 
going to do the extrude option and maybe
I<00:00:54.629> don't<00:00:54.780> want<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:54.960> text<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> be<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.530> thick

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
I don't want that text to be that thick

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.910 
I don't want that text to be that thick
i'm<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> say<00:00:56.280> point<00:00:56.670> one<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.739> i'm<00:00:58.739> going

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
i'm going to say point one and i'm going

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.180 
i'm going to say point one and i'm going
to<00:00:59.100> give<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.460> bevel<00:01:00.170> because<00:01:01.170> bells<00:01:02.070> are

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
to give it a bevel because bells are

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.719 
to give it a bevel because bells are
cool<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:03.769> at<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> size<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.369> know<00:01:05.460> maybe<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
cool and at the size you know maybe the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.890 
cool and at the size you know maybe the
bevel<00:01:05.970> wouldn't<00:01:06.180> show<00:01:06.330> up<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.720> made<00:01:06.869> a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
bevel wouldn't show up but if you made a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.530 
bevel wouldn't show up but if you made a
bit<00:01:07.140> bigger<00:01:07.610> then<00:01:08.610> you'd<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.970> bevel<00:01:09.360> that

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
bit bigger then you'd have a bevel that

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.679 
bit bigger then you'd have a bevel that
it<00:01:09.659> definitely<00:01:09.810> show<00:01:10.170> up<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.439> your<00:01:10.470> print<00:01:11.150> and

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.070 

with<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:17.610> font<00:01:18.090> options<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.689> can<00:01:18.780> actually

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
with the font options you can actually

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.580 
with the font options you can actually
go<00:01:19.170> into<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.409> file<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.040> select<00:01:20.720> from<00:01:21.720> say

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
go into a file and select from say

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.960 
go into a file and select from say
windows<00:01:23.310> /<00:01:26.570> fonts

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.000 

leave<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.780> from<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> available<00:01:31.260> Fox<00:01:31.680> I'm

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
leave it from the available Fox I'm

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.210 
leave it from the available Fox I'm
going<00:01:32.160> to<00:01:32.220> go<00:01:32.340> with<00:01:33.260> something<00:01:34.260> from<00:01:34.620> the<00:01:34.860> time

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
going to go with something from the time

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.920 
going to go with something from the time
series<00:01:35.850> just<00:01:36.090> because<00:01:36.330> I'll<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.540> nice<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
series just because I'll be nice and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.320 
series just because I'll be nice and
clearly<00:01:37.290> not<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.100> same<00:01:38.490> kind<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.880> font<00:01:39.120> as

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
clearly not the same kind of font as

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.230 
clearly not the same kind of font as
when<00:01:39.660> we<00:01:39.780> started<00:01:40.110> with<00:01:40.230> that's<00:01:40.440> very<00:01:41.210> sort<00:01:42.210> of

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
when we started with that's very sort of

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.760 
when we started with that's very sort of
definitely<00:01:42.810> not<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.350> same<00:01:43.560> text<00:01:44.150> and<00:01:45.590> I<00:01:46.590> can

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
definitely not the same text and I can

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.280 
definitely not the same text and I can
still<00:01:47.040> tap<00:01:47.280> into<00:01:47.520> edit<00:01:47.850> mode<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.330> change<00:01:48.870> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
still tap into edit mode and change the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.310 
still tap into edit mode and change the
text<00:01:52.130> which<00:01:53.360> is<00:01:54.360> kind<00:01:54.660> of<00:01:54.690> cool<00:01:54.750> because<00:01:55.080> you

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
text which is kind of cool because you

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.570 
text which is kind of cool because you
can<00:01:55.350> keep<00:01:55.710> making<00:01:56.100> those<00:01:56.190> sorts<00:01:56.520> of

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
can keep making those sorts of

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.010 
can keep making those sorts of
modifications<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.450> while<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.690> text<00:01:57.930> is

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
modifications to it while the text is

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.080 
modifications to it while the text is
still<00:01:58.260> mutable<00:02:00.290> so<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.800> is<00:02:02.130> now<00:02:02.700> I'm<00:02:02.940> going

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
still mutable so this is now I'm going

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.469 
still mutable so this is now I'm going
to<00:02:03.150> call<00:02:03.300> that<00:02:03.330> may<00:02:03.630> be<00:02:03.690> done<00:02:04.550> I<00:02:05.550> can<00:02:06.119> use<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
to call that may be done I can use the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.570 
to call that may be done I can use the
sheer<00:02:06.780> option<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.590> tilt<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.040> text<00:02:08.429> back<00:02:08.550> and

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
sheer option to tilt the text back and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.250 
sheer option to tilt the text back and
forth<00:02:08.970> which<00:02:09.240> is<00:02:09.360> kind<00:02:09.510> of<00:02:09.540> cool<00:02:09.600> so<00:02:09.899> until<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
forth which is kind of cool so until the

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.140 
forth which is kind of cool so until the
back<00:02:10.440> slightly<00:02:10.790> just<00:02:11.790> because<00:02:12.000> that's

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
back slightly just because that's

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.400 
back slightly just because that's
something<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.510> couldn't<00:02:12.750> do<00:02:12.870> with<00:02:12.990> italics

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
something you couldn't do with italics

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.290 
something you couldn't do with italics
cuz<00:02:13.560> italics<00:02:13.980> always<00:02:14.190> goes<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:14.490> way<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:17.300> now

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
cuz italics always goes this way and now

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.770 
cuz italics always goes this way and now
I'm<00:02:18.690> gonna<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.920> know<00:02:20.040> freeze<00:02:20.490> this<00:02:20.850> into<00:02:21.450> an

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
I'm gonna you know freeze this into an

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.760 
I'm gonna you know freeze this into an
object<00:02:22.260> which<00:02:23.780> is<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.959> mesh<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.500> I'm<00:02:25.560> going<00:02:25.709> to

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
object which is a mesh so I'm going to

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.260 
object which is a mesh so I'm going to
convert<00:02:26.250> mesh<00:02:26.640> from<00:02:26.850> etc<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:29.250> now<00:02:29.490> if<00:02:29.790> i<00:02:29.880> have

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
convert mesh from etc so now if i have

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.850 
convert mesh from etc so now if i have
an<00:02:30.420> edit<00:02:30.690> mode<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.930> see<00:02:31.080> this<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.290> now<00:02:31.440> this

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
an edit mode you see this is now this

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.979 
an edit mode you see this is now this
all<00:02:32.130> this<00:02:32.310> mesh<00:02:32.970> underneath<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.780> i'm<00:02:33.870> going

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
all this mesh underneath and i'm going

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.370 
all this mesh underneath and i'm going
to<00:02:35.330> demonstrate<00:02:36.330> one<00:02:36.870> thing<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.230> was<00:02:37.350> a

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
to demonstrate one thing that was a

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.320 
to demonstrate one thing that was a
little<00:02:37.800> bit<00:02:38.040> annoying<00:02:38.430> when<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.730> was<00:02:38.880> figuring

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
little bit annoying when I was figuring

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.840 
little bit annoying when I was figuring
this<00:02:39.450> stuff<00:02:39.510> out<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.200> if<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.739> select<00:02:41.550> this

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
this stuff out of you if you select this

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.360 
this stuff out of you if you select this
like<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.330> bevels<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.530> tops<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:44.010> text<00:02:44.310> and

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
like the bevels and the tops of text and

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.460 
like the bevels and the tops of text and
everything<00:02:44.760> by<00:02:45.150> default<00:02:45.390> are<00:02:45.780> not<00:02:45.959> connected

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
everything by default are not connected

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.560 
everything by default are not connected
together<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:47.070> I'm<00:02:47.160> going<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.660> go<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.769> mesh

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
together so I'm going to go to mesh

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.940 
together so I'm going to go to mesh
vertices<00:02:52.220> remove<00:02:53.220> doubles<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:54.110> that's<00:02:55.110> to

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
vertices remove doubles and that's to

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.870 
vertices remove doubles and that's to
780<00:02:56.670> vertices<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:57.780> almost<00:02:58.560> 3,000<00:02:59.370> vertices

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
780 vertices so almost 3,000 vertices

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.289 
780 vertices so almost 3,000 vertices
were<00:03:00.090> removed<00:03:00.360> by<00:03:00.570> that<00:03:00.750> little<00:03:00.840> process<00:03:02.299> but

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
were removed by that little process but

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.009 
were removed by that little process but
now<00:03:03.390> this<00:03:03.570> is<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.750> manifold<00:03:04.230> mesh<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:06.019> that's

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
now this is a manifold mesh and that's

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.900 
now this is a manifold mesh and that's
you<00:03:07.380> can<00:03:07.470> see<00:03:07.590> all<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.950> details<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:08.610> there<00:03:08.790> and

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
you can see all the details in there and

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.270 
you can see all the details in there and
these<00:03:09.000> are<00:03:09.120> all<00:03:09.150> in<00:03:09.410> quads<00:03:10.410> on<00:03:10.709> those<00:03:10.860> bevels

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
these are all in quads on those bevels

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.530 
these are all in quads on those bevels
and<00:03:11.489> everything<00:03:12.049> so<00:03:13.049> that's<00:03:13.290> an<00:03:14.480> object<00:03:15.480> you

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
and everything so that's an object you

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.300 
and everything so that's an object you
could<00:03:15.690> export<00:03:16.110> but<00:03:16.410> I'm<00:03:16.560> going<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:16.769> go<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:16.950> step

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
could export but I'm going to go a step

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.060 
could export but I'm going to go a step
further<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:17.790> add<00:03:18.390> in<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:19.110> thing<00:03:19.470> called<00:03:19.500> a

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
further and add in a thing called a

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.140 
further and add in a thing called a
curve<00:03:21.410> i'm<00:03:22.410> going<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.709> edit<00:03:22.830> it<00:03:23.100> by<00:03:23.489> scaling<00:03:23.940> it

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
curve i'm going to edit it by scaling it

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.729 
curve i'm going to edit it by scaling it
up<00:03:24.209> quite<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.570> bit<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.110> that<00:03:25.140> it's<00:03:25.380> sort<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.650> on

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
up quite a bit so that it's sort of on

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.920 
up quite a bit so that it's sort of on
the<00:03:25.830> same<00:03:26.010> order<00:03:26.549> of<00:03:26.580> magnitude<00:03:26.700> is<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.600> texts

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
the same order of magnitude is the texts

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.670 
the same order of magnitude is the texts
that<00:03:28.080> are<00:03:28.110> seeing<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:30.170> i'm<00:03:31.170> going<00:03:31.380> to<00:03:31.500> add<00:03:31.650> a

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
that are seeing and i'm going to add a

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.460 
that are seeing and i'm going to add a
modifier<00:03:32.130> to<00:03:32.970> this<00:03:33.150> thing<00:03:33.420> that<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:34.170> called

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
modifier to this thing that is called

curve<00:03:34.920> i'm<00:03:35.880> going<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.180> select<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:36.780> career

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
curve i'm going to select that career

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.600 
curve i'm going to select that career
that<00:03:37.290> i<00:03:37.350> just<00:03:37.560> picked<00:03:37.769> as<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.010> thing<00:03:38.400> that's

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
that i just picked as the thing that's

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.490 
that i just picked as the thing that's
modifying<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.240> and<00:03:39.390> now

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
modifying it and now

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.840 
modifying it and now
move<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:44.260> that<00:03:44.290> kind<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.710> cool<00:03:44.890> when<00:03:45.490> i<00:03:45.520> move

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
move and that kind of cool when i move

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.510 
move and that kind of cool when i move
the<00:03:46.210> the<00:03:46.870> control<00:03:47.410> points<00:03:47.800> on<00:03:47.920> that<00:03:48.040> curve<00:03:48.310> it

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
the the control points on that curve it

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.770 
the the control points on that curve it
distorts<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.570> text<00:03:50.050> along<00:03:50.350> that<00:03:50.710> curve<00:03:50.920> so<00:03:51.780> do

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
distorts the text along that curve so do

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.180 
distorts the text along that curve so do
something<00:03:53.050> kind<00:03:53.440> of<00:03:53.970> like<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.980> as<00:03:56.980> you<00:03:57.100> go

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
something kind of like this as you go

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.860 
something kind of like this as you go
too<00:03:57.250> far<00:03:57.580> you're<00:03:57.820> eventually<00:03:58.240> be<00:03:58.330> distorting

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
too far you're eventually be distorting

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.870 
too far you're eventually be distorting
it<00:03:58.990> into<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.320> non<00:03:59.620> manifold<00:04:00.220> mesh<00:04:00.459> like<00:04:00.670> I<00:04:00.760> do

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
it into a non manifold mesh like I do

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.449 
it into a non manifold mesh like I do
this<00:04:01.090> this<00:04:01.390> is<00:04:01.510> probably<00:04:02.100> starting<00:04:03.100> a<00:04:03.190> self

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
this this is probably starting a self

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.010 
this this is probably starting a self
intersect<00:04:04.030> so<00:04:04.870> I<00:04:05.040> stick<00:04:06.040> to<00:04:06.130> something<00:04:06.340> fairly

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
intersect so I stick to something fairly

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.150 
intersect so I stick to something fairly
modest<00:04:09.870> with<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:11.020> distortions<00:04:11.620> I<00:04:11.800> can<00:04:11.950> be

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
modest with the distortions I can be

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.350 
modest with the distortions I can be
pretty<00:04:12.430> confident<00:04:12.880> that<00:04:13.000> that's<00:04:13.060> going<00:04:13.270> to

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
pretty confident that that's going to

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.830 
pretty confident that that's going to
stay<00:04:13.600> manifold<00:04:14.640> so<00:04:15.640> that<00:04:15.910> that's<00:04:16.299> probably<00:04:16.570> a

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
stay manifold so that that's probably a

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.710 
stay manifold so that that's probably a
manifold<00:04:17.350> mesh<00:04:17.650> but<00:04:18.100> it's<00:04:18.160> also<00:04:18.430> pretty<00:04:19.419> cool

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
manifold mesh but it's also pretty cool

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.590 
manifold mesh but it's also pretty cool
and<00:04:19.959> strange<00:04:20.320> looking<00:04:20.650> and<00:04:20.859> I'm<00:04:21.040> going<00:04:21.190> to<00:04:21.220> add

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
and strange looking and I'm going to add

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.210 
and strange looking and I'm going to add
another<00:04:22.600> wrinkle<00:04:23.410> to<00:04:23.710> this<00:04:23.740> which<00:04:24.040> is<00:04:24.130> I'm

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
another wrinkle to this which is I'm

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.120 
another wrinkle to this which is I'm
going<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:24.810> shrink<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:26.020> top<00:04:26.200> part<00:04:26.500> which<00:04:27.010> is

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
going to shrink the top part which is

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.210 
going to shrink the top part which is
another<00:04:27.340> thing<00:04:27.580> you<00:04:28.380> can<00:04:29.380> get<00:04:29.620> away<00:04:29.710> with<00:04:30.010> with

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
another thing you can get away with with

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.000 
another thing you can get away with with
lender<00:04:30.550> so<00:04:30.700> now<00:04:30.850> I've<00:04:31.030> got<00:04:31.150> something<00:04:31.330> really

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
lender so now I've got something really

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.190 
lender so now I've got something really
pretty<00:04:33.010> funky-looking<00:04:33.490> but<00:04:34.360> I<00:04:34.630> think<00:04:35.110> it's

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
pretty funky-looking but I think it's

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.060 
pretty funky-looking but I think it's
pretty<00:04:35.290> neat<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:37.140> now<00:04:38.140> I'm<00:04:38.410> going<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:38.770> export

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
pretty neat and now I'm going to export

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.580 
pretty neat and now I'm going to export
this<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:40.210> go<00:04:40.930> to<00:04:40.990> export<00:04:41.980> stl<00:04:42.880> I<00:04:43.260> can<00:04:44.260> now<00:04:44.380> just

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
this and go to export stl I can now just

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.760 
this and go to export stl I can now just
go<00:04:44.800> to<00:04:44.860> my<00:04:46.320> other<00:04:47.320> programs<00:04:47.800> /<00:04:48.280> blender<00:04:49.060> files
