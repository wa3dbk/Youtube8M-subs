00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
peeing outside of the litter box

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.750 
peeing outside of the litter box
actually<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.379> one<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.860> most<00:00:38.070> common

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
actually this is one of the most common

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.140 
actually this is one of the most common

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
you might like to hear why from the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.090 
you might like to hear why from the
cat's<00:00:44.760> point<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.360> view<00:00:45.629> they<00:00:46.290> sometimes<00:00:46.559> pee

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
cat's point of view they sometimes pee

upside<00:00:47.519> the<00:00:47.670> litter<00:00:47.850> box<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:50.010> first<00:00:50.280> reason

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
upside the litter box the first reason

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.000 
upside the litter box the first reason
is<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.660> they<00:00:51.780> probably<00:00:52.020> don't<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
is that they probably don't like the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.389 
is that they probably don't like the
location<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.149> box<00:00:54.649> maybe<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.950> have<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.280> in

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
location of the box maybe you have it in

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.220 
location of the box maybe you have it in
somewhere<00:00:56.789> that's<00:00:56.969> convenient<00:00:57.570> for<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.960> but

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
somewhere that's convenient for you but

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.100 
somewhere that's convenient for you but
perhaps<00:00:59.160> from<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.520> cat's<00:00:59.850> perspective<00:01:00.629> they

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
perhaps from the cat's perspective they

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.219 
perhaps from the cat's perspective they
find<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.590> noisy<00:01:02.370> or<00:01:02.640> maybe<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:03.510> not<00:01:03.690> private

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
find it noisy or maybe it's not private

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.520 
find it noisy or maybe it's not private
enough<00:01:04.759> the<00:01:05.759> second<00:01:06.210> most<00:01:06.390> common<00:01:06.509> reason<00:01:06.930> is

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
enough the second most common reason is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.100 
enough the second most common reason is
that<00:01:07.590> they<00:01:08.220> may<00:01:08.430> not<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.479> litter<00:01:09.780> that

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that they may not like the litter that

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.160 
that they may not like the litter that
you<00:01:10.410> put<00:01:10.710> inside<00:01:11.190> the<00:01:11.490> box<00:01:11.869> cats<00:01:12.869> are<00:01:13.140> very

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
you put inside the box cats are very

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.490 
you put inside the box cats are very
picky<00:01:13.979> about<00:01:14.130> having<00:01:14.910> very<00:01:15.270> soft<00:01:15.780> litter<00:01:16.170> so

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
picky about having very soft litter so

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.190 
picky about having very soft litter so
that<00:01:16.649> it<00:01:16.740> feels<00:01:16.979> good<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.310> their<00:01:17.640> paws<00:01:18.200> they

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
that it feels good on their paws they

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.320 
that it feels good on their paws they
also<00:01:19.380> tend<00:01:20.039> not<00:01:20.190> to<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.729> litter<00:01:21.030> that's

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
also tend not to like litter that's

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.440 
also tend not to like litter that's
perfumed<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.800> may<00:01:22.979> be<00:01:23.039> nice<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.700> us<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:24.330> it

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
perfumed it may be nice for us but it

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.980 
perfumed it may be nice for us but it
smells<00:01:24.750> very<00:01:24.990> strange<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.890> them<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:27.750> third

smells very strange to them the third
most<00:01:28.319> common<00:01:28.770> reason<00:01:29.130> applies<00:01:29.819> to<00:01:30.330> multiple

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
most common reason applies to multiple
