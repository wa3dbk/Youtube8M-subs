00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
anything like that but you know it is

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.469 
anything like that but you know it is
pretty<00:02:04.380> pretty<00:02:04.979> similar<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.820> Echelon<00:02:06.299> in

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
pretty pretty similar to the Echelon in

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.169 
pretty pretty similar to the Echelon in
my<00:02:06.600> opinion<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.110> far<00:02:07.320> as<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:08.429> know<00:02:08.550> designs<00:02:08.940> in

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
my opinion as far as you know designs in

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.430 
my opinion as far as you know designs in
the<00:02:09.270> pocket<00:02:09.629> clip<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.959> things<00:02:10.080> like<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.259> so

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
the pocket clip and things like that so

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.510 
the pocket clip and things like that so
I<00:02:10.619> think<00:02:10.739> it's<00:02:10.950> going<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.160> be<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> pretty

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
I think it's going to be a pretty

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.170 
I think it's going to be a pretty
comfortable<00:02:12.030> EDC<00:02:12.450> knife

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
clip that's actually on the Echelon so I

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.490 
clip that's actually on the Echelon so I
know<00:02:49.299> that<00:02:49.599> you<00:02:49.930> know<00:02:50.049> it<00:02:50.139> rides<00:02:50.379> pretty

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500

pretty<00:02:51.220> nice<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.669> deep<00:02:51.849> but<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.569> is<00:02:52.720> easy<00:02:53.049> to

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
pretty nice and deep but it is easy to

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.960 
pretty nice and deep but it is easy to
actually<00:02:53.859> remove<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.340> knife<00:02:54.489> when<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:54.730> need

to<00:02:55.060> go<00:02:55.180> ahead<00:02:55.419> and<00:02:55.569> use<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.739> pocket<00:02:57.280> clip

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
to go ahead and use it the pocket clip

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.240 
to go ahead and use it the pocket clip
is<00:02:57.639> a<00:02:58.000> four<00:02:58.450> for<00:02:59.049> precision<00:02:59.379> pocket<00:02:59.799> clip<00:02:59.950> so

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
is a four for precision pocket clip so

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.119 
is a four for precision pocket clip so
it<00:03:00.579> comes<00:03:00.909> right<00:03:01.480> hand<00:03:01.750> tip<00:03:01.989> up<00:03:02.169> carry<00:03:02.439> but<00:03:03.040> you

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
can switch it to tip down keri or left

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.420 
can switch it to tip down keri or left
left-handed<00:03:06.340> tip<00:03:06.579> up<00:03:06.730> or<00:03:06.939> tip<00:03:07.180> down<00:03:07.329> Keri<00:03:07.659> now

there and they they actually inserted a
stainless<00:03:24.549> steel<00:03:24.579> plate<00:03:25.470> 22<00:03:26.470> basically<00:03:26.919> what

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
stainless steel plate 22 basically what

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.649 
stainless steel plate 22 basically what
they<00:03:27.190> did<00:03:27.400> is<00:03:27.519> they<00:03:27.549> created<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.150> frame<00:03:28.419> lock

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:28.659 
they did is they created a frame lock

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.599 
they did is they created a frame lock
then<00:03:29.379> what<00:03:29.530> kirsch<00:03:29.739> is<00:03:29.919> doing<00:03:30.220> is<00:03:30.370> they

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
then what kirsch is doing is they

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.149 
then what kirsch is doing is they
actually<00:03:31.090> calling<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:32.019> a<00:03:32.169> subframe<00:03:32.769> lock

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
actually calling it a subframe lock

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:34.469 
actually calling it a subframe lock
because<00:03:33.639> of<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:33.939> fact<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:34.239> they<00:03:34.449> are

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:34.479 
because of the fact that they are

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:38.159 
because of the fact that they are
inserted<00:03:35.290> it<00:03:35.409> there<00:03:35.650> so<00:03:35.949> I<00:03:36.389> mean<00:03:37.389> obviously

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
inserted it there so I mean obviously

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.589 
inserted it there so I mean obviously
it's<00:03:38.650> something<00:03:39.280> else<00:03:39.549> to<00:03:39.699> test<00:03:39.970> just<00:03:40.299> to<00:03:40.389> see

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
it's something else to test just to see

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.559 
it's something else to test just to see
how<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:40.870> does<00:03:41.049> but<00:03:41.799> so<00:03:42.430> far<00:03:42.639> the<00:03:43.060> reviews<00:03:43.419> that

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
how it does but so far the reviews that

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.509 
how it does but so far the reviews that
I've<00:03:43.659> seen<00:03:43.930> have<00:03:44.290> been<00:03:44.560> pretty<00:03:44.769> been<00:03:45.250> pretty

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
I've seen have been pretty been pretty

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.399 
I've seen have been pretty been pretty
favorable<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:46.299> I<00:03:46.509> don't<00:03:47.049> think<00:03:47.199> there's<00:03:47.319> going

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
favorable so I don't think there's going

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:49.949 
favorable so I don't think there's going
to<00:03:47.500> be<00:03:47.560> any<00:03:47.620> issues<00:03:48.069> with<00:03:48.250> it<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:49.359> the<00:03:49.780> way

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
to be any issues with it the the way

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.439 
to be any issues with it the the way
down<00:03:50.109> the<00:03:50.229> knife<00:03:50.379> itself<00:03:50.530> is<00:03:50.919> 3.6<00:03:51.579> ounces<00:03:52.120> so

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
down the knife itself is 3.6 ounces so

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.659 
down the knife itself is 3.6 ounces so
it's<00:03:52.599> definitely<00:03:52.930> you<00:03:53.530> know<00:03:53.650> not<00:03:53.979> not<00:03:54.340> a<00:03:54.400> heavy

you do have dual thumb studs which helps
you<00:05:13.490> deploy<00:05:14.449> the<00:05:14.599> blade<00:05:14.779> as<00:05:14.900> well<00:05:15.080> so<00:05:15.349> you<00:05:15.949> need

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
you deploy the blade as well so you need

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.950 
you deploy the blade as well so you need
to<00:05:16.189> do<00:05:16.370> that<00:05:16.400> you<00:05:16.909> know<00:05:17.029> you<00:05:17.449> can<00:05:17.599> do<00:05:17.689> it<00:05:17.719> that

way also and again here is that a

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.640 
way also and again here is that a
subframe<00:05:21.860> lock<00:05:22.219> you<00:05:22.939> guys<00:05:23.120> can<00:05:23.300> see<00:05:23.650> early

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
subframe lock you guys can see early

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.860 
subframe lock you guys can see early
lock<00:05:24.889> up<00:05:25.099> on<00:05:25.279> there<00:05:25.550> which<00:05:25.909> is<00:05:25.939> which<00:05:26.509> is<00:05:26.659> nice

which is the model number all right go
ahead<00:06:02.689> and<00:06:03.400> focus<00:06:04.400> this<00:06:04.759> and<00:06:04.969> again<00:06:05.080> so<00:06:06.080> you

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:11.659 
really solid sturdy knife I think it's

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:13.809 
really solid sturdy knife I think it's
going<00:06:11.750> to<00:06:11.810> be<00:06:11.900> like<00:06:12.110> i<00:06:12.229> like<00:06:12.560> i<00:06:12.680> said<00:06:12.919> a<00:06:13.099> great

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:13.819 
going to be like i like i said a great

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:16.029 
going to be like i like i said a great
EDC<00:06:14.419> knife<00:06:14.449> i<00:06:14.900> mean<00:06:15.199> i'll<00:06:15.349> show<00:06:15.589> you<00:06:15.650> by<00:06:15.860> way<00:06:16.009> of

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 
EDC knife i mean i'll show you by way of

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:22.350 
EDC knife i mean i'll show you by way of
comparison<00:06:16.279> i<00:06:16.729> do<00:06:16.789> have<00:06:17.060> the<00:06:17.379> Echelon<00:06:18.379> here<00:06:19.659> so

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
comparison i do have the Echelon here so

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.260 
comparison i do have the Echelon here so
there<00:06:23.360> you<00:06:23.479> go<00:06:23.509> now<00:06:23.900> the<00:06:24.460> the<00:06:25.460> blade<00:06:25.729> length<00:06:25.969> on

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
there you go now the the blade length on

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.570 
there you go now the the blade length on
the<00:06:26.629> on<00:06:26.900> the<00:06:26.960> knockout<00:06:27.680> is<00:06:27.710> three<00:06:28.370> and<00:06:28.400> a

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
the on the knockout is three and a

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.550 
the on the knockout is three and a
quarter<00:06:28.759> inches<00:06:28.939> and<00:06:29.509> then<00:06:30.229> you<00:06:30.349> get<00:06:30.439> an

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
quarter inches and then you get an

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.439 
quarter inches and then you get an
overall<00:06:30.860> length<00:06:31.159> of<00:06:31.370> seven<00:06:31.759> and<00:06:31.939> seven

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:32.449 
overall length of seven and seven

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:35.199 
overall length of seven and seven
eighths<00:06:32.629> inches<00:06:33.349> so<00:06:33.969> obviously<00:06:34.969> it's<00:06:35.149> a

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:35.209 
eighths inches so obviously it's a

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:37.420 
eighths inches so obviously it's a
little<00:06:35.630> bit<00:06:35.750> bigger<00:06:35.930> than<00:06:36.139> the<00:06:36.319> Echelon<00:06:36.800> but

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
little bit bigger than the Echelon but

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.459 
little bit bigger than the Echelon but
it's<00:06:37.580> still<00:06:37.789> pretty<00:06:38.449> manageable<00:06:38.810> size<00:06:39.199> for

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:39.469 
it's still pretty manageable size for

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.910 
it's still pretty manageable size for
every<00:06:39.649> day
