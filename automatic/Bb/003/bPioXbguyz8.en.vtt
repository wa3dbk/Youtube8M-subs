something someone else said that can

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.280 
something someone else said that can

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
lie and you go through that and like

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.509 
lie and you go through that and like
heavy<00:03:30.600> rain<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.380> can<00:03:31.590> fail<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.250> story

realize<00:03:45.000> there<00:03:45.269> are<00:03:45.390> 15<00:03:45.900> different<00:03:45.930> things

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
realize there are 15 different things

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.900 
realize there are 15 different things
you<00:03:46.560> can<00:03:46.680> call<00:03:46.860> them<00:03:47.010> on<00:03:47.100> again<00:03:47.220> worried<00:03:47.580> which

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
you can call them on again worried which

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.430 
you can call them on again worried which
I<00:03:48.030> thought<00:03:48.180> was<00:03:48.300> incredible<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:48.930> it<00:03:49.080> branches

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
I thought was incredible and it branches

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.530 
I thought was incredible and it branches
out<00:03:49.709> in<00:03:49.890> different<00:03:50.280> ways<00:03:50.400> as<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:51.060> cases<00:03:51.209> get

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
out in different ways as the cases get

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.300 
out in different ways as the cases get
more<00:03:51.720> complex<00:03:52.110> you<00:03:52.260> can<00:03:52.380> you<00:03:52.590> realize<00:03:52.920> oh<00:03:53.070> hold

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
more complex you can you realize oh hold

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.960 
more complex you can you realize oh hold
on<00:03:53.370> this<00:03:53.550> would<00:03:53.670> have<00:03:53.760> played<00:03:53.880> out

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
on this would have played out

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.430 
on this would have played out
differently<00:03:54.300> if<00:03:54.390> I'd<00:03:54.450> done<00:03:54.600> it<00:03:54.660> that<00:03:54.900> way<00:03:54.930> you

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
differently if I'd done it that way you

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.220 
differently if I'd done it that way you
can<00:03:55.620> replay<00:03:56.120> cases<00:03:57.120> it's<00:03:57.630> worth<00:03:57.750> doing<00:03:58.019> it<00:03:58.110> and

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
can replay cases it's worth doing it and

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.690 
can replay cases it's worth doing it and
sometimes<00:03:58.380> if<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:58.739> do<00:03:58.860> well<00:03:59.040> in<00:03:59.160> one<00:03:59.280> try<00:03:59.640> to

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
sometimes if you do well in one try to

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.550 
sometimes if you do well in one try to
do<00:03:59.790> really<00:03:59.970> poorly<00:04:00.030> it's<00:04:00.570> interesting<00:04:00.810> okay

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
do really poorly it's interesting okay

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.600 
do really poorly it's interesting okay
now<00:04:01.650> what<00:04:01.769> about<00:04:01.830> that<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.220> mentioned<00:04:02.550> that

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
now what about that you mentioned that

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.340 
now what about that you mentioned that
there<00:04:02.790> is<00:04:02.820> shooting<00:04:03.330> an<00:04:03.450> action<00:04:03.810> when<00:04:04.200> it's

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
there is shooting an action when it's

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.810 
there is shooting an action when it's
serviceable<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:04.830> that<00:04:05.130> actual<00:04:05.370> story<00:04:05.670> of<00:04:05.730> that

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
serviceable to that actual story of that

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.180 
serviceable to that actual story of that
investigation<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:06.450> that<00:04:06.840> solid<00:04:07.440> it's<00:04:08.040> not

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
investigation is that solid it's not

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.310 
investigation is that solid it's not
very<00:04:08.850> familiar<00:04:09.120> I've<00:04:09.780> never<00:04:09.930> felt<00:04:10.170> that

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
very familiar I've never felt that

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.080 
very familiar I've never felt that
combat<00:04:10.620> was<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.830> strongest<00:04:11.190> aspect<00:04:11.580> of<00:04:11.640> a

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
combat was the strongest aspect of a

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.699 
combat was the strongest aspect of a
rockstar<00:04:12.360> game<00:04:12.600> what's<00:04:12.959> neat<00:04:13.170> here<00:04:13.200> is<00:04:13.440> it's

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
rockstar game what's neat here is it's

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.320 
rockstar game what's neat here is it's
not<00:04:13.890> very<00:04:14.160> challenging<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:14.880> I<00:04:14.940> think<00:04:15.209> it<00:04:15.299> fits

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
not very challenging and I think it fits

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.509 
not very challenging and I think it fits
the<00:04:15.690> narrative<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:16.260> are<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.799> cops<00:04:17.010> they<00:04:17.400> are

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
the narrative you are the cops they are

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.190 
the narrative you are the cops they are
the<00:04:17.700> robbers<00:04:17.850> right<00:04:18.299> you<00:04:18.510> really<00:04:18.750> are<00:04:18.900> kind<00:04:19.080> of

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
the robbers right you really are kind of

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.599 
the robbers right you really are kind of
the<00:04:19.320> hero<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.650> story<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:20.070> towards<00:04:20.459> the

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
the hero of the story and towards the

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.850 
the hero of the story and towards the
end<00:04:20.640> because<00:04:21.479> it's<00:04:21.690> this<00:04:22.289> becomes<00:04:22.680> very

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
end because it's this becomes very

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.640 
end because it's this becomes very
Norrish<00:04:23.370> and

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
Norrish and

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.450 
Norrish and
there's<00:04:23.770> a<00:04:23.860> point<00:04:24.130> where<00:04:24.250> it<00:04:24.310> gets<00:04:24.430> very

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
there's a point where it gets very

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.490 
there's a point where it gets very
claustrophobic<00:04:24.729> and<00:04:25.389> some<00:04:25.960> of<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.080> action<00:04:26.410> at

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
claustrophobic and some of the action at

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.260 
claustrophobic and some of the action at
the<00:04:26.530> end<00:04:26.710> is<00:04:26.830> very<00:04:26.889> cathartic<00:04:27.370> it's<00:04:28.090> not

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
the end is very cathartic it's not
