wheel<00:01:08.040> wells<00:01:08.370> there<00:01:08.790> we<00:01:08.909> go<00:01:09.090> same<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> rear

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
wheel wells there we go same on the rear

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.820 
wheel wells there we go same on the rear
there<00:01:11.490> we<00:01:11.670> go<00:01:12.530> same<00:01:13.530> sort<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.030> routing<00:01:15.800> gain<00:01:16.800> a

wells<00:01:21.110> now<00:01:22.110> let's<00:01:22.409> look<00:01:22.590> at<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.150> concave<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
wells now let's look at this concave and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.859 
wells now let's look at this concave and
shape<00:01:24.800> so<00:01:25.800> it's<00:01:26.010> got<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> slight<00:01:26.549> concave<00:01:27.149> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
shape so it's got a slight concave and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.469 
shape so it's got a slight concave and
it's<00:01:28.049> slightly<00:01:28.380> dropped<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.820> see<00:01:30.090> though<00:01:30.299> he

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
it's slightly dropped and see though he

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.929 
it's slightly dropped and see though he
can<00:01:30.630> just<00:01:30.960> see<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.560> shadow<00:01:31.829> hear<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.490> slight

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
can just see the shadow hear of a slight

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.569 
can just see the shadow hear of a slight
drop<00:01:33.420> there<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.770> behind<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.159> front<00:01:35.189> bolts

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
drop there just behind the front bolts

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.380 
drop there just behind the front bolts
and<00:01:36.590> then<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.799> got<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.039> gas<00:01:38.219> pedals<00:01:38.700> there<00:01:39.240> we

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
and then you got the gas pedals there we

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:47.810 
and then you got the gas pedals there we
go<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:42.710> more<00:01:43.710> back<00:01:44.219> and<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:45.000> sort<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:46.100> slight<00:01:47.100> w

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
go and more back and a sort of slight w

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.740 
go and more back and a sort of slight w
concave<00:01:48.619> yeah

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
concave yeah

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.770 
concave yeah
I<00:01:50.780> can<00:01:51.230> show<00:01:51.500> that<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.860> egg<00:01:52.010> gr<00:01:52.820> see<00:01:53.510> a<00:01:53.840> shadow

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
I can show that the egg gr see a shadow

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.290 
I can show that the egg gr see a shadow
so<00:01:56.780> it's<00:01:57.260> ever<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:57.680> slightly<00:01:58.160> here<00:01:58.580> and<00:01:58.880> back

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
so it's ever so slightly here and back

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.480 
so it's ever so slightly here and back
up<00:01:59.479> again<00:02:00.010> and<00:02:01.690> again<00:02:02.690> on<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:03.020> rear<00:02:03.310> just<00:02:04.310> a

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
up again and again on the rear just a

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.380 
up again and again on the rear just a
little<00:02:04.640> sort<00:02:04.910> of<00:02:04.940> pocket<00:02:05.410> very<00:02:06.410> subtle<00:02:07.390> okay

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
little sort of pocket very subtle okay

little sort of pocket very subtle okay
ah<00:02:08.630> one<00:02:09.110> thing<00:02:09.320> you<00:02:09.410> should<00:02:09.440> note<00:02:10.660> when<00:02:11.660> our

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
ah one thing you should note when our

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.660 
ah one thing you should note when our
completes<00:02:12.260> we<00:02:12.470> do<00:02:12.590> check<00:02:12.890> them<00:02:13.160> before<00:02:13.340> they

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
completes we do check them before they

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.620 
completes we do check them before they
go<00:02:13.850> out<00:02:13.880> they<00:02:14.090> come<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.260> us<00:02:15.320> assembled<00:02:15.980> but<00:02:16.220> we

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
go out they come to us assembled but we

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.449 
go out they come to us assembled but we
just<00:02:17.630> check<00:02:18.320> everything<00:02:18.590> first<00:02:19.190> thing<00:02:19.340> we

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
just check everything first thing we

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.690 
just check everything first thing we
noticed<00:02:19.850> was<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:20.530> they<00:02:21.530> did<00:02:21.830> not<00:02:21.860> come<00:02:22.400> with

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
noticed was that they did not come with

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.210 
noticed was that they did not come with
spacers<00:02:23.270> who<00:02:23.480> seems<00:02:23.900> most<00:02:24.170> odd<00:02:24.380> on<00:02:24.980> such<00:02:25.190> a

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
spacers who seems most odd on such a

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.699 
spacers who seems most odd on such a
premium<00:02:25.670> board<00:02:25.970> first<00:02:26.570> thing<00:02:26.750> we<00:02:26.900> do<00:02:27.110> we<00:02:27.470> put

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
premium board first thing we do we put

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.060 
premium board first thing we do we put
spaces<00:02:28.070> in<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.730> wheels<00:02:29.450> so<00:02:30.380> do<00:02:30.620> check<00:02:30.650> that

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
spaces in the wheels so do check that

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.310 
spaces in the wheels so do check that
something<00:02:34.070> we<00:02:34.160> actually<00:02:34.520> like<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.940> see

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
something we actually like to see

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.050 
something we actually like to see
supplied<00:02:36.320> already<00:02:36.709> but<00:02:36.980> as<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.550> say<00:02:37.730> is<00:02:37.880> worth

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
supplied already but as I say is worth

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.660 
supplied already but as I say is worth
checking<00:02:38.540> these<00:02:38.959> things<00:02:39.230> are<00:02:39.350> hidden<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:39.860> not

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
checking these things are hidden so not

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.300 
checking these things are hidden so not
everyone<00:02:40.910> will<00:02:41.150> pick<00:02:41.390> up<00:02:41.540> on<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.930> fact<00:02:42.310> right
