00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.499 
teasers again all this conjecture and
you<00:01:22.470> might<00:01:22.680> see<00:01:23.040> some<00:01:23.759> parallels<00:01:24.240> with

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
you might see some parallels with

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.480 
you might see some parallels with
zombies<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.140> characters<00:01:25.650> are<00:01:25.860> fab<00:01:26.130> four

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
zombies the characters are fab four

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.010 
zombies the characters are fab four
we're<00:01:26.759> being<00:01:26.939> tested<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.659> stuff<00:01:27.869> like

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
we're being tested on and stuff like

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.499 
we're being tested on and stuff like
that<00:01:28.159> replaced<00:01:29.159> with<00:01:29.340> certain<00:01:29.670> memories<00:01:30.060> see

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
that replaced with certain memories see

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.330 
that replaced with certain memories see
some<00:01:30.750> manipulation<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.220> can

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
some manipulation like that so you can

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.330 
some manipulation like that so you can
absolutely<00:01:32.549> see<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.630> zombies<00:01:34.320> type<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.680> idea<00:01:35.130> or

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
absolutely see a zombies type of idea or

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.130 
absolutely see a zombies type of idea or
effect<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.850> still<00:01:36.479> personally<00:01:36.840> don't<00:01:37.079> think

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
effect I still personally don't think

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.050 
effect I still personally don't think
this<00:01:37.290> has<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.530> do<00:01:37.619> with<00:01:37.650> zombie<00:01:38.070> now<00:01:38.670> they

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
this has to do with zombie now they

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.670 
this has to do with zombie now they
might<00:01:39.329> be<00:01:39.479> able<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.780> use<00:01:39.869> like<00:01:40.320> they<00:01:40.439> did<00:01:40.650> in

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
might be able to use like they did in

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.539 
might be able to use like they did in
black<00:01:41.340> ops<00:01:41.520> 1<00:01:41.640> Nova<00:01:42.390> six<00:01:42.780> was<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.829> campaign<00:01:44.340> but

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549

also<00:01:44.700> implemented<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.509> zombies<00:01:46.049> they<00:01:46.229> also

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
also implemented in zombies they also

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.050 
also implemented in zombies they also
had<00:01:46.590> explanations<00:01:47.130> for<00:01:47.250> both<00:01:47.430> those<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.880> both

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
had explanations for both those in both

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.510 
had explanations for both those in both
games<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.990> maybe<00:01:49.439> whatever<00:01:49.770> method<00:01:50.250> they<00:01:50.369> use

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
games so maybe whatever method they use

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.490
