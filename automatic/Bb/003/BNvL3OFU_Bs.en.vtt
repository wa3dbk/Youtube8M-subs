Wizards<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.120> follow<00:00:45.329> up<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.750> I'm<00:00:46.649> just

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
Wizards to follow up and I'm just

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.560 
Wizards to follow up and I'm just

debating on whether drop my heroes at

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.350 
debating on whether drop my heroes at
the<00:00:48.660> bottom<00:00:48.989> later<00:00:49.350> or<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:50.520> at<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.910> top<00:00:51.090> but

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the bottom later or just at the top but

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.939 
the bottom later or just at the top but
i<00:00:51.420> think<00:00:51.780> i'm<00:00:51.870> going<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.110> wait<00:00:52.320> until<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.770> end

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
i think i'm going to wait until the end

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.380 
i think i'm going to wait until the end
of<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.129> right<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.460> see<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.820> got<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.120> fifty

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
of the right to see if I got that fifty

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.549 
of the right to see if I got that fifty
percent<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.840> then<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.170> work<00:00:55.350> our<00:00:55.530> way

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
percent and then we can work our way

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.099 
percent and then we can work our way
from<00:00:55.680> there<00:00:56.030> so<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> Dragons<00:00:57.360> have<00:00:57.690> already

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
from there so the Dragons have already

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.810 
from there so the Dragons have already
caused<00:00:58.410> around<00:00:58.770> nineteen<00:00:59.219> percent<00:00:59.399> damage

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
caused around nineteen percent damage

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.310 
caused around nineteen percent damage
and<00:01:00.270> they're<00:01:00.420> getting<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> core<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
and they're getting to the core of the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.349 
and they're getting to the core of the
base<00:01:01.590> with<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.949> center<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.489> actually<00:01:02.730> some

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
base with the center of it actually some

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.969 
base with the center of it actually some
dragons<00:01:03.719> are<00:01:03.840> off<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> right<00:01:04.470> but<00:01:04.830> I'm

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
base to clear a path for my dragons

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.760 
base to clear a path for my dragons
don't<00:03:36.480> want<00:03:36.660> them<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.930> get<00:03:37.020> distracted<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.650> go

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
don't want them to get distracted and go

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:38.870 
don't want them to get distracted and go
on<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:37.950> outside<00:03:38.370> of<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.520> base<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:38.790> that's

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
on the outside of the base and that's

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.120 
on the outside of the base and that's
what<00:03:39.060> often<00:03:39.480> happens<00:03:39.510> when<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:40.500> do<00:03:40.770> when

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
what often happens when you do when

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.500 
what often happens when you do when
you're<00:03:41.250> going<00:03:41.370> with<00:03:41.580> dragons<00:03:42.060> or<00:03:42.209> something

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
you're going with dragons or something

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.930 
you're going with dragons or something
like<00:03:42.600> pekka's<00:03:43.110> they<00:03:43.709> always<00:03:44.070> get<00:03:44.250> distracted

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
like pekka's they always get distracted

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.520 
like pekka's they always get distracted
by<00:03:45.240> some<00:03:45.420> of<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.510> buildings<00:03:45.840> around<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.380> base

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
by some of the buildings around the base

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.650 
by some of the buildings around the base
so<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.310> Dragons<00:03:47.700> have<00:03:47.820> literally<00:03:48.120> just<00:03:48.480> been

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
so the Dragons have literally just been

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.730 
so the Dragons have literally just been
dropped<00:03:48.840> I'm<00:03:49.050> going<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.230> drop<00:03:49.350> to<00:03:49.560> raise

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
dropped I'm going to drop to raise

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.710 
dropped I'm going to drop to raise
spells<00:03:50.040> in<00:03:50.310> front<00:03:50.520> of<00:03:50.610> them<00:03:50.700> as<00:03:50.910> well<00:03:51.240> and<00:03:51.480> one

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
spells in front of them as well and one

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.690 
spells in front of them as well and one
of<00:03:51.840> them<00:03:51.959> completely<00:03:52.440> missed<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.130> two<00:03:53.550> of<00:03:53.610> the

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
of them completely missed and two of the

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.860 
of them completely missed and two of the
dragons<00:03:54.060> are<00:03:54.120> going<00:03:54.270> to<00:03:54.330> head<00:03:54.480> off<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.630> the

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
dragons are going to head off to the

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.360 
dragons are going to head off to the
side<00:03:55.110> staking<00:03:55.620> out<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.800> side<00:03:55.980> buildings

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
side staking out the side buildings

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.620 
side staking out the side buildings
that's<00:03:56.640> what<00:03:56.940> I<00:03:56.970> thought<00:03:57.240> was<00:03:57.420> gonna<00:03:57.570> happen

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
that's what I thought was gonna happen

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.449 
that's what I thought was gonna happen
so<00:03:58.350> client<00:03:58.650> castles<00:03:58.890> going<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.070> be<00:03:59.130> luring

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
so client castles going to be luring

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.040 
so client castles going to be luring
these<00:03:59.640> dragons<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.180> center<00:04:00.540> of<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.870> base

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
these dragons to the center of the base

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.720 
these dragons to the center of the base
and<00:04:01.350> I<00:04:01.830> didn't<00:04:02.040> really<00:04:02.160> want<00:04:02.430> that<00:04:02.550> to<00:04:02.670> happen

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
and I didn't really want that to happen

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.970 
and I didn't really want that to happen
I<00:04:03.120> wanted<00:04:04.050> some<00:04:04.260> of<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.410> Dragons<00:04:04.740> the<00:04:04.830> head

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
I wanted some of the Dragons the head

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.440 
I wanted some of the Dragons the head
over<00:04:05.160> to<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.400> dark<00:04:05.610> elixir<00:04:05.790> storage<00:04:06.300> or
