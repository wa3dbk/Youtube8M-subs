00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
which is orange but I had been looking

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.740 
which is orange but I had been looking
at<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.550> wallet<00:02:32.850> for<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.060> while<00:02:33.210> I<00:02:33.240> thought<00:02:33.570> it

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
at this wallet for a while I thought it

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.750 
at this wallet for a while I thought it
was<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.900> really<00:02:34.260> really<00:02:34.410> cool<00:02:34.740> concept<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.520> loved

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
was a really really cool concept I loved

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.630 
was a really really cool concept I loved
the<00:02:35.970> design<00:02:36.240> with<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.690> partial<00:02:37.200> EPI<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.800> the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
the design with the partial EPI and the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.840 
the design with the partial EPI and the
monogram<00:02:39.210> canvas<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:41.190> had<00:02:41.400> literally<00:02:41.730> been

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
monogram canvas and I had literally been

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.110 
monogram canvas and I had literally been
watching<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.630> review<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:43.010> I<00:02:44.010> can't<00:02:44.910> remember

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
watching the review of I can't remember

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.670 
watching the review of I can't remember
her<00:02:45.270> user<00:02:45.480> name<00:02:45.660> right<00:02:45.840> now<00:02:45.959> but<00:02:46.020> she<00:02:46.290> posted<00:02:46.590> a

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
her user name right now but she posted a

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.910 
her user name right now but she posted a
video<00:02:46.800> of<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:48.390> long<00:02:48.870> wallet<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.410> this<00:02:49.560> exact

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
video of the long wallet and this exact

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.970 
video of the long wallet and this exact
color<00:02:51.230> combination<00:02:52.230> with<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.470> orange<00:02:52.770> and

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
color combination with the orange and

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.380 
color combination with the orange and
the<00:02:53.100> brown<00:02:53.340> but<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.790> long<00:02:53.940> wallet<00:02:54.240> is<00:02:54.360> a

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
the brown but the long wallet is a

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.970 
the brown but the long wallet is a
little<00:02:54.690> bit<00:02:54.780> longer<00:02:54.990> obviously<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:55.950> the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
little bit longer obviously this is the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.030 
little bit longer obviously this is the
compact<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:57.390> I'd<00:02:58.200> literally<00:02:58.500> been<00:02:58.709> watching

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
compact and I'd literally been watching

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.570 
compact and I'd literally been watching
that<00:02:59.250> video<00:03:00.320> up<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:01.740> day<00:03:01.950> until<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.400> got

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
that video up to this day until I got

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.340 
that video up to this day until I got
this<00:03:02.790> one<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.240> what<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:03.780> really<00:03:04.020> like<00:03:04.140> is<00:03:04.320> that

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
this one and what I really like is that

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.080 
this one and what I really like is that
it<00:03:04.500> has<00:03:04.590> silver<00:03:04.830> hardware<00:03:05.310> which<00:03:05.700> is<00:03:05.730> really

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
it has silver hardware which is really

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.310 
it has silver hardware which is really
cool<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.980> it's<00:03:08.670> in<00:03:08.820> monogram<00:03:09.300> with<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.990> FB

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
cool and it's in monogram with the FB

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.320 
cool and it's in monogram with the FB
and<00:03:10.620> since<00:03:11.100> I<00:03:11.190> guess<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.670> EPI<00:03:11.940> piece<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.240> now

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
and since I guess the EPI piece is now

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.490 
and since I guess the EPI piece is now
had<00:03:12.480> silver<00:03:12.810> hardware<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:13.350> is

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
had silver hardware and this is

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.259 
had silver hardware and this is
connected<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.100> FPPC<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.760> had<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:15.000> make<00:03:15.120> it

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
connected to the FPPC I had to make it

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.860 
connected to the FPPC I had to make it
silver<00:03:16.430> but<00:03:17.430> when<00:03:17.580> you<00:03:17.700> open<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.209> there<00:03:18.630> is

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
silver but when you open it there is

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.120 
silver but when you open it there is
this<00:03:19.230> big<00:03:20.220> slot<00:03:20.850> right<00:03:21.150> here<00:03:21.540> which<00:03:21.780> is<00:03:22.130> kind

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
this big slot right here which is kind

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.650 
this big slot right here which is kind
of<00:03:23.190> too<00:03:23.340> big<00:03:23.519> for<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.700> credit<00:03:23.910> card<00:03:24.060> but<00:03:24.390> you<00:03:24.510> can

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
of too big for a credit card but you can

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.830 
of too big for a credit card but you can
store<00:03:24.959> like<00:03:25.110> receipts<00:03:25.950> or<00:03:26.190> stuff<00:03:26.430> in<00:03:26.610> here<00:03:26.850> I'm

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
store like receipts or stuff in here I'm

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.380 
store like receipts or stuff in here I'm
not<00:03:28.019> really<00:03:28.140> sure<00:03:28.380> but<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.850> put<00:03:30.000> stuff<00:03:30.120> in

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
not really sure but you put stuff in

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.460 
not really sure but you put stuff in
here<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.959> this<00:03:31.860> is<00:03:32.010> how<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.310> opens<00:03:32.670> up<00:03:32.910> again

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
here and this is how it opens up again

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.520 
here and this is how it opens up again
this<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.680> closed<00:03:35.390> opens<00:03:36.390> up<00:03:36.510> like<00:03:36.660> this<00:03:36.720> so

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
this is a closed opens up like this so

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.380 
this is a closed opens up like this so
you<00:03:37.620> hold<00:03:37.769> it<00:03:37.890> this<00:03:38.010> way<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.970> like<00:03:39.150> that

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
you hold it this way and I like that

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.180 
you hold it this way and I like that
because<00:03:39.540> it's<00:03:39.810> compact<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.380> long<00:03:40.590> wallet<00:03:41.040> is

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
because it's compact the long wallet is

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.940 
because it's compact the long wallet is
you<00:03:41.519> hold<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:42.060> like<00:03:42.180> this<00:03:42.380> but<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.530> comes<00:03:43.769> out<00:03:43.890> a

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
you hold it like this but it comes out a

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.520 
you hold it like this but it comes out a
lot<00:03:44.130> longer<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:44.880> just<00:03:45.120> seems<00:03:45.500> too<00:03:46.500> big

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
lot longer and it just seems too big

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.530 
lot longer and it just seems too big
this<00:03:47.160> way<00:03:47.370> for<00:03:47.640> me<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:49.940> but<00:03:50.940> I<00:03:50.970> really<00:03:51.269> do<00:03:51.420> like

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
this way for me so but I really do like

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.830 
this way for me so but I really do like
this<00:03:51.840> when<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.739> open<00:03:52.890> it<00:03:53.310> there's<00:03:54.180> four<00:03:54.480> card

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
this when you open it there's four card

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.120 
this when you open it there's four card
slots<00:03:55.170> here<00:03:56.180> you<00:03:57.180> can<00:03:57.330> see<00:03:57.570> that<00:03:58.010> there<00:03:59.010> is<00:03:59.100> a

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
slots here you can see that there is a

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.880 
slots here you can see that there is a
large<00:03:59.519> pocket<00:04:00.230> back<00:04:01.230> here<00:04:01.500> where<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:01.650> can<00:04:01.769> put

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
large pocket back here where you can put

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.620 
large pocket back here where you can put
your<00:04:02.040> cash<00:04:02.280> in<00:04:02.549> I<00:04:02.760> think<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.030> date<00:04:03.239> code<00:04:03.420> is

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
your cash in I think the date code is

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.900 
your cash in I think the date code is
back<00:04:03.840> here<00:04:04.080> too<00:04:04.380> I<00:04:04.739> didn't<00:04:05.400> even<00:04:05.519> look<00:04:05.670> for<00:04:05.730> the

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
back here too I didn't even look for the

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.750 
back here too I didn't even look for the
date<00:04:06.090> code<00:04:06.269> I'm<00:04:06.390> sorry<00:04:10.040> but<00:04:11.040> I<00:04:11.100> will<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.430> won't

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
date code I'm sorry but I will I won't

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.039 
date code I'm sorry but I will I won't
bother<00:04:11.880> with<00:04:12.030> that<00:04:12.180> right<00:04:12.450> now<00:04:12.480> I'll<00:04:12.750> probably

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
bother with that right now I'll probably

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.380 
bother with that right now I'll probably
do<00:04:13.560> a<00:04:13.590> separate<00:04:13.920> video<00:04:14.040> of<00:04:14.640> this<00:04:14.850> packed<00:04:15.150> and

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
do a separate video of this packed and

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.949 
do a separate video of this packed and
inside<00:04:15.600> my<00:04:15.630> bag<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.169> stuff<00:04:16.350> but<00:04:17.010> on<00:04:17.220> this<00:04:18.150> is

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
inside my bag and stuff but on this is

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.760 
inside my bag and stuff but on this is
what<00:04:19.080> it<00:04:19.169> looks<00:04:19.380> like<00:04:19.470> it<00:04:19.799> has

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:20.770 
what it looks like it has

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.290

the flap here is in monogram canvas
which<00:04:23.840> i<00:04:23.900> think<00:04:23.960> is<00:04:24.140> kind<00:04:24.320> of<00:04:24.380> cool<00:04:24.440> because

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
which i think is kind of cool because

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.650 
which i think is kind of cool because
since<00:04:25.400> this<00:04:25.490> is<00:04:25.670> orange<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.120> this<00:04:26.240> is<00:04:26.420> brown

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
since this is orange and this is brown

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.240 
since this is orange and this is brown
that's<00:04:26.930> kind<00:04:27.110> of<00:04:27.170> like<00:04:27.290> the<00:04:27.440> opposite<00:04:27.920> of<00:04:28.040> this

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
that's kind of like the opposite of this

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.190 
that's kind of like the opposite of this
it's<00:04:28.940> kind<00:04:29.090> of<00:04:29.120> cool<00:04:29.300> I<00:04:29.450> like<00:04:29.690> that<00:04:29.720> detail
