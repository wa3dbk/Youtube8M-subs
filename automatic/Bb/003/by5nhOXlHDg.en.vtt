may be feeding to one type of insect and

may be feeding to one type of insect and
that<00:00:59.010> insect<00:00:59.520> only<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.539> actually<00:01:01.230> that's<00:01:01.289> what

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
that insect only so actually that's what

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.569 
that insect only so actually that's what
I'm<00:01:01.530> doing<00:01:01.770> right<00:01:01.859> now<00:01:01.920> I'm<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.370> switch

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
I'm doing right now I'm going to switch

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.100 
I'm doing right now I'm going to switch
up<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.850> little<00:01:03.059> bit<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.449> see<00:01:03.660> if<00:01:03.750> we<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:03.930> match

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
up a little bit and see if we can match

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.450 
up a little bit and see if we can match
exactly<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.769> what<00:01:04.860> these<00:01:04.979> fish<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.309> feeding

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
exactly to what these fish are feeding

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.789 
exactly to what these fish are feeding
are<00:01:05.760> now<00:01:06.450> considering<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.320> those<00:01:07.470> things

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
are now considering all those things

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.710 
are now considering all those things

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
just because I sound like I know what

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.050 
just because I sound like I know what
I'm<00:01:09.869> talking<00:01:10.380> about<00:01:10.610> doesn't<00:01:11.610> mean<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.790> can

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
I'm talking about doesn't mean I can

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.210
