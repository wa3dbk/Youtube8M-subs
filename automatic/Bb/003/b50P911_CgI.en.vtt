00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
today we're gonna be doing a review on

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.340 
today we're gonna be doing a review on
the<00:00:01.650> 70<00:00:02.040> millimeter<00:00:02.429> 86a<00:00:03.240> orangutan<00:00:03.959> yellow

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
the 70 millimeter 86a orangutan yellow

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.900 
the 70 millimeter 86a orangutan yellow
stimulus<00:00:04.890> wheel<00:00:09.710> this<00:00:10.710> wheel<00:00:10.980> in<00:00:11.309> my<00:00:11.460> opinion

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
stimulus wheel this wheel in my opinion

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.490 
stimulus wheel this wheel in my opinion
is<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:14.070> best<00:00:14.280> wheel<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.750> I've<00:00:16.020> had

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
is is the best wheel in that I've had

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.040 
is is the best wheel in that I've had
I've<00:00:17.100> had<00:00:17.490> about<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:18.029> range<00:00:18.300> between<00:00:18.570> 8

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
I've had about a range between 8

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.679 
I've had about a range between 8
different<00:00:19.289> wheels<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.240> by<00:00:21.390> far<00:00:21.660> the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
different wheels and this is by far the

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.830 
different wheels and this is by far the
best<00:00:21.960> view<00:00:22.199> I've<00:00:22.320> ever<00:00:22.470> had<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:23.660> just<00:00:24.660> saying

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
best view I've ever had so just saying

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.339 
best view I've ever had so just saying
that<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.529> really<00:00:25.859> good<00:00:26.039> wheel<00:00:26.220> um<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:27.349> my

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
that it's a really good wheel um I my

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.099 
that it's a really good wheel um I my
longboard<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.340> mostly<00:00:29.849> are<00:00:30.539> doing<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.929> lot<00:00:31.080> of

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
longboard I mostly are doing a lot of

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.250 
longboard I mostly are doing a lot of
sliding<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.360> this<00:00:33.360> holds<00:00:33.719> up<00:00:33.930> really<00:00:34.140> well

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
sliding and this holds up really well

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:45.470 
sliding and this holds up really well
it's<00:00:34.739> an<00:00:34.860> 86<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.870> really<00:00:36.870> smooth<00:00:37.350> slides<00:00:44.480> very

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
it's an 86 a really smooth slides very

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.869 
it's an 86 a really smooth slides very
buttery<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.590> slides<00:00:46.980> like<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.250> dream

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
buttery it's it slides like a dream

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.450 
buttery it's it slides like a dream
pretty<00:00:48.270> much<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.960> really<00:00:49.559> good<00:00:49.739> when

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
pretty much it's it's really good when

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.430 
pretty much it's it's really good when
it<00:00:50.579> comes<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:50.940> cruising<00:00:51.480> if<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:52.199> don't

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
it comes it is cruising if you don't

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.430 
it comes it is cruising if you don't
know<00:00:52.590> many<00:00:52.860> slides<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.670> probably<00:00:54.390> wouldn't<00:00:55.199> get

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
know many slides I probably wouldn't get

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.260 
know many slides I probably wouldn't get
it<00:00:55.559> because<00:00:56.460> that's<00:00:56.579> kind<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.000> what<00:00:57.149> it's

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
it because that's kind of what it's

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.260 
it because that's kind of what it's
based<00:00:57.539> around<00:00:57.859> it's<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.039> whole<00:00:59.370> sliding

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
based around it's the whole sliding

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.580 
based around it's the whole sliding
feature<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.620> wheel<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.840> if<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.380> don't

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
feature of the wheel so if you don't

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.030 
feature of the wheel so if you don't
it's<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.900> wheel<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.560> want<00:01:10.950> to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it's just it's a wheel that you want to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.420 
it's just it's a wheel that you want to
slide<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:11.670> not<00:01:12.060> really<00:01:12.450> cruise<00:01:12.840> with<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.500> mean

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
slide with not really cruise with I mean

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.310 
slide with not really cruise with I mean
I<00:01:14.520> guess<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.000> cruise<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:15.750> like

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
I guess you can cruise of it but like

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.080 
I guess you can cruise of it but like
it's<00:01:16.590> kind<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.920> expensive<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.700> cruising

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
it's kind of expensive for a cruising

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.890 
it's kind of expensive for a cruising
wheel<00:01:18.210> if<00:01:18.299> you're<00:01:18.420> gonna<00:01:18.509> get<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.780> for

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
wheel if you're gonna get it for

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.520 
wheel if you're gonna get it for
cruising<00:01:19.939> but<00:01:20.939> sliding<00:01:22.369> yeah<00:01:24.380> things<00:01:25.380> that

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
cruising but sliding yeah things that

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.469 
cruising but sliding yeah things that
this<00:01:25.650> wheel<00:01:25.950> might<00:01:26.250> be<00:01:26.430> known<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:27.030> would<00:01:27.420> be

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
this wheel might be known for would be

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.069 
this wheel might be known for would be
holding<00:01:28.350> out<00:01:28.470> big<00:01:29.130> standard<00:01:29.820> slides<00:01:33.079> holding

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
holding out big standard slides holding

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.890 
holding out big standard slides holding
90<00:01:34.500> degrees<00:01:34.829> slides<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.490> not<00:01:35.790> flat<00:01:36.150> spotty<00:01:36.509> if

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
90 degrees slides and not flat spotty if

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.760 
90 degrees slides and not flat spotty if
you<00:01:37.860> want<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.220> wheel<00:01:38.460> for<00:01:39.150> sliding<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
you want a wheel for sliding and you

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.960 
you want a wheel for sliding and you
know<00:01:40.890> your<00:01:41.070> other<00:01:41.189> wheels<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.640> been<00:01:41.670> wearing

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
know your other wheels have been wearing

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.960 
know your other wheels have been wearing
down<00:01:42.240> really<00:01:42.750> fast<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.530> would<00:01:44.310> highly

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
down really fast I would highly

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.300 
down really fast I would highly
recommend<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.990> orangutan<00:01:46.590> yellow<00:01:46.799> stimulus

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
recommend the orangutan yellow stimulus

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.950 
recommend the orangutan yellow stimulus
a<00:01:47.490> six<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.000> wheel<00:01:48.829> it<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.250> I'm<00:01:50.970> planning<00:01:51.869> on

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
a six a wheel it I I'm planning on

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.830 
a six a wheel it I I'm planning on
riding<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.470> forever<00:01:52.770> really<00:01:53.399> like<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.000> I'd

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
riding this forever really like I I'd

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.709 
riding this forever really like I I'd
use<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.170> lot<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.439> slides<00:01:56.149> little<00:01:57.149> flatland

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
use a lot of slides little flatland

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.350 
use a lot of slides little flatland
tricks<00:01:57.930> but<00:01:58.229> mostly<00:01:58.590> slides<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.369> this<00:02:00.030> just

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
tricks but mostly slides and this just

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.840 
tricks but mostly slides and this just
holds<00:02:00.689> out<00:02:00.810> well<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.439> better<00:02:02.280> than<00:02:02.520> most<00:02:02.670> of

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
holds out well it's better than most of

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.859 
holds out well it's better than most of
the<00:02:02.909> wheels<00:02:03.090> I've<00:02:03.240> ever<00:02:03.390> seen<00:02:03.689> ever<00:02:04.170> used<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.840> I

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
the wheels I've ever seen ever used so I

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.979 
the wheels I've ever seen ever used so I
really<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.860> really<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.789> wheel<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.450> I

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
really I really like this wheel and I

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.050 
really I really like this wheel and I
really<00:02:10.530> recommend<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.250> any<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.849> that
