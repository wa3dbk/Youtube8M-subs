00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.689 

there's<00:00:50.500> a<00:00:50.589> couple<00:00:50.739> reasons<00:00:50.979> why<00:00:51.309> we<00:00:51.549> went

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
there's a couple reasons why we went

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.170 
there's a couple reasons why we went
about<00:00:51.909> doing<00:00:52.180> the<00:00:52.629> shoe<00:00:53.129> one<00:00:54.129> reason<00:00:54.489> was<00:00:54.670> it

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
about doing the shoe one reason was it

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.490 
about doing the shoe one reason was it
seems<00:00:55.449> like<00:00:55.659> there's<00:00:55.839> an<00:00:55.960> awful<00:00:56.350> lot<00:00:56.379> of

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
seems like there's an awful lot of

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.560 
seems like there's an awful lot of
vulcanize<00:00:57.010> out<00:00:57.220> there<00:00:57.430> and<00:00:58.030> if<00:00:58.269> we're<00:00:58.390> ever

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
vulcanize out there and if we're ever

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.060 
vulcanize out there and if we're ever
going<00:00:58.720> to<00:00:58.809> change<00:00:58.839> what<00:00:59.500> we're<00:00:59.680> doing<00:00:59.890> with

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
going to change what we're doing with

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.680 
going to change what we're doing with
vulcanized<00:01:00.580> or<00:01:00.790> at<00:01:00.879> least<00:01:01.030> add<00:01:01.269> to<00:01:01.570> the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
vulcanized or at least add to the
