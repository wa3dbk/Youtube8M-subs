here<00:02:25.780> is<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.320> exhaust<00:02:26.770> and<00:02:27.220> it<00:02:27.550> is<00:02:27.700> pretty

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
here is the exhaust and it is pretty

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.710 
here is the exhaust and it is pretty
much<00:02:28.420> complete<00:02:28.860> like<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:29.980> said<00:02:30.220> this<00:02:30.610> is

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
much complete like I said this is

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.530 
much complete like I said this is
factory<00:02:31.720> pipes<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:33.000> they<00:02:34.000> come<00:02:34.270> right<00:02:34.480> off

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
factory pipes and they come right off

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.160 
factory pipes and they come right off
the<00:02:34.870> engineer<00:02:35.760> but<00:02:36.760> factored<00:02:37.510> pipes<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:38.080> i

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
the engineer but factored pipes and i

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.560 
the engineer but factored pipes and i
went<00:02:38.350> ahead<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.560> welded<00:02:39.010> them<00:02:39.130> into<00:02:39.790> this

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
went ahead and welded them into this

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.750 
went ahead and welded them into this
which<00:02:41.410> is<00:02:41.710> a<00:02:41.740> factory<00:02:42.490> muffler<00:02:44.100> if<00:02:45.100> you

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
which is a factory muffler if you

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.390 
which is a factory muffler if you
remember<00:02:46.210> I<00:02:46.240> had<00:02:46.600> that<00:02:46.840> long<00:02:47.200> long<00:02:47.920> chrome

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
remember I had that long long chrome

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.790 
remember I had that long long chrome
muffler<00:02:48.820> that<00:02:49.060> was<00:02:49.150> originally<00:02:49.600> for<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:50.140> 12

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
muffler that was originally for a 12

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
horse briggs and stratton that's what it

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.110 
horse briggs and stratton that's what it
was<00:02:53.680> set<00:02:53.920> up<00:02:54.040> for<00:02:54.660> cut<00:02:55.660> it<00:02:55.780> in<00:02:55.900> half<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:56.700> cut<00:02:57.700> the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
was set up for cut it in half I cut the

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.080 
was set up for cut it in half I cut the
ends<00:02:58.540> off<00:02:58.690> now<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.200> can<00:02:59.440> see<00:02:59.680> I<00:02:59.920> cut<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.760> ends

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
ends off now you can see I cut the ends

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.420 
ends off now you can see I cut the ends
off<00:03:01.240> I<00:03:01.810> had<00:03:02.320> a<00:03:02.350> little<00:03:02.530> bit<00:03:02.740> of<00:03:02.770> extension

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
off I had a little bit of extension

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.100 
off I had a little bit of extension
there<00:03:03.610> but<00:03:03.760> I<00:03:03.850> cut<00:03:04.060> him<00:03:04.209> about<00:03:04.390> one<00:03:04.600> inch<00:03:04.810> and

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
there but I cut him about one inch and

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.760 
there but I cut him about one inch and
then<00:03:06.010> I<00:03:06.220> board<00:03:06.880> some<00:03:07.090> holes<00:03:07.330> in<00:03:07.720> there<00:03:08.080> if<00:03:08.680> you

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
then I board some holes in there if you

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.160 
then I board some holes in there if you
look<00:03:08.890> down<00:03:09.070> in<00:03:09.340> there<00:03:09.550> real<00:03:09.820> closely<00:03:10.209> you<00:03:11.140> can

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
look down in there real closely you can

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.500 
look down in there real closely you can
find<00:03:11.500> my<00:03:11.590> bear<00:03:11.770> to<00:03:11.890> see<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.190> what<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.090> see<00:03:13.300> and

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
find my bear to see it what you see and

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.930 
find my bear to see it what you see and
down<00:03:13.750> there<00:03:14.020> is<00:03:14.260> I<00:03:14.650> know<00:03:14.830> it's<00:03:15.130> got<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:15.790> little

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
down there is I know it's got a little

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.150 
down there is I know it's got a little
bit<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.150> stuff<00:03:16.420> in<00:03:16.570> there<00:03:16.690> but<00:03:16.830> what<00:03:17.830> that<00:03:18.010> is

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
bit of stuff in there but what that is

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160 
bit of stuff in there but what that is
is<00:03:18.489> where<00:03:18.730> I've<00:03:18.880> drilled<00:03:19.239> holes<00:03:19.510> into<00:03:19.870> a

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
is where I've drilled holes into a

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.590 
is where I've drilled holes into a
center<00:03:20.890> pipe<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.540> then<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:23.170> exhaust<00:03:23.860> goes

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
center pipe and then the exhaust goes

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.500 
center pipe and then the exhaust goes
down<00:03:25.600> this<00:03:25.870> straight<00:03:26.530> tube<00:03:26.769> but<00:03:27.310> then<00:03:27.519> as<00:03:28.209> the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
down this straight tube but then as the

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.540 
down this straight tube but then as the
as<00:03:28.720> it<00:03:28.870> comes<00:03:29.080> through<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.800> pressure<00:03:30.070> counter

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
as it comes through the pressure counter

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.460 
as it comes through the pressure counter
releases<00:03:31.060> in<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.480> sound<00:03:31.750> goes<00:03:32.019> into<00:03:32.350> the

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
releases in the sound goes into the

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.130 
releases in the sound goes into the
baffling<00:03:32.890> because<00:03:33.670> inside<00:03:34.150> this<00:03:34.390> tube<00:03:34.720> is

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.580 

steel<00:03:38.140> wool<00:03:38.350> so<00:03:39.570> on<00:03:40.570> this<00:03:40.840> other<00:03:41.050> side<00:03:41.170> i

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
steel wool so on this other side i

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.310 
steel wool so on this other side i
welded<00:03:41.980> another<00:03:42.310> washer<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:42.940> then<00:03:43.660> I<00:03:44.050> added

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
welded another washer and then I added

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.940 
welded another washer and then I added
this<00:03:44.650> piece<00:03:44.950> of<00:03:45.190> threaded<00:03:45.640> pipe<00:03:46.140> on<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.680> back

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
this piece of threaded pipe on the back

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.699 
this piece of threaded pipe on the back
side<00:03:48.220> here<00:03:48.330> where<00:03:49.330> you<00:03:49.480> saw<00:03:49.840> where<00:03:50.170> I<00:03:50.200> you<00:03:50.620> know

side here where you saw where I you know
drilled<00:03:50.980> those<00:03:51.130> holes<00:03:51.459> I<00:03:51.730> bored<00:03:52.060> those<00:03:52.239> holes

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
drilled those holes I bored those holes

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.580 
drilled those holes I bored those holes
in<00:03:52.660> there<00:03:52.840> these<00:03:53.470> are<00:03:54.360> couplers

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
in there these are couplers

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.240 
in there these are couplers

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
in there and what's kind of cool about

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.420 
in there and what's kind of cool about
this<00:04:02.860> is<00:04:03.100> if<00:04:04.470> depending<00:04:05.470> on<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.739> way<00:04:05.890> it<00:04:06.100> sound

the one that has the two pieces and I
can<00:04:31.930> screw<00:04:32.320> in<00:04:32.500> a<00:04:32.740> factory<00:04:33.640> mufflers<00:04:34.060> into

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
can screw in a factory mufflers into

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.240 
can screw in a factory mufflers into
this<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:35.020> make<00:04:35.260> it<00:04:35.289> even<00:04:35.560> quieter<00:04:35.860> if<00:04:36.160> I

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
this and make it even quieter if I

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.580 
this and make it even quieter if I
wanted<00:04:36.520> to<00:04:36.580> but<00:04:37.419> I<00:04:37.720> don't<00:04:38.200> know<00:04:38.289> what<00:04:38.470> it's

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
wanted to but I don't know what it's

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.260 
wanted to but I don't know what it's
going<00:04:38.710> to<00:04:38.770> sound<00:04:38.919> like<00:04:39.160> I<00:04:39.460> think<00:04:40.150> it<00:04:40.240> looks

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
going to sound like I think it looks

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.550 
going to sound like I think it looks
pretty<00:04:40.450> cool<00:04:40.660> we<00:04:40.960> show<00:04:41.110> you<00:04:41.169> real<00:04:41.349> quick<00:04:41.380> what

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
pretty cool we show you real quick what

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.029 
pretty cool we show you real quick what
I<00:04:41.710> did<00:04:41.919> for<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.370> throttle<00:04:42.849> control<00:04:43.770> this<00:04:44.770> of

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
I did for the throttle control this of

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.190 
I did for the throttle control this of
course<00:04:45.070> is<00:04:45.430> a<00:04:45.490> bicycle<00:04:46.000> cable<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:46.539> I<00:04:46.990> just

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
course is a bicycle cable and I just

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.760 
course is a bicycle cable and I just
barely<00:04:47.620> cut<00:04:48.130> the<00:04:48.729> excess<00:04:49.150> off<00:04:49.390> of<00:04:49.720> the<00:04:49.960> out<00:04:50.470> you

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
barely cut the excess off of the out you

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.920 
barely cut the excess off of the out you
know<00:04:50.890> outer<00:04:51.070> shielding<00:04:51.520> cable<00:04:51.880> and<00:04:52.060> then<00:04:52.840> you

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
know outer shielding cable and then you

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.390 
know outer shielding cable and then you
have<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:53.140> inner<00:04:53.289> shield<00:04:53.620> and<00:04:53.800> this<00:04:54.130> little

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
have the inner shield and this little

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.670 
have the inner shield and this little
piece<00:04:54.580> right<00:04:54.700> here<00:04:54.820> if<00:04:55.390> I<00:04:55.570> can<00:04:55.780> get<00:04:55.930> in<00:04:56.110> just<00:04:56.410> a

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
piece right here if I can get in just a

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.140 
piece right here if I can get in just a
little<00:04:56.830> bit<00:04:56.950> maybe<00:04:57.310> I<00:04:57.430> can<00:04:57.640> just<00:04:57.669> hit<00:04:57.910> a<00:04:57.970> little

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
little bit maybe I can just hit a little

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.830 
little bit maybe I can just hit a little
a<00:04:58.270> zune<00:04:58.539> and<00:04:58.979> I<00:04:59.979> can<00:05:00.160> show<00:05:00.400> you<00:05:02.070> it's<00:05:03.070> a

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
a zune and I can show you it's a

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.380 
a zune and I can show you it's a
actually<00:05:04.840> it's<00:05:05.169> an<00:05:05.410> electrical<00:05:06.390> connector

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
actually it's an electrical connector

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.540 
actually it's an electrical connector
piece<00:05:07.750> you<00:05:08.050> know<00:05:08.169> the<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.919> little<00:05:09.099> loop<00:05:09.340> bin

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
piece you know the the little loop bin

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.150 
piece you know the the little loop bin
and<00:05:10.180> then<00:05:10.270> i<00:05:10.300> screw<00:05:10.419> the<00:05:10.780> screw<00:05:11.080> in<00:05:11.260> and<00:05:11.710> looped

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
and then i screw the screw in and looped

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
and then i screw the screw in and looped
the<00:05:13.110> actual<00:05:14.110> cable<00:05:14.320> and<00:05:14.680> then<00:05:14.950> crimped<00:05:15.400> it<00:05:15.490> so

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
the actual cable and then crimped it so

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.659 
the actual cable and then crimped it so
it's<00:05:16.330> actually<00:05:16.479> you<00:05:17.020> know<00:05:17.140> twice<00:05:17.800> being<00:05:18.370> held

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
it's actually you know twice being held

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.880 
it's actually you know twice being held
on<00:05:18.849> to<00:05:19.060> this<00:05:19.240> and<00:05:19.960> when<00:05:20.140> you<00:05:20.229> screw<00:05:20.560> this<00:05:20.710> in

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
on to this and when you screw this in

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.140 
on to this and when you screw this in
you<00:05:21.039> want<00:05:21.220> to<00:05:21.280> keep<00:05:21.400> it<00:05:21.520> a<00:05:21.580> little<00:05:21.610> bit<00:05:21.940> loose

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
you want to keep it a little bit loose

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.800 
you want to keep it a little bit loose
and<00:05:22.979> then<00:05:23.979> you<00:05:24.070> crimp<00:05:24.340> it<00:05:24.460> and<00:05:24.610> that's<00:05:25.570> how<00:05:25.780> i

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
and then you crimp it and that's how i

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.130 
and then you crimp it and that's how i
did<00:05:25.960> that<00:05:26.110> and<00:05:27.240> then<00:05:28.240> of<00:05:28.360> course<00:05:28.390> it<00:05:28.780> me<00:05:29.080> no

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
did that and then of course it me no

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.080 
did that and then of course it me no
mounts<00:05:29.500> in<00:05:29.590> this<00:05:29.770> regular<00:05:30.070> position<00:05:30.250> i<00:05:30.669> went

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
mounts in this regular position i went

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.310 
mounts in this regular position i went
ahead<00:05:31.150> and<00:05:31.360> remount<00:05:32.229> the<00:05:32.910> choke<00:05:33.910> so<00:05:34.810> i<00:05:34.840> could

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
ahead and remount the choke so i could

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.750 
ahead and remount the choke so i could
actually<00:05:35.500> have<00:05:35.830> a<00:05:35.860> choke<00:05:36.160> and<00:05:36.430> i'll<00:05:36.520> show<00:05:36.550> you

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
actually have a choke and i'll show you

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.610 
actually have a choke and i'll show you
where<00:05:37.030> that<00:05:37.060> is<00:05:38.700> little<00:05:39.700> piece<00:05:39.910> right<00:05:39.940> here

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
where that is little piece right here

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.659 
where that is little piece right here
nice<00:05:41.620> little<00:05:41.950> coke<00:05:42.810> fill<00:05:43.810> tank<00:05:44.080> i<00:05:44.400> did<00:05:45.400> all<00:05:45.520> the

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
nice little coke fill tank i did all the

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.159 
nice little coke fill tank i did all the
wiring<00:05:45.880> start<00:05:46.360> to<00:05:46.419> put<00:05:46.599> the<00:05:46.690> little<00:05:46.870> computer

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
wiring start to put the little computer

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.790 
wiring start to put the little computer
on<00:05:47.410> here<00:05:47.680> and<00:05:47.770> it<00:05:47.890> actually<00:05:48.039> tells<00:05:48.370> the<00:05:48.640> hours

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
on here and it actually tells the hours

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.070 
on here and it actually tells the hours
and<00:05:50.800> there<00:05:51.370> you<00:05:51.490> go<00:05:51.520> that's<00:05:51.970> all<00:05:52.150> the<00:05:52.330> wiring<00:05:52.599> I

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
and there you go that's all the wiring I

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.370 
and there you go that's all the wiring I
know<00:05:53.620> it<00:05:53.830> looks<00:05:53.950> like<00:05:54.070> a<00:05:54.190> mess<00:05:54.460> but<00:05:54.760> it's

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
know it looks like a mess but it's

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.900 
know it looks like a mess but it's
pretty<00:05:56.380> easy<00:05:56.560> to<00:05:56.770> bundle<00:05:57.280> it<00:05:57.400> up<00:05:57.490> and<00:05:57.700> start

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
pretty easy to bundle it up and start

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.200 
pretty easy to bundle it up and start
zip<00:05:58.120> time<00:05:58.440> and<00:05:59.440> it<00:05:59.620> will<00:05:59.770> clean<00:05:59.979> itself<00:06:00.160> up<00:06:00.520> and

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
zip time and it will clean itself up and

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.870 
zip time and it will clean itself up and
I<00:06:01.539> was<00:06:01.660> able<00:06:01.810> to<00:06:01.990> use<00:06:02.349> the<00:06:02.560> factory<00:06:03.310> fuse<00:06:03.640> and

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
I was able to use the factory fuse and

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.520 
I was able to use the factory fuse and
not<00:06:04.030> at<00:06:04.210> all<00:06:04.390> that<00:06:04.630> kind<00:06:04.810> of<00:06:04.840> fun<00:06:05.020> stuff<00:06:05.550> so
