00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello friends and youtube friends 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.960
 Facebook 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.610
 I'm jose del Faro send them a hug 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.000
 obviously tell them that the week 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.799
 last time we upload the first video of what 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.719
 that had been the theme sings and celebrates 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.119
 and we saw the peculiarity of the stanza 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.520
 what note was I to make them a 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.820
 small reminder we saw that this 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.840
 song was in C minor with ninth what 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.300
 what happened is that we used the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.070
 Gizmo particular capo or 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.260
 those who are from here of Spain 'la 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.500
 nut 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.630
 we saw that we were doing 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.640
 arpeggios different exercises to 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.290
 that maybe some are used to 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.060
 do good today let's see the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.570
 particularity of what the bridge has 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.850
 and the entry hits then this 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.520
 would be the following the first thing we saw 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.520
 was this then we're going to start it like this 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.890
 ok now the part of the bridge would come 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.580
 for the bridge part of the chords 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.870
 that we are using would be less 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.080
 and solvent 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:29.040
 family 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.080
 and only what we're going to use this kind of 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.280
 stance for the minor fa we will use 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.210
 this and we're going to make them see it 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.790
 exactly and see how we are doing 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.100
 running we are running from the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.250
 first string up to the sixth that would be 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.250
 A) Yes 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:56.140
 with your finger is not problematic and for 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.480
 that we are going to make a particularity 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.470
 and we are not going to make the chord 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.930
 whole but we 're going to make the chord 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.229
 I 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:13.519
 note 2 and we're going to go like this 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:18.080
 it would be like that yes 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.080
 22 22 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.530
 ok then now we are going to execute 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.390
 just as it is for the entrance of the bridge 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.690
 we said that we came from Christ there is at 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.690
 side 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.959
 ok we will do it more slowly the 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.590
 bridge so you can see how what 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.590
 we are running it is very easy it would be 2 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.760
 Hello 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.470
 i 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.040
 they are already their deaths are the so-called 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.370
 children of light 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:27.280
 now only with the guitar would be 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.280
 to leave him defeated remains in the blood 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.050
 and thanks to his death we are called 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.320
 children of light 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.810
 ok and then now we would come again 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.940
 for the entrance of what is being 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.760
 the refrain that we will not see 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.200
 whole only let's see the entry 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.220
 two strokes would be no serious ground 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.790
 Sing celebrates because age because 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:57.780
 it would be sings where the 'great if 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:02.160
 we counted would be a two three four letter 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:05.250
 does not celebrate they go in 2 and in 4 a 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.430
 earth and we would be using again the 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.250
 note of C minor ninth then we are going to 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.850
 see are very simple hits can be 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.220
 do with a thud 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.870
 particularly in the recording I did it 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.810
 simply with a pinch of strings 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:26.430
 be charmed in the ebro because the 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.170
 victory ok then let's see let's go to 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.540
 go to the bridge and we're leaving directly 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:34.250
 to the punches of the chorus and there 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.250
 we will stop so they can 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:52.430
 the execution to play it 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:55.610
 and sings celebrates because the victory 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.259
 our ok and then we would go to 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.780
 something a little more complicated than 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:02.599
 we will see next week we are going to 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.400
 simply repeat this small detail 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:07.210
 so that you have it clearer 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.210
 would be 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:17.509
 so so black once again in the 34 

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:22.199
 sing 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:24.449
 ok and well I want to introduce you and today 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:27.179

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.189
 meat the particular percussionist the 

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:30.839
 he plays the flamenco cajÃ³n something of what 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:33.929
 I told them it's very flamenco and we're going 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:35.969
 to be watching later good friends 

00:05:33.929 --> 00:05:38.279

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:40.590
 many comments that can be discussed 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:43.410
 much that they can 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.840
 execute this new way of touching that 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:49.220
 is flamenco and nothing sends them a 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.220
