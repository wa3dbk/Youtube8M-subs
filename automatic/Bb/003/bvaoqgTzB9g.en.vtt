00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:08.040
 good then there was nice piece tokyo 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.950
 balance that is not bad 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:19.920
 these rather mundane disagreements of them 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:21.300
 since the set of hers and for the couple 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.890
 and it's a bit of a variant with 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.600
 a few small boots that we add 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.789
 hit me I prefer to see it sinful 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.140
 forgot something like that I play once 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.140
 the project was explained 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:55.399
 on the back of the breast the minor tac 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.780
 we have unfortunately also to do it 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:02.269
 like that but I'm more comfortable 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.159
 like that and our index will go down to 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.369
 level of the little note there to add 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.369
 1 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.530
 or 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.030
 then we will do the same thing for 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.640
 practically a thing with the pass in 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:29.130
 ground do you tube 10.2 inches you can 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.130
 so you see that 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.880
 then the third chord then we have 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:53.370
 dole after that looks like a D minor 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:02:07.030
 this console is here so I 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:10.320
 blocks the dodo leu the forest and come back to 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.320
 press here for the little 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.819
 he 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.140
 and we are going to play just with his two 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.140
 strings and bass 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:49.510
 bah as a friend and I put my little finger 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:52.700
 here the first part will be fair or 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:03:09.040
 then the index will block and body 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:09.040
 here then so I quickly it gives 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.819
 a 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.489
 finished 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:42.990
 as the piece is the organ of the 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:46.280
 better we can add small ones 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.280
 variations in our hunger 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.609
 I hope it was cool
