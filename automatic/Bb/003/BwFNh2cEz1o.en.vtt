and their boys goes ah that's called
vibrato<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.910> can<00:00:15.030> do<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.240> with<00:00:15.420> guitars<00:00:15.750> so

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
vibrato you can do that with guitars so

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.340 
vibrato you can do that with guitars so
let's<00:00:16.170> look<00:00:16.350> at<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.710> guitar<00:00:16.859> pedal<00:00:18.140> all<00:00:19.140> right

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
let's look at the guitar pedal all right

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.950 
let's look at the guitar pedal all right
now<00:00:19.470> I've<00:00:19.619> got<00:00:19.830> open<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.490> vibrato<00:00:21.150> pedal<00:00:21.660> and

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
now I've got open the vibrato pedal and

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.340 
now I've got open the vibrato pedal and
this<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.710> really<00:00:23.039> simple<00:00:23.250> pedal<00:00:23.840> because<00:00:24.840> if

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
this is a really simple pedal because if

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.620 
this is a really simple pedal because if
you<00:00:25.470> already<00:00:25.650> know<00:00:25.980> what<00:00:26.220> vibrato<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.939> then

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
you already know what vibrato is then

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.960 
you already know what vibrato is then
you<00:00:28.380> know<00:00:28.619> what<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.099> gonna<00:00:29.250> sound<00:00:29.519> like<00:00:29.699> or

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
you know what it's gonna sound like or

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.150 
you know what it's gonna sound like or
you<00:00:30.449> know<00:00:30.599> what<00:00:30.810> it's<00:00:30.929> gonna<00:00:31.080> do<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
you know what it's gonna do to the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.990 
you know what it's gonna do to the
guitar<00:00:33.170> so<00:00:34.170> vibrato<00:00:34.620> if<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.489> don't<00:00:35.730> know<00:00:35.850> what

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
guitar so vibrato if you don't know what

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.220 
guitar so vibrato if you don't know what
it<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.239> vibrato<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:38.480> bend<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.989> pitch

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
it is vibrato is a a bend in the pitch

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.940 
it is vibrato is a a bend in the pitch
and<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:41.340> an<00:00:41.520> up-and-down<00:00:42.649> pitch<00:00:43.649> Bend

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
and it's an up-and-down pitch Bend

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.619 
and it's an up-and-down pitch Bend
that's<00:00:44.360> consistent<00:00:45.379> so<00:00:47.180> let's<00:00:48.180> say<00:00:48.360> you're

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
that's consistent so let's say you're

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.540 
that's consistent so let's say you're
listening<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.110> someone<00:00:49.410> sing<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
listening to someone sing and the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.270 
listening to someone sing and the
vocalist<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.239> hope<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.350> holding<00:00:52.860> out<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> note

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
vocalist is hope is holding out a note

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.160 
vocalist is hope is holding out a note
for<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.090> while<00:00:55.039> usually<00:00:56.039> at<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.579> tail<00:00:56.910> ends<00:00:57.180> is

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
for a while usually at the tail ends is

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.160 
for a while usually at the tail ends is
where<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.370> singers<00:00:59.730> will<00:00:59.910> add<00:01:00.090> vibrato<00:01:00.390> to

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
where the singers will add vibrato to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.000 
where the singers will add vibrato to
the<00:01:01.289> note<00:01:01.940> just<00:01:02.940> because<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.570> sounds<00:01:03.930> better

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
the note just because it sounds better

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.380 
the note just because it sounds better
it<00:01:05.010> sounds<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.430> little<00:01:05.549> bit<00:01:05.729> more<00:01:05.790> richer<00:01:06.299> and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
it sounds a little bit more richer and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.320 
it sounds a little bit more richer and
fuller<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.880> little<00:01:08.880> less<00:01:09.119> boring

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
fuller and and it's a little less boring

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.730 
fuller and and it's a little less boring
than<00:01:11.360> just<00:01:12.360> holding<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> note<00:01:12.930> consistently

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
than just holding the note consistently

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.679 
than just holding the note consistently
and<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.369> kind<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.580> bends<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:15.600> a

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
and it just kind of bends it just a

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.230 
and it just kind of bends it just a
little<00:01:15.960> bit<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.350> little<00:01:17.100> bit<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.400> sharp<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
little bit a little bit of sharp and a

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.340 
little bit a little bit of sharp and a
little<00:01:18.509> bit<00:01:18.630> flat<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:19.920> right<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.340> key<00:01:21.350> so

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
little bit flat but it's right in key so

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.969 
little bit flat but it's right in key so
let's<00:01:23.250> go<00:01:23.400> ahead<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.640> take<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.360> listen<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
let's go ahead and take a listen to the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.149 
let's go ahead and take a listen to the
vibrato<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:27.259> course<00:01:28.259> at<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.680> default

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
vibrato of course at the default

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:44.010 
vibrato of course at the default
GarageBand<00:01:30.060> settings

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.150 

okay<00:01:45.020> now<00:01:45.140> I'm<00:01:45.200> just<00:01:45.260> going<00:01:45.500> to<00:01:45.620> turn<00:01:45.800> off<00:01:46.010> the

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
okay now I'm just going to turn off the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.980 
okay now I'm just going to turn off the
wrap<00:01:46.400> out<00:01:46.580> of<00:01:46.610> vibrato<00:01:47.210> just<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.660> give<00:01:47.810> you<00:01:47.960> a

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
wrap out of vibrato just to give you a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.640 
wrap out of vibrato just to give you a
reference

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.160 

so<00:01:55.640> that's<00:01:55.790> just<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.270> regular<00:01:56.450> guitar<00:01:56.960> with

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
so that's just the regular guitar with

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.980 
so that's just the regular guitar with
no<00:01:57.380> vibrato<00:01:57.800> and<00:01:58.070> let's<00:01:58.250> add<00:01:58.430> in<00:01:58.670> vibrato<00:01:59.090> to

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
no vibrato and let's add in vibrato to

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:11.140 
no vibrato and let's add in vibrato to
that<00:02:00.110> same<00:02:00.410> chord<00:02:09.369> okay<00:02:10.369> so<00:02:10.430> let's<00:02:10.880> take<00:02:11.090> a

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
that same chord okay so let's take a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
that same chord okay so let's take a
look<00:02:11.390> at<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:12.230> rate<00:02:12.590> and<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.520> depth<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.900> rate

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
look at the rate and the depth so rate

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.430 
look at the rate and the depth so rate
does<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.980> same<00:02:16.250> exact<00:02:16.670> thing<00:02:16.730> it's<00:02:17.210> how<00:02:18.110> fast

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
does the same exact thing it's how fast

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.440 
does the same exact thing it's how fast
you<00:02:18.620> want<00:02:18.740> that<00:02:18.980> pitch<00:02:19.220> Bend<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:19.730> be<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.270> if<00:02:20.360> you

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
you want that pitch Bend to be so if you

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.510 
you want that pitch Bend to be so if you
want<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:20.690> really<00:02:20.870> really<00:02:21.170> fast<00:02:21.410> one<00:02:21.740> you<00:02:22.460> just

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
want a really really fast one you just

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.610 
want a really really fast one you just
raise<00:02:22.880> up<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.180> rate<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.360> little<00:02:23.630> bit<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:24.050> let's

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
raise up the rate a little bit and let's

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:35.009 
raise up the rate a little bit and let's
take<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:24.830> listen<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.190> that

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:45.660 

so<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.140> rate<00:02:36.349> is<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:38.379> that<00:02:39.379> goes<00:02:39.560> really<00:02:39.769> fast

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.550 

so<00:02:46.670> that's<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.879> really<00:02:47.030> fast<00:02:47.390> random<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.319> me<00:02:48.440> it

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
so that's a really fast random to me it

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.830 
so that's a really fast random to me it
kind<00:02:48.650> of<00:02:48.800> sounds<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.099> little<00:02:49.280> bit<00:02:49.489> unnatural

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
kind of sounds a little bit unnatural

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.050 
kind of sounds a little bit unnatural
but<00:02:50.840> of<00:02:50.930> course<00:02:51.170> do<00:02:51.920> whatever<00:02:52.340> you<00:02:52.640> want

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
but of course do whatever you want

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:05.490 
but of course do whatever you want
let's<00:02:53.269> do<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.540> low<00:02:54.379> rate<00:02:54.709> setting

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.199 

alright<00:03:06.500> so<00:03:06.799> I'm<00:03:06.890> gonna<00:03:07.010> put<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.430> back<00:03:07.489> up<00:03:07.760> to

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
alright so I'm gonna put that back up to

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.119 
alright so I'm gonna put that back up to
about<00:03:08.360> halfway<00:03:08.659> now<00:03:09.200> let's<00:03:09.470> take<00:03:09.620> a<00:03:09.709> look<00:03:09.950> at

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
about halfway now let's take a look at

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.199 
about halfway now let's take a look at
the<00:03:10.310> depth<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:10.940> that's<00:03:11.780> gonna<00:03:12.019> be<00:03:12.319> how<00:03:13.209> how

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
the depth and that's gonna be how how

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.070 
the depth and that's gonna be how how
much<00:03:14.390> it's<00:03:14.629> bending<00:03:15.049> that<00:03:15.200> pitch<00:03:15.849> so<00:03:16.900> let's<00:03:17.900> do

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
much it's bending that pitch so let's do

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.039 
much it's bending that pitch so let's do
a<00:03:18.110> high<00:03:18.409> percentage<00:03:18.980> depth<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:20.780> take<00:03:21.019> a

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
a high percentage depth and take a

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:33.069 
a high percentage depth and take a
listen<00:03:31.360> alright<00:03:32.360> now<00:03:32.599> let's<00:03:32.840> do<00:03:32.989> the

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
listen alright now let's do the

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:33.910 
listen alright now let's do the
vice-versa

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
vice-versa

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.349 
vice-versa
of<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:35.540> diff<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:36.140> do<00:03:36.890> lower<00:03:37.239> percentage<00:03:38.239> of

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
of the diff and do lower percentage of

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:45.700 
of the diff and do lower percentage of
debt

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.710 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.180 

okay<00:03:46.710> and<00:03:46.800> that<00:03:46.920> pretty<00:03:47.430> much<00:03:47.640> sums<00:03:48.360> up<00:03:48.900> the

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
okay and that pretty much sums up the

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.150 
okay and that pretty much sums up the
vibrato<00:03:50.190> pedal<00:03:50.580> but<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.390> one<00:03:51.600> last<00:03:51.900> knob<00:03:52.710> is

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
vibrato pedal but the one last knob is

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160 
vibrato pedal but the one last knob is
the<00:03:53.220> type<00:03:53.790> of<00:03:53.820> vibrato<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.690> that's<00:03:54.840> simply

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
the type of vibrato and that's simply

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.100 
the type of vibrato and that's simply
just<00:03:55.380> different<00:03:56.370> types<00:03:56.520> it<00:03:56.820> so<00:03:57.480> let's<00:03:57.930> take<00:03:58.080> a

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
just different types it so let's take a

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.140 
just different types it so let's take a
listen<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:59.370> original<00:03:59.520> vibrato<00:04:00.770> and<00:04:02.150> then

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
listen to the original vibrato and then

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.880 
listen to the original vibrato and then
let's<00:04:03.660> do<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:03.810> couple<00:04:04.020> of<00:04:04.260> these<00:04:04.380> let's<00:04:04.680> go<00:04:04.830> to

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
let's do a couple of these let's go to

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:14.260 
let's do a couple of these let's go to
c1

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
okay so there you go that's the vibrato

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.120 
okay so there you go that's the vibrato
pedal<00:04:28.930> so<00:04:29.930> please<00:04:30.140> remember<00:04:30.320> to<00:04:30.470> rate<00:04:30.740> comment
