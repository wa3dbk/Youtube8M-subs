00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.210
 dot com episode 2004 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.599
 There is something unusual here 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:14.549
 and that is the creek ice cream with 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:17.460
 hot cherries cleverly packed into 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.949
 not separate areas already 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.510
 he prettily himself refined 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.490
 call 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:29.039
 all cases here, the ingredients most 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:32.279
 the shortest is indeed yes 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:41.700
 It can be a stone or a part 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:43.379
 of a stone and now that's exactly what 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.020
 So they say that one does not read as 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.050
 Often that should be ten minutes , so to speak 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.300
 so trust first of the -18 what 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.620
 the deep cupboard has the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.360
 of course a microwave 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.800
 by that has that is interesting 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.500
 is on the theme neatly the wattzahl 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.420
 specify four minutes 30 again 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.250
 Of course, one wonders how to get in 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.200
 stir the microwave no matter 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.060
 the two options which I am so aware of 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:25.770
 the mobile should be on hand there are 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:27.979
 not at all ok as a person alone 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.979
 eat 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.590
 Now you have to do that somehow 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:39.590
 can disconnect 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.590
 the opening fails 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:51.539
 he has to be here now you have it so nice 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.539
 I do not think that's sophisticated anymore 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:10.200
 through which it never goes microwave rises 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.170
 but stiff frozen cherry whatever 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.099
 then I came back with the vehicle and 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.099
 house over there 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:39.540
 no , that's exactly what this one is doing 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.709
 I do not see that for myself 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:53.590
 I like to portion here right now 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:55.030
 times the ice cream is ice cream is 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.359
 I would just get creamy ice cream 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.400
 say 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:04.049
 tastes like this Russian you know 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.049
 What I mean this Russian ice cream 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.940
 since I like to say that 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.990
 From now on, there is more shortest 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.990
 about it 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:33.650
 yes, it smells fruity already 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.489
 a bit dirty you can be nice 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.709
 lonely, of course, I can do it too 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:45.010
 now, of course, the worlds are getting as they are 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:53.780
 so beautiful says hot and cold at the same time 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:56.230
 Let's not be so good 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.230
 for the teeth 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:17.130
 must be as sour kiss the 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:17.130
 be sure to be sour cherries 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:30.280
 means that means to enjoy means pure 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:34.110
 you more or less I do not care and 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:37.720
 beats anti enjoyment and that is so yes 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.090
 is quite interesting but not so now 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.400
 the world for me personally he is here 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.820
 So what's hot with ice cream is ice cream 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.820
 hot soup 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.539
 especially the church as the wash 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:02.189
 Delicious where the church is that is 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:04.199
 southern sweet to the fed so does 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:15.180
 a very very very complete 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:16.469
 impression the nutrition what suits me 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.389
 believe the two things do not fit 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:20.639
 together 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:23.509
 indeed any yes sugar worth just 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.270
 tastes here sugar bomb 25 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:29.759
 just tastes sentence totally sugared 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:57.889
 sugar finished and should light that it so 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:57.889
 blatantly somehow at the creek resort is 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:15.379
 so typical sound agreement 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:56.740
 some things not working together 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:07:07.839
 City Palace weekend ready 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:14.050
 that's ok to extreme form account he 

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:17.759
 his practice and ice cream was now 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.759
 asked is deep
