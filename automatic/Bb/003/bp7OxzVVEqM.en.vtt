00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.450
 The media interest was huge as Prince Albert of Monaco yesterday on the 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.150
 Calin Gologan booth at the booth 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.000
 The nobleman is interested in electromobility and had to join his 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.209
 Of course, take a tour of the fair in Elektra Urban 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.210
 the single-seater with electric motor of three hours 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.210
 and stay in the air and has a range of 400 kilometers 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.119
 The idea came to Nesselwanger Calin Gologan rather by chance than a fair 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.140
 visited for paragliders 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.289
 I have him there 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.800
 in a hedge 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.700
 a very small e-motor unit electric motor unit lead 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.140
 high quality hang gliders there were six seven kilos of battery engine and 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.360
 Propeller and that fascinated me to such a small unit with the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.970
 current CDU 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.020
 such a hang glider in the air hung for 20 minutes 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.860
 I have relocated here 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.590
 there you have to 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.090
 Extrapolating these data easily translates to an accident 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.680
 if not immediately seen that landlord now because that is really a 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.560
 Ultralight to build the electric motor 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.660
 That's three years ago 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.080
 In thousands of working hours since then, the Elektra Bahn has been the prototype 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.950
 a microlight flyer 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.420
 100 kilograms it is hard 100 kilos versus the batteries simple 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.600
 notebook batteries the inventor Calin Gologan announces 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.470
 At the Aero fair in Friedrichshafen the plane was rolled along with 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.450
 presented a solar hangar 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.320
 he should deliver the energy for the fly and so the co2 emissions in 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.480
 Press zero 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.620
 From the beginning, this aircraft was designed for low operating costs 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.450
 our operating costs are 2 30 euros per hour 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.620
 is very agile 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.010
 or so easy to understand leads motorists enough of the a2 EUR per 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.530
 Kilometers too fast 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.260
 good performance 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.430
 and the total cost 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.110
 We want to bring such a system to market by the end of the year 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.670
 Burnout approval 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.460
 Schaaf the gang production and this system 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.930
 Flight time There was bus travel in Haiti 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.870
 for around 500,000 euros 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.540
 According to Colo, 20 square meters of solar space are enough for a total of 300 flight hours per year 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.269
 as much as an average league club graduated 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.060
 About four weeks ago Elektra had its first flight Uwe to 4 5 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.959
 where the aircraft normally also stands the flight characteristics of the electric 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:21.560
 airman 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.890
 for test pilot Norbert Lorentzen very different than on airplanes 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.239
 Internal combustion engine it's the beautiful sound on with the SEC quite different from her 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.109
 you have to do that properly Jasper 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.719
 the exchanges in the traffic emt 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.709
 to buses should be four large 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.359
 Forte is of course double situations so it's a forest landlord 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.129
 Roubini that's a top team similar running 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.489
 this gas does not exist under Tel in Gars it is so he so the BI the spontaneous 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.459
 Gas intake simply but there is a power hole network 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.389
 in the operation the 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.419
 Tilke throttle and Vista 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:55.149
 accelerates whole 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:58.269
 just before the finish goes up to speed for us 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.389
 very very pleasant 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:05.099
 many more test flights are scheduled to follow this year, among others 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.319
 a flight from departure to Hamburg 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.549
 Calin Gologan an finances the project by private means alone 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.749
 Flying she is, so to speak, a mission of the man from Nesselwang 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.659
 Next year, the electric products will go into series after that also wants two and 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.489
 attack four-seater machine 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.680
 Our concept is one of being able to develop a family 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:31.469
 and this aircraft d 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:34.979
 Technology platform for the future family 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:38.509
 because as a single-seater but less development risk 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.649
 but the whole family is based on honesty 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:47.159
 in the Albertina Harnik and Cultural Summer for consists of the 1 set 2 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.169
 seats 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:52.719
 The small one is being promoted from zero to stakes and in the future 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:56.909
 could possibly be even larger aircraft thanks to electric motors in the 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:57.959
 Go air 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.879
 what we do now is sport and leisure aviation and is one 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.759
 good base 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.209
 from technology 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.069
 She was in registration phase 12 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.499
 the future 

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:13.339
 commercial use 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:16.169
 finally see from next class 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.039
 be quite interesting last day counts for example Facebook six sees them 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.740
 the plane with two engines 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.270
 as in commercial use 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.569
 for this plane will have 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:29.430
 not you the battery 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.460
 which is usually cheaper I guess treasures 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.590
 electro-pop in ten years 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.340
 and so Rainer paragraph 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.559
 Electric plane for Tor Bottrops aircraft so regional route w 

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:46.169
 Munich Hamburg 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.749
 30 years 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:51.710
 Calin Gologan on is a visionary in terms of electrostatic precipitator he is 

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:55.419
 convinced of his idea function two neutral flying 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.460
 a prominent advocate father since he may already
