 hello and welcome soon also to your channel 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.500
 meeting solution of your android channel 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:07.450
 I had asked what the keyboard 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.030
 the three of us already have it action parameters 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.849
 of the Htc 39 300 it should be noted that this 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.849
 keyboard only works for the rom stop 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.770
 believing for our samsung galaxy s3 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.880
 do not try to install this mod in 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.740
 pure android because it's not going to 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.360
 work only works for the rom 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.150
 who has the samsung personalization 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.450
 and as you can see we have what the 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:32.150
 normal keyboard of the c-31 we can 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:35.030
 observe here we go to what is the 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.250
 to install the know 3 since it has 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.100
 much more options we're just going to 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.770
 enter into recovery mode and let's 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.100
 flashing a file should also be noted 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.960
 what 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.730
 that to install this mode they have to 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.730
 have a rom de adexa the can 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.890
 install the rom that you left in the 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.450
 previous video 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.579
 I will leave you in the description of 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.250
 video also so they can install 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.050
 this mode if it is not a rom de adexa da 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.489
 it will not work so I will leave you 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.839
 also in the description of the video the 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.150
 file required for installation 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.250
 they just copy it and the arrow 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.440
 from recovery rather once 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.420
 let's be in the recovery we're just going 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.920
 install the mod let's look for it in the 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.840
 micro SD memory 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.259
 Where do we have it? 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.259
 binder 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.040
 let's find the 23 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.590
 only 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.910
 As you can see, it has already been 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.990
 installed correctly we only give it 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.820
 drink and read restart 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.640
 we have already installed everything 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.040
 what is the keyboard and I go back and I what 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.990
 I repeat for this installation they need 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.340
 a rom of adex fairies and not not going to 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.929
 work what is the keyboard 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.340
 well once the charger arrives 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.350
 our terminal as proof what is 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.840
 the keyboard and how can you observe 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.030
 white with the five rows too 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.219
 they appear what are the symbolic and 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.290
 here we can also add what they are 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:03.930
 gestures as 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.390
 some like to put these gestures in 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.729
 some publications that do well 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.679
 this is what this video is to create something 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.750
 fast for our samsung galaxy s3 and 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.190

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.080
 keyboard of the three in our terminal 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.430
 If you liked the video because already 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.810

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.990
