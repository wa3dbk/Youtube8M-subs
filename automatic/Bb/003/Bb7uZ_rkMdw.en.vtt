default<00:02:29.770> launcher<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:32.370> there<00:02:33.370> we<00:02:33.520> go<00:02:33.700> just

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
default launcher and there we go just

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.870 
default launcher and there we go just
takes<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.360> minute<00:02:34.390> all<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.020> icons<00:02:35.410> are<00:02:35.590> there

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
takes a minute all the icons are there

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.100 
takes a minute all the icons are there
go<00:02:36.880> on<00:02:37.090> tours<00:02:37.330> running<00:02:37.660> all<00:02:37.810> right<00:02:38.050> now<00:02:40.110> and

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
go on tours running all right now and

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.320 
go on tours running all right now and
this<00:02:41.620> is<00:02:41.800> a<00:02:41.830> resistive<00:02:42.459> screen<00:02:42.459> it's<00:02:43.180> not

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
this is a resistive screen it's not

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.729 
this is a resistive screen it's not
capacitive<00:02:44.080> so<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:44.320> got<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.560> use<00:02:44.680> your

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
capacitive so you got to use your

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.470 
capacitive so you got to use your
fingernail<00:02:45.250> or<00:02:45.430> use<00:02:45.550> a<00:02:45.580> stylus<00:02:47.910> let<00:02:48.910> me<00:02:49.030> show

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
fingernail or use a stylus let me show

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.030 
fingernail or use a stylus let me show
you<00:02:49.510> something<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:49.930> runs<00:02:50.320> pretty<00:02:50.590> good<00:02:50.739> on

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
you something that runs pretty good on

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.740 
you something that runs pretty good on
it<00:02:51.220> we'll<00:02:51.340> see<00:02:51.489> if<00:02:51.580> this<00:02:51.760> works<00:02:54.570> this<00:02:55.570> is<00:02:55.720> a

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
it we'll see if this works this is a

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.880 
it we'll see if this works this is a
more<00:02:56.020> modern<00:02:56.470> apps<00:02:56.739> then<00:02:57.100> then<00:02:57.850> say<00:02:58.380> my<00:02:59.380> bubble

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
more modern apps then then say my bubble

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.180 
more modern apps then then say my bubble
pop<00:03:00.160> or<00:03:00.459> just<00:03:01.120> whatever<00:03:01.360> came<00:03:02.230> on<00:03:02.530> this<00:03:02.860> device

to<00:03:03.250> begin<00:03:03.700> with

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.699 

we'll<00:03:08.760> go<00:03:08.910> through<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.150> couple<00:03:09.360> slides<00:03:09.810> see<00:03:10.590> how

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
we'll go through a couple slides see how

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:22.610 
we'll go through a couple slides see how
it<00:03:10.860> runs

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.680 

one<00:03:23.220> fish<00:03:23.580> two<00:03:23.610> fish<00:03:24.150> red<00:03:24.680> fish<00:03:26.330> and<00:03:27.330> keep<00:03:27.569> in

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
one fish two fish red fish and keep in

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.460 
one fish two fish red fish and keep in
mind<00:03:27.900> that<00:03:27.989> this<00:03:28.170> is<00:03:28.349> not<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:29.930> video<00:03:30.930> this<00:03:31.290> is

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
mind that this is not a video this is

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.850 
mind that this is not a video this is
its<00:03:32.010> flash<00:03:32.370> animation<00:03:33.090> or<00:03:33.299> something<00:03:33.720> so<00:03:34.709> it's

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
its flash animation or something so it's

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.789 
its flash animation or something so it's
running<00:03:35.159> this<00:03:35.250> all<00:03:35.489> right<00:03:35.700> so<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.299> can<00:03:36.500> if<00:03:37.500> you

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
running this all right so you can if you

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.550 
running this all right so you can if you
if<00:03:38.790> you're<00:03:39.360> concerned<00:03:39.720> about<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:40.200> can<00:03:40.379> tell

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
if you're concerned about you can tell

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.680 
if you're concerned about you can tell
that<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:41.280> frame<00:03:41.610> rate<00:03:41.849> on<00:03:42.030> even<00:03:42.390> this<00:03:42.510> is

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
that the frame rate on even this is

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.399 
that the frame rate on even this is
lower<00:03:45.079> than<00:03:46.079> than<00:03:46.409> on<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:47.040> modern<00:03:47.640> cell<00:03:47.970> phone

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409 
lower than than on a modern cell phone

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.600 
lower than than on a modern cell phone
you<00:03:49.409> know<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.530> two-hundred-dollar<00:03:50.099> cell<00:03:50.370> phone

which is awesome because I've had

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.800 
which is awesome because I've had
computers<00:04:02.519> that<00:04:02.730> weren't<00:04:03.000> this<00:04:03.090> capable<00:04:03.599> back

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
computers that weren't this capable back

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.069 
computers that weren't this capable back
in<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.079> 90s<00:04:04.609> so<00:04:05.609> it's<00:04:05.790> as<00:04:05.970> cool<00:04:06.540> light<00:04:06.840> where

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
in the 90s so it's as cool light where

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.970 
in the 90s so it's as cool light where
the<00:04:07.200> technology<00:04:07.409> is<00:04:07.859> going<00:04:08.040> but<00:04:09.000> um<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.980> mean

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
the technology is going but um I mean

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.190 
the technology is going but um I mean
you<00:04:11.099> can<00:04:11.250> have<00:04:11.400> fun<00:04:11.609> with<00:04:11.790> this<00:04:11.879> device<00:04:12.269> and

you can have fun with this device and
you<00:04:13.349> just<00:04:13.470> got<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.680> have<00:04:13.890> a<00:04:13.920> really<00:04:14.310> good

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
you just got to have a really good

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.279 
you just got to have a really good
wireless<00:04:15.269> signal<00:04:15.629> if<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.870> want<00:04:16.019> to<00:04:16.079> browse

the web the wireless chip in this thing
it<00:04:22.079> just<00:04:22.350> it<00:04:22.560> doesn't<00:04:23.010> pick<00:04:23.310> up<00:04:23.430> wireless

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
it just it doesn't pick up wireless

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.870 
it just it doesn't pick up wireless
signals<00:04:24.240> all<00:04:24.389> that<00:04:24.570> well<00:04:24.750> but<00:04:25.620> I<00:04:26.280> have<00:04:26.760> this

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
signals all that well but I have this

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.890 
device setup is an all offline device
like<00:04:29.639> I<00:04:29.760> said<00:04:29.820> it's<00:04:30.090> for<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:30.300> kid<00:04:30.479> I<00:04:30.510> don't<00:04:30.750> the

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
like I said it's for a kid I don't the

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.010 
like I said it's for a kid I don't the
internet<00:04:31.289> on<00:04:31.440> it<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:32.330> so<00:04:33.330> it's<00:04:33.479> cool<00:04:33.660> let<00:04:33.990> me

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
internet on it and so it's cool let me

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.450 
internet on it and so it's cool let me
just<00:04:34.349> bring<00:04:34.470> it<00:04:34.620> in<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.800> band<00:04:35.010> and<00:04:35.160> all<00:04:35.310> this

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
just bring it in the band and all this

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.060 
just bring it in the band and all this
stuff<00:04:35.700> just<00:04:35.970> works<00:04:36.930> on<00:04:37.169> it<00:04:37.200> without<00:04:37.680> being

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
stuff just works on it without being

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.040 
stuff just works on it without being
connected<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.210> any<00:04:39.330> Wi-Fi

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.510 

so<00:04:42.710> I<00:04:42.740> mean<00:04:43.039> this<00:04:43.159> here<00:04:43.580> it's<00:04:44.060> responsive

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
so I mean this here it's responsive

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.820 
so I mean this here it's responsive
you<00:04:47.120> know<00:04:47.240> there's<00:04:48.199> there's<00:04:48.379> plenty<00:04:48.740> of

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
you know there's there's plenty of

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.400 
you know there's there's plenty of
things<00:04:48.949> you<00:04:49.069> can<00:04:49.220> do<00:04:49.400> with<00:04:49.490> this<00:04:49.610> thing<00:04:49.849> to<00:04:50.410> to

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
things you can do with this thing to to

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.529 
things you can do with this thing to to
kill<00:04:51.620> time<00:04:51.860> it<00:04:52.069> runs<00:04:52.190> real<00:04:52.490> good<00:04:52.520> for<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:53.360> most

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
kill time it runs real good for the most

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.279 
kill time it runs real good for the most
part<00:04:53.810> it<00:04:54.050> does<00:04:54.229> have<00:04:54.440> a<00:04:54.500> camera<00:04:54.800> on<00:04:54.919> it<00:04:55.220> but<00:04:55.550> the

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289
