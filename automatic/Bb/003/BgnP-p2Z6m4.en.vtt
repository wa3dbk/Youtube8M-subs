00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
the inhibitor don't think they could get

the inhibitor don't think they could get
much<00:04:16.530> more<00:04:16.830> right<00:04:17.099> now<00:04:17.280> maybe<00:04:17.669> that<00:04:17.940> top

before remember they lost a game with
all<00:04:28.380> three<00:04:28.860> inhibitors<00:04:29.400> down<00:04:29.610> so<00:04:29.880> they're

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
all three inhibitors down so they're

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.219 
all three inhibitors down so they're
trying<00:04:30.300> not<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:30.750> make<00:04:30.840> that<00:04:30.960> same<00:04:31.200> mistake

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
on that hard engage composition this

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.240 
on that hard engage composition this
time<00:04:54.450> around<00:04:54.630> I<00:04:55.140> looked<00:04:55.320> there<00:04:55.650> was<00:04:55.770> 25

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
time around I looked there was 25

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.700 
time around I looked there was 25
minutes<00:04:56.880> of<00:04:57.030> good<00:04:57.300> solid<00:04:57.630> play<00:04:57.990> from<00:04:58.020> IM<00:04:58.560> in

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
minutes of good solid play from IM in

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.680 
minutes of good solid play from IM in
that<00:04:58.860> game<00:04:59.099> and<00:04:59.280> 16<00:05:00.000> minutes<00:05:00.030> of<00:05:00.390> kind<00:05:00.599> of

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
that game and 16 minutes of kind of

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.300 
that game and 16 minutes of kind of
meandering<00:05:01.289> and<00:05:01.590> not<00:05:01.979> really<00:05:02.190> understanding

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
meandering and not really understanding

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.159 
meandering and not really understanding
how<00:05:02.849> to<00:05:03.000> close<00:05:03.330> out<00:05:03.510> again<00:05:03.750> that<00:05:03.780> probably

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
how to close out again that probably

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.110 
how to close out again that probably
shouldn't<00:05:04.440> be<00:05:04.530> too<00:05:04.740> big<00:05:04.950> of<00:05:04.979> a<00:05:05.160> surprise<00:05:05.340> given

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
shouldn't be too big of a surprise given

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.339 
shouldn't be too big of a surprise given
them<00:05:06.360> on<00:05:06.450> the<00:05:06.570> lowest<00:05:06.930> side<00:05:07.140> of<00:05:07.260> these

standings<00:05:07.979> but<00:05:08.490> the<00:05:08.580> same<00:05:08.849> problems<00:05:09.240> exist

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630
