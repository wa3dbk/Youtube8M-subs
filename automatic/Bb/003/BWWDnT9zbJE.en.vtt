00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello people in this video it works 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.880
 to make an air heater 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.840
 as you can see i have been for this from me 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.800
 a radiator lie and that is 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.689
 a cpu fan from a computer like that 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.820
 pretty neat clean shares that 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.619
 you can see and within the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.539
 you can also see this fan 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.750
 integrated fan one really 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.719
 clean solved thing now i have in 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.880
 apron with this fan 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:41.010
 made different attempts and 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.140
 One of them was as an example I have one 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.620
 a couple of tlm taken tight on it 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.600
 I have built and tried this 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.910
 to make the radiator warm 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.879
 according to the heat dissipate 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.550
 according to manufacturer of this field element 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.940
 It is approved for 12 volt and ampere 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.440
 that is 96 watt and I also 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.809
 actually in this radiator 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.000
 can transfer 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.159
 as long as the blower is inside this 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.840
 radiator did not work was yes 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.080
 Everything was wonderful as well 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.760
 feel a heat and so is the fan 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.040
 jumped within 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.560
 Seconds nothing more to heat available 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.850
 so was completely dissipated in the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.580
 plaintext it means the 96 watts generated 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.340
 heat generated by the pt element 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.750
 were not enough for one 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.200
 constant heat flow 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.200
 maintain 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.659
 which is now there it lies just close that 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.150
 you go here and say okay okay 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.070
 if none of these sources of heat are me 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.320
 have been able to use before 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.450
 uphold this heat flow 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.689
 Actually, it really does get 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.119
 to take on the plaintiff like us 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.430
 that can get very hot 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.899
 and especially on a point how to 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.390
 sees the area because that's not 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.189
 very big you can do it in a small way 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.759
 Compare finger is about that 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.399
 my fingers the nagra 4 1 and 2 cents 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.179
 coin and that is actually relative 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.280
 small 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.250
 and if one says now that one for the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.740
 Generation of 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.120
 a military bang-gas plusminus circa 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.940
 200 watts in the minute needs it offers 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.790
 It's up to you to build something 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.420
 a construction builds where you act there 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.480
 can and so he was high with that 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.840
 Illuminates around the hot temperature 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.610
 this flame in this fan 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.800
 initiate 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.410
 whether it works or not or 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.270
 just as little as any attempt 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.640
 I already know you did 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.100
 not you should actually now 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.410
 But I have to say I have to build 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.170
 so many started construction there 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.150
 simply no longer comply with it 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.850
 That's why I decided to do this 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.890
 to put video on the net to show you 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.930
 and what's actually there and how 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.690
 that was actually thought 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.110
 if someone should find who is 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.959
 for this story can inspire the 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.450
 It can be that simple as an idea 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.980
 take and try to implement me 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.140
 I would be glad if I hear then 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.570
 that has actually managed one the 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.570
 and my thought actually not so 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.700
 was bad 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:28.269
 in the sense I'd ask all 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.570
 post car so do something pure 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:34.420
 results just down in this 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.870
 video purely so yes all synonymous note 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.760
 get how that was done and 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.470
 at the moment I say thank you for 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.360
 I wish you a nice time 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.989
 until the next video 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.989
 See you
