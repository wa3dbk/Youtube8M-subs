00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.700
 what is healthy eating 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.380
 now it was explained 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.599
 Eating well will provide a healthy life from childhood to old age 

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:13.469
 It is therefore very important to learn to eat well from children 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:15.600
 a proper diet 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.540
 nozar acquire healthy life habits be healthy individuals and 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.909
 strong and free of many diseases 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:25.909
 but so much talk about healthy diet and what does it consist of? 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.230
 you could say of that that being vary 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.399
 Is complete 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.089
 that is, it provides us with the right nutrients for our needs 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.440
 a graphic way to see it would be this 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.710
 it's not about taking only certain foods 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.710
 but that our body receives certain nutrients 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.140
 substances that it has of all the foods to develop and function 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.340
 each food contains several and different nutrients 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.040
 That's why it's important to gather all the groups in our diet 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.340
 foods 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.920
 I repeat it 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.810
 not some food 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.810
 yes some nutrients present in many foods 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.900
 for now it's all clear 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.360
 effectively 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.540
 to know that 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.380
 the health professionals have given us a fantastic pyramid 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.220
 the foods that we are going to consume the most are at the base 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.300
 It is composed of a-rod pasta 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.310
 cereal and potato 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.659
 in the second level 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.909
 we have vegetables, vegetables and fruits rich in vitamins and minerals 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.670
 also 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.700
 we also have olive oil here 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.700
 in the third level we have milk and its derivatives 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.420
 and in the fourth level are the meat the fish 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.020
 the vegetables and the soils 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.200
 these four groups are the ones that we have to consume daily 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.690
 but we still have the tip of the pyramid that is reserved for the 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.120
 casual consumption food 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.910
 composed of sweet sausages fat and refreshing drinks 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.580
 all this food pyramid would not hold without 2 500 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.180
 practice exercise regularly and take every day between one and two 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.709
 liters of water 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.139
 sports and water 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:15.900
 they are two fundamental elements of the pyramid 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.900
 and therefore of a healthy diet 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:23.569
 not only what we consume is important, but also its distribution as 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:24.679
 long day 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.379
 since it depends on our daily vitality 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.049
 our love and our performance in the various tasks we perform 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.019
 the most advisable thing to distribute it in 5 tomÃ¡s 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.179
 breakfast will be the most important meal of the day 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.700
 lunch serves 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.670
 to avoid getting to the food with excessive hunger avoiding binge eating 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:51.119
 the food has to reinforce the fatigue of the morning and bring them the 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:54.489
 enough energy to face the efforts of the afternoon 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.129
 but nevertheless 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.019
 It should not be excessively heavy 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.019
 the measure should not involve an excessive intake of calories 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.009
 the dinner has to be light 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:06.880
 to avoid bad digestions 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.030
 that can interrupt our rest at the time of falling asleep 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:12.829
 recapitulating 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.829
 we must continue and learn from childhood 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:20.689
 For a good diet, nutrients are needed 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.269
 we found that many foods 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.529
 know which of those foods 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:29.209
 you have to consume more using the pyramid with your 2 500 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.989
 physical exercise and water 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.190
 We will distribute this throughout the day in five meals 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:40.180
 eating breakfast like a king eating with a double 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.399
 and pulling considered 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:43.819
 in four steps 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.449
 from childhood nutrients according to a pyramid in five meals 

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:51.719
 these are the bases of healthy eating
