there the explosion but my xbox kept

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.560 
there the explosion but my xbox kept
freezing<00:01:46.979> when<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.729> was<00:01:47.850> up<00:01:47.939> there<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.420> blew

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
freezing when I was up there and we blew

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.240 
freezing when I was up there and we blew
it<00:01:48.600> up<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:48.960> decided<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.649> go<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.100> beach

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
it up so I decided to go on the beach

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.300 
it up so I decided to go on the beach
because<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.640> worked<00:01:50.820> previously<00:01:51.470> so<00:01:52.470> that's

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
because it worked previously so that's

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.969 
because it worked previously so that's
what<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.460> did<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.700> then<00:01:53.880> as<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.960> could<00:01:55.110> see<00:01:55.140> the
