00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
of a twist I recently discovered the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.839

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
speech jammer app on the phones that you

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.209

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.760 
can get on the ice stars just called
jammer<00:00:14.690> I'm<00:00:15.690> not<00:00:15.839> sure<00:00:15.990> it's<00:00:16.199> like<00:00:16.320> an<00:00:16.440> Android

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
jammer I'm not sure it's like an Android

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.050 
jammer I'm not sure it's like an Android
but<00:00:16.949> yeah<00:00:17.070> basically<00:00:17.220> what<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:17.820> thing<00:00:18.029> does

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
but yeah basically what this thing does

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.380 
but yeah basically what this thing does
is<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.960> replays<00:00:19.439> back<00:00:19.920> your<00:00:20.220> voice<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.760> like<00:00:21.359> a

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
is it replays back your voice I like a

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.439 
is it replays back your voice I like a
millisecond<00:00:22.020> delay<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:23.180> messes<00:00:24.180> with<00:00:24.330> your

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
millisecond delay and messes with your

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.939 
millisecond delay and messes with your
speech<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.019> only<00:00:25.170> works<00:00:25.410> on<00:00:25.680> some

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
speech and this only works on some

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.519 
speech and this only works on some
