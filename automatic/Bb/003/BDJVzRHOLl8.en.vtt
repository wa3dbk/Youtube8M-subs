share with you some techniques for

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.850 
share with you some techniques for
learning<00:00:07.529> Irish<00:00:08.099> tunes<00:00:08.639> by<00:00:09.240> ear<00:00:09.440> I'd<00:00:10.440> like<00:00:10.740> to

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
learning Irish tunes by ear I'd like to

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.310 
learning Irish tunes by ear I'd like to
call<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.190> segment<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:12.210> more<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:12.719> learn<00:00:12.750> the

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
call this segment the more you learn the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.580 
call this segment the more you learn the
easier<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.219> gets<00:00:14.660> and<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.809> want<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.080> start<00:00:16.350> out

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
easier it gets and I want to start out

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.330 
easier it gets and I want to start out
very<00:00:17.630> basically<00:00:21.199> learning<00:00:22.199> any<00:00:22.680> kind<00:00:23.250> of

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
very basically learning any kind of

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.019 
very basically learning any kind of
traditional<00:00:23.939> tune<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:25.430> physical<00:00:26.430> event<00:00:26.789> and

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
traditional tune is a physical event and

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.810 
traditional tune is a physical event and
we'll<00:00:27.900> start<00:00:28.230> with<00:00:28.439> with<00:00:28.830> some<00:00:29.039> thing<00:00:29.640> that

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
we'll start with with some thing that

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.359 
we'll start with with some thing that
you<00:00:29.910> might<00:00:30.420> be<00:00:30.800> intimately<00:00:31.800> familiar<00:00:32.070> with

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
you might be intimately familiar with

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:43.639 
you might be intimately familiar with
something<00:00:33.149> like<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:42.170> you'll<00:00:43.170> notice<00:00:43.379> i'm

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
something like this you'll notice i'm

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.670 
something like this you'll notice i'm
only<00:00:43.829> using<00:00:44.010> my<00:00:44.280> left<00:00:44.460> hand<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.469> there's<00:00:46.469> this

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
only using my left hand and there's this

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.660 
only using my left hand and there's this
pattern<00:00:47.160> which<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.719> one<00:00:48.719> two<00:00:49.320> three<00:00:49.920> one<00:00:50.160> two

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
pattern which is one two three one two

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.970 
pattern which is one two three one two
three<00:00:51.199> we<00:00:52.199> can<00:00:52.379> get<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.590> little<00:00:52.860> more

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
three we can get a little more

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:07.190 
three we can get a little more
complicated<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.850> go<00:01:05.210> okay<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.270> you'll<00:01:06.990> notice

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
complicated and go okay so you'll notice

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.280 
complicated and go okay so you'll notice
in<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.650> Thun<00:01:07.920> there<00:01:08.130> are<00:01:08.220> some<00:01:08.400> jumps<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:10.229> you

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
in that Thun there are some jumps so you

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.520 
in that Thun there are some jumps so you
have<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.740> learn<00:01:10.920> how<00:01:11.270> it<00:01:12.270> feels<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.780> if<00:01:19.380> you're

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
have to learn how it feels and if you're

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.679 
have to learn how it feels and if you're
just<00:01:19.740> starting<00:01:19.860> out<00:01:20.310> learning<00:01:20.670> tunes<00:01:21.360> by<00:01:21.659> ear

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
just starting out learning tunes by ear

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.230 
just starting out learning tunes by ear
I<00:01:22.229> would<00:01:22.979> suggest<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.610> pick<00:01:23.820> out<00:01:24.000> some

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
I would suggest that you pick out some

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.170 
I would suggest that you pick out some
tunes<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.780> know<00:01:25.049> very<00:01:25.979> well<00:01:26.250> at<00:01:26.939> least

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
tunes that you know very well at least

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.420 
tunes that you know very well at least
in<00:01:27.509> your<00:01:27.780> head<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.229> try<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.829> find<00:01:29.130> them<00:01:29.280> on

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
in your head and try to find them on

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:39.399 
in your head and try to find them on
your<00:01:29.579> instrument<00:01:29.850> another<00:01:30.600> good<00:01:30.840> one<00:01:31.049> is

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.819 

remember<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.560> one<00:01:42.140> you<00:01:43.140> also<00:01:43.470> might

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
remember that one you also might

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.469 
remember that one you also might
discover<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.840> start<00:01:46.140> tunes<00:01:46.500> on

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
discover that you can start tunes on

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.450 
discover that you can start tunes on
different<00:01:48.479> notes<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:49.079> other<00:01:49.619> ways<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:50.070> other

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
different notes in other ways in other

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.940 
different notes in other ways in other
words<00:01:50.700> different<00:01:51.689> places<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.680> instrument

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
words different places on the instrument

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.249 
words different places on the instrument
for<00:01:53.670> instance<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.060> first<00:01:54.329> tune<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:55.110> can

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
for instance the first tune you can

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:03.680 
for instance the first tune you can
start<00:01:55.530> here<00:01:57.140> we<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.259> also<00:01:58.409> start<00:01:58.710> here

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:13.700 

oh<00:02:05.960> right<00:02:08.180> so<00:02:11.870> try<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:12.900> out<00:02:13.170> on<00:02:13.530> your

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
oh right so try that out on your

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.680 
oh right so try that out on your
instrument<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.510> see<00:02:15.510> how<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.650> goes
