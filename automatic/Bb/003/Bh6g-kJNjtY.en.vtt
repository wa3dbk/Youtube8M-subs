can see it's running at a decent speed I

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.410 
can see it's running at a decent speed I
would<00:01:24.659> say<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:24.930> going<00:01:25.229> at<00:01:26.240> sixty<00:01:27.240> percent

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
would say it's going at sixty percent

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.819 
would say it's going at sixty percent
out<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.740> normal<00:01:29.070> speed<00:01:30.049> being<00:01:31.049> as<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.560> right

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
out of normal speed being as that right

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.600 
out of normal speed being as that right
now<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.250> running<00:01:32.700> at<00:01:32.880> about<00:01:33.470> 22<00:01:34.470> 21<00:01:35.189> frames

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
now it's running at about 22 21 frames

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.140 
now it's running at about 22 21 frames
per<00:01:36.030> second<00:01:36.479> out<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:37.189> 30<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.670> optimal

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
per second out of 30 and the optimal

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.679 
per second out of 30 and the optimal
would<00:01:39.299> be<00:01:39.590> at<00:01:40.590> 30<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.700> when<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.450> going

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
would be at 30 and when it's going

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.590 
would be at 30 and when it's going
really<00:01:42.960> well<00:01:43.079> like<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.710> battle<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.579> goes<00:01:45.060> at<00:01:45.240> 60

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
really well like in battle it goes at 60

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.080 
really well like in battle it goes at 60
frames<00:01:45.630> per<00:01:45.960> second<00:01:46.500> which<00:01:47.220> makes<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.640> run<00:01:47.880> at

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
frames per second which makes it run at

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.690 
frames per second which makes it run at
a<00:01:48.149> very<00:01:48.509> good<00:01:48.750> speed<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.350> as<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:50.250> can<00:01:50.369> see<00:01:50.549> in

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
a very good speed so as you can see in

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.300 
a very good speed so as you can see in
battles<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.270> runs<00:01:51.630> very<00:01:51.840> well<00:01:52.619> doesn't<00:01:53.159> look

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
battles it runs very well doesn't look

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.330 
battles it runs very well doesn't look
like<00:01:53.579> it's<00:01:53.759> lagging<00:01:54.000> at<00:01:54.479> all<00:01:54.890> except<00:01:55.890> for<00:01:56.130> when

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
like it's lagging at all except for when

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.100 
like it's lagging at all except for when
it's<00:01:56.490> showing<00:01:56.790> animations<00:01:57.509> but<00:01:57.750> when<00:01:57.990> you're

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
it's showing animations but when you're

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.679 
it's showing animations but when you're
actually<00:01:58.259> selecting<00:01:59.189> commands<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.820> doing
