00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
power supply as you can see starting

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.280 
power supply as you can see starting
perfectly<00:01:17.280> no<00:01:17.580> problem<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.689> here's<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
perfectly no problem and here's just the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.749 
perfectly no problem and here's just the
hard<00:01:19.500> drive<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.920> would<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.310> show<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.549> how

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
hard drive I would like to show you how

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.330 
hard drive I would like to show you how
it<00:01:20.939> looks<00:01:21.150> without<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.570> cover<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.740> mattered

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
it looks without the cover this mattered

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.109 
it looks without the cover this mattered
anyway<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.000> doesn't<00:01:24.540> matter<00:01:25.430> so<00:01:26.430> that's<00:01:27.000> as

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
anyway so doesn't matter so that's as

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.760 
anyway so doesn't matter so that's as
simple<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.900> see<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.290> now<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.530> will

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
simple as you can see and now I will

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.060 
simple as you can see and now I will
show<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.009> how<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.280> measure<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.909> voltages<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
show you how to measure the voltages and

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.590 
show you how to measure the voltages and
remember<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.549> should<00:01:32.790> measure<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.210> voltages

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
remember you should measure the voltages

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.179 
remember you should measure the voltages
using<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> multimeter<00:01:34.409> only<00:01:34.920> because

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
using the multimeter only because

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.569 
using the multimeter only because
software<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:36.030> always<00:01:36.750> not<00:01:37.350> telling<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
software is always not telling you the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.569 
software is always not telling you the
truth<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.479> Rho<00:01:39.659> voltages<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.350> always<00:01:41.130> check

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
truth that Rho voltages so always check

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.080 
truth that Rho voltages so always check
it<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.720> then<00:01:43.409> measure<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.979> using<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
it and then measure it using the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.410 
it and then measure it using the
multimeter<00:01:45.500> now<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:47.460> course<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.180> computer

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
multimeter now of course the computer

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.810 
multimeter now of course the computer
need<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:48.960> assembled<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:50.460> computer

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
need to be assembled and the computer

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.609 
need to be assembled and the computer
need<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.180> switched<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.600> if<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.380> want<00:01:52.530> to

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
need to be switched on if you want to

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.260 
need to be switched on if you want to
measure<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.759> best<00:01:53.939> way<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.240> to

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
measure it and the best way is to

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.690 
measure it and the best way is to
measure<00:01:54.540> when<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.409> computer<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.189> under<00:01:56.549> load

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
measure when the computer is under load

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.999 
measure when the computer is under load
okay<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.960> started<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.590> need<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.979> a

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
okay so it started you need the a

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.469 
okay so it started you need the a
multimeter<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.729> course<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:02.479> something

remember always use the multimeter never
software<00:03:43.780> I<00:03:44.019> will<00:03:44.950> switch<00:03:45.130> it<00:03:45.160> off<00:03:45.400> make<00:03:45.940> this

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
software I will switch it off make this

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.500 
software I will switch it off make this
quieter<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.610> that<00:03:48.610> is<00:03:48.730> 5%<00:03:49.480> plus<00:03:49.690> minus<00:03:50.200> 5%

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
quieter and that is 5% plus minus 5%

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.160 
quieter and that is 5% plus minus 5%
fluctuation<00:03:52.510> in<00:03:52.720> your<00:03:52.780> voltages<00:03:53.500> so<00:03:54.269> any<00:03:55.269> more

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
fluctuation in your voltages so any more

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.350 
fluctuation in your voltages so any more
than<00:03:56.380> 5%<00:03:57.010> is<00:03:57.640> no<00:03:57.850> good<00:03:58.060> at<00:03:58.209> all

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
than 5% is no good at all

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.660 
than 5% is no good at all
okay<00:03:59.260> so<00:03:59.320> I<00:03:59.500> hope<00:03:59.709> that<00:03:59.890> was<00:04:00.040> helpful<00:04:00.070> for<00:04:00.489> you
