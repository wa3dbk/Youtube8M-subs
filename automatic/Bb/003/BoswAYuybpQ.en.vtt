00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:10.890
 I will explain how to disassemble the coffee ank 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:15.440
 First open the top lid and pull out the coffee tank 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:19.800
 And turn the coffee size transparent part to the left 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:23.189
 Remove the black meter of the surface there 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:28.130
 Then remove the lid of the 4 t tank 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.130
 Remove the plate at 10 o'clock when it is turned over 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.970
 Next , disassemble the scale 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.420
 Turn over the coffee tank scale 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.539
 Remove the meter plate 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.150
 Next , pinch the top and bottom with your palm 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:51.410
 Please turn to the arrow method while holding down 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:55.020
 Finally, while putting your finger in the hole, pull it up 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:59.960
 Bottom plate can be removed 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.960
 This completes the decomposition of the coffee type 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:09.850
 In the case where the coffee powder can not be decomposed solidified soaking in warm water once Then 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:14.990
 You can easily decomposed 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:21.550
 Next I will explain how to clean the coffee tank 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:28.600
 First of all , wipe off the dirt on the transparent part of the coffee tank with a soft cloth 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:33.990
 At this time , please be careful not to wash with water because the rubber part is hard to dry 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:38.189
 Then wash the plate on the coffee tank scale 10 o'clock 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:43.040
 Use a dry cloth to wipe out the dirt on each part 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:49.300
 If dirt can not be removed, put it in warm water and rinse it. 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:56.409
 If you still can not remove the dirt, please lightly rub off the dirt 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:02:02.799
 After draining, let it naturally dry over night and let it dry well 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:04.340
 Never use a dryer to dry it, as it may deform. 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:09.830
 Please give me 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:14.170
 Finally, I will explain how to assemble the coffee cup process lego . 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:20.580
 First , assemble the coffee tank weighing machine 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:23.940
 Place the bottom plate to the meter body while aligning the mark which is a measure 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.150
 Next hold the two parts with your palm 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:31.780
 Lock while holding down 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:39.480
 It will look like this if locked successfully 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.480
 Listen to the triangular protrusion at the center of the weighing plate and align it with the coworker's body 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.460
 Next is the assembly of the transparent part 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:53.160
 First put on the cap 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:55.820
 The protrusion at the center of the 10 o'clock plate faces the inside of the transparent part of the coffee tank 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.820
 Snap in 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.939
 Combine the bright part and the scale 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:12.020
 Match the special express on the following parts and fit in 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:16.630
 Let's turn it to the right until the transparent part stops while fixing the measuring instrument on the side 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.630
 Finally return to the coal mine machine 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.300
 accomplished 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.860
 Please enjoy coffee of barista from now on
