00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.389
 very good from a new tutorial of 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.280
 mobile components I present the speaker 

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:11.709
 boy 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.110
 usb port account to be able to put 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:17.230
 music between the mini series to load it 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.720
 and microsd card around here back has 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.280
 the whole speaker can move the 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.950
 hands 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:29.950
 and here's headset input 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.950
 we understand 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.010
 Kirchner 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.720
 I already have it here I get that 08 I got 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.720
 connect is already with fully connected 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.690
 and now we put some music so that 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.690
 sound 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.250
 but 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.250
 here allows us to increase the volume 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.050
 we just got a whatsapp 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.330
 we lower the volume 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.180
 from here low volume down 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.420
 keeping it fixed and if we go up towards 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.420
 above 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.960
 about the volume 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.750
 this is the speaker also gives us the 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.990
 option that if we press we make a 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.229
 pause but we press again makes them 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.229
 a play 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.360
 if we keep tight and it does not change us 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.350
 The mode 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.350
 with radio 2 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.590
 and we press 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.800
 is going to do a sweep of all the 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.010
 stations that you will find we have to 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.390
 let it work until the coastal 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.390
 make it totally sweep 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.180
 it's more cantor 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:12.090
 for example we can stop it if we go to 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.090
 give arrives to select 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.740
 of all the all located 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.900
 pressing 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.120
 we change a bluetooh mode right now 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.730
 then as I see it connect with the 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.159
 mobile if I give it 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.489
 I keep listening with the song of 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.489
 report 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.500
 comes with its cable to charge it by 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.500
 mini usb 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.760
 usb to a plug to a network adapter and 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.849
 this is the auxiliary to connect it to 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.299
 computer to an mp3 type of these 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.299
 little ones 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.030
