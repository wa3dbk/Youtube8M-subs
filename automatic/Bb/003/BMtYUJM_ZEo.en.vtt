little<00:01:42.840> stand<00:01:43.140> here<00:01:44.899> not<00:01:45.899> too<00:01:46.110> difficult<00:01:46.500> to

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
little stand here not too difficult to

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.639 
little stand here not too difficult to
pull<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.950> off<00:01:47.060> well<00:01:48.060> here's<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:49.140> first<00:01:49.409> and

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
pull it off well here's the first and

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.069 
pull it off well here's the first and
the<00:01:49.740> smaller<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.520> two<00:01:50.700> ear<00:01:51.479> loops<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.960> can

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
the smaller of the two ear loops you can

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.499 
the smaller of the two ear loops you can
see<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.950> secondary<00:01:53.399> ealer<00:01:53.790> ear<00:01:54.090> loop<00:01:54.299> is

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
see that the secondary ealer ear loop is

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.380 
see that the secondary ealer ear loop is
a<00:01:54.740> significantly<00:01:55.740> larger<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:57.090> you've<00:01:57.240> got

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
a significantly larger so you've got

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.819 
a significantly larger so you've got
some<00:01:57.540> options<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.990> terms<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.290> sizing<00:02:00.680> you<00:02:01.680> can

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
some options in terms of sizing you can

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:02.990 
some options in terms of sizing you can
pull<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.040> right<00:02:02.280> off<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.700> don't<00:02:02.759> need<00:02:02.939> it

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
pull that right off so you don't need it

like<00:04:15.479> that<00:04:15.629> this<00:04:15.870> one<00:04:15.989> worked<00:04:16.139> out<00:04:16.289> pretty

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
like that this one worked out pretty

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.719 
like that this one worked out pretty
well<00:04:16.560> for<00:04:16.859> me<00:04:16.979> in<00:04:17.070> spite<00:04:17.280> of<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.400> fact<00:04:17.549> that<00:04:17.609> I

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
well for me in spite of the fact that I

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.439 
well for me in spite of the fact that I
have<00:04:17.849> rather<00:04:18.000> large<00:04:18.120> ears<00:04:18.750> I<00:04:20.359> recorded<00:04:21.359> a

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
have rather large ears I recorded a

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.170 
have rather large ears I recorded a
quick<00:04:21.630> test<00:04:21.959> call<00:04:22.260> so<00:04:23.070> you<00:04:23.190> can<00:04:23.340> hear<00:04:24.000> how<00:04:24.029> the

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
quick test call so you can hear how the

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.730 
quick test call so you can hear how the
noise<00:04:24.419> cancellation<00:04:24.900> works<00:04:25.229> roughly<00:04:25.650> now

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
noise cancellation works roughly now

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.350 
noise cancellation works roughly now
don't<00:04:25.950> take<00:04:26.099> this<00:04:26.159> as<00:04:26.460> a<00:04:26.490> per

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
don't take this as a per

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.059 
don't take this as a per
an<00:04:27.419> indication<00:04:27.810> of<00:04:28.080> call<00:04:28.469> quality<00:04:28.740> with<00:04:29.009> the

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:29.069 
an indication of call quality with the

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:30.619 
an indication of call quality with the
headset<00:04:29.310> which<00:04:29.460> seems<00:04:29.669> pretty<00:04:29.819> good<00:04:30.000> but<00:04:30.240> at

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:30.629 
headset which seems pretty good but at

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:32.240 
headset which seems pretty good but at
least<00:04:30.750> give<00:04:30.960> you<00:04:31.020> an<00:04:31.110> idea<00:04:31.379> how<00:04:31.530> it<00:04:31.680> handles

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
least give you an idea how it handles

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:49.399 
least give you an idea how it handles
some<00:04:32.370> noises<00:04:47.990> so<00:04:48.990> your<00:04:49.139> nurse<00:04:49.259> with<00:04:49.379> the

saying no notice the difference when I

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:02.059 
saying no notice the difference when I

turn it off again Claudia is definitely

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:04.309 
turn it off again Claudia is definitely
better<00:05:02.310> when<00:05:02.580> it's<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.539> hair<00:05:03.689> dryers<00:05:03.900> off<00:05:04.110> but

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:04.319 
better when it's the hair dryers off but

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:09.529 
better when it's the hair dryers off but
still<00:05:04.529> pretty<00:05:04.650> good<00:05:04.770> nonetheless<00:05:08.539> here's

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
still pretty good nonetheless here's

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.089 
still pretty good nonetheless here's
more<00:05:09.659> clear<00:05:09.900> now<00:05:10.050> as<00:05:10.229> I<00:05:10.289> moved<00:05:10.500> into<00:05:10.650> a<00:05:10.740> bigger

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
more clear now as I moved into a bigger

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.779 
more clear now as I moved into a bigger
room<00:05:11.310> that<00:05:11.639> are<00:05:11.759> sound<00:05:13.189> so<00:05:14.189> overall<00:05:14.580> pretty

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
room that are sound so overall pretty

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.339 
room that are sound so overall pretty
impressive<00:05:15.150> in<00:05:15.330> terms<00:05:15.509> of<00:05:15.689> how<00:05:15.870> it<00:05:15.990> handles

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
impressive in terms of how it handles

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.140 
impressive in terms of how it handles
the<00:05:16.500> noise<00:05:16.680> cancellation<00:05:17.009> doesn't<00:05:17.400> 100%

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
the noise cancellation doesn't 100%

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.879 
the noise cancellation doesn't 100%
block<00:05:18.389> it<00:05:18.569> out<00:05:18.659> but<00:05:18.719> it<00:05:18.990> definitely<00:05:19.229> makes<00:05:19.529> the

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
block it out but it definitely makes the

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.379 
block it out but it definitely makes the
headset<00:05:20.279> usable<00:05:20.699> inside<00:05:20.969> of<00:05:21.090> noisy

headset usable inside of noisy

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.200
