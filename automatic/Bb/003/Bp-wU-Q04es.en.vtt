00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hey this is a basin red wing 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.600
 every nightmare of every weight 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.130
 watchers and we do the power that I show 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.639
 you in this sequence of barbecue from 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.360
 rheinhessen 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.360
 have lots of fun with it 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.320
 the ingredients we use for the bacon red 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.970
 wings need what we already call it 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.830
 I need bacon bacon here 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.360
 again the bacon from the colorful bentheimer 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.780
 from my audience gallinat years 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.550
 always a true splendor then yes 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.900
 Need to drink , of course , was called something 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.210
 Do you take this little biscuit? 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.930
 pastry the things with marshmallow cream 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.580
 fill 270 calories apiece but that 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.230
 should not bother us today because of it 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.750
 Let's take a bit of a and syrup 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.150
 with that the ingredients so and they 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.699
 their drinks and pool and that's all 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.989
 then we prepare now before so handy 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.360
 Drinking is so unpacked you can 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.280
 that have been filled down and see 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.989
 that's why I'm grabbing myself this way now 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.470
 a slice of the colorful bentheimer 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.909
 Bacon and put the quickie on it 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.610
 and hit the corners here 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.290
 a bit high that just when the 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.560
 the filling gets hot right away 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.940
 does not just stretch out like this 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.369
 then I put two slices now 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:23.970
 belkin next to each other and beat the 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.970
 over here above 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.240
 and then our bacon rappt winky 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.460
 prepared and allowed on the grill 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.820
 I have the profit on 220 degrees 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:50.470
 preheated and that is really nice 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:54.010
 warm and we are this gorgeous 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.710
 bacon rap quickies the sentences i now 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:01.540
 just here in the middle in the 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.460
 indirect cover area and now 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.000
 Let's wait ten minutes and 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.830
 then come back with the wheel like you 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.760
 You can see the marshmallow cream look 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.770
 to their thinking away at it to 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.209
 brave the bacon is already pretty crisp 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.840
 so now is time for ours 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.840
 ahrensburg 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.400
 Now we're going to run two more 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.080
 minutes to pull so she is drinking 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:46.069
 I completely take it out here 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:47.720
 now from the grill and so looks 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.860
 finished from Beijing dapd 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.150
 keys with maple syrup absolute madness 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.150
 they are leaving a little bit now 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.150
 cool and then eaten 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.590
 yes then it is time for this 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.239
 drink to taste let it on everyone 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.800
 case cool I say that very clearly 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.750
 ever in advance because that's one 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.209
 jelly and if that's really hot 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.370
 is and it gets to the palate then it will 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.900
 really angry I can already see now 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.920
 it seems to be quite tasty 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.920
 then I know now also times 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:29.150

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.049
 this sugar mass and next to it 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.489
 this tart 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.650
 an example is here actually 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.450

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.230

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.850
