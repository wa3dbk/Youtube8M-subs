00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello everyone is nasri 1 8 of 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.049
 the tamini trouble I hope you go 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.490
 Well, I'm fine, we're going 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.750
 today for a new episode of 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.090
 three things you did not know 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.130
 maybe not on the ps4 so just 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.929
 before small break I would like you 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.359
 thank you all case you have been very 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.580
 many to tell me and appreciated the 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.140
 last the last episode so that 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.640
 I had done with respect to this series 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.289
 so I thank you all but 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.539
 some of you some of you I saw 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.359
 told me that the information given was 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.309
 sometimes a little too basic so on this 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.260
 episode there I really broke the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.760
 head for all your info a lot more 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.170
 complicated and I hope that for the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.370
 most you would not know them 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.390
 after that for sure if you are a 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.370
 expert of the abbey we will 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.640
 know for sure that's okay we're 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.640
 left 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.820
 so first thing did you know that 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.260
 sony has put in place a system for 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.680
 talk to his playstation 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.570
 a bit like we'll say that in a little 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.980
 like an iphone with syria where we can 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.629
 to talk to him is exactly the same 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.250
 so it's very simple for that it you 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.770
 just have a microphone so for example 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.510
 the microphone that you had delivered in the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.950
 playstation when you bought it and 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.560
 your arm you connect it to your 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.880
 joystick and talk to you and you say 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.970
 playstation and you will see you 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.110
 playstation light watch and chain a 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.680
 once arrived in there tells you 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.890
 all orders every 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.890
 orders 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.869
 all swamp orders 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.880
 notification and see true that it works 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.259
 that's a little buggy because 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.750
 since I would like to make the video at the same 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.399
 time it's a little weird but so 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.539
 normally it's a market so here 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.520
 it's a little gadget they put and 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.610
 it allows you to talk to your console with 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.160
 your microphone here are second tips 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.770
 did you know that we can film his 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.360
 screen 2 ps4 on his ps vita 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.679
 in fact it's very simple you see 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.429
 your everything you see on the screen 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.649
 from the ps4 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.910
 he transcribed on ps vita and so that 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.920
 can serve imagine you have to go 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.420
 to the toilet and wherever you have by 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.610
 example go eat that you have to 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.980
 stay connected to your thesis 4 you the 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.590
 connect via your ps vita you go 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.510
 in your living room eat and at the same time 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.050
 you can play with remote in ps4 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.760
 the ps vita 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.530
 so for those I'm going to show you 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.000
 it's very simple at first 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.330
 you have to go to settings on the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.090
 playstation get off a little bit 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.730
 up to connection settings 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.140
 remote play enable playback 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.959
 remote so connect directly 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.739
 at the ps vita ps thierry and you do a 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.720
 added a device so once 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.610
 there you will see mark the start 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.690
 the ps4 so we end up the swiss 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.260
 thomas ps vita so that I can 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.260
 show more 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.960
 so once on your ps vita 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.520
 so here you see her I'm going to you 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.910
 to show it's very simple what you 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.020
 go do 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.520
 so that's where I do not know what I 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.590
 think you have good you 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.070
 go to go in ps4 link on the ps 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.780
 vita is there we start you and 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.510
 once arrived in this link so you 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.080
 see the code that showed behind on 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.510
 the ps4 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.360
 you will be reading from a distance and 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.020
 you are reloading ps4 stele in class so 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.070
 I saw it already knows that since 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.390
 he's used to you have noticed 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.250
 failed because as I was there on 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.290
 it will work there logically it should 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.800
 to walk better but here you have just 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.800
 to enter your code 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.810
 so here they are checking 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.940
 the environment and that's you and 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.430
 I arrive and in fact just everything 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.020
 what is on the ps vita ps 4,038 on 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.390
 ps lives and I can play ps 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.130
 vita I can do everything if I came on 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.470
 trials 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.750
 after I can so here it is I can 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.130
 little psk system to get back to nothing 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.709
 finally we can do everything in fact 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.769
 we just play with his ps vita and 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:57.340
 it's a very interesting formality that 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:59.530
 sony set up third and 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.910
 last thing for this one he goes 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.870
 have to go again in 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:07.420
 parameters random notification is so 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.100
 once arrived here so we will be able 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.900
 uncheck some crosses that are only used to 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.459
 nothing so what is it at tiff ication 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.260
 affirmed notification it's very simple 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.359
 actually not at the top right of your 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.400
 screen be sent mark your friend and 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.530
 online your friend to review a part 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.120
 it will remove this display 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.500
 so that's interesting because sometimes 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.460
 when playing and that is to 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.440
 his record is pretty boring 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.740
 for example when a part of love 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.220
 that I think of some not nothing 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.050
 uploading it can be 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.890
 remove 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.330
 after two terms you do as you 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.100
 want but that too activities you 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.320
 can remove it too I think after 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.490
 it's up to you to see that but it's 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.840
 something as interesting a little 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.960
 little more known not very complicated but 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.669
 I still wanted to show it to you 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.860
 so the video is over I hope that 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.720
 the tips toronto him and will have served 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.000
 if so I can just ask 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.870
 put a little green thumb that makes me 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.760
 really happy 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.140
 nota bonus is not the case and to go 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.880
 see the other videos that are 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.810
 displayed here is everyone and at 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.169
 the next for a new video 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.169
 lease
