the lag and all the crap that you have

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.030 
the lag and all the crap that you have
so<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.629> already<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.290> downloaded<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.950> this

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
so I already have it downloaded and this

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.830 
so I already have it downloaded and this
is<00:00:44.160> what<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.399> looks<00:00:44.550> like<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.420> open<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.690> up

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
is what it looks like so just open it up

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.380 
is what it looks like so just open it up
and<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.770> list<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.640> things<00:00:47.910> once<00:00:48.270> it

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
and you have a list of things once it

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.069 
and you have a list of things once it
opens<00:00:48.890> and<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.789> usually<00:00:51.300> just<00:00:51.480> check<00:00:51.930> off

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
opens and I usually just check off

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.639 
opens and I usually just check off
everything<00:00:53.780> except<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:54.870> network<00:00:55.170> passwords

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
everything except for network passwords

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.560 
everything except for network passwords
because<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.920> need<00:00:56.070> those<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.969> saves<00:00:57.390> your

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
because you need those it saves your

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.290 
because you need those it saves your
network<00:00:57.870> passwords<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:59.280> don't<00:00:59.670> get<00:01:00.120> rid<00:01:00.239> of

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
network passwords so don't get rid of

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.960 
network passwords so don't get rid of
that<00:01:05.900> okay<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.200> at<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.159> bottom<00:01:08.340> here<00:01:08.670> there's

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
that okay and at the bottom here there's

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.649 
that okay and at the bottom here there's
this<00:01:09.420> Advanced<00:01:10.260> tab<00:01:10.680> what<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.659> really

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
this Advanced tab what you really

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.820 
this Advanced tab what you really
shouldn't<00:01:13.020> touch<00:01:13.200> unless<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.650> know<00:01:13.740> what

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
shouldn't touch unless you know what

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.249 
shouldn't touch unless you know what
you're<00:01:13.920> doing<00:01:14.220> because<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.939> don't<00:01:15.750> really<00:01:16.049> know

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
you're doing because I don't really know

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.800 
you're doing because I don't really know
what<00:01:16.409> much<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.100> stuff<00:01:17.159> does<00:01:17.810> like

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
what much of this stuff does like

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.440 
what much of this stuff does like
environment<00:01:19.229> path<00:01:19.439> or<00:01:19.860> window<00:01:20.460> size<00:01:20.820> /

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
environment path or window size /

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.630 
environment path or window size /
location<00:01:21.689> cash<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.159> don't<00:01:23.310> touch<00:01:23.430> me<00:01:23.610> that

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
location cash so I don't touch me that

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.999 
location cash so I don't touch me that
so<00:01:24.210> after<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.479> go<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.810> applications<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.799> I

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
so after that go to applications and I

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.070 
so after that go to applications and I
pretty<00:01:26.729> much<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:26.939> check<00:01:27.450> every<00:01:27.930> single

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
pretty much just check every single

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.950 
pretty much just check every single
thing<00:01:28.259> off<00:01:28.530> because<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.340> will<00:01:29.520> really<00:01:30.509> free<00:01:30.869> up

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
thing off because it will really free up

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.719 
thing off because it will really free up
your<00:01:30.990> lag<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.189> lot<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.340> these<00:01:32.460> programs

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
your lag it's a lot of these programs

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.420 
your lag it's a lot of these programs
use<00:01:33.119> up<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.299> lot<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.479> memory<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:35.100> once<00:01:35.280> you're

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
use up a lot of memory so once you're

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.859 
use up a lot of memory so once you're
done<00:01:35.520> checking<00:01:35.790> stuff<00:01:36.030> off<00:01:36.210> click<00:01:36.630> run

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
done checking stuff off click run

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.640 
done checking stuff off click run
cleaner<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:38.450> it'll<00:01:39.450> start<00:01:39.930> cleaning<00:01:40.619> your

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
cleaner and it'll start cleaning your

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.249 
cleaner and it'll start cleaning your
crap<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.579> don't<00:01:42.150> worry<00:01:42.329> because<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.079> won't

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
crap and don't worry because this won't

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.380 
crap and don't worry because this won't
get<00:01:43.619> rid<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.890> any<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.250> your<00:01:44.430> useful<00:01:44.640> files<00:01:45.149> or

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
get rid of any of your useful files or

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.109 
get rid of any of your useful files or
anything<00:01:45.720> like<00:01:46.680> one<00:01:46.860> time<00:01:46.890> my<00:01:47.729> brother<00:01:47.790> was

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
anything like one time my brother was

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.999 
anything like one time my brother was
suffering<00:01:48.509> from<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.930> large<00:01:49.170> amount<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.530> lag<00:01:49.710> so

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
suffering from a large amount of lag so

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.069 
suffering from a large amount of lag so
I<00:01:50.040> did<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:50.490> cleaner<00:01:50.790> firm<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.810> cleared

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
I did this cleaner firm and it cleared

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.440 
I did this cleaner firm and it cleared
up<00:01:52.170> about<00:01:52.680> five<00:01:53.159> megabytes<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.790> memory<00:01:53.909> and

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
up about five megabytes of memory and

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.719 
up about five megabytes of memory and
after<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.200> he<00:01:55.259> was<00:01:55.710> lag<00:01:56.009> for<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
after that he was lag for you for the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.310 
after that he was lag for you for the
longest<00:01:56.939> time<00:01:57.180> until<00:01:57.960> they<00:01:58.049> started

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
longest time until they started

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.649 
longest time until they started
downloading<00:01:58.680> more<00:01:58.890> crap<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.460> then<00:02:00.420> after

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
downloading more crap but then after

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.230 
downloading more crap but then after
that<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.840> gonna<00:02:00.960> click<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.200> registry<00:02:01.799> and

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
that you gonna click on registry and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.990 
that you gonna click on registry and
have<00:02:03.240> everything<00:02:03.570> clicked<00:02:04.049> here<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.439> then

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.600 

this<00:02:10.530> usually<00:02:10.679> takes<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.100> little<00:02:11.220> bit<00:02:11.370> longer

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
this usually takes a little bit longer

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.180 
this usually takes a little bit longer
but<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.150> ran<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> cleaner<00:02:12.690> today<00:02:12.960> earlier<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.920> I

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
but I ran a cleaner today earlier so I

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.850 
but I ran a cleaner today earlier so I
really<00:02:14.970> don't<00:02:15.150> have<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.270> much<00:02:15.510> stuff<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.260> be

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
really don't have that much stuff to be

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.949 
really don't have that much stuff to be
cleaned<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.830> just<00:02:20.010> wait<00:02:20.130> for<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.430> finish

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
cleaned so just wait for this to finish

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.809 
cleaned so just wait for this to finish
once<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.110> does<00:02:22.230> click<00:02:22.530> fix<00:02:22.950> selected<00:02:23.520> issues

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
once it does click fix selected issues

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.810 
once it does click fix selected issues
and<00:02:25.160> once<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.959> dialog<00:02:27.959> box<00:02:28.260> opens<00:02:28.560> up<00:02:29.280> click

fix<00:02:30.150> all<00:02:30.360> selected<00:02:30.990> issues<00:02:31.290> because<00:02:31.770> they're

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
fix all selected issues because they're

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.190 
fix all selected issues because they're
mostly<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.310> same<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.820> it'll<00:02:33.570> tell<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:33.990> that

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.500 
mostly the same and it'll tell you that
the<00:02:34.380> issues<00:02:34.709> were<00:02:35.130> fixed<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.790> there's<00:02:36.420> a

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
the issues were fixed and there's a

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.300 
the issues were fixed and there's a
toolbox<00:02:36.870> over<00:02:37.230> here<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.770> can<00:02:37.890> use<00:02:38.160> to

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
toolbox over here that you can use to

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.670 
toolbox over here that you can use to
uninstall<00:02:39.000> your<00:02:39.239> programs<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.380> little<00:02:40.560> bit

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
uninstall your programs a little bit

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.710 
uninstall your programs a little bit
easier<00:02:40.800> than<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.370> windows<00:02:41.730> default

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
easier than the windows default

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.330 
easier than the windows default
uninstaller<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:43.709> I<00:02:43.739> recommend<00:02:44.010> using<00:02:44.400> this

a little bit here because my screen is
completely<00:03:37.860> black<00:03:38.540> once<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.690> loads<00:03:39.810> just<00:03:40.079> open

completely black once it loads just open

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.830 
completely black once it loads just open

settings and usually this is what it

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.830 
settings and usually this is what it
looks<00:03:48.090> like<00:03:48.739> once<00:03:49.739> you<00:03:49.890> first<00:03:50.160> start<00:03:50.430> off<00:03:50.840> the

distance too far but we're going to

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
is really laggy and this isn't probably

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.310 
is really laggy and this isn't probably
the<00:04:16.590> preferred<00:04:16.890> way<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.100> play<00:04:18.049> because<00:04:19.049> I

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
the preferred way to play because I

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.240 
the preferred way to play because I
prefer<00:04:20.900> FPS<00:04:21.900> /<00:04:22.169> graphics<00:04:22.770> any<00:04:22.950> day

decreased<00:04:42.080> or<00:04:43.080> minimal<00:04:43.890> I<00:04:44.180> don't<00:04:45.180> think<00:04:45.360> it

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
decreased or minimal I don't think it

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.050 
decreased or minimal I don't think it
makes<00:04:45.600> much<00:04:45.810> of<00:04:45.870> a<00:04:46.020> difference<00:04:46.050> so<00:04:46.800> I<00:04:47.070> usually

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
makes much of a difference so I usually

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.270 
makes much of a difference so I usually
set<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.360> decreased<00:04:48.780> then<00:04:49.590> I<00:04:49.710> get<00:04:49.920> out<00:04:50.040> of<00:04:50.070> that

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
set to decreased then I get out of that

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.390 
set to decreased then I get out of that
and<00:04:51.830> as<00:04:52.830> you<00:04:53.700> can<00:04:53.880> see<00:04:54.350> my<00:04:55.350> minecraft<00:04:56.100> is

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
and as you can see my minecraft is

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.830 
and as you can see my minecraft is
actually<00:04:57.000> a<00:04:57.060> little<00:04:57.540> less<00:04:58.410> laggy<00:04:58.890> R<00:04:59.190> so<00:04:59.840> this

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
actually a little less laggy R so this

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.840 
actually a little less laggy R so this
helps<00:05:01.140> this<00:05:01.620> is<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:01.919> basic<00:05:02.160> stuff<00:05:02.669> that

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
helps this is the basic stuff that

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.940 
helps this is the basic stuff that
people<00:05:03.000> know<00:05:03.270> but<00:05:04.020> there's<00:05:04.200> actually<00:05:04.410> another

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
people know but there's actually another

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.740 
people know but there's actually another
part<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:05.460> this<00:05:05.490> that<00:05:05.910> a<00:05:05.940> lot<00:05:06.240> of<00:05:06.270> people<00:05:06.330> don't

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
part to this that a lot of people don't

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.780 
part to this that a lot of people don't
know<00:05:06.840> because<00:05:07.290> after<00:05:08.040> changing<00:05:08.490> all<00:05:08.760> that

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
know because after changing all that

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.880 
know because after changing all that
people<00:05:09.360> still<00:05:09.720> experience<00:05:10.260> lag<00:05:10.560> and<00:05:10.770> I<00:05:10.830> know

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
people still experience lag and I know

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.430 
people still experience lag and I know
from<00:05:11.250> experience<00:05:11.400> myself<00:05:12.080> so<00:05:13.080> we're<00:05:13.230> going<00:05:13.350> to

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
from experience myself so we're going to

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.860 
from experience myself so we're going to
do<00:05:13.530> is<00:05:13.680> open<00:05:13.860> up<00:05:14.010> your<00:05:14.220> task<00:05:15.180> manager<00:05:15.630> you<00:05:15.720> can

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
do is open up your task manager you can

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.010 
do is open up your task manager you can
access<00:05:16.140> that<00:05:16.320> by<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:16.560> taskbar<00:05:17.070> or<00:05:17.220> clicking

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
access that by the taskbar or clicking

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.020 
access that by the taskbar or clicking
ctrl<00:05:19.020> shift<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:19.710> escape<00:05:20.070> and<00:05:20.760> go<00:05:20.910> to<00:05:20.970> your

ctrl shift and escape and go to your

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
processes and usually at the top you'll

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.159 
processes and usually at the top you'll
see<00:05:24.120> Java<00:05:24.600> w<00:05:25.020> exe<00:05:25.680> that's<00:05:26.370> minecraft<00:05:26.940> and<00:05:27.210> it

see Java w exe that's minecraft and it

right-clicking on java w you can set

right-clicking on java w you can set
priorities<00:05:41.630> which<00:05:42.630> allows<00:05:42.960> minecraft<00:05:43.560> to

priorities which allows minecraft to

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.710 
priorities which allows minecraft to
allocate<00:05:44.070> more<00:05:44.250> memory<00:05:44.430> so<00:05:45.240> once<00:05:45.419> you<00:05:45.510> click

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
allocate more memory so once you click

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.930 
allocate more memory so once you click
set<00:05:45.960> priority<00:05:46.560> you<00:05:46.710> can<00:05:46.890> choose<00:05:47.400> either<00:05:47.430> real

you had more RAM you probably wouldn't

you're just going to click above normal

beautiful<00:06:13.590> and<00:06:14.330> i<00:06:15.330> have<00:06:16.169> no<00:06:16.530> lag<00:06:16.830> right<00:06:17.070> now<00:06:17.250> i

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.290 
beautiful and i have no lag right now i

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.719 
beautiful and i have no lag right now i
can<00:06:19.290> basically<00:06:19.500> do<00:06:19.890> whatever<00:06:19.979> i<00:06:20.220> want<00:06:20.310> without

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
can basically do whatever i want without

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:25.280 
can basically do whatever i want without
worrying<00:06:21.180> about<00:06:21.660> lag<00:06:23.810> this<00:06:24.810> kind<00:06:24.990> of<00:06:25.140> actually

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
worrying about lag this kind of actually

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.409 
worrying about lag this kind of actually
makes<00:06:26.010> me<00:06:26.220> want<00:06:26.400> to<00:06:26.460> play<00:06:26.580> minecraft<00:06:27.120> a<00:06:27.240> little

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
makes me want to play minecraft a little

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.070 
makes me want to play minecraft a little
bit<00:06:27.540> more<00:06:27.690> because<00:06:28.310> when<00:06:29.310> i<00:06:29.340> used<00:06:29.610> to<00:06:29.729> play

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
bit more because when i used to play

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.110 
bit more because when i used to play
like<00:06:31.080> back<00:06:31.590> in<00:06:31.620> my<00:06:31.800> minecraft<00:06:32.280> prime<00:06:32.669> it<00:06:32.970> was

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
like back in my minecraft prime it was

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.810 
like back in my minecraft prime it was
super<00:06:33.539> laggy

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
super laggy

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.000 
super laggy
and<00:06:34.910> now<00:06:35.690> it's<00:06:35.960> actually<00:06:36.200> really<00:06:36.770> good<00:06:39.010> this

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.010 
and now it's actually really good this

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.800 
and now it's actually really good this
is<00:06:40.160> probably<00:06:40.430> the<00:06:40.610> best<00:06:41.030> way<00:06:41.420> to<00:06:41.480> fix<00:06:41.840> your<00:06:42.050> leg

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:43.810 
is probably the best way to fix your leg

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.330 
is probably the best way to fix your leg
so<00:06:44.810> if<00:06:44.900> you<00:06:45.020> have<00:06:45.200> a<00:06:45.230> really<00:06:45.590> light<00:06:45.830> computer

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
so if you have a really light computer

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.910
