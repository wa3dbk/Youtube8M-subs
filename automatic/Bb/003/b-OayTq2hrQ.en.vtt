hello<00:00:08.120> I'm<00:00:08.450> Adam<00:00:08.840> with<00:00:09.020> Roma<00:00:09.230> Bowl<00:00:09.470> i'm<00:00:09.680> here

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
hello I'm Adam with Roma Bowl i'm here

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.500 
hello I'm Adam with Roma Bowl i'm here
today<00:00:09.980> to<00:00:10.190> talk<00:00:10.580> to<00:00:10.639> you<00:00:10.850> about<00:00:11.090> the

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510 
today to talk to you about the

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.720 
today to talk to you about the
architecture<00:00:11.960> of<00:00:12.559> rho<00:00:13.010> sink<00:00:13.720> row<00:00:14.720> sink<00:00:15.080> is<00:00:15.320> a

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
architecture of rho sink row sink is a

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.150 
architecture of rho sink row sink is a
mediating<00:00:16.730> server<00:00:17.180> it<00:00:17.960> helps<00:00:18.380> you<00:00:18.560> keep<00:00:18.830> data

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
mediating server it helps you keep data

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.960 
mediating server it helps you keep data
synchronized<00:00:19.939> to<00:00:20.930> mobile<00:00:21.349> devices<00:00:21.970> from

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
synchronized to mobile devices from

synchronized to mobile devices from
back-end<00:00:23.840> apps<00:00:25.840> that<00:00:26.840> expose<00:00:27.350> web<00:00:27.830> service

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
back-end apps that expose web service

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.729 
back-end apps that expose web service
interfaces<00:00:29.380> so<00:00:30.730> the<00:00:31.730> RO<00:00:31.970> sync<00:00:32.330> server<00:00:32.739> sits

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
interfaces so the RO sync server sits

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.650

you can either host your own row sync

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.080 
you can either host your own row sync
server<00:00:37.850> or<00:00:38.829> if<00:00:39.829> you're<00:00:40.070> using<00:00:40.100> row<00:00:40.579> hub<00:00:40.850> we

client that row sync client sits on top

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.560 
client that row sync client sits on top
of<00:01:57.680> a<00:01:57.979> database<00:01:58.250> that<00:01:58.909> we<00:01:59.090> ship<00:01:59.360> with

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
of a database that we ship with

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.859 
of a database that we ship with
generally<00:02:00.409> its<00:02:00.590> sequel<00:02:00.950> light<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:01.630> its<00:02:02.630> job

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
generally its sequel light and its job

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.199 
generally its sequel light and its job
is<00:02:02.930> to<00:02:03.110> talk<00:02:04.040> to<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.490> RO<00:02:04.729> sync<00:02:05.030> server<00:02:07.209> which

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
is to talk to the RO sync server which

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.979 
is to talk to the RO sync server which
then<00:02:08.509> makes<00:02:08.840> calls<00:02:09.410> to<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:11.090> source<00:02:11.450> adapter

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
then makes calls to the source adapter

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.949 
then makes calls to the source adapter
that<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:12.410> write<00:02:13.030> which<00:02:14.030> has<00:02:14.239> log<00:02:14.480> in<00:02:14.690> query

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
that you write which has log in query

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.990 
that you write which has log in query
create<00:02:15.290> update<00:02:15.650> delete<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.190> log<00:02:16.370> off<00:02:16.610> that

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
create update delete and log off that

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.390 
create update delete and log off that
talks<00:02:17.270> to<00:02:17.360> your<00:02:17.480> back-end<00:02:17.690> system

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
talks to your back-end system

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.210 
talks to your back-end system
very<00:02:19.060> often<00:02:19.329> you<00:02:19.629> can<00:02:19.840> just<00:02:20.200> write<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.829> query

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
very often you can just write a query

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.559 
very often you can just write a query
method<00:02:21.659> and<00:02:23.370> what<00:02:24.370> this<00:02:24.489> does<00:02:24.730> is<00:02:24.939> talks<00:02:25.239> to<00:02:25.540> a

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
method and what this does is talks to a

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.500 
method and what this does is talks to a
back-end<00:02:26.110> app<00:02:26.590> this<00:02:27.340> could<00:02:27.549> be<00:02:27.579> any<00:02:27.909> app<00:02:28.180> that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
back-end app this could be any app that

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.839 
back-end app this could be any app that
you<00:02:28.629> choose<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:29.230> might<00:02:29.470> be<00:02:29.680> some<00:02:29.890> hosted<00:02:30.370> CRM

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
you choose it might be some hosted CRM

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.410 
you choose it might be some hosted CRM
and<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:32.500> app<00:02:32.769> exposes<00:02:33.519> either<00:02:33.939> a<00:02:34.090> rest

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
and that app exposes either a rest

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.599 
and that app exposes either a rest
interface<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:35.260> possibly<00:02:35.620> exposes<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.340> soap

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
interface it possibly exposes a soap

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.809 
interface it possibly exposes a soap
interface<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:39.010> will<00:02:39.220> write<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.579> query

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
interface and so you will write a query

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.410 
interface and so you will write a query
method<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:40.750> calls<00:02:41.200> out<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:42.189> the<00:02:42.730> rest<00:02:43.000> or

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
method that calls out to the rest or

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.789 
method that calls out to the rest or
soap<00:02:43.659> interface<00:02:44.370> grabs<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.609> information

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
soap interface grabs the information

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.099 
soap interface grabs the information
parses<00:02:47.799> it<00:02:47.829> out<00:02:48.159> and<00:02:48.519> then<00:02:48.569> that<00:02:49.569> is<00:02:49.599> going<00:02:49.930> to

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
parses it out and then that is going to

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:56.670 
parses it out and then that is going to
get<00:02:50.230> stored<00:02:50.819> into<00:02:51.819> a<00:02:52.030> database<00:02:55.440> then<00:02:56.440> keep

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
get stored into a database then keep

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.259 
get stored into a database then keep
track<00:02:57.010> of<00:02:57.190> objects<00:02:58.349> attributes<00:02:59.349> and<00:03:00.250> values

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.599 

so<00:03:04.269> now<00:03:04.599> we're<00:03:04.840> going<00:03:05.019> to<00:03:05.139> go<00:03:05.859> off<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.579> the

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
so now we're going to go off to the

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.250 
so now we're going to go off to the
screencast<00:03:07.269> to<00:03:07.450> encourage<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:07.989> look<00:03:08.079> at

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
the screencast that's called row sync

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.259 
the screencast that's called row sync
with<00:03:11.019> row<00:03:11.260> hub<00:03:11.530> that<00:03:12.250> describes<00:03:12.819> how<00:03:13.209> you

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
would write those source adapters thank

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.370 
would write those source adapters thank
you
