Dan Dave and spark Faust cuts the first
one<00:00:07.500> was<00:00:07.710> inspired<00:00:08.069> by<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.760> molecule<00:00:09.389> to

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
one was inspired by the molecule to

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.980 
one was inspired by the molecule to
spring<00:00:09.900> production<00:00:11.179> and<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.360> second<00:00:12.719> one<00:00:12.809> was

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
spring production and the second one was

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.780 
spring production and the second one was
inspired<00:00:13.469> by<00:00:13.830> Genesis
