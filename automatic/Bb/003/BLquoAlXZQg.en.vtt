with<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.850> app<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.210> figure<00:02:49.540> out<00:02:49.720> if<00:02:50.710> I<00:02:50.860> want<00:02:51.160> it

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
with the app to figure out if I want it

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.190 
with the app to figure out if I want it
now<00:02:51.340> it's<00:02:51.580> enough<00:02:51.910> time<00:02:52.210> to<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.570> guess<00:02:52.690> see<00:02:53.080> if

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
now it's enough time to I guess see if

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.750

you<00:02:53.320> like<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.710> app<00:02:53.830> but<00:02:54.130> I<00:02:54.160> don't<00:02:54.460> think<00:02:54.580> it's

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
you like the app but I don't think it's

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.120 
you like the app but I don't think it's
enough<00:02:54.880> time<00:02:55.300> nearly<00:02:55.720> enough<00:02:56.050> time<00:02:56.350> to

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
enough time nearly enough time to

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.940 
enough time nearly enough time to
actually<00:02:57.540> get<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.570> play<00:02:58.900> with<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.320> which<00:02:59.650> kind

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
actually get to play with it which kind

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.460 
actually get to play with it which kind
of<00:03:00.010> sucks<00:03:00.370> but<00:03:00.790> it's<00:03:01.420> it's<00:03:01.750> enough<00:03:02.020> time<00:03:02.260> to

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
of sucks but it's it's enough time to

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.110 
of sucks but it's it's enough time to
honestly<00:03:02.950> I'm<00:03:03.070> kind<00:03:03.100> of<00:03:03.310> like<00:03:03.460> contradicting

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
honestly I'm kind of like contradicting

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.610 
honestly I'm kind of like contradicting
myself<00:03:04.180> but<00:03:04.570> it's<00:03:04.720> enough<00:03:04.960> time<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.350> see<00:03:05.500> if

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
myself but it's enough time to see if

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.100 
myself but it's enough time to see if
you<00:03:05.710> like<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.220> app<00:03:06.370> I<00:03:06.580> guess<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:07.840> that's<00:03:07.989> the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
you like the app I guess so that's the

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.500 
you like the app I guess so that's the
only<00:03:08.140> downside<00:03:08.770> now<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.400> paid<00:03:09.970> version<00:03:10.000> is

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
only downside now the paid version is

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.900 
only downside now the paid version is
399<00:03:11.020> it's<00:03:11.410> a<00:03:11.440> little<00:03:11.620> steep<00:03:11.890> but<00:03:11.950> it's<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.760> great

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
399 it's a little steep but it's a great

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.600 
399 it's a little steep but it's a great
app<00:03:13.239> nonetheless<00:03:13.900> so<00:03:14.830> let's<00:03:15.340> go<00:03:15.430> ahead<00:03:15.459> and

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610
