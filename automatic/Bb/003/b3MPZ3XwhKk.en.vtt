00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
Ravens won I really think it's going to

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
for sure going to be that so if you have

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.000 
for sure going to be that so if you have
the<00:02:40.630> coins<00:02:40.870> for<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.500> would<00:02:41.620> like<00:02:41.770> that

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
then be sure to get that this one is

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.280 
then be sure to get that this one is
obviously<00:02:44.800> going<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.370> be<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.520> flash<00:02:45.760> backpack

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
obviously going to be a flash backpack

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.440 
obviously going to be a flash backpack
so<00:02:47.290> if<00:02:47.650> you're<00:02:47.800> in<00:02:48.130> flashbacks<00:02:48.940> I<00:02:49.120> would<00:02:49.239> apply

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
so if you're in flashbacks I would apply

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.270 
so if you're in flashbacks I would apply
that<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:49.780> if<00:02:50.170> you're<00:02:50.350> too<00:02:50.560> lazy<00:02:50.770> to<00:02:51.010> do<00:02:51.130> the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
that and if you're too lazy to do the

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.080 
that and if you're too lazy to do the
set<00:02:51.550> um<00:02:53.130> so<00:02:54.130> buy<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.520> for<00:02:54.670> a<00:02:54.730> reasonable

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
set um so buy that for a reasonable

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.300 
set um so buy that for a reasonable
price<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.630> I<00:02:55.900> think<00:02:56.260> that's<00:02:56.470> pretty<00:02:56.770> much<00:02:57.010> it

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
price and I think that's pretty much it

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.660 
price and I think that's pretty much it
I<00:02:57.730> don't<00:02:58.209> know<00:02:58.330> if<00:02:58.450> I'm<00:02:58.570> missing<00:02:58.870> any<00:02:59.459> that<00:03:00.459> are
