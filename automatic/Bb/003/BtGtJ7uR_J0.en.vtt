00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 the pilot maría de villota has 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.609
 reappeared smiling before the media 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.500
 communication after his accident the 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.389
 last month of july the madrileña 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.700
 sheltered by his family and by many 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.070
 friends has transmitted a full optimism 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.130
 after leaving behind a real nightmare 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.370
 he approached one of the surgeons who 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.070
 I had operated and with my family around 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.490
 Maria told me 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.760
 we have saved your life 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.980
 but we have to tell you that you have lost 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.020
 the eye 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.530
 at that moment 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:42.460
 I looked at the doctor and told him you are 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.980
 surgeon and he said yes and I told him and 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.750
 you operate with two hands you need two 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.180
 hands to operate 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.520
 and he said yes yes and I told him then I 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.750
 I'm a Formula 1 driver and I need 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.610
 two eyes and the poor guy I told him about that 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.650
 eye was my decision as if the poor to 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.620
 the best would have had some option 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:07.970
 to be able to do something and you realize that 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:11.000
 you see more than before because I used to just 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.960
 I saw formula 1 I used to just see myself 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.550
 on top of a car competing and did not see 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.200
 what was really important in the 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.630
 life the clarity of saying 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.969
 I'm alive and that at that time there 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.219
 I was valuing the biggest thing that is 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:29.670
 that the person who was there, then, 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:32.040
 had saved so 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.439
 this eye has returned me the north has 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.890
 returned the important thing the first time 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.369
 I looked in the mirror and I stayed 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.710
 terrified 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.630
 but looking at her I stayed more 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.690
 shocked by what she was 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.039
 suffering for me not and then I made a 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.080
 grace and I said to the mirror removes bug 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:56.039
 at that time I had 104 points in the 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.289
 face had my eye covered and my face the 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.869
 horrible or as you can imagine but 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:04.700
 at that moment my mother smiled and 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.100
 we share the anecdote with the family 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:12.180
 what I really thought at that moment 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:15.299
 it was that he's going to love me like that 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.310
 and I have realized that they have loved me 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:21.150
 more than 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.280
 I have a whole life to cover the other 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.750
 and the one that comes to me now all 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.200
 pilots shows her the love I've 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.599
 had it been amazing messages darling 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.010
 encouragement from people that have given me 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.380
 overwhelmed and they have done that today 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.200
 when I look in the mirror because this 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.780
 proud because I really think that my 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.200
 Current aspect says much more of who 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.000
 it's Maria de Villota from the aspect that 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.349
 I said previously mine is to say 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.140
 I carry my story and I take it with me 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.660
 very much love and pride and I give you the 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.370
 thank you all for this push of 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.049
 all the messages that one of 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.970
 the ones that most touched her was Carlos 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.569
 6 who attended with his son also 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.830
 pilot to show his support and affection 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.319
 but if I'm going to thank you for the 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.000
 example that we have all been given to 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.980
 young people too 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.610
 this that is before finished now a lot 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.600

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.600
 it's something to the touch
