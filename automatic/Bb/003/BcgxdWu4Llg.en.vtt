the m60e4 light machine gun available to
the<00:00:15.060> support<00:00:15.480> class<00:00:15.630> now<00:00:16.439> we<00:00:16.500> did<00:00:16.769> see<00:00:17.009> the<00:00:17.160> m60

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
the support class now we did see the m60

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.210 
the support class now we did see the m60
in<00:00:17.970> battlefield<00:00:18.570> 3<00:00:18.689> of<00:00:19.050> course<00:00:19.259> now<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.099> is

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
in battlefield 3 of course now this is

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.849 
in battlefield 3 of course now this is
the<00:00:20.339> m60e4<00:00:20.999> version<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.169> we've<00:00:22.320> got<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.560> assume

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
the m60e4 version so we've got to assume

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.800 
the m60e4 version so we've got to assume
it's<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.400> slightly<00:00:23.730> different<00:00:23.999> model<00:00:24.359> but<00:00:24.539> for

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
it's a slightly different model but for

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.359 
it's a slightly different model but for
all<00:00:24.869> intents<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.349> purposes<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:26.220> is

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
all intents and purposes this is

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.279 
all intents and purposes this is
basically<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.999> exact<00:00:27.329> same<00:00:27.419> weapon<00:00:27.929> we<00:00:28.079> saw

single round on operation Metro is

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.720 
single round on operation Metro is
actually<00:00:43.590> more<00:00:43.770> difficult<00:00:43.920> than<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.400> seems

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
actually more difficult than it seems

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.390 
actually more difficult than it seems
but<00:00:45.630> to<00:00:45.750> get<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.990> m60<00:00:46.500> all<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.100> do<00:00:47.250> is

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
but to get the m60 all you have to do is

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.310 
but to get the m60 all you have to do is
get<00:00:47.580> one<00:00:47.790> anti-vehicle<00:00:48.360> ribbon<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.960> destroy

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
get one anti-vehicle ribbon and destroy

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.130 
get one anti-vehicle ribbon and destroy
five<00:00:49.620> vehicles<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.310> Gulf<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.670> Oman<00:00:50.810> now<00:00:51.810> all<00:00:51.990> of

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
five vehicles on Gulf of Oman now all of

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.780 
five vehicles on Gulf of Oman now all of
this<00:00:52.260> does<00:00:52.560> have<00:00:52.830> to<00:00:52.980> be<00:00:53.070> done<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.550> space

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
this does have to be done in the space

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.030 
this does have to be done in the space
of<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.090> single<00:00:54.450> game<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.350> way<00:00:55.470> I<00:00:55.500> achieved

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
of a single game so the way I achieved

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.560 
of a single game so the way I achieved
this<00:00:56.250> was<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.580> course<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.910> join<00:00:57.060> a<00:00:57.120> match<00:00:57.360> with

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
this was of course to join a match with

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.330 
this was of course to join a match with
as<00:00:57.690> many<00:00:57.870> tickets<00:00:58.260> as<00:00:58.440> possible<00:00:58.950> the<00:00:59.070> longer

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
as many tickets as possible the longer

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.070 
as many tickets as possible the longer
the<00:00:59.430> match<00:00:59.610> the<00:01:00.120> more<00:01:00.300> time<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.660> have<00:01:00.690> to

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
the match the more time you have to

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.990 
the match the more time you have to
destroy<00:01:01.410> those<00:01:01.590> vehicles<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.610> I<00:01:02.700> went<00:01:02.910> in

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
destroy those vehicles and I went in

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.700 
destroy those vehicles and I went in
using<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.360> Recon<00:01:03.780> class<00:01:04.049> with<00:01:04.289> a<00:01:04.379> spawn

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
using the Recon class with a spawn

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.010 
using the Recon class with a spawn
beacon<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.609> course<00:01:05.880> c4<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.570> would<00:01:06.749> put<00:01:06.899> that

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
beacon and of course c4 I would put that

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.410 
beacon and of course c4 I would put that
spawn<00:01:07.289> beacon<00:01:07.619> down<00:01:07.770> around<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.340> flag<00:01:08.579> wait<00:01:09.240> for

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
spawn beacon down around a flag wait for

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.910 
spawn beacon down around a flag wait for
enemy<00:01:09.659> poised<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.990> capture<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.469> flag<00:01:10.679> and

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
enemy poised to capture that flag and

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.099 
enemy poised to capture that flag and
then<00:01:11.130> perish<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.820> keep<00:01:12.359> an<00:01:12.509> out<00:01:12.630> for<00:01:12.659> enemy

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:13.109 
then perish you in keep an out for enemy

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:14.989 
then perish you in keep an out for enemy
vehicles<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.710> try<00:01:13.859> and<00:01:13.979> throw<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.310> c4<00:01:14.729> from<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:14.999 
vehicles and try and throw the c4 from a

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:16.819 
vehicles and try and throw the c4 from a
bug<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.659> very<00:01:15.840> effective<00:01:16.170> way<00:01:16.469> to<00:01:16.499> get<00:01:16.770> as

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829 
bug it's a very effective way to get as

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:18.319 
bug it's a very effective way to get as
close<00:01:17.069> to<00:01:17.249> those<00:01:17.340> vehicles<00:01:17.609> as<00:01:17.880> possible

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
close to those vehicles as possible

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:19.520 
close to those vehicles as possible
without<00:01:18.539> being<00:01:18.899> detected

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
without being detected

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.800 
without being detected
so<00:01:19.859> the<00:01:20.039> m60<00:01:20.700> light<00:01:21.030> machine<00:01:21.420> gun<00:01:21.630> has

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
so the m60 light machine gun has

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.239 
so the m60 light machine gun has
actually<00:01:22.229> been<00:01:22.350> used<00:01:22.409> by<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.799> American

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:23.249 
actually been used by the American

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:26.090 
actually been used by the American
military<00:01:23.340> since<00:01:23.990> 1957<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.649> is<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:26.069> of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
military since 1957 so it is one of

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.679 
military since 1957 so it is one of
their<00:01:26.219> most<00:01:26.369> long-standing<00:01:26.700> weapons<00:01:27.509> in

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
their most long-standing weapons in

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.660 
their most long-standing weapons in
service<00:01:28.140> now<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.859> course<00:01:29.009> since<00:01:29.219> it<00:01:29.399> was<00:01:29.490> first

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
service now of course since it was first

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.399 
service now of course since it was first
created<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.299> has<00:01:30.450> seen<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> lot<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.869> changes<00:01:31.380> and

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
created it has seen a lot of changes and

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.319 
created it has seen a lot of changes and
a<00:01:31.560> lot<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.710> upgrades<00:01:32.159> but<00:01:32.670> all<00:01:32.819> in<00:01:32.969> all<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.299> is

basically the exact same iconic weapon

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.249 
basically the exact same iconic weapon
we<00:01:35.670> saw<00:01:35.880> heavily<00:01:36.270> used<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.719> the<00:01:36.840> Vietnam<00:01:37.229> War

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
we saw heavily used in the Vietnam War

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.440 
we saw heavily used in the Vietnam War
so<00:01:38.009> let's<00:01:38.219> go<00:01:38.369> ahead<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.789> take<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.969> look<00:01:39.179> at<00:01:39.359> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
so let's go ahead and take a look at the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.200 
so let's go ahead and take a look at the
stats<00:01:39.749> now<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.409> m60<00:01:41.009> actually<00:01:41.460> has<00:01:41.609> a<00:01:41.639> very

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
stats now the m60 actually has a very

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.629 
stats now the m60 actually has a very
impressive<00:01:42.600> damage<00:01:43.020> model<00:01:43.469> with<00:01:43.859> a<00:01:43.950> 34%

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:44.639 
impressive damage model with a 34%

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:47.569 
impressive damage model with a 34%
maximum<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> 25%<00:01:46.079> minimum<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.189> thing<00:01:47.459> is

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
maximum and a 25% minimum this thing is

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.639 
maximum and a 25% minimum this thing is
actually<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:48.119> par<00:01:48.359> with<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.719> scar-h<00:01:49.020> assault

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
actually on par with the scar-h assault

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.739 
actually on par with the scar-h assault
rifle<00:01:50.039> now<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.850> comparison<00:01:51.389> with<00:01:51.479> its<00:01:51.539> other

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:51.749 
rifle now in comparison with its other

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:54.260 
rifle now in comparison with its other
LMG<00:01:52.289> counterparts<00:01:52.979> such<00:01:53.130> as<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.280> mg<00:01:53.700> 4<00:01:54.030> and

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
LMG counterparts such as the mg 4 and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.529 
LMG counterparts such as the mg 4 and
the<00:01:54.389> m249<00:01:54.959> they<00:01:55.709> only<00:01:55.859> rack<00:01:56.100> up<00:01:56.279> a<00:01:56.399> 25%<00:01:57.389> maximum

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
the m249 they only rack up a 25% maximum

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.959 
the m249 they only rack up a 25% maximum
and<00:01:57.990> an<00:01:58.200> 18<00:01:58.649> minimum<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.249> their<00:01:59.459> maximum

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
and an 18 minimum so their maximum

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.730 
and an 18 minimum so their maximum
damage<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.539> only<00:02:00.779> just<00:02:01.079> on<00:02:01.289> par<00:02:01.499> with<00:02:01.679> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
damage is only just on par with the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.919 
damage is only just on par with the
minimum<00:02:02.069> of<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.369> m60<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.179> can<00:02:03.329> see<00:02:03.539> this

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
minimum of the m60 so you can see this

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.169 
minimum of the m60 so you can see this
weapon<00:02:04.170> really<00:02:04.679> does<00:02:04.829> pull<00:02:05.130> some<00:02:05.340> weight<00:02:05.549> now

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
weapon really does pull some weight now

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:07.730 
weapon really does pull some weight now
the<00:02:06.240> range<00:02:06.539> of<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:06.810> weapon<00:02:07.020> isn't<00:02:07.619> too

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
the range of this weapon isn't too

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.600 
the range of this weapon isn't too
shabby<00:02:08.129> either

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
shabby either

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.789 
shabby either
the<00:02:08.819> drop<00:02:09.030> off<00:02:09.209> starts<00:02:09.569> at<00:02:09.659> 8<00:02:09.810> meters<00:02:10.019> as<00:02:10.409> to<00:02:10.679> be

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
the drop off starts at 8 meters as to be

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.320 
the drop off starts at 8 meters as to be
expected<00:02:10.890> with<00:02:11.430> most<00:02:11.640> weapons<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.299> game

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
expected with most weapons in the game

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.160 
expected with most weapons in the game
but

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
but

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.230 
but
actually<00:02:13.440> reaches<00:02:13.800> out<00:02:13.950> all<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.280> way<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.490> 75

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
actually reaches out all the way to 75

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.240 
actually reaches out all the way to 75
meters<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:15.900> in<00:02:16.170> comparison<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.069> other

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
meters so in comparison to the other

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.150 
meters so in comparison to the other
LMGs<00:02:17.819> of<00:02:17.940> only<00:02:18.090> 65<00:02:18.540> meters<00:02:19.080> those<00:02:19.530> extra<00:02:19.950> 10

LMGs of only 65 meters those extra 10

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.830 
LMGs of only 65 meters those extra 10
meters<00:02:20.489> would<00:02:20.640> still<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.150> course<00:02:21.330> minimum

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
meters would still of course minimum

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.470 
meters would still of course minimum
damage<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.290> 25%<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:23.700> are<00:02:23.880> going<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.090> be<00:02:24.180> taking

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
damage of 25% you are going to be taking

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.300

down<00:02:24.510> players<00:02:24.930> quite<00:02:25.170> easily<00:02:25.410> at<00:02:25.800> long<00:02:26.040> range

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
down players quite easily at long range

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.520 
down players quite easily at long range
if<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:26.849> can<00:02:27.060> make<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.330> shot<00:02:27.569> now<00:02:28.200> where<00:02:28.410> this

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
if you can make the shot now where this

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.410 
if you can make the shot now where this
weapon<00:02:28.920> begins<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.340> fall<00:02:29.520> down<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.180> course

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
weapon begins to fall down is of course

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.740 
weapon begins to fall down is of course
its<00:02:30.630> rate<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:30.870> fire<00:02:31.050> with<00:02:31.650> only<00:02:32.000> 570<00:02:33.000> rpm<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.630> is

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
its rate of fire with only 570 rpm it is

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.540 
its rate of fire with only 570 rpm it is
actually<00:02:34.200> one<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.500> slowest<00:02:34.950> weapons<00:02:35.400> in

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
actually one of the slowest weapons in

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.550 
actually one of the slowest weapons in
the<00:02:35.640> game<00:02:35.850> but<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.780> be<00:02:36.900> expected<00:02:37.260> with

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
the game but that is to be expected with

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.759 
the game but that is to be expected with
that<00:02:37.739> high<00:02:37.920> damage<00:02:38.310> model<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.730> 34%<00:02:39.690> now<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.500> sit

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
that high damage model of 34% now to sit

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.650 
that high damage model of 34% now to sit
alongside<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.400> slow<00:02:41.700> rate<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:41.940> fire<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.480> also

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
alongside that slow rate of fire it also

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.080 
alongside that slow rate of fire it also
has<00:02:43.019> a<00:02:43.200> particularly<00:02:43.800> slow<00:02:44.250> reload<00:02:44.640> time<00:02:44.910> of

has a particularly slow reload time of

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.930 
has a particularly slow reload time of
7.8<00:02:46.080> seconds<00:02:46.590> now<00:02:46.800> of<00:02:47.310> course<00:02:47.550> that's<00:02:47.790> the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
7.8 seconds now of course that's the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.370 
7.8 seconds now of course that's the
same<00:02:48.000> whether<00:02:48.480> or<00:02:48.630> not<00:02:48.720> you've<00:02:48.900> actually<00:02:49.110> used

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
same whether or not you've actually used

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.050 
same whether or not you've actually used
all<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.830> bullets<00:02:49.860> or<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.370> still<00:02:50.640> have<00:02:50.850> some

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
all the bullets or you still have some

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
now of course all belt-fed machine guns

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.059 
now of course all belt-fed machine guns
are<00:03:00.420> gonna<00:03:00.630> have<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.810> slow<00:03:01.260> reload<00:03:01.620> time<00:03:01.890> but

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
are gonna have a slow reload time but

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.860 
are gonna have a slow reload time but
even<00:03:02.160> compared<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.760> something<00:03:03.000> like<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.330> mg<00:03:03.600> 4

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
even compared to something like the mg 4

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.289 
even compared to something like the mg 4
it<00:03:04.019> comes<00:03:04.230> in<00:03:04.380> at<00:03:04.470> 6.2<00:03:05.100> seconds<00:03:05.519> that<00:03:06.030> two

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
it comes in at 6.2 seconds that two

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.210 
it comes in at 6.2 seconds that two
seconds<00:03:06.750> can<00:03:06.959> make<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.290> particular<00:03:07.650> difference

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
seconds can make a particular difference

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.850 
seconds can make a particular difference
especially<00:03:08.489> in<00:03:09.000> close<00:03:09.450> range<00:03:09.720> combat<00:03:09.860> so

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860

I've tried doing this with the m60 and

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.590 
I've tried doing this with the m60 and
it<00:03:40.859> definitely<00:03:41.340> isn't<00:03:41.549> that<00:03:41.850> successful<00:03:42.480> of

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
it definitely isn't that successful of

it definitely isn't that successful of
course<00:03:42.630> that<00:03:42.989> slow<00:03:43.260> rate<00:03:43.440> of<00:03:43.590> fire<00:03:43.799> means<00:03:44.040> you

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
course that slow rate of fire means you

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.400 
course that slow rate of fire means you
might<00:03:44.670> take<00:03:44.880> out<00:03:45.090> one<00:03:45.239> or<00:03:45.329> two<00:03:45.359> guys<00:03:45.690> before

the rest turn around and put you into

the rest turn around and put you into
the<00:03:48.000> ground<00:03:48.299> so<00:03:48.660> this<00:03:49.079> weapon<00:03:49.500> isn't<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.920> kind

rushing enemy players but that doesn't

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.770 
rushing enemy players but that doesn't
mean<00:03:53.400> this<00:03:53.519> weapon<00:03:53.910> doesn't<00:03:54.150> have<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:54.450> great

away<00:04:35.180> that<00:04:35.360> first<00:04:35.659> shot<00:04:35.900> recoil<00:04:36.080> so<00:04:36.590> you<00:04:37.009> could

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:37.219 
away that first shot recoil so you could

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:39.040 
away that first shot recoil so you could
put<00:04:37.400> this<00:04:37.490> weapon<00:04:37.819> into<00:04:38.090> semi-automatic<00:04:38.870> mode

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
put this weapon into semi-automatic mode

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.839 
put this weapon into semi-automatic mode
have<00:04:39.469> the<00:04:39.620> angle<00:04:39.919> grip<00:04:40.129> and<00:04:40.370> get<00:04:40.550> some<00:04:40.729> very

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849 
have the angle grip and get some very

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:43.270 
have the angle grip and get some very
accurate<00:04:41.150> shots<00:04:41.689> out<00:04:41.900> there<00:04:42.110> which<00:04:42.319> up<00:04:42.590> to<00:04:42.770> 75

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
accurate shots out there which up to 75

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.640 
accurate shots out there which up to 75
meters<00:04:43.669> will<00:04:43.849> be<00:04:43.969> taking<00:04:44.300> 25%<00:04:45.229> damage<00:04:45.379> with

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
meters will be taking 25% damage with

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.529 
meters will be taking 25% damage with
each<00:04:45.830> shot<00:04:46.189> so<00:04:46.460> you<00:04:46.639> have<00:04:47.000> got<00:04:47.180> a<00:04:47.210> chance<00:04:47.449> of

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
each shot so you have got a chance of

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.059 
each shot so you have got a chance of
taking<00:04:47.689> up<00:04:47.930> players<00:04:48.289> at<00:04:48.409> a<00:04:48.469> very<00:04:48.710> long

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:49.069 
taking up players at a very long

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.490 
taking up players at a very long
distance<00:04:49.340> now<00:04:50.180> personally<00:04:50.449> I<00:04:50.750> have<00:04:50.990> found<00:04:51.289> one

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
distance now personally I have found one

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.020 
distance now personally I have found one
of<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.650> most<00:04:51.800> effective<00:04:52.280> ways<00:04:52.310> to<00:04:52.490> use<00:04:52.849> his

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
of the most effective ways to use his

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.820 
of the most effective ways to use his
weapon<00:04:53.180> is<00:04:53.509> by<00:04:53.659> taking<00:04:54.080> advantage<00:04:54.199> of<00:04:54.710> the

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
weapon is by taking advantage of the

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.010 
weapon is by taking advantage of the
suppression<00:04:55.189> of<00:04:55.460> course<00:04:56.030> the<00:04:56.180> LMGs<00:04:56.719> are<00:04:56.930> the

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
suppression of course the LMGs are the

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.869 
suppression of course the LMGs are the
only<00:04:57.409> weapons<00:04:57.770> in<00:04:57.919> battlefield<00:04:58.370> 4<00:04:58.460> now<00:04:58.819> to

00:04:58.869 --> 00:04:58.879 
only weapons in battlefield 4 now to

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:01.059 
only weapons in battlefield 4 now to
still<00:04:59.210> feature<00:04:59.509> the<00:04:59.750> suppression<00:05:00.080> effect<00:05:00.319> so

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:01.069 
still feature the suppression effect so

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:02.320 
still feature the suppression effect so
if<00:05:01.159> you're<00:05:01.279> having<00:05:01.490> a<00:05:01.610> battle<00:05:01.819> with<00:05:02.029> a<00:05:02.060> player

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
if you're having a battle with a player

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.939 
if you're having a battle with a player
who's<00:05:02.509> firing<00:05:02.810> back<00:05:03.080> at<00:05:03.259> you<00:05:03.379> with<00:05:03.560> say<00:05:03.800> an

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
who's firing back at you with say an

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.040 
who's firing back at you with say an
assault<00:05:04.279> rifle<00:05:04.340> I<00:05:04.819> would<00:05:05.330> put<00:05:05.509> as<00:05:05.629> many<00:05:05.840> rounds

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
assault rifle I would put as many rounds

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.110 
assault rifle I would put as many rounds
downrange<00:05:06.439> on<00:05:06.889> that<00:05:07.129> point<00:05:07.370> as<00:05:07.520> possible<00:05:07.969> and

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
downrange on that point as possible and

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.209 
downrange on that point as possible and
try<00:05:08.300> and<00:05:08.419> affect<00:05:08.689> his<00:05:08.840> accuracy<00:05:09.169> once<00:05:10.009> you've

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:10.219 
try and affect his accuracy once you've

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:11.559 
try and affect his accuracy once you've
done<00:05:10.370> that<00:05:10.430> even<00:05:10.819> if<00:05:10.969> you're<00:05:11.060> not<00:05:11.180> hitting<00:05:11.509> the

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:11.569 
done that even if you're not hitting the

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:12.999 
done that even if you're not hitting the
player<00:05:11.779> I<00:05:12.020> would<00:05:12.439> then<00:05:12.560> take<00:05:12.590> some<00:05:12.979> more

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
player I would then take some more

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.159 
player I would then take some more
slower<00:05:13.550> steadier<00:05:14.029> shots<00:05:14.270> to<00:05:14.509> try<00:05:14.779> and<00:05:14.900> get<00:05:15.050> the

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
slower steadier shots to try and get the

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.800 
slower steadier shots to try and get the
kill<00:05:15.409> so<00:05:15.740> at<00:05:16.189> first<00:05:16.490> I<00:05:16.789> would<00:05:16.909> blast<00:05:17.120> a<00:05:17.360> lot<00:05:17.719> of

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
kill so at first I would blast a lot of

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.719 
kill so at first I would blast a lot of
rounds<00:05:18.110> out<00:05:18.169> the<00:05:18.289> player<00:05:18.529> in<00:05:18.710> one<00:05:18.860> go<00:05:19.069> really

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
rounds out the player in one go really

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.189 
rounds out the player in one go really
hit<00:05:19.879> them<00:05:20.029> hard<00:05:20.270> with<00:05:20.419> suppression<00:05:20.930> and<00:05:21.110> then

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
hit them hard with suppression and then

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.809 
hit them hard with suppression and then
afterwards<00:05:21.680> follow<00:05:22.159> up<00:05:22.340> with<00:05:22.520> some<00:05:22.669> more

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:22.819 
afterwards follow up with some more

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:25.029 
afterwards follow up with some more
accurate<00:05:23.300> shots<00:05:23.539> to<00:05:23.750> make<00:05:23.779> the<00:05:24.080> kill<00:05:24.349> so

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
accurate shots to make the kill so

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.429 
accurate shots to make the kill so
overall<00:05:25.580> the<00:05:25.879> m60<00:05:26.419> hasn't<00:05:26.779> disappointed<00:05:27.110> me

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:27.439 
overall the m60 hasn't disappointed me

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:29.170 
overall the m60 hasn't disappointed me
but<00:05:27.620> it's<00:05:27.740> also<00:05:27.949> not<00:05:28.340> quite<00:05:28.490> being<00:05:28.849> the<00:05:28.969> white

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
but it's also not quite being the white

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.269 
but it's also not quite being the white
knight<00:05:29.419> I<00:05:29.629> was<00:05:29.750> expecting<00:05:30.349> for<00:05:30.800> close-range

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:31.279 
knight I was expecting for close-range

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:33.129 
knight I was expecting for close-range
matches<00:05:31.699> like<00:05:31.879> operation<00:05:32.330> Locker<00:05:32.659> in<00:05:32.960> the

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
matches like operation Locker in the

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:34.809 
matches like operation Locker in the
future<00:05:33.529> if<00:05:33.680> I<00:05:33.800> am<00:05:34.009> gonna<00:05:34.250> run<00:05:34.430> with<00:05:34.580> a<00:05:34.639> light

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:34.819 
future if I am gonna run with a light

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:36.339 
future if I am gonna run with a light
machine<00:05:35.150> gun<00:05:35.300> I'm<00:05:35.419> probably<00:05:35.930> gonna<00:05:36.110> take

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:36.349 
machine gun I'm probably gonna take

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:39.040 
machine gun I'm probably gonna take
something<00:05:36.710> like<00:05:36.800> the<00:05:36.949> mg<00:05:37.279> for<00:05:37.580> the<00:05:37.789> m249<00:05:38.360> but

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
something like the mg for the m249 but

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.600 
something like the mg for the m249 but
higher<00:05:39.259> rate<00:05:39.440> of<00:05:39.469> fire<00:05:39.620> definitely<00:05:40.339> gives<00:05:40.490> you

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
higher rate of fire definitely gives you

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.129 
higher rate of fire definitely gives you
a<00:05:40.639> better<00:05:41.000> chance<00:05:41.150> of<00:05:41.479> survival<00:05:41.990> in

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
a better chance of survival in

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:44.200 
a better chance of survival in
head-to-head<00:05:42.560> battles<00:05:43.099> but<00:05:43.669> if<00:05:43.729> I<00:05:43.789> am<00:05:43.940> playing

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
head-to-head battles but if I am playing

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.909 
head-to-head battles but if I am playing
large<00:05:44.479> games<00:05:44.750> of<00:05:44.900> conquest<00:05:45.379> and<00:05:45.500> I<00:05:45.620> want<00:05:45.830> to

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
large games of conquest and I want to

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.559 
large games of conquest and I want to
try<00:05:46.069> and<00:05:46.190> take<00:05:46.310> out<00:05:46.490> players<00:05:46.879> a<00:05:47.000> little<00:05:47.330> bit

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:47.569 
try and take out players a little bit

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:49.480 
try and take out players a little bit
further<00:05:47.839> away<00:05:48.020> and<00:05:48.379> of<00:05:48.620> course<00:05:48.830> conserve<00:05:49.310> some

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
further away and of course conserve some

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.939 
further away and of course conserve some
of<00:05:49.580> that<00:05:49.699> ammunition<00:05:49.909> I<00:05:50.360> would<00:05:50.870> take<00:05:51.229> the<00:05:51.379> m60

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
of that ammunition I would take the m60

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:53.680 
of that ammunition I would take the m60
so<00:05:52.159> this<00:05:52.520> is<00:05:52.669> definitely<00:05:52.819> the<00:05:53.060> type<00:05:53.240> of<00:05:53.270> weapon

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
so this is definitely the type of weapon

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.659 
so this is definitely the type of weapon
I<00:05:53.870> would<00:05:54.050> use<00:05:54.229> on<00:05:54.440> those<00:05:54.560> larger<00:05:55.039> matches<00:05:55.430> but

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
I would use on those larger matches but

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.159 
I would use on those larger matches but
that's<00:05:55.849> all<00:05:56.029> I've<00:05:56.150> got<00:05:56.180> time<00:05:56.539> for<00:05:56.719> in<00:05:56.900> today's

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
that's all I've got time for in today's

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:58.869 
that's all I've got time for in today's
video<00:05:57.379> I<00:05:57.770> would<00:05:57.860> love<00:05:58.189> to<00:05:58.310> hear<00:05:58.400> from<00:05:58.550> you<00:05:58.699> in

00:05:58.869 --> 00:05:58.879 
video I would love to hear from you in

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:00.670 
video I would love to hear from you in
the<00:05:58.909> comments<00:05:59.300> below<00:05:59.419> what<00:05:59.870> your<00:06:00.110> thoughts<00:06:00.439> on

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680
