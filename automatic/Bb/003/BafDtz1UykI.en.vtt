to drop so if you learn how to drop
automatically<00:00:40.780> turn<00:00:41.080> into<00:00:41.290> a<00:00:41.350> max<00:00:41.530> ammo<00:00:41.830> about

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
automatically turn into a max ammo about

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.400 
automatically turn into a max ammo about
what<00:00:42.400> is<00:00:42.550> if<00:00:42.820> you<00:00:43.269> do<00:00:43.449> get<00:00:43.690> maximum<00:00:43.870> are<00:00:44.260> you

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
what is if you do get maximum are you

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.899 
what is if you do get maximum are you
hacking<00:00:44.590> it<00:00:44.890> still<00:00:45.100> turns<00:00:45.309> into<00:00:45.460> a<00:00:45.580> right<00:00:45.760> now

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:45.909 
hacking it still turns into a right now

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:47.850 
hacking it still turns into a right now
but<00:00:46.059> nothing<00:00:46.360> good<00:00:46.510> happens<00:00:46.570> there<00:00:46.989> so<00:00:47.199> stick

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.140 
1200 50.4 at all you can just easily
hack<00:03:52.959> it<00:03:53.400> it's<00:03:54.400> got<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.670> hack<00:03:54.790> on<00:03:54.940> you<00:03:55.060> of

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
hack it it's got the hack on you of

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.119 
hack it it's got the hack on you of
course<00:03:55.360> but<00:03:55.599> it<00:03:55.959> does<00:03:56.110> take<00:03:56.379> a<00:03:56.620> good<00:03:56.860> simple

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
course but it does take a good simple

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:03.960 
course but it does take a good simple
amount<00:03:57.640> of<00:03:57.700> time<00:03:57.910> as<00:03:58.629> you<00:03:58.810> can<00:03:58.870> see<00:04:02.580> but<00:04:03.580> is<00:04:03.730> it

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
amount of time as you can see but is it

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.479 
amount of time as you can see but is it
i<00:04:04.300> think<00:04:04.360> is<00:04:04.660> well<00:04:04.840> worth<00:04:05.020> it<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:05.440> if<00:04:06.310> you

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
i think is well worth it and if you

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:07.950 
i think is well worth it and if you
don't<00:04:06.640> love<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.940> points<00:04:07.269> obviously

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.840 
can see here oh I'm suffocating and this
is<00:04:32.530> hacking<00:04:32.890> the<00:04:32.980> guns<00:04:33.220> when<00:04:33.490> you<00:04:33.580> hack<00:04:33.820> the

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
is hacking the guns when you hack the

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.810 
is hacking the guns when you hack the
gun<00:04:34.210> it's<00:04:35.020> quick<00:04:35.650> to<00:04:35.680> do<00:04:35.980> the<00:04:36.010> gun<00:04:36.400> flipped

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
gun it's quick to do the gun flipped

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.660 
gun it's quick to do the gun flipped
over<00:04:37.060> and<00:04:37.450> what<00:04:37.990> that<00:04:38.140> means<00:04:38.350> is<00:04:38.650> like<00:04:39.490> the

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
over and what that means is like the

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.480 
over and what that means is like the
upgraded<00:04:40.270> ammo<00:04:40.500> used<00:04:41.500> to<00:04:41.650> be<00:04:41.790> 450<00:04:42.790> and<00:04:43.030> the

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
upgraded ammo used to be 450 and the

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.580 
upgraded ammo used to be 450 and the
normal<00:04:45.490> Elmo<00:04:45.760> used<00:04:46.300> to<00:04:46.480> be<00:04:46.570> like<00:04:46.690> 500<00:04:47.230> that

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
normal Elmo used to be like 500 that

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.400 
normal Elmo used to be like 500 that
stops<00:04:47.920> it<00:04:48.100> around<00:04:48.340> so<00:04:48.640> the<00:04:49.330> normal<00:04:49.570> m.o<00:04:49.990> now<00:04:50.230> is

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
stops it around so the normal m.o now is

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.180 
stops it around so the normal m.o now is
51<00:04:50.920> is<00:04:51.630> 4500<00:04:52.630> and<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:53.440> upgrade<00:04:53.740> is<00:04:53.860> ammo<00:04:54.100> is

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
51 is 4500 and the upgrade is ammo is

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.130 
51 is 4500 and the upgrade is ammo is
400<00:04:54.550> 500<00:04:54.670> points<00:04:55.030> so<00:04:55.480> if<00:04:55.810> you<00:04:55.960> do<00:04:56.110> have

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
400 500 points so if you do have

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.900 
400 500 points so if you do have
upgraded<00:04:56.560> your<00:04:56.740> garnish<00:04:57.070> it<00:04:57.190> does<00:04:57.400> help<00:04:57.640> a<00:04:57.730> lot

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
upgraded your garnish it does help a lot

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.760 
upgraded your garnish it does help a lot
and<00:04:58.150> then<00:04:58.750> look<00:04:58.960> use<00:04:59.140> as<00:04:59.290> you<00:04:59.410> see<00:04:59.440> there

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
and then look use as you see there

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.110 
and then look use as you see there
normal<00:05:00.640> where<00:05:00.730> I<00:05:00.760> 500<00:05:01.390> points<00:05:01.920> normal<00:05:02.920> our

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
normal where I 500 points normal our

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.480 
normal where I 500 points normal our
4500<00:05:04.120> points<00:05:04.330> I<00:05:04.440> so<00:05:05.440> it's<00:05:06.100> just<00:05:06.310> a<00:05:06.340> lot<00:05:06.430> easier

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
4500 points I so it's just a lot easier

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.270 
4500 points I so it's just a lot easier
to<00:05:06.880> hack<00:05:07.240> it<00:05:07.450> and<00:05:07.600> this<00:05:08.590> is<00:05:08.770> not<00:05:08.920> cool<00:05:09.100> thing

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
to hack it and this is not cool thing

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.440 
to hack it and this is not cool thing
that's<00:05:09.430> probably<00:05:09.670> the<00:05:09.760> coolest<00:05:09.940> thing<00:05:10.270> if

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
that's probably the coolest thing if

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.880 
that's probably the coolest thing if
your<00:05:10.600> mates<00:05:10.840> like<00:05:11.200> running<00:05:11.500> out<00:05:11.620> point

your mates like running out point

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.170 
your mates like running out point

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
suddenly have a lot of points you can

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.990 
suddenly have a lot of points you can
hack<00:05:13.600> your<00:05:13.630> friend<00:05:14.290> and<00:05:14.590> give<00:05:15.100> him<00:05:15.340> automatic

500 points and this is a cool being and
this<00:05:18.910> is<00:05:19.000> probably<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.300> most<00:05:19.480> doing<00:05:19.900> most

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
this is probably the most doing most

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.010
