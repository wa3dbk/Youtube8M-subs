 twofold 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.030
 she is tall and not to be torn 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:21.180
 shock absorbers need to be installed 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:24.689
 simply . get your set so that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:33.809

 And so to the condition and also unscrew 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:46.079
 mount bowls active one bolt 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:01:07.409
 insert here does not screw into place that 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:01:11.100

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.730
 so when you install these here 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:52.460
 brackets for depreciation i.e. 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:56.570
 such a c. here but it turns out 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:02.520
 that is short, that is, I stomped the puck 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:05.910
 80 how here is the installed washer then 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.899
 There is what it turns out if you clamp without 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:12.420
 washer thats it will form part 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:17.520
 when the work of the press is deformed and here 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:20.370
 it will bend this fate that is the pool 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.870
 spawn can be that it was not necessary 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.140
 be sure to put a shaybochka 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.830
 lend you hold it all straight without 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:37.950
 deformation will mount here everything 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:41.690
 exactly everything is fine tighten the nut 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.900
 and bolt 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.700
 need to insert began to put the bolt 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.120
 bushing because it is clear and tighten 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.030

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:00.180
 bore holes so far not yet 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:06.030
 tighten insert that is anchoring 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:12.180
 tattooed that there is no insert a bolt and then 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:15.900

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:21.120
 bracket that is here it stands already 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.910
 It is established to the Crimea that they for should 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.820
 for shock absorber springs 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:29.280
 when put 4age should not and springs 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.940
 that is, they have to be high 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.140
 to substitute so as not to vomit the shock absorber 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.120
 crush dinner 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.770
