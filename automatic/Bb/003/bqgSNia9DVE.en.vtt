 olive oil and white dining wreath 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.840
 first we need to prepare a color 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.770

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.600

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.280
 will be added at the very end 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.500
 we cut our cabbage with such medium 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.910
 pieces not too large that is 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.670
 that's too big 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.489
 trimming it is also very important not 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.300
 digest cabbage is important for us 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:07.610
 retained its shape and had enough 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.439
 elastic send our cabbage water 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.220
 water must first be required 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.220
 to salt 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.890
 guys generally cooked with broth but we 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.990
 We will use the vegetable broth 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.140
 But from there the broth from the cabbage will also be 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.869
 very tasty and salt do not overdo it 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.869
 how are we still gonna have parmesan cheese 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.360
 and plus we still you add salt to them so 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.610
 that salt is very tidy until ours 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.600
 cabbage is cooked we will prepare the main 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.119
 Ingredients 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.670
 the first thing i'll take is take onion and 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.890
 we will need to chop it enough 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:47.640
 finely 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:50.070
 cut in half for that amount 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.180
 guys who will do better to take 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.180
 one large 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.479
 now we need to chop carrots on 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:05.090
 small cubes difference 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:16.160
 cut carrot in half 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:18.920
 This is not too small but not 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.110
 spin us carrot size to size 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.640
 cubes should be something like 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.080
 pea of reason I will cook in Kazan 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.180
 I already put it on fire 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.790
 warm up now pour olive 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:40.130
 oil grams 50 and in heated oil 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:42.290
 send onions and carrots now 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.570
 prepare his white meat I'll 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.570
 cut into medium cubes too 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.360
 the pieces should not be small not 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.420
 small 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:01.519
 average and now cut here 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:06.280
 slices of onions and carrots, we already 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.280
 grabbed and I send meat to them 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:15.620
 shuffle set strong fire 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.980
 now we need the meat 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.980
 to salt 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:28.310
 black pepper to taste and good 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:31.550
 shuffle now we add shelves 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.820
 Larisa that is, I have 10 kilograms of honey 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:37.570
 half a pack 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:40.780
 our meat is almost ready now 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:45.410
 mix the meat with rice 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:48.440
 must reign as if reflected and be 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.870
 completely about such in oil it is very 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.650
 important result each gum should 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.830
 get covered in oil I'm stirring all the time 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.750
 to have my claims burned 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.450
 rice and fried two to three minutes now 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.180
 we need to add white table wine 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.150
 somewhere 50 grams is a must 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.400
 ingredient in the result as in Italy and 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:15.700
 in Spain, by the way, there are also a lot of dishes 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.700
 preparing with wine so add 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:24.710
 our alcohol has already evaporated 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:30.440
 now we add boiling broth 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:34.910
 I add one shell at a time 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.910
 mix everything well 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.730
 and fight like imbibed sitting in the area 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.730
 now add 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.330
 since we took the gender proportion 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:05:00.370
 kilograms of rice naturally we need 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:00.370
 need this one and a half liter of broth and 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:10.570
 so i add all the broth 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:15.880
 I found I already added half the broth 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.880
 Now you can add green peas 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.750
 we need a sticky consistency 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.160
 rice so she was such a mess 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.880
 sticky to 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:31.970
 from the dish I do not move away constantly stirring 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.400
 the most important horizon besides wine is 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.400
 Of course the cooking process 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.970
 rice we add broth he hit panama 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.890
 ladle of rice the whole thing absorbs and 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.230
 then we add the following so on 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:48.500
 throughout the time but for now we 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.780
 res res will be prepared 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.550
 is prepared by everyone in different ways that is 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.620
 look at the packaging should be 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.890
 written that is, remove this rice varieties 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.950
 the rice that I use is boiled for 20 minutes 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:04.160
 it means ours but we are preparing for 20 minutes 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.300
 and that's a plus for everything and for that 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.630
 still take 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.690
 rice which is very sticky it is also very 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:18.380
 important in this matter there is almost ready 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:21.680
 we add butter she should 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:24.050
 melt melt and soak in our rice 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.479
 cauliflower we have my ready when 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.960
 she cooked we pulled her out of the broth 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:33.740
 Now add to rice and very carefully 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.139
 shuffle so as not to damage our to 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.439
 taste 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:40.949
 so that it remains pure gas 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:45.749
 principle, you can turn off the cabbage with us 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:48.270
 ready therefore to marry and so that the extra 

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:56.330
 just do not interfere immediately add about 100 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:07:02.039
 gram remember add cheese and move 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:05.210
 very very tidy risotto with chicken 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:07.830
