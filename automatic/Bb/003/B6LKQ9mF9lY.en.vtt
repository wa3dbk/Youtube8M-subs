 nooo 

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.550
 as on 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:10.459
 does 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.099
 when speaking rhythm guitar 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:19.029
 there are two types of good techniques that I usually use to decide that 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.789
 part and story to play 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.980
 average a little bit program turn that there is a 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.259
 a bass line that I do things 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.689
 bing mimmo 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.580
 camping in 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.490
 bin 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.370
 ben ten in 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.219
 showcase 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.220
 the first apparel I could have 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.390
 create 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.590
 town could be something like that thanks thanks to a leather netbook 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.680
 in the mountains also% 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.739
 so I'm playing a seventh C minor so 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.200
 but then of course offers the port + 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.550
 now boast free kings to satisfy a pokemon 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.550
 good thing now 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.070
 188 I also put myself 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.230
 in B flat, they are not born with the moon 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.090
 operating company 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.090
 is 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.140
 night 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.140
 1 inna 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.010
 the 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.040
 the part with this can go very well in many musical ensembles but 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.049
 if we are playing in compliance a little 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.700
 not having a little bit larger where one comes out. * I look for the horn section 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.570
 we risk starting to fight with other musicians 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.940
 because all those who are urging are often playing 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.240
 in this section 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.620
 think that in music 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.050
 we have several violent we have a dipresso 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.950
 thun types of sounds very low people then 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.040
 20 careers 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.770
 dinner 20,000 maps very high 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.320
 so what does it mean that we have this line 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.499
 going from bottom to top here is where the steps are divided 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.769
 the medium-low mediocre minds the others 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.249
 obviously a sonar bass player mainly in the pass section e 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.249
 this musical line 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:27.219
 leon keyboardists that you would have 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.219
 when they are wary they are usually in the section 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.469
 pound so if he is playing with another instrument accompanying maybe 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.739
 I look at the keyboard you have to try to complement the flight by sight without sta 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.599
 if you come the keyboardist is playing emilia i'm in this section 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:49.459
 it is useless that there are also how to create is therefore able to make 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.079
 look for others 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.200
 other spaces where it was possible to play so that 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:00.869
 he said night the tor your music is heard as it is. complementary 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:03.849
 to the music itself is strange on older roberto 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.860
 then I changed my preparation 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.310
 a part where I want to show you exactly how to prune complementary. 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.320
 Astrist who is will instead be in this section here 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.439
 in italy 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.709
 but believe that it allows 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.059
 in the meantime 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:23.549
 make it better

 anna the pd is 15% marketing 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.709
 here I can start to help a little bit 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.559
 but of this kind where I am practically 

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:41.099
 using single notes 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.010
 so that they have only one too 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.010
 so I have a better chance of being heard 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.169
 find my sound space of this oh. speaking 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.019
 and now I'm briefly using the pentatonic c minor fingering 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.129

 room 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.720
