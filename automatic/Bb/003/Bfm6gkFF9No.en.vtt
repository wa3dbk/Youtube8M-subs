the clownfish have not begun hosting yet
but<00:00:20.699> they<00:00:20.850> seem<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.090> get<00:00:21.359> along<00:00:21.420> just<00:00:21.660> fine

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
but they seem to get along just fine

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.009 
but they seem to get along just fine
with<00:00:22.350> each<00:00:22.470> other<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.060> as<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.090> can<00:00:24.480> see<00:00:24.779> there

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
with each other and as you can see there

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.800 
with each other and as you can see there
there<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> giant<00:00:26.160> massive<00:00:26.760> pulsing<00:00:27.449> zinnia

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
there is a giant massive pulsing zinnia

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.589 
there is a giant massive pulsing zinnia
and<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.619> has<00:00:28.769> absolutely<00:00:29.490> taken<00:00:29.970> over<00:00:30.179> my<00:00:30.359> rock

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
and it has absolutely taken over my rock

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.620 
and it has absolutely taken over my rock
work<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.470> growing<00:00:31.890> like<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.279> weed<00:00:32.430> at<00:00:33.210> first<00:00:33.510> I

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
work it's growing like a weed at first I

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.030 
work it's growing like a weed at first I
thought<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.930> was<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> good<00:00:34.320> thing<00:00:34.380> but<00:00:34.800> now

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
thought this was a good thing but now

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.670 
thought this was a good thing but now
I'm<00:00:35.730> getting<00:00:36.030> quite<00:00:36.300> annoyed<00:00:36.870> with<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.350> so

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
I'm getting quite annoyed with it so

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.220 
I'm getting quite annoyed with it so

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
I've harvested a bunch of it and set it

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.369 
I've harvested a bunch of it and set it
down<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.410> some<00:00:40.890> rubble<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.870> right<00:00:42.870> side<00:00:43.140> of

up<00:00:58.469> with<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> pulsing<00:00:59.340> zinnia<00:00:59.699> factory<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.420> this

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
up with a pulsing zinnia factory in this

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.319 
up with a pulsing zinnia factory in this
little<00:01:00.870> 8<00:01:01.079> gallon<00:01:01.469> tank<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.699> conditions<00:01:03.120> seem

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
little 8 gallon tank the conditions seem

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.000 
little 8 gallon tank the conditions seem
to<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.750> perfect<00:01:04.199> for<00:01:04.409> it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
to be just perfect for it

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.440 
to be just perfect for it
the<00:01:05.610> water<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.360> little<00:01:07.229> dirtier<00:01:07.619> than<00:01:07.799> my

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
the water is a little dirtier than my

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.420 
the water is a little dirtier than my
normal<00:01:09.450> SPS<00:01:10.080> tanks<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.799> because<00:01:11.130> there's<00:01:11.280> no

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
normal SPS tanks just because there's no

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.960 
normal SPS tanks just because there's no
refugium<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.180> lot<00:01:12.330> less<00:01:12.510> water<00:01:12.810> volume<00:01:13.970> you

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
refugium a lot less water volume you

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.490 
refugium a lot less water volume you
know<00:01:15.090> heavy<00:01:15.299> violet<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:15.990> such<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> small

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
know heavy violet for such a small

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.260 
know heavy violet for such a small
volume<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:18.920> yeah<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.189> it's<00:01:20.340> it's<00:01:20.670> perfect

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
volume and yeah so it's it's perfect

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.270 
volume and yeah so it's it's perfect
also<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.659> think<00:01:21.810> they<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.290> love<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.710> Tesla

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
also I think they just love the Tesla

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.550 
also I think they just love the Tesla
LED<00:01:23.670> light<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.869> i<00:01:24.960> plug<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.439> and

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
LED light I like it i plug it in and

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.020 
LED light I like it i plug it in and
turn<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> spectrum<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.610> looks

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
turn it in and the spectrum just looks

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.399 
turn it in and the spectrum just looks
perfect<00:01:27.950> it<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.420> standard<00:01:30.420> ocean<00:01:31.079> blue

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
perfect it is the standard ocean blue

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.999 
perfect it is the standard ocean blue
color<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.970> like<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.390> lot<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:34.500> wouldn't<00:01:34.920> go

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
color and I like it a lot I wouldn't go

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.830 
color and I like it a lot I wouldn't go
deep<00:01:35.280> blue<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.610> would<00:01:35.939> be<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.329> too<00:01:36.540> blue

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
deep blue that would be just too blue

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.289 
deep blue that would be just too blue
and<00:01:37.049> sky<00:01:38.009> blue<00:01:38.159> may<00:01:38.460> be<00:01:38.520> fine<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> lot<00:01:39.270> of

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
and sky blue may be fine for a lot of

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.889 
and sky blue may be fine for a lot of
people's<00:01:39.630> tastes<00:01:40.020> as<00:01:40.229> well<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:42.180> other<00:01:42.210> corals

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
people's tastes as well the other corals

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.780 
people's tastes as well the other corals
are<00:01:43.290> still<00:01:43.619> doing<00:01:43.770> well<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> lot<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.579> places

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
are still doing well but a lot of places

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.280 
are still doing well but a lot of places
they're<00:01:45.060> covered<00:01:45.360> up<00:01:45.479> by<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.720> zinnia<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.259> I

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
they're covered up by the zinnia so I

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.219 
they're covered up by the zinnia so I
really<00:01:46.619> need<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.799> spend<00:01:47.070> some<00:01:47.280> more<00:01:47.490> time

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
really need to spend some more time

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.149 
really need to spend some more time
maintaining<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.590> trimming<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.979> back

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
maintaining this and trimming it back

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.160 
maintaining this and trimming it back
I've<00:01:50.460> actually<00:01:50.640> removed<00:01:51.210> all<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.720> zinnia

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
I've actually removed all the zinnia

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.630 
I've actually removed all the zinnia
from<00:01:52.500> my<00:01:52.729> SPS<00:01:53.729> frag<00:01:54.030> tank<00:01:54.329> back<00:01:54.570> home<00:01:55.520> one<00:01:56.520> of

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
from my SPS frag tank back home one of

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.120 
from my SPS frag tank back home one of
the<00:01:56.729> users<00:01:57.149> had<00:01:57.780> some<00:01:58.290> questions<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:59.009> I'd

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
the users had some questions that I'd

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.399 
the users had some questions that I'd
like<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.310> address<00:01:59.689> one<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.780> their<00:02:00.899> questions

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
like to address one of their questions

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.399 
like to address one of their questions
was<00:02:02.149> in<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.270> comment<00:02:03.630> section<00:02:04.020> was<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
was in the comment section was the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.530 
was in the comment section was the
number<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.460> fish<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.939> can<00:02:06.090> keep<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.420> this

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
number of fish that you can keep in this

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.650 
number of fish that you can keep in this
tank<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.110> would<00:02:07.920> say<00:02:08.179> if<00:02:09.179> it's<00:02:09.360> something<00:02:09.629> like

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
tank I would say if it's something like

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.410 
tank I would say if it's something like
clownfish<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.649> max<00:02:11.160> really<00:02:11.730> they<00:02:12.030> need<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.300> be

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
clownfish to max really they need to be

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.670 
clownfish to max really they need to be
maybe<00:02:12.599> in<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.840> 16<00:02:13.200> gallon

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
maybe in a 16 gallon

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.490 
maybe in a 16 gallon
but<00:02:13.859> when<00:02:13.980> they're<00:02:14.129> small<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:16.140> doesn't

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
but when they're small that doesn't

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.740 
but when they're small that doesn't
matter<00:02:16.650> as<00:02:16.859> much<00:02:17.209> which<00:02:18.209> we<00:02:18.329> when<00:02:18.450> they<00:02:18.569> grow

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
matter as much which we when they grow

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.000 
matter as much which we when they grow
it<00:02:18.900> may<00:02:18.989> think<00:02:19.230> I'm<00:02:19.349> moving<00:02:19.620> them<00:02:19.739> somewhere

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
it may think I'm moving them somewhere

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.349 
it may think I'm moving them somewhere
else<00:02:20.159> I'm<00:02:20.310> putting<00:02:20.549> something<00:02:20.879> else<00:02:21.030> in<00:02:21.209> there

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
else I'm putting something else in there

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:23.690 
else I'm putting something else in there
but<00:02:21.390> you're<00:02:22.140> really<00:02:22.349> talking<00:02:22.799> about<00:02:22.859> two<00:02:23.310> to

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
but you're really talking about two to

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.240 
but you're really talking about two to
three<00:02:23.730> fish<00:02:24.269> and<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:25.109> small<00:02:25.409> nano<00:02:25.650> tank<00:02:26.040> like

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
three fish and a small nano tank like

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.589 
three fish and a small nano tank like
this<00:02:26.719> doesn't<00:02:27.719> seem<00:02:27.989> like<00:02:28.049> a<00:02:28.290> lot<00:02:28.650> but<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:30.540> is

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
this doesn't seem like a lot but it is

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.020 
this doesn't seem like a lot but it is
it<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.680> if<00:02:31.920> they're<00:02:32.189> in<00:02:32.340> such<00:02:32.549> a<00:02:32.579> small<00:02:32.790> space

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
it is if they're in such a small space

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.809 
it is if they're in such a small space
and<00:02:33.709> it's<00:02:34.709> still<00:02:34.950> great<00:02:35.159> having<00:02:35.519> them<00:02:35.609> around

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
and it's still great having them around

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.209 
and it's still great having them around
so<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:37.079> is<00:02:37.590> my<00:02:38.060> current<00:02:39.560> status<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.889> the<00:02:40.950> tank

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219 
so that is my current status of the tank

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.099 
so that is my current status of the tank
I've<00:02:41.489> done<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.700> couple<00:02:41.939> of<00:02:42.120> modifications<00:02:42.900> I'll

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
I've done a couple of modifications I'll

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
I've 3d printed a little mount for the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.629 
I've 3d printed a little mount for the
pH<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.370> temperature<00:02:50.870> probes<00:02:52.459> I've<00:02:53.459> also

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
pH and temperature probes I've also

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.830 
pH and temperature probes I've also
added<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.269> new<00:02:54.510> auto<00:02:55.290> top<00:02:55.709> off<00:02:55.889> this<00:02:56.159> is<00:02:56.310> just<00:02:56.549> a

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
added a new auto top off this is just a

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.920 
added a new auto top off this is just a
flipped<00:02:57.840> switch<00:02:58.109> version<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:59.750> first<00:03:00.750> why

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
flipped switch version and first why

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.470 
flipped switch version and first why
it's<00:03:01.049> going<00:03:01.230> great<00:03:01.409> so<00:03:01.500> once<00:03:02.250> again<00:03:02.419> thank<00:03:03.419> you
