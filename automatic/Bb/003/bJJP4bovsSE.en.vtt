00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.060
 called new mediapad t1 8.0 pro 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.230
 why it is not clear because 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.240
 specifications 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.970
 he will say so the most that neither is 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.780
 budget it we have installed 8 inch 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.190
 ips display with a resolution of 1280 by 800 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.050

 also here we have a battery 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.970
 on 4 thousand 800 milliamps 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.740
 so basically he will be enough 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.740
 such a charge with such a small 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.600
 permission but may yet considered 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.770
 tablet and also found a very 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.840
 interesting router from and you watch it 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.330
 not just a router, it is also a power bank 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.640
 here is a five thousand 200 battery 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.070

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.750
 work up to five hours 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:07.760
 handing out 4g altai and even jetsam internet 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.300
 the router is very interesting 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.450
 style follows samsung trend of the past 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.910
 years imitation under the skin is enough 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.120
 compact here almost an inch oled 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.459
 display and here you see the ethernet connector 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.750
 but I said this router can hand out 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.690
 there are also 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.840
 usb to charge and 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.150
 and how much I understand myself 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.280
 power is supplied to this connector 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.380
 also this router possesses such 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.570
 interesting software tricks like file 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.000
 sharing that is, he can 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.740
 represent cloud storage and transfer 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.560

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.410

 know its interface partially repeats 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.020
 android 50 looking at technical 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:12.450
 display characteristics here 5 5 inches with 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.080

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.120
 gigabytes of ram 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.660
 us at 1 2 gigahertz permissions android 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.900
 and 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.540
 turned out to be wrong here and motion white 30 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.880
 before we return to our media 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.130
 the fruit of x2 which we are not completely 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.050
 felt to tell only what 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.380
 the price of this smartphone 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.160
 extremely budget here is about 250 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.950
 euro and in Ukraine 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.840
 it ranges from 8 thousand hryvnia 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.560
 Agree pretty profitable 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.530
 sentence 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.350
 Well, let's see how friends work 13 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.700
 mega pixel sensor mediapad x2 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.700
 turn on the camera 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.760
 and 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.390
 so but this is not what we wanted, let's 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.390
 again 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.180

 work in silt then there are networks that for 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.340
 our country is not yet relevant but I 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.670

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.710
 handle pricing and launch dates 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.920
 the consultant could not tell us anything 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.790
 although it is strange because I passed you on the net 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.220
