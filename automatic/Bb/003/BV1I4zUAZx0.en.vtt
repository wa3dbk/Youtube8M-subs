 Speed ​​of sound

 use a weapon later there is a 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.760
 theoretical exam that are knowledge

 the personality the second ones 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.250
 most important contents of the law of

 practical users are transferred to 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.750
 a polygon where after a 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.820
 introduction are placed at eight meters 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.120

 of fire of that evaluation then 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.570
 we basically do it here in this area 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.450
 which is a shooting range and is based 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.110

 can place the ammunition inside a 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.240
 Charger or hopper 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.560
 so we try to evaluate it is also 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.560
 true that the person shows us that 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.010
 has that ability that ability 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.540
 also place the hopper on the gun 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.450
 take the gun well with both hands 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.599
 and finally, to carry out a series of 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.909
 shots that has a normal 5 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.370
 shots for telling him to hit 3 on a 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.049
