 a link will appear we download it 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.410
 download the launcher in this case 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.930
 the pirate is launched a year ago 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.610

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.660
 the pc screen 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.340
 and we wait for you to create the folder one 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.640
 once reopened this one will ask us for a 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.180
 username this case I use it and premium 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.180
 using 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:06.950
 we have play here and we can give him age 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.670
 edit profile 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:15.820
 the version will be 1.7 point 4 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.070
 up to 1.7 points 9 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.909
 will continue to update as I go 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.920
 coming out new versions 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.030
 we choose the version that we hope to use 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:31.319
 in this case the motorbike 7 and we saved the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.880
 profile and we will give place this in a view 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:37.430
 giving play 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.430
 will start to load the game 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.369
 without the unter it stops working recording 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.229
 in the video description for 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.539
 update the launcher and put another 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.380
 The most recommended is the premium 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:56.390
 but not everyone has it so I do not know 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.850
