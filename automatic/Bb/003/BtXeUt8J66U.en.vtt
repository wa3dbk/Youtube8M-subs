00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.180 
engine stand and got it flipped over and
it<00:00:33.329> would<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.540> been<00:00:33.630> easy<00:00:33.840> enough

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
snaps on there and you can snap that

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.790 
snaps on there and you can snap that
gasket<00:00:54.180> down<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.140> also<00:00:55.289> snap

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
gasket down and then you can also snap

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.770 
gasket down and then you can also snap
the<00:00:56.010> oil<00:00:56.219> pan<00:00:56.699> down<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.300> holds<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.690> in

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the oil pan down and it holds it in

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.090 
the oil pan down and it holds it in
place<00:00:57.809> till<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.320> get<00:00:58.440> some<00:00:58.620> bolts<00:00:58.920> started

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
place till you get some bolts started

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
really good he's a bottom down on a rock

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.440 
really good he's a bottom down on a rock
or<00:01:23.700> two<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.229> time<00:01:25.530> anyway<00:01:26.460> we're<00:01:27.360> gonna

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
I don't you do a little weld in there I

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.440

guess<00:01:32.310> they're<00:01:32.549> okay<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.000> looks<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.240> it

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
guess they're okay it looks like it

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.999 
guess they're okay it looks like it
didn't<00:01:33.630> go<00:01:33.750> through<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:33.990> paint<00:01:34.290> why<00:01:34.590> somebody

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
didn't go through the paint why somebody

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.730 
didn't go through the paint why somebody
painted<00:01:35.250> an<00:01:35.490> engine<00:01:35.759> why<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.270> don't<00:01:36.600> know<00:01:36.840> i

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
painted an engine why I don't know i

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.270 
painted an engine why I don't know i
guess<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.460> was<00:01:38.490> easy<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.909> find<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.390> leaks<00:01:40.280> but

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
guess it was easy to find the leaks but

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.840 
guess it was easy to find the leaks but
they<00:01:41.400> didn't<00:01:41.640> fix<00:01:41.790> them<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.390> I'm<00:01:42.780> fix<00:01:43.110> them<00:01:43.290> but

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
they didn't fix them so I'm fix them but

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.429 
they didn't fix them so I'm fix them but
white<00:01:44.850> I'd<00:01:45.149> almost<00:01:45.570> rather<00:01:45.780> have<00:01:46.049> no<00:01:46.200> pain
