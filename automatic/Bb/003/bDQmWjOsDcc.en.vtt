up here what I have is a clip and I got
these<00:01:24.390> from<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.259> pub<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:26.310> 57<00:01:26.909> cents<00:01:27.180> of

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
these from on the pub like 57 cents of

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.359 
these from on the pub like 57 cents of
each<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:28.110> basically<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.560> pull<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.920> kind<00:01:29.280> of

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
each and basically you pull that kind of

like<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.689> curtain<00:01:30.689> rod<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.900> guess<00:01:33.650> however<00:01:34.650> you

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
like a curtain rod I guess however you

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.230 
like a curtain rod I guess however you
can<00:01:34.950> see<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.189> many<00:01:35.369> ways<00:01:35.520> slabs<00:01:35.880> all<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.150> way

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
can see this many ways slabs all the way

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.859 
can see this many ways slabs all the way
down<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:38.150> basically<00:01:39.150> once<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.450> gets<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
down and basically once it gets to the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.840 
down and basically once it gets to the
end<00:01:40.079> here<00:01:40.439> what<00:01:41.369> I'll<00:01:41.460> do<00:01:42.170> take<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.290> clip<00:01:43.530> off

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
end here what I'll do take that clip off

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.700 
end here what I'll do take that clip off
and<00:01:44.850> actually<00:01:45.270> clip<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.369> cord<00:01:47.369> itself

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
and actually clip it to the cord itself

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.859 
and actually clip it to the cord itself
so<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.740> way<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.189> gets<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.520> little<00:01:50.659> it's<00:01:51.659> more

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
so that way it gets a little it's more

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.060 
so that way it gets a little it's more
tensioning<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.439> pulls<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.770> all<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> way

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
tensioning and it pulls it all the way

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.520 
tensioning and it pulls it all the way
up<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.570> and<00:01:54.570> then<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.750> have<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.960> clip<00:01:55.229> here<00:01:55.259> in

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
up here and then I have a clip here in

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.020 
up here and then I have a clip here in
the<00:01:55.619> center<00:01:56.009> as<00:01:56.219> well<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:57.329> I'll<00:01:57.479> clip<00:01:59.030> I'll

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
the center as well that I'll clip I'll

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.160 
the center as well that I'll clip I'll
show<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.360> what<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.600> looks<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.110> you

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
