 or 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.509
 like 20 years ago 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.210
 being at the origins of the industrial 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.620
 wooden house construction in Russia 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.930
 the lock now 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.940
 focused on the best world 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.940
 achieve low-rise construction 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.160
 the main parameters of the house there from the series 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.800
 finished house high level 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.180
 thermal insulation 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.580
 use of environmentally friendly 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:01.030
 materials short construction time 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.030
 here we are steady 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.539
 all constructive elements of the house 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.909
 manufactured on production lines and 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:18.939
 famous german house building 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.250
 firms strife and delivered on 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.880
 production site 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.880
 montage 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.290
 delivery is by euro forum 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.590
 packages or spokes trailers when home 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.540
 mounted with wheels foundations 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.760
 must match hydra 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.119
 geological conditions of construction 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.720
 site usually home 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.910
 installed on a strip foundation 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.390
 cover and and cap can be arranged with 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.590
 using sandwich panels along their carriers 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.350
 abilities and level of thermal insulation 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.640
 Tomak basement panels completely 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.619
 meet building codes and 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.489
 the rules 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.300
 shown to residential and public 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.300
 buildings 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.940
 significant advantage of panel 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.530
 the houses there from is a dry way 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.740
 construction and high assembly speed 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.590
 quick installation due to the fact that 80 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.030
 percent of construction work 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.030
 carried out in the factory on 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.540
 the place is produced assemblies already finished 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:48.160
 walls and ceilings gable truss 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.820
 system a single wall construction 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.270
 panels 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.940
 thanks to industrial performance 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.310
 have high precision facade so 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.370
 ideally they can be made only 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.650
 factory platoons mates 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.490
 structural elements provide 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.850
 reliable tight connections 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.970
 eliminating heat loss and blowing 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.730
 walls 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.180
 installed on the basement floor 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.550
 one by one and tightened together 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.400
 screws self-tapping screws large sections 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.430
 then factory made 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.010
 exactly fit the project therefore 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.000
 the first floor can be installed in 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.950
 one day on occasion 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.250
 Panelek factory 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.260
 window and door blocks are installed 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.490
 painted or plastered exterior 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.490
 wall surfaces 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.700
 there is a single tomato company 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.050
 production responsibility 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.200
 for all the constructive elements of hunger 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:58.970
 after installation of interior and exterior walls 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.970
 floor slabs are being laid 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:18.860
 Next is the pediment line and after it 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.860
 the remaining walls of the attic floor 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.490
 it's time to install truss 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.950
 systems since the walls of the house are assembled 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.940
 perfect installation of the truss system 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.940
 runs smoothly 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.840
 bars are nailed outside to the rafters 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:05:01.750
 crates and installation 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:04.800
 roofing in this case 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.900
 profiled sheet 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.600
 since the house does not shrink after 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.330
 completion of roofing work proceed to 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.480
 exterior cladding and interior decoration 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.480
 houses 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.000
 the assembled house has the correct geometry 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.760
 premises 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.600
 flat surface of walls and floors and 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.560
 ceilings 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.080
 the final finishing coat absent 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.680
 problems with the Wrangel and the walls and floors 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.680
 and ceilings 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.630
 building stiffness 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.490
 provided by a system of rigidly connected 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.050
 between wall panels 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.490
 floor slabs and truss systems 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.950
 house construction how reliable 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.350
 what can withstand elevated wind 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.530
 high humidity loads 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.170
 and also here we are activity site from 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.610
 six to nine points 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.770
 should mention one more 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.750
 indisputable advantage of prefabricated houses 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.000
 Tomatoes 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.850
 If necessary, the construction of the house 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.570
 can also be quickly dismantled and 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.800
 reassembled elsewhere 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.409
 basic assembly 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.169
 attic 4 bedroom house under the seahorse 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:24.039
 by five workers and a crane operator 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:27.990
 Lasts from 3 to 5 days depending on 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:27.990
 area and complexity of the house 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.200
 the owners of the houses there are always assured of 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.930
 the security of your home 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.780
 this confidence is supported by experience 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:43.960
 enterprises positive reviews 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:46.110
 as well as relevant certificates and
