00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:10.519
 today we are going to make bran biscuits 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.450
 with carrot and cinnamon 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:17.770
 for that let's start 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:21.580
 by mixing a tablespoon of 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:25.960
 wheat bran with three tablespoons and 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:29.169
 oat bran half a 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.160
 teaspoon baking powder yeast 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.320
 powdered 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.870
 a little salt 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.570
 and cinnamon 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.910
 you can take a tablespoon spoonful and 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.130
 half I put it 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.990
 if we can if we have a blender that 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.540
 structure or some other element that we 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.309
 help to grind let's pass this 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.520
 come on , we 're going to crush it to get 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:58.030
 a fine little cookie a thin cake I 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.860
 I have done I have given this 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.080
 crusher 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.150
 in this way the Masita will be more 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:09.030
 fine we will put in a bowl 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.980
 we will mix it with grated carrot 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.270
 these are 40 grams of grated carrot 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:19.070
 It's like half a carrot 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.159
 a 100 % natural yogurt 100 milliliters of 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.159
 milk 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:30.860
 and saccharin liquid sweetener a 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.860
 spoonful or a tablespoon and a half 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.960
 we started everything 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.170
 we are going to need also 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.570
 two egg whites and a little salt 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.930
 this what we will do is put them in 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.240
 another bowl the two clear 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.939
 and a handful of salt a little bit a 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.409
 handful please a pinch of salt and what 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.829
 let's beat with a blender 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.829
 rods 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:10.410
 what we do then now is to mix 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.410
 the whites in our mix 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.610
 with enveloping movements 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.960
 we throw the rest 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.659
 what we will do now is put it in the 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.670
 oven that we have preheated to 180 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.670
 degrees in a silicone mold 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.019
 I had to repeat the recipe several times 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.090
 times because I have met with a 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.680
 problem doing it with the recipe 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.750
 original as it had begun 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.120
 adding milk and respecting 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.849
 times that appear in the recipe in the 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.310
 sonia the sponge cake website 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.120
 it was wet and damp on the inside and not 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.120
 He is finished 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.160
 in a second attempt what I did was 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.860
 increase the oven temperature 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.680
 keeping the same ingredients 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.780
 and the same oven time and this has 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.210
 been the result the buns are 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.210
 completely set but as you can see 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.560
 have toasted over I'm going to open one for 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.500
 see how it is 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.540
 in the center we still have a little roll 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.450
 that is quite humid but as you can see 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.849
 be completely roasted on the sides 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.129
 and this completely ruins the appearance 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.569
 of the bun is not that it's not good, it's not 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.299
 I have tried yet but of course the 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.670
 aspect is not accessible finally what 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.489
 what I have done is to keep the time 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.620
 oven that would be 25 minutes 25 or 30 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.329
 What I have done is give you 10 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.640
 oven minutes down the bottom 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.129
 alone and the rest of the time the whole oven 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.049
 but I have removed the milk 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:01.200
 used yogurt but I have not put the 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.650
 milk and finally the result that 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.650
 we were looking for 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.959
 I hope you try it
