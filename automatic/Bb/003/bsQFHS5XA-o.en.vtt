is just a quick little video of how the

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.980 
is just a quick little video of how the
idea<00:00:04.890> for<00:00:05.250> art<00:00:05.640> now<00:00:06.299> known<00:00:06.540> this<00:00:06.629> battle

set we did with silver lit in 2007 it
was<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> fun<00:00:24.359> novelty<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:25.140> too<00:00:25.740> inaccurate<00:00:26.460> to

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
was a fun novelty but too inaccurate to

of<00:00:35.430> control<00:00:36.680> problem<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.890> IR<00:00:38.160> beams<00:00:38.370> can

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
of control problem is that IR beams can

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.880 
of control problem is that IR beams can
be<00:00:38.610> wildly<00:00:39.239> inaccurate<00:00:39.540> they<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.469> bounce<00:00:40.680> off

laser<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:43.710> more<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.070> an<00:00:44.309> invisible

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
laser it's more like an invisible

laser it's more like an invisible
flashlight<00:00:45.420> beam<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.960> gets<00:00:46.110> broader<00:00:46.410> with

flashlight beam that gets broader with
the<00:00:46.980> increased<00:00:47.309> distance<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.660> can

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
the increased distance so you can

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.600 
the increased distance so you can
basically<00:00:49.140> hit<00:00:49.710> your<00:00:49.829> opponent<00:00:50.309> even<00:00:50.489> when

basically hit your opponent even when

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.340 
basically hit your opponent even when

in<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> right<00:00:52.680> direction<00:00:53.149> it<00:00:54.149> was<00:00:54.239> innovative

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
in the right direction it was innovative

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.420 
in the right direction it was innovative
and<00:00:54.840> fun<00:00:55.020> for<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.230> time<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:56.129> could<00:00:56.340> be

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
and fun for the time but could be

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.920 
and fun for the time but could be
disappointed<00:00:57.030> if<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.210> wanted<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.690> real

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
disappointed if you wanted a real

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.930 
disappointed if you wanted a real
competition<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:59.309> other<00:00:59.430> problem<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.789> course

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
competition the other problem of course

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.529 
competition the other problem of course
is<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.750> need<00:01:00.989> two<00:01:01.230> people<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.800> play<00:01:02.539> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
is that you need two people to play the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.060 
is that you need two people to play the
Vectron<00:01:03.870> invasion<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.439> another<00:01:04.680> one<00:01:04.860> that

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
Vectron invasion is another one that

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.490 
Vectron invasion is another one that
required<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.670> one<00:01:05.909> person<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.200> was<00:01:07.290> still

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
required on one person but it was still

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.859 
required on one person but it was still
our<00:01:07.650> IR<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.760> limited<00:01:09.299> control<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
our IR and the limited control of the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.530 
our IR and the limited control of the
aircraft<00:01:10.320> was<00:01:10.710> pretty

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.080 

so<00:01:14.260> there<00:01:14.440> were<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.620> main<00:01:14.800> challenges<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.640> real

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
so there were the main challenges a real

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.060 
so there were the main challenges a real
competitive<00:01:16.750> system<00:01:17.200> for<00:01:17.560> one<00:01:17.800> or<00:01:18.040> two

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
competitive system for one or two

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.760 
competitive system for one or two
players<00:01:18.490> an<00:01:19.270> accurate<00:01:19.900> firing<00:01:20.290> and<00:01:20.410> shooting

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
players an accurate firing and shooting

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.140 
players an accurate firing and shooting
action<00:01:20.980> with<00:01:21.520> more<00:01:22.360> exciting<00:01:22.780> payoff<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.970> the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
action with more exciting payoff so the

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.520 
action with more exciting payoff so the
first<00:01:25.420> thing<00:01:25.600> we<00:01:25.720> did<00:01:25.840> was<00:01:26.020> try<00:01:26.170> to<00:01:26.290> come<00:01:26.500> up

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
first thing we did was try to come up

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.700 
first thing we did was try to come up
with<00:01:26.710> a<00:01:27.100> drum<00:01:27.700> that<00:01:28.420> could<00:01:28.600> accurately<00:01:28.870> track

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
with a drum that could accurately track

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.760 
with a drum that could accurately track
reading<00:01:30.670> that<00:01:30.820> IR<00:01:31.240> signal<00:01:31.720> and<00:01:31.960> chasing<00:01:32.710> it

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
reading that IR signal and chasing it

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.610 
reading that IR signal and chasing it
down<00:01:33.450> pretty<00:01:34.450> happy<00:01:34.750> with<00:01:34.900> it<00:01:35.020> so<00:01:35.050> we<00:01:35.260> mounted

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
down pretty happy with it so we mounted

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.020 
down pretty happy with it so we mounted
that<00:01:35.770> signal<00:01:36.160> to<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:36.370> bottom<00:01:36.670> or<00:01:37.000> a

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
that signal to the bottom or a

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.030 
that signal to the bottom or a
helicopter<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:38.730> tried<00:01:39.730> out<00:01:40.860> tracking<00:01:41.860> the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
helicopter and tried out tracking the

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.280 
helicopter and tried out tracking the
helicopter<00:01:42.580> which<00:01:43.150> we<00:01:43.720> were<00:01:43.810> also<00:01:43.930> pretty

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
helicopter which we were also pretty

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.350 
helicopter which we were also pretty
pleased<00:01:44.530> with<00:01:44.680> the<00:01:45.190> results<00:01:45.610> in<00:01:45.940> terms<00:01:46.120> of<00:01:46.300> the

we're<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.550> little<00:01:54.790> bit<00:01:55.030> wimpy<00:01:55.390> they<00:01:55.780> didn't<00:01:56.020> go

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
we're a little bit wimpy they didn't go

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.810 
we're a little bit wimpy they didn't go
that<00:01:56.320> far<00:01:56.620> they<00:01:56.890> used<00:01:57.100> a<00:01:57.220> flex<00:01:57.580> and<00:01:57.760> all

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
that far they used a flex and all

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.990 
that far they used a flex and all
release<00:01:58.180> on<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.320> spring<00:01:59.710> and<00:02:00.100> so<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:00.790> had<00:02:00.970> to

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
release on the spring and so you had to

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.210 
release on the spring and so you had to
be<00:02:01.180> pretty<00:02:01.660> close<00:02:01.900> proximity<00:02:02.440> to<00:02:02.650> the<00:02:02.830> robot

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
be pretty close proximity to the robot

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.790 
be pretty close proximity to the robot
for<00:02:03.490> him<00:02:03.610> to<00:02:03.790> accurately<00:02:04.330> shoot<00:02:04.660> you<00:02:04.810> which<00:02:05.560> we

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
for him to accurately shoot you which we

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.170 
for him to accurately shoot you which we
weren't<00:02:06.010> satisfied<00:02:06.160> with<00:02:06.550> we<00:02:06.910> wanted

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
weren't satisfied with we wanted

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
weren't satisfied with we wanted
something<00:02:07.390> that<00:02:07.540> was<00:02:07.720> a<00:02:07.780> little<00:02:07.930> bit<00:02:08.080> more

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
something that was a little bit more

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.010 
something that was a little bit more
powerful<00:02:08.679> it<00:02:09.670> shoot<00:02:09.970> a<00:02:10.090> helicopter<00:02:10.720> at<00:02:10.840> least

10 feet away and vice versa so happy
with<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.750> tracking<00:02:17.050> we<00:02:17.380> set<00:02:17.620> up<00:02:17.739> for<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.040> new

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
with the tracking we set up for the new

we're<00:02:21.640> all<00:02:21.760> Robocop<00:02:22.239> fans<00:02:22.540> here<00:02:22.840> but<00:02:23.050> it's<00:02:23.200> a

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
we're all Robocop fans here but it's a

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.360 
we're all Robocop fans here but it's a
loose<00:02:23.830> inspiration<00:02:25.650> anyways<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:27.280> know

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
loose inspiration anyways the you know

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.460 
loose inspiration anyways the you know
the<00:02:27.700> Gatling<00:02:28.120> guns<00:02:28.330> which<00:02:28.600> are<00:02:28.750> air<00:02:28.959> powered

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
the Gatling guns which are air powered

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.180 
the Gatling guns which are air powered
and<00:02:29.709> can<00:02:30.010> shoot<00:02:30.250> over<00:02:30.850> 20<00:02:31.150> feet<00:02:31.360> and

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
and can shoot over 20 feet and

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.150 
and can shoot over 20 feet and
accurately<00:02:33.190> track<00:02:33.519> and<00:02:33.730> shoot<00:02:33.940> over<00:02:34.239> 10<00:02:34.600> feet

accurately track and shoot over 10 feet

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.240 
accurately track and shoot over 10 feet
and<00:02:36.959> then<00:02:37.959> we<00:02:38.230> had<00:02:38.380> to<00:02:38.530> figure<00:02:38.709> out<00:02:38.950> something

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
and then we had to figure out something

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.830 
and then we had to figure out something
similar<00:02:39.670> for<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:39.850> helicopter<00:02:40.480> which<00:02:40.690> the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
similar for the helicopter which the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.570 
similar for the helicopter which the
team<00:02:41.050> in<00:02:41.200> Toronto<00:02:41.410> came<00:02:41.950> up<00:02:42.100> with<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.340> dis

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
team in Toronto came up with the dis

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.280 
team in Toronto came up with the dis
shooting<00:02:42.910> helicopter<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.600> again<00:02:43.870> can<00:02:44.050> shoot

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
shooting helicopter that again can shoot

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.590 
shooting helicopter that again can shoot
20<00:02:44.620> feet<00:02:44.860> instead<00:02:45.670> of<00:02:45.850> being<00:02:46.030> four<00:02:46.300> or<00:02:46.450> five

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
20 feet instead of being four or five

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.960 
20 feet instead of being four or five
with<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.930> plastic<00:02:47.380> missiles<00:02:47.769> so<00:02:47.980> then<00:02:48.220> when

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
with the plastic missiles so then when

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.490 
with the plastic missiles so then when
you<00:02:49.030> put<00:02:49.239> this<00:02:49.390> dis<00:02:49.660> shooting<00:02:49.930> helicopter

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
you put this dis shooting helicopter

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.650 
you put this dis shooting helicopter
together<00:02:50.769> with<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.040> robot<00:02:51.459> we<00:02:52.060> had<00:02:52.300> a<00:02:52.330> real

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
together with the robot we had a real

together with the robot we had a real

and it takes practice I won't say like a
