00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
but you really don't really need it

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.070 
but you really don't really need it
honestly

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
honestly

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.920 
honestly
I<00:02:09.140> don't<00:02:10.040> see<00:02:10.160> anything<00:02:10.310> else<00:02:10.750> there's<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:11.780> few

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.930 
I don't see anything else there's a few
differences<00:02:12.320> volume<00:02:12.740> stuff<00:02:13.520> like<00:02:13.670> that<00:02:13.700> but

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
differences volume stuff like that but

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.040 
differences volume stuff like that but
other<00:02:16.940> than<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.120> it's<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.510> it's<00:02:17.720> much<00:02:17.870> nicer

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
other than that it's a it's much nicer

other than that it's a it's much nicer
than<00:02:18.530> I<00:02:18.940> think<00:02:19.940> is<00:02:20.030> anyway<00:02:20.360> I<00:02:20.570> think<00:02:21.200> it's<00:02:21.380> much

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
than I think is anyway I think it's much

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.010 
than I think is anyway I think it's much
nicer<00:02:21.710> than<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.070> big<00:02:22.220> one<00:02:22.750> then<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.870> big

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
nicer than the big one then the big

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.760 
nicer than the big one then the big
remote<00:02:24.350> here<00:02:24.680> I'm<00:02:25.640> not<00:02:25.820> sure<00:02:25.910> if<00:02:26.030> it<00:02:26.120> lights<00:02:26.240> up

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.840 
remote here I'm not sure if it lights up
we'll<00:02:27.770> find<00:02:27.950> out<00:02:28.040> when<00:02:28.130> I<00:02:28.190> put<00:02:28.370> some<00:02:28.460> batteries

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
we'll find out when I put some batteries

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.150 
we'll find out when I put some batteries
in<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.120> I<00:02:29.150> guess<00:02:29.710> thought<00:02:30.710> doesn't<00:02:30.950> look<00:02:31.040> like

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
in and I guess thought doesn't look like

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.280 
in and I guess thought doesn't look like
it<00:02:31.280> does<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:33.380> here's<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.710> headphones<00:02:35.290> just

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
it does and here's the headphones just

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.420 
it does and here's the headphones just
pops<00:02:36.500> open<00:02:37.540> now<00:02:38.540> these<00:02:38.750> are<00:02:39.050> all<00:02:39.980> right<00:02:40.160> like

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
pops open now these are all right like

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.970 
pops open now these are all right like
the<00:02:40.580> standard<00:02:40.790> set<00:02:41.120> is<00:02:41.270> real<00:02:41.540> small<00:02:41.660> as<00:02:42.290> you

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
the standard set is real small as you

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.820
