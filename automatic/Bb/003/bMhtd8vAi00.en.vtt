 snakes and spiders evolves 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.679
 discreetly in nature thanks to a 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.679
 shock weapon their venom 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.450
 they can strike anytime and 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.450
 anywhere 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.809
 the bite of a small 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.420
 octopus has ennobled consists of -10 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.850
 chemical products 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.190
 this usually discrete mollusc 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.520
 measure no more than 10 cm and lives in 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.520
 rocky areas 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.500
 if we disturb him his appearance changes 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.420
 radically his skin suddenly cover 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.440
 dano bright blue 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:14.570
 produced by called cells 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:22.910
 chromate at the fort is a good way to 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:24.500
 keep the predators away from this 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.229
 octopus feeds primarily on 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.710
 small fish and crustaceans his weapon 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.030
 chemical is used to attack defend itself 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.670
 and among the range of toxins contained 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.979
 in his venom his prey must in 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.399
 dread one above all the 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.399
 tetrodotoxin 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:02:10.560
 this substance is much more 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:02:12.330
 powerful that cyanide the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.610
 tetrodotoxin is extremely widespread 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.540
 in the sea 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.770
 several species produce 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.480
 especially the fish globe the 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.120
 tetrodotoxin is present everywhere in 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.959
 his body and this is enough to deter the 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.959
 most predators 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:40.460
 but the Japanese make it a dish 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:43.060
 delicate this fish is known here under the 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.060
 name of fumay 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:53.560
 it is a specialty of gastronomy 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.269
 Japanese but only one gram of it 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.200
 to be toxins could kill all 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.790
 guests of a 500-seat restaurant 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.830
 to have permission to serve this 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.050
 fish a chef must follow a 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.280
 training for two years and pass a 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.280
 rigorous practical exam 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.860
 the liver the ovaries the skin and the kidneys 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.069
 of the fake bus are all potentially 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.760
 murderers of toxins even hides 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.760
 between its edges 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.710
 there is no anti venom 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.120
 antidote of any kind 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:37.160
 it does not take a year in Japan 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.160
 without this fish making a victim
