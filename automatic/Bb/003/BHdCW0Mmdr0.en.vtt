mainly onto our back foot to help

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.979 
mainly onto our back foot to help
control<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> power<00:01:02.449> so<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> key<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.960> have

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
control the power so the key is to have

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.080 
control the power so the key is to have
