the tip for this week is placing far
increases<00:00:03.929> in<00:00:04.200> stockinette<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.850> when<00:00:06.480> would

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
increases in stockinette and when would

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:07.400 
increases in stockinette and when would
you<00:00:06.690> do<00:00:06.899> this

you do this
well<00:00:07.770> most<00:00:08.490> frequently<00:00:09.030> for<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.269> sleeve<00:00:09.630> or<00:00:10.080> if

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
well most frequently for a sleeve or if

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.310 
you're working a sweater from the top
down<00:00:11.880> maybe<00:00:12.179> at<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.450> neckline<00:00:12.809> that's<00:00:13.080> where

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
down maybe at the neckline that's where

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.129 
down maybe at the neckline that's where
you're<00:00:13.500> working<00:00:14.240> increases<00:00:15.240> most<00:00:15.630> frequently

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
you're working increases most frequently

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.900 
you're working increases most frequently
and<00:00:16.230> was<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.500> some<00:00:16.680> specific<00:00:17.190> design<00:00:17.490> pattern

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
and was it some specific design pattern

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.140 
and was it some specific design pattern
and<00:00:18.210> notice<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.109> this<00:00:19.230> case<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.880> there<00:00:20.880> is

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.679 
the left of the increase on the left
side<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.380> there<00:00:29.039> are<00:00:29.279> two<00:00:29.609> stitches<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
side and there are two stitches to the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.069 
side and there are two stitches to the
right<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:32.820> increases<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> right<00:00:33.870> side

right of the increases on the right side
this<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> symmetrical<00:00:35.510> mirrored<00:00:36.510> placement

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
this is a symmetrical mirrored placement

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.200 
this is a symmetrical mirrored placement
this<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.649> what<00:00:37.800> you're<00:00:37.950> looking<00:00:38.250> for<00:00:38.520> now

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
this is what you're looking for now

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.970 
this is what you're looking for now
while<00:00:39.510> we're<00:00:39.690> looking<00:00:39.960> at<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.230> swatch<00:00:40.559> let's

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
while we're looking at this swatch let's

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.500 
while we're looking at this swatch let's
look<00:00:41.160> at<00:00:41.280> some<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> drawbacks<00:00:42.090> first<00:00:42.390> of

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
look at some of the drawbacks first of

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.180 
look at some of the drawbacks first of
all<00:00:42.600> these<00:00:42.809> increases<00:00:43.290> are<00:00:43.410> very<00:00:43.590> noticeable

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
all these increases are very noticeable

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.510 
all these increases are very noticeable
the<00:00:44.850> bar<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.899> also<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.920> will<00:00:47.129> have<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.309> little

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
the bar and also you will have a little

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.010 
the bar and also you will have a little
hole<00:00:47.760> below<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.360> bar<00:00:48.570> that's<00:00:48.780> virtually

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
hole below that bar that's virtually

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.369 
hole below that bar that's virtually
impossible<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:50.039> get<00:00:50.309> rid<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.789> stockinette

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
impossible to get rid of in stockinette

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.560 
impossible to get rid of in stockinette
also<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.680> stitch<00:00:52.949> below<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.910> increases

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
also the stitch below the increases

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.049 
also the stitch below the increases
where<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> increase<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.469> made<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:56.010> small<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
where the increase is made is small and

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.119 
where the increase is made is small and
that's<00:00:57.510> because<00:00:57.840> you're<00:00:57.989> using<00:00:58.199> one<00:00:58.739> stitch

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
that's because you're using one stitch

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.549 
that's because you're using one stitch
to<00:00:59.430> make<00:00:59.789> two<00:01:00.030> stitches<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:01.350> going<00:01:01.469> to

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
to make two stitches and it's going to

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.590 
to make two stitches and it's going to
reduce<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.010> size<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.520> stitch<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:03.510> if

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
reduce the size of that stitch but if

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.329 
reduce the size of that stitch but if
you<00:01:03.660> are<00:01:03.780> gonna<00:01:03.930> use<00:01:04.019> bar<00:01:04.379> increases<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.159> is

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
you are gonna use bar increases this is

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.920 
you are gonna use bar increases this is
the<00:01:05.369> proper<00:01:05.790> placement<00:01:06.000> now<00:01:06.420> let's<00:01:06.630> look<00:01:06.750> at<00:01:06.900> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the proper placement now let's look at a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.200 
the proper placement now let's look at a
swatch<00:01:07.229> where<00:01:07.710> there<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.070> improper<00:01:08.970> placement

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
swatch where there is improper placement

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.010 
swatch where there is improper placement
on<00:01:10.460> this<00:01:11.460> watch<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.240> increases<00:01:12.750> are<00:01:12.780> not

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
on this watch the increases are not

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.249 
on this watch the increases are not
mirrored<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.210> right<00:01:15.210> side<00:01:15.509> there<00:01:16.110> are<00:01:16.140> two

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
mirrored on the right side there are two

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.399 
mirrored on the right side there are two
stitches<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.030> left<00:01:18.240> side<00:01:18.479> here<00:01:19.170> there

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
stitches but on the left side here there

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.109 
stitches but on the left side here there
are<00:01:19.530> two<00:01:19.680> stitches<00:01:20.189> over<00:01:20.460> here<00:01:20.850> there<00:01:21.090> are

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
are two stitches over here there are

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.870 
are two stitches over here there are
three<00:01:21.540> stitches<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:23.070> always<00:01:23.369> like<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.729> tell

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
three stitches and I always like to tell

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.600 
three stitches and I always like to tell
my<00:01:24.030> students<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.470> expect<00:01:26.100> symmetry

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
my students that the I expect symmetry

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.609 
my students that the I expect symmetry
and<00:01:26.909> when<00:01:27.210> there<00:01:27.360> isn't<00:01:27.540> symmetry<00:01:28.140> you're

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
and when there isn't symmetry you're

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.929 
and when there isn't symmetry you're
going<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.829> look<00:01:29.040> at<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.460> try<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.670> figure

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
going to look at it and try and figure

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.630 
going to look at it and try and figure
out<00:01:30.090> why<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.479> isn't<00:01:30.780> symmetrical<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.680> you're

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
out why it isn't symmetrical and you're

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.760 
out why it isn't symmetrical and you're
noticing<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.360> ideally<00:01:34.229> when<00:01:34.439> you're<00:01:34.560> placing

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
noticing it ideally when you're placing

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.149 
noticing it ideally when you're placing
increases<00:01:35.430> they<00:01:35.700> should<00:01:35.939> be<00:01:36.180> unnoticeable

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
increases they should be unnoticeable

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.310 
increases they should be unnoticeable
now<00:01:38.159> another<00:01:38.430> way<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.509> never<00:01:39.720> ever<00:01:39.960> ever

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
now another way that you never ever ever

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.310 
now another way that you never ever ever
want<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.740> place<00:01:41.180> increases<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
want to place increases is in the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.889 
want to place increases is in the
selvage<00:01:43.680> stitch<00:01:43.950> first<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.909> all<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.720> just

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
selvage stitch first of all this is just

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.010 
selvage stitch first of all this is just
downright<00:01:46.049> ugly<00:01:46.939> the<00:01:47.939> selvage<00:01:48.540> sides<00:01:48.780> are

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
downright ugly the selvage sides are

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.580 
downright ugly the selvage sides are
bumpy<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:50.240> imagine<00:01:51.240> if<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.930> were<00:01:52.140> trying<00:01:52.439> to

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
bumpy but imagine if I were trying to

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.280 
bumpy but imagine if I were trying to
pick<00:01:52.979> up<00:01:53.159> stitches<00:01:53.460> or<00:01:53.880> seam<00:01:54.270> along<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:55.020> edge

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
pick up stitches or seam along this edge

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
side and to pick up stitches but it

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.990 
side and to pick up stitches but it
wouldn't<00:02:22.470> be<00:02:22.560> symmetrical<00:02:23.190> imagine<00:02:23.760> if<00:02:23.880> you

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
wouldn't be symmetrical imagine if you

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.059 
wouldn't be symmetrical imagine if you
were<00:02:24.120> doing<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.480> top<00:02:24.660> down<00:02:24.840> sweater<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.500> that

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
were doing a top down sweater and that

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.830 
were doing a top down sweater and that
was<00:02:26.220> your<00:02:26.370> neckline<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:27.270> would<00:02:27.390> have<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.660> go<00:02:27.810> a

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
was your neckline you would have to go a

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.570 
was your neckline you would have to go a
couple<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.319> stitches<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.709> in<00:02:29.100> order<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.430> get<00:02:29.550> a

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
couple of stitches and in order to get a

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.630 
couple of stitches and in order to get a
symmetrical<00:02:30.150> line<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.770> would<00:02:31.980> still<00:02:32.400> look

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
symmetrical line and it would still look

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.570 
symmetrical line and it would still look
lumpy<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.090> bumpy<00:02:33.440> now<00:02:34.440> how<00:02:34.620> do<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.830> determine

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
lumpy and bumpy now how do I determine

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.150 
lumpy and bumpy now how do I determine
this<00:02:36.709> it's<00:02:37.709> easy<00:02:38.070> on<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.900> right<00:02:40.110> side<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:41.010> go

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
this it's easy on the right side to go

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.520 
this it's easy on the right side to go
for<00:02:41.370> symmetry<00:02:41.640> I'm<00:02:42.420> gonna<00:02:42.720> I've<00:02:42.959> decided<00:02:43.260> on

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
for symmetry I'm gonna I've decided on

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.340 
for symmetry I'm gonna I've decided on
this<00:02:43.680> watch<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.160> want<00:02:44.370> my<00:02:44.550> increases<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:46.170> have

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
this watch I want my increases to have

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.630 
this watch I want my increases to have
two<00:02:47.250> stitches<00:02:47.640> on<00:02:47.730> either<00:02:47.790> side<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:48.989> I<00:02:49.459> knit<00:02:50.459> my

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
two stitches on either side so I knit my

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.170 
two stitches on either side so I knit my
stitch<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.739> remember<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> bar<00:02:53.670> increase

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
stitch and remember that a bar increase

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.509 
stitch and remember that a bar increase
is<00:02:54.360> going<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.750> put<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.080> bar<00:02:55.320> immediately<00:02:56.310> to

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
is going to put the bar immediately to

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.100 
is going to put the bar immediately to
the<00:02:56.940> left<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.600> stitch<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:57.989> you're

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
the left of the stitch that you're

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.759 
the left of the stitch that you're
knitting<00:02:58.320> so<00:02:58.590> if<00:02:58.709> I<00:02:58.860> want<00:02:59.160> two<00:02:59.489> stitches<00:03:00.769> to

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
knitting so if I want two stitches to

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.259 
knitting so if I want two stitches to
the<00:03:02.690> right<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:04.080> my<00:03:04.290> increase<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:04.980> work<00:03:05.760> that

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
the right of my increase I work that

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.949 
the right of my increase I work that
increase<00:03:06.900> in<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:08.670> second<00:03:09.060> stitch<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:09.600> that's

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
increase in the second stitch and that's

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.640 
increase in the second stitch and that's
going<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.170> put<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.440> bar<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:12.050> left<00:03:13.050> of<00:03:13.530> that

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
going to put the bar to the left of that

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.020 
going to put the bar to the left of that
stitch<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.070> I'll<00:03:14.160> have<00:03:14.310> my<00:03:14.459> two<00:03:14.519> selvage

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
stitch and I'll have my two selvage

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.530 
stitch and I'll have my two selvage
stitches<00:03:15.450> now<00:03:16.440> over<00:03:16.950> here<00:03:17.519> if<00:03:17.850> you're

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
stitches now over here if you're

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.250 
stitches now over here if you're
thinking<00:03:19.019> oh<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:19.709> want<00:03:19.980> two<00:03:20.549> stitches<00:03:21.260> what

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
thinking oh I want two stitches what

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.680 
thinking oh I want two stitches what
would<00:03:22.410> happen<00:03:22.799> if<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.160> made<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.910> stitch<00:03:24.209> in

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
would happen if I made the stitch in

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.560 
would happen if I made the stitch in
that<00:03:25.350> stitch<00:03:26.070> there<00:03:26.730> would<00:03:26.910> be<00:03:26.940> one<00:03:27.239> stitch

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
that stitch there would be one stitch

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.740 
that stitch there would be one stitch
because<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:28.170> bar<00:03:28.410> is<00:03:28.739> going<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.100> appear<00:03:29.760> there

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
because the bar is going to appear there

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.190 
because the bar is going to appear there
so<00:03:31.350> where<00:03:31.530> I<00:03:31.560> actually<00:03:32.000> want<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.269> make<00:03:33.480> the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
so where I actually want to make the

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.850 
so where I actually want to make the
increase<00:03:34.680> on<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.190> left<00:03:35.459> side<00:03:35.730> is<00:03:36.150> in<00:03:37.140> the

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
increase on the left side is in the

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.130 
increase on the left side is in the
third<00:03:38.160> stitch<00:03:39.530> and<00:03:41.329> that<00:03:42.329> is<00:03:42.600> going<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:42.959> leave

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
third stitch and that is going to leave

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.960 
third stitch and that is going to leave
two<00:03:43.500> stitches<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:45.120> left<00:03:46.579> and<00:03:47.579> you<00:03:47.760> can<00:03:47.790> see

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
two stitches to the left and you can see

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.319 
two stitches to the left and you can see
that<00:03:49.310> it's<00:03:50.310> going<00:03:50.549> to<00:03:50.640> be<00:03:50.790> symmetrical

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
that it's going to be symmetrical

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.000 
that it's going to be symmetrical
requires<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.930> little<00:03:52.170> bit<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.380> thought<00:03:52.680> now<00:03:52.950> you

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
requires a little bit of thought now you

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.530 
requires a little bit of thought now you
can<00:03:53.220> use<00:03:53.370> this<00:03:53.489> increase<00:03:53.940> when<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.360> want

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
can use this increase when you want

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.199 
can use this increase when you want
something<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.260> be<00:03:55.350> a<00:03:55.380> little<00:03:55.440> more<00:03:55.739> decorative

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
something to be a little more decorative

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.970 
something to be a little more decorative
but<00:03:57.209> otherwise<00:03:57.420> there<00:03:57.810> are<00:03:57.840> better<00:03:58.200> increases

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
but otherwise there are better increases
