00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
not too much so I'm going to go to the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.330 
not too much so I'm going to go to the
sink<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.930> run<00:01:34.020> these<00:01:34.200> under<00:01:34.470> some<00:01:34.619> water<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
sink and run these under some water the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.460 
sink and run these under some water the
Beauty<00:01:35.579> Blender<00:01:35.670> gets<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.150> lot<00:01:36.450> bigger<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.229> I'm

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
Beauty Blender gets a lot bigger so I'm

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.350 
Beauty Blender gets a lot bigger so I'm
going<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.680> see<00:01:37.829> hopefully<00:01:38.369> maybe<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.180> one

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
going to see hopefully maybe this one

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.149 
going to see hopefully maybe this one
will<00:01:39.479> get<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.659> size<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.290> one<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.799> put

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
will get the size of this one so I put

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.770 
will get the size of this one so I put
both<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.340> them<00:01:41.549> under<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> water<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.420> they

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
both of them under the water and they

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.440 
both of them under the water and they
both<00:01:43.079> got<00:01:43.439> really<00:01:43.979> big<00:01:44.340> I'm<00:01:44.820> having<00:01:45.240> high

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450

hopes<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.140> one<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.770> really<00:01:47.579> soft<00:01:47.880> just

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
hopes for this one it's really soft just

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.530 
hopes for this one it's really soft just
like<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.540> Beauty<00:01:48.840> Blender<00:01:48.930> very<00:01:49.409> bouncy<00:01:50.100> and

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
the same now on to see if it does the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.300 
the same now on to see if it does the

Lauder Double Wear foundation so we're
going<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.380> see<00:02:01.560> if<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.740> blends<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.070> out<00:02:02.159> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
going to see if it blends it out the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.800 
going to see if it blends it out the
same<00:02:02.490> way<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.850> Beauty<00:02:03.090> Blender<00:02:03.180> does<00:02:03.540> I've

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
same way the Beauty Blender does I've

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.100 
same way the Beauty Blender does I've
used<00:02:04.649> my<00:02:04.829> Beauty<00:02:05.130> Blender<00:02:05.159> like<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.640> said

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
used my Beauty Blender like I said

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.810 
used my Beauty Blender like I said
over<00:02:06.290> a<00:02:06.320> year<00:02:06.410> now<00:02:06.710> so<00:02:06.920> I<00:02:06.950> pretty<00:02:07.190> much<00:02:07.310> know

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
over a year now so I pretty much know

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.450 
over a year now so I pretty much know
how<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:08.330> applies<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:09.229> we'll<00:02:09.649> see<00:02:09.860> if<00:02:10.070> this<00:02:10.250> one

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
how it applies and we'll see if this one

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.770 
how it applies and we'll see if this one
can<00:02:10.930> live<00:02:11.930> up<00:02:12.080> to<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.500> so<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.490> if<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.510> can

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
can live up to it so and if it can

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.990 
can live up to it so and if it can
that's<00:02:15.170> really<00:02:15.410> good<00:02:15.590> because<00:02:16.000> it's

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
that's really good because it's

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.770

concealer<00:03:20.140> it's<00:03:21.140> probably<00:03:21.470> gonna<00:03:21.560> work<00:03:21.739> out

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
concealer it's probably gonna work out

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.370 
concealer it's probably gonna work out
the<00:03:21.950> same<00:03:22.130> way<00:03:22.340> but<00:03:22.760> you<00:03:23.299> know<00:03:23.480> we<00:03:23.810> like<00:03:24.019> to<00:03:24.170> try
