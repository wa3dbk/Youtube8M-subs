00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
indicates that usages so the would pop

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.369 
indicates that usages so the would pop
up<00:03:08.819> has<00:03:09.060> 75<00:03:09.660> uses<00:03:10.079> the<00:03:10.739> iron<00:03:11.040> has<00:03:11.340> 350<00:03:12.209> uses<00:03:12.750> the

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
up has 75 uses the iron has 350 uses the

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.890 
up has 75 uses the iron has 350 uses the
gold<00:03:13.739> is<00:03:14.010> only<00:03:14.310> 50<00:03:15.000> but<00:03:15.180> again<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.450> does<00:03:15.629> jump

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
the diamond which is what it's got nine

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.759 
the diamond which is what it's got nine
on<00:03:21.090> online<00:03:21.329> basically<00:03:21.690> it's<00:03:21.810> unlimited<00:03:22.170> so

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
on online basically it's unlimited so

on online basically it's unlimited so
it's<00:03:22.920> infinite<00:03:23.370> jumps<00:03:23.760> but<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:24.959> yeah<00:03:25.200> so<00:03:25.380> they

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
it's infinite jumps but so yeah so they

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.569 
it's infinite jumps but so yeah so they
