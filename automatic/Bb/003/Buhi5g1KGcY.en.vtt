drawing a Mercedes we're gonna start off

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.769 
drawing a Mercedes we're gonna start off
with<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.369> tires<00:00:17.640> because<00:00:18.210> those<00:00:18.570> are<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
with the tires because those are the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.500 
with the tires because those are the
simplest<00:00:19.320> shapes<00:00:19.910> we're<00:00:20.910> just<00:00:21.090> going<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.270> draw

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
simplest shapes we're just going to draw

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.870 
simplest shapes we're just going to draw
two<00:00:21.570> circles<00:00:25.130> then<00:00:26.130> we're<00:00:26.250> gonna<00:00:26.340> draw<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.640> line

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
two circles then we're gonna draw a line

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.839 
two circles then we're gonna draw a line
connecting<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.660> two<00:00:27.840> circles<00:00:28.670> we'll<00:00:29.670> draw

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
connecting the two circles we'll draw

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.650 
connecting the two circles we'll draw
one<00:00:30.119> more<00:00:30.619> line<00:00:32.630> just<00:00:33.630> here<00:00:34.910> to<00:00:35.910> show<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.480> line

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
one more line just here to show the line

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.600 
one more line just here to show the line
of<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> doors<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.559> then<00:00:38.010> we'll<00:00:38.160> just<00:00:38.430> draw

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
of the doors and then we'll just draw

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.400 
of the doors and then we'll just draw
one<00:00:38.879> more<00:00:38.940> line<00:00:39.329> up<00:00:39.540> here<00:00:39.780> for<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.110> hood<00:00:40.290> of

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
one more line up here for the hood of

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.090 
one more line up here for the hood of
the<00:00:40.469> car<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:42.899> draw<00:00:43.050> two<00:00:43.320> lines<00:00:43.590> coming<00:00:43.950> down

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
the car and draw two lines coming down

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.240 
the car and draw two lines coming down
this<00:00:44.460> way<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.030> then<00:00:45.239> we'll<00:00:45.420> connect<00:00:46.010> this<00:00:47.010> to

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
this way and then we'll connect this to

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.160 
this way and then we'll connect this to
here<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.969> will<00:00:48.149> create<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.539> back<00:00:48.960> of

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
here and that will create the back of

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.740 
here and that will create the back of
the<00:00:49.230> car<00:00:49.640> and<00:00:50.640> we'll<00:00:50.820> do<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> same<00:00:51.329> thing<00:00:51.629> you

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
the car and we'll do the same thing you

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.410 
the car and we'll do the same thing you
see<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.079> almost<00:00:52.379> like<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.129> triangle<00:00:56.420> I'm

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
see it's almost like a triangle I'm

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.130 
see it's almost like a triangle I'm
going<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.690> do<00:00:57.809> one<00:00:58.050> more<00:00:58.079> line<00:00:58.410> up<00:00:58.620> here<00:00:59.039> and

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
going to do one more line up here and

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.549 
going to do one more line up here and
you<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.170> box<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.379> simple<00:01:04.379> you

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
you just box that in and that simple you

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.310 
you just box that in and that simple you
can<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.040> back<00:01:05.220> windshield<00:01:05.900> and<00:01:06.900> again

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
can have the back windshield and again

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.539 
can have the back windshield and again
we'll<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> same<00:01:08.729> thing<00:01:09.090> here<00:01:10.549> another

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
we'll do the same thing here another

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.399 
we'll do the same thing here another
simple<00:01:12.060> shape<00:01:12.330> here<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.140> front

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
simple shape here for the front

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.219 
simple shape here for the front
windshield<00:01:14.090> we'll<00:01:15.090> divide<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.630> line<00:01:15.810> here<00:01:16.110> to

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
windshield we'll divide the line here to

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.620 
windshield we'll divide the line here to
get<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> windows<00:01:17.000> now<00:01:18.000> we'll<00:01:18.180> work<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
get the windows now we'll work on the

get the windows now we'll work on the
front<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:18.990> car<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:19.439> we'll<00:01:19.619> come<00:01:19.830> here

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
front of the car here we'll come here

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.420 
front of the car here we'll come here
almost<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.090> an<00:01:21.240> oval<00:01:21.630> shape<00:01:22.310> for<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
almost do like an oval shape for the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.130 
almost do like an oval shape for the
headlamp

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
headlamp

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.730
