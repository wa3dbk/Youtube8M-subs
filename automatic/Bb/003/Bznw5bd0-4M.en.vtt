medium<00:01:04.470> t-rex<00:01:05.309> 600<00:01:05.939> which<00:01:06.540> I'm<00:01:06.810> sure<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.260> KD

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
medium t-rex 600 which I'm sure that KD

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.010 
medium t-rex 600 which I'm sure that KD
s<00:01:07.650> 600<00:01:08.189> will<00:01:08.340> be<00:01:08.490> exactly<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.150> same<00:01:09.450> size<00:01:09.720> and

s 600 will be exactly the same size and

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.070 
s 600 will be exactly the same size and
then<00:01:10.650> KD<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.159> 550<00:01:11.760> e<00:01:11.790> Wow
