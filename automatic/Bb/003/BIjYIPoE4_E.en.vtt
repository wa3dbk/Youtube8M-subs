again<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.530> driver<00:02:26.910> sits<00:02:27.910> in<00:02:28.120> this<00:02:28.209> position

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
again the driver sits in this position

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.069 
again the driver sits in this position
here<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:30.190> operates<00:02:30.640> these<00:02:30.910> handlebars<00:02:31.390> now

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
here and operates these handlebars now

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.300 
here and operates these handlebars now
as<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.380> can<00:02:32.470> see<00:02:32.530> when<00:02:32.859> I<00:02:32.950> turn<00:02:32.980> the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
as you can see when I turn the

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.720 
as you can see when I turn the
handlebars<00:02:33.880> that<00:02:34.470> turns<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.859> rudders<00:02:36.250> at<00:02:36.549> the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
handlebars that turns to rudders at the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.240 
handlebars that turns to rudders at the
back<00:02:36.910> so<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.630> directs<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.410> flow<00:02:38.650> of<00:02:38.680> air<00:02:38.980> out

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
back so it directs the flow of air out

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.849 
back so it directs the flow of air out
through<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:40.269> back<00:02:40.480> of<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.690> fan<00:02:41.019> and<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:41.680> can

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
through the back of the fan and I can

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.310 
through the back of the fan and I can
steer<00:02:42.160> it<00:02:42.340> now<00:02:43.180> if<00:02:43.299> I<00:02:43.390> want<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.660> stop<00:02:43.959> moving

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
steer it now if I want to stop moving

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.410 
steer it now if I want to stop moving
forward<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.040> just<00:02:45.220> hover<00:02:45.430> in<00:02:45.579> one<00:02:45.730> position<00:02:46.239> I

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
forward and just hover in one position I

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.560 
forward and just hover in one position I
take<00:02:46.989> hold<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.739> lever<00:02:48.250> here<00:02:48.609> I<00:02:48.850> press<00:02:49.390> the

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
take hold of a lever here I press the

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.750 
take hold of a lever here I press the
knob<00:02:49.780> on<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:50.109> and<00:02:50.350> then<00:02:50.799> pull<00:02:51.040> up<00:02:51.160> you<00:02:51.459> see<00:02:51.609> what

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
knob on in and then pull up you see what

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.310 
knob on in and then pull up you see what
that's<00:02:51.850> doing<00:02:52.150> at<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.329> back<00:02:52.510> it's<00:02:53.169> actually

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
that's doing at the back it's actually

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.120 
that's doing at the back it's actually
closing<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.250> couple<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.669> things

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
closing a couple of things

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.710 
closing a couple of things
look<00:02:55.220> like<00:02:55.400> venetian<00:02:55.910> blinds<00:02:56.180> those<00:02:56.570> are

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
look like venetian blinds those are

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.540 
look like venetian blinds those are
called<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:56.930> thrust<00:02:57.260> spoilers<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:58.370> think

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
called the thrust spoilers and I think

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.550 
called the thrust spoilers and I think
you<00:02:58.610> can<00:02:58.760> see<00:02:58.970> why<00:02:59.180> I<00:02:59.510> closed<00:03:00.080> them<00:03:00.290> all<00:03:00.410> the

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
you can see why I closed them all the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.500 
you can see why I closed them all the
way<00:03:00.740> it<00:03:01.340> means<00:03:01.580> there'll<00:03:01.790> be<00:03:01.820> no<00:03:02.060> air<00:03:02.240> going

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
way it means there'll be no air going

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.620 
way it means there'll be no air going
through<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.870> back<00:03:03.140> of<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.590> fan<00:03:04.400> cylinder<00:03:04.970> the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
through the back of the fan cylinder the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.840 
through the back of the fan cylinder the
air<00:03:05.780> only<00:03:06.020> goes<00:03:06.350> down<00:03:06.650> underneath<00:03:07.160> so<00:03:07.700> it's

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
air only goes down underneath so it's

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.460 
air only goes down underneath so it's
still<00:03:08.030> hovering<00:03:08.420> in<00:03:08.630> position<00:03:09.140> it's<00:03:09.260> not

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
still hovering in position it's not

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.560 
still hovering in position it's not
moving<00:03:09.890> forward<00:03:10.310> if<00:03:10.640> I<00:03:10.730> want<00:03:10.880> to<00:03:10.940> go<00:03:11.030> forward<00:03:11.330> I

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
moving forward if I want to go forward I

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.110 
moving forward if I want to go forward I
just<00:03:11.810> press<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.470> plunger<00:03:12.680> down<00:03:13.070> and<00:03:13.400> there

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
just press the plunger down and there

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.360 
just press the plunger down and there
goes<00:03:14.390> out<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.720> back<00:03:14.900> once<00:03:15.500> again<00:03:15.800> I<00:03:15.950> move

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
goes out the back once again I move

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.270 
goes out the back once again I move
forward<00:03:16.780> well<00:03:17.780> that's<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.350> very<00:03:18.560> neat

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
forward well that's a very neat

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.400 
forward well that's a very neat
hovercraft<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.630> also<00:03:20.810> has<00:03:21.140> something

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
hovercraft and it also has something

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.740 
hovercraft and it also has something
around<00:03:21.710> the<00:03:21.890> outside<00:03:22.370> which<00:03:23.000> is<00:03:23.180> vitally

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
around the outside which is vitally

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.980 
around the outside which is vitally

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.460 
for obvious reasons a skirt can you
