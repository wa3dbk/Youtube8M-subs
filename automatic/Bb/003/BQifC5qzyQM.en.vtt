violate almost doubling or prep actually

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.310 
violate almost doubling or prep actually
I<00:05:55.919> think<00:05:55.949> more<00:05:56.490> than<00:05:56.639> doubling<00:05:57.090> sky<00:05:57.419> score<00:05:57.840> but

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
I think more than doubling sky score but

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.930 
I think more than doubling sky score but
still<00:05:58.650> not<00:05:58.860> enough<00:05:58.919> to<00:05:59.280> overcome<00:05:59.520> as<00:05:59.789> the
