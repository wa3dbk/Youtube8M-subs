00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.070 

this<00:00:00.669> tutorial<00:00:01.180> we<00:00:01.300> will<00:00:01.329> be<00:00:01.540> taking<00:00:01.810> apart

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:02.080 
this tutorial we will be taking apart

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.190 
this tutorial we will be taking apart
and<00:00:02.230> reassembling<00:00:02.679> the<00:00:02.889> dayan<00:00:03.220> zhanchi<00:00:03.250> and

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
and reassembling the dayan zhanchi and

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.720 
and reassembling the dayan zhanchi and
this<00:00:05.200> is<00:00:05.380> a<00:00:05.620> stickerless<00:00:06.070> cube<00:00:06.460> and<00:00:06.580> just

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:06.730 
this is a stickerless cube and just

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.300 
this is a stickerless cube and just
happened<00:00:07.030> to<00:00:07.120> me<00:00:07.210> mixed<00:00:07.510> up<00:00:07.600> at<00:00:07.750> the<00:00:07.870> time<00:00:08.310> to

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.310 
happened to me mixed up at the time to

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.180 
happened to me mixed up at the time to
begin<00:00:09.570> rotate<00:00:10.570> the<00:00:10.750> top<00:00:10.960> layer<00:00:11.230> 45<00:00:11.860> degrees

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
begin rotate the top layer 45 degrees

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.310 
begin rotate the top layer 45 degrees
like<00:00:12.400> this<00:00:12.430> and<00:00:13.000> then<00:00:13.330> you<00:00:13.510> want<00:00:13.690> to<00:00:13.870> stick

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
like this and then you want to stick

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.260 
like this and then you want to stick
your<00:00:14.350> thumb<00:00:14.980> in<00:00:15.160> there<00:00:15.370> and<00:00:15.730> then<00:00:15.880> just<00:00:15.910> kind

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
your thumb in there and then just kind

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.820 
your thumb in there and then just kind
of<00:00:16.330> twist<00:00:16.539> it<00:00:16.720> around<00:00:16.869> until<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:18.640> pops<00:00:19.150> out

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
of twist it around until it pops out

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.529 
of twist it around until it pops out
yeah<00:00:20.830> and<00:00:20.860> these<00:00:21.010> torpedoes<00:00:21.310> can<00:00:21.940> be<00:00:22.119> hard<00:00:22.449> to

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:22.539 
yeah and these torpedoes can be hard to

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.730 
yeah and these torpedoes can be hard to
get<00:00:22.810> past<00:00:23.460> unless<00:00:24.460> your<00:00:24.820> son<00:00:25.000> attack<00:00:25.740> the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
get past unless your son attack the

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:41.279 
get past unless your son attack the
corners<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:39.389> just<00:00:40.389> think<00:00:40.719> he's<00:00:40.839> running<00:00:41.109> with

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
corners and just think he's running with

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.500 
corners and just think he's running with
the<00:00:41.440> torpedoes<00:00:41.649> do<00:00:42.129> they<00:00:42.399> make<00:00:43.179> sure<00:00:43.359> the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
the torpedoes do they make sure the

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.660 
the torpedoes do they make sure the
edges<00:00:43.780> don't<00:00:43.960> go<00:00:44.170> flying<00:00:44.440> so<00:00:44.799> they<00:00:45.370> go<00:00:45.549> around

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
edges don't go flying so they go around

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.809 
edges don't go flying so they go around
these<00:00:45.969> corners<00:00:46.329> just<00:00:46.510> like<00:00:46.929> that<00:00:47.639> we<00:00:48.639> will

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:48.819 
these corners just like that we will

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:50.399 
these corners just like that we will
once<00:00:49.089> again<00:00:49.239> be<00:00:49.539> putting<00:00:49.809> this<00:00:49.870> in<00:00:49.929> the<00:00:50.170> sauce

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.409 
once again be putting this in the sauce

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:52.469 
once again be putting this in the sauce
position<00:00:51.010> but<00:00:51.280> since<00:00:51.519> it's<00:00:51.699> not<00:00:51.850> super<00:00:52.209> cube

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:52.479 
position but since it's not super cube

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:54.689 
position but since it's not super cube
you<00:00:52.659> don't<00:00:52.809> have<00:00:52.989> to<00:00:53.139> do<00:00:53.289> centers<00:00:54.249> but<00:00:54.459> if<00:00:54.579> it

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
you don't have to do centers but if it

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.000 
you don't have to do centers but if it
is<00:00:54.819> a<00:00:54.850> super<00:00:55.179> cube<00:00:55.389> do<00:00:56.079> it<00:00:56.229> the<00:00:56.379> way<00:00:56.499> that<00:00:56.530> I<00:00:56.769> sit

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
is a super cube do it the way that I sit

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.699 
is a super cube do it the way that I sit
on<00:00:57.100> this<00:00:57.280> make<00:00:58.179> sure<00:00:58.329> they're<00:00:58.479> solved<00:00:58.869> now

00:00:59.699 --> 00:00:59.709 
on this make sure they're solved now

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:03.439 
on this make sure they're solved now
take<00:01:00.489> an<00:01:00.639> edge<00:01:00.879> and<00:01:01.420> put<00:01:01.749> it<00:01:01.869> between<00:01:02.049> this

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
take an edge and put it between this

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.440 
take an edge and put it between this
like<00:01:04.449> just<00:01:04.720> like<00:01:04.900> that<00:01:05.730> now<00:01:06.730> take<00:01:07.030> another<00:01:07.270> one

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
like just like that now take another one

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.120 
like just like that now take another one
and<00:01:07.600> since<00:01:07.780> this<00:01:07.900> is<00:01:08.050> a<00:01:08.140> stickerless<00:01:08.590> one<00:01:08.920> it's

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
and since this is a stickerless one it's

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:16.830 
and since this is a stickerless one it's
much<00:01:09.310> easier<00:01:10.860> now<00:01:11.860> take<00:01:12.130> its<00:01:12.310> corner<00:01:15.840> just

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
much easier now take its corner just

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.290 
much easier now take its corner just
like<00:01:16.960> that<00:01:17.320> oh<00:01:17.590> yeah<00:01:18.580> and<00:01:18.670> these<00:01:18.880> things<00:01:19.150> will

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
like that oh yeah and these things will

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.120 
like that oh yeah and these things will
sometimes<00:01:19.750> do<00:01:19.960> that<00:01:20.110> see<00:01:20.680> yeah<00:01:20.800> you<00:01:20.830> got<00:01:21.010> to<00:01:21.070> be

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
sometimes do that see yeah you got to be

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.180 
sometimes do that see yeah you got to be
careful<00:01:21.310> in<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.610> first<00:01:21.820> few<00:01:22.090> of<00:01:22.240> them<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.950> in

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
careful in the first few of them this in

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:34.550 
careful in the first few of them this in
there<00:01:24.420> now<00:01:26.610> take<00:01:27.610> another<00:01:27.880> edge<00:01:31.260> another<00:01:32.260> one

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
there now take another edge another one

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.230 
there now take another edge another one
and<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:37.240> a<00:01:37.570> trick<00:01:37.930> there<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.670> I<00:01:39.730> surf<00:01:40.000> that

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
and it's a trick there and I surf that

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.060 
and it's a trick there and I surf that
was<00:01:40.360> off<00:01:40.510> the<00:01:40.630> spray<00:01:40.840> a<00:01:40.870> little<00:01:41.050> bit<00:01:41.260> so<00:01:41.890> yeah<00:01:42.040> I

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
was off the spray a little bit so yeah I

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.070 
was off the spray a little bit so yeah I
just<00:01:42.100> keep<00:01:42.490> building<00:01:43.180> up<00:01:43.510> just<00:01:43.780> like<00:01:43.900> you<00:01:44.050> did

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
just keep building up just like you did

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:56.210 
just keep building up just like you did
on<00:01:44.260> the<00:01:44.380> 3x3<00:01:44.830> if<00:01:45.190> you<00:01:45.340> have<00:01:45.940> a<00:01:45.970> big<00:01:46.300> branch<00:01:46.630> 3x3

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.340 

so<00:01:57.220> once<00:01:57.850> you<00:01:57.940> get<00:01:58.030> to<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:58.270> last<00:01:58.420> layer<00:01:58.840> you<00:01:59.140> do

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
so once you get to the last layer you do

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.080 
so once you get to the last layer you do
want<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.620> twist<00:01:59.830> it<00:02:00.040> a<00:02:00.070> little<00:02:00.220> bit<00:02:00.370> to<00:02:00.610> get<00:02:00.970> it

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
want to twist it a little bit to get it

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.240 
want to twist it a little bit to get it
in<00:02:01.300> there<00:02:01.600> you<00:02:01.750> know<00:02:01.870> since<00:02:02.650> it's<00:02:02.979> held

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
in there you know since it's held

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.130 
in there you know since it's held
together<00:02:03.400> and<00:02:03.729> yeah<00:02:04.180> you<00:02:04.330> can<00:02:04.570> pop<00:02:04.840> off<00:02:05.020> the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
together and yeah you can pop off the

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.920 
together and yeah you can pop off the
center<00:02:05.380> cap<00:02:05.560> if<00:02:05.890> you<00:02:06.040> need<00:02:06.190> attention

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
center cap if you need attention

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.410 
center cap if you need attention
it's<00:02:07.080> too<00:02:07.260> loose<00:02:07.580> because<00:02:08.580> it'll<00:02:08.940> fall<00:02:09.119> apart

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
it's too loose because it'll fall apart

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.310 
it's too loose because it'll fall apart
if<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.869> tension<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.259> too<00:02:10.350> loose<00:02:12.110> put<00:02:13.110> in<00:02:13.230> the

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
if the tension is too loose put in the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:25.010 
if the tension is too loose put in the
corner<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.980> work<00:02:14.220> around<00:02:23.450> now<00:02:24.450> when<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.870> comes

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
corner and work around now when it comes

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.100 
corner and work around now when it comes
down<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.620> last<00:02:25.890> three<00:02:26.490> pieces<00:02:27.060> once<00:02:27.810> again

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
down to the last three pieces once again

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.920 
down to the last three pieces once again
put<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.530> corners<00:02:28.950> in<00:02:29.100> first<00:02:29.480> just<00:02:30.480> like<00:02:30.630> this

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
put the corners in first just like this

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.260 
put the corners in first just like this
but<00:02:31.680> this<00:02:31.890> time<00:02:32.160> when<00:02:32.490> you<00:02:32.640> put<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:32.940> edge<00:02:33.060> in

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
but this time when you put the edge in

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.050 
but this time when you put the edge in
you<00:02:33.450> twist<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:35.660> just<00:02:36.660> like<00:02:36.810> that
