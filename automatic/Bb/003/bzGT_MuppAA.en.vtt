00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
how to fit the case so bottom end in

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.260 
how to fit the case so bottom end in
first<00:00:55.129> well<00:00:56.129> first<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.489> all<00:00:56.520> we<00:00:56.670> split<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> two

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
first well first of all we split the two

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.180 
first well first of all we split the two
layers<00:00:57.480> apart<00:00:57.870> bottom<00:00:58.410> end<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.680> first<00:00:58.890> and

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
layers apart bottom end in first and

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.279 
layers apart bottom end in first and
then<00:00:59.340> we<00:00:59.489> sort<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.300> pop<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.870> case<00:01:01.050> back

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
then we sort of pop the case back

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.110 
then we sort of pop the case back
together<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.340> mentioned<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.879> dual

layer which is so what we do is we just

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.010 
layer which is so what we do is we just

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
remove this top section like so you can

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.810 
remove this top section like so you can
see<00:01:10.229> here<00:01:10.500> we've<00:01:10.619> got<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:10.830> hard<00:01:11.220> rigid

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820

then we ease it into the case and that

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.420 
then we ease it into the case and that
is<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.340> portion<00:01:47.850> actually<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.290> just<00:01:50.130> want

well<00:01:56.969> built<00:01:57.540> into<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> case<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:59.040> that's

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
well built into the case so that's

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.100 
well built into the case so that's
really<00:01:59.490> nice<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.030> these<00:02:00.479> will<00:02:00.719> stay<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:00.990> a

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
really nice and these will stay in a

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.289 
really nice and these will stay in a
place<00:02:01.140> once<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.770> place<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.310> back<00:02:02.640> portion<00:02:03.149> on

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
place once I place this back portion on

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.179 
place once I place this back portion on
before<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.350> put<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.590> on<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.770> want<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:04.950> show<00:02:05.040> you

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
before I put this on I want to show you

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.039 
before I put this on I want to show you
how<00:02:05.310> thin<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.180> very<00:02:06.479> very<00:02:06.540> thin<00:02:07.020> very

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
how thin this is so very very thin very

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.499 
how thin this is so very very thin very
lightweight<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:08.580> particular<00:02:08.940> bit<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.360> not

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
lightweight this particular bit is not

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.969

going<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.690> add<00:02:09.810> all<00:02:09.929> much<00:02:10.110> bulk<00:02:10.440> but<00:02:10.709> we<00:02:10.830> have

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
going to add all much bulk but we have

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.229 
going to add all much bulk but we have
got<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.190> little<00:02:11.340> bit<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.580> bulk<00:02:11.819> added<00:02:12.120> on

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
got a little bit of bulk added on

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.559 
got a little bit of bulk added on
already<00:02:12.720> with<00:02:13.319> the

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
already with the

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.479 
already with the
portion<00:02:14.019> direct<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.709> soft<00:02:14.950> silicon<00:02:15.340> rubber

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
portion direct the soft silicon rubber

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.179 
portion direct the soft silicon rubber
and<00:02:15.879> to<00:02:16.569> fit<00:02:16.719> this<00:02:16.840> back<00:02:17.049> in<00:02:17.230> we<00:02:17.560> just<00:02:17.799> go<00:02:17.980> in

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189 
and to fit this back in we just go in

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.459 
and to fit this back in we just go in
bottom<00:02:18.579> edge<00:02:18.760> first<00:02:19.049> so<00:02:20.049> we're<00:02:20.170> just<00:02:20.200> going<00:02:20.439> to

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:20.469 
bottom edge first so we're just going to

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.640 
bottom edge first so we're just going to
place<00:02:20.650> bottom<00:02:21.129> edge<00:02:21.249> in<00:02:21.400> here<00:02:21.989> like<00:02:22.989> so<00:02:23.319> and

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
place bottom edge in here like so and

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.270 
place bottom edge in here like so and
ease<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.159> into<00:02:24.280> place<00:02:24.639> and<00:02:25.950> we're<00:02:26.950> just<00:02:27.069> going

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
ease it into place and we're just going

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.580 
ease it into place and we're just going
to<00:02:27.310> pull<00:02:27.519> that<00:02:27.730> port<00:02:28.689> protection<00:02:28.870> out<00:02:29.379> and

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
to pull that port protection out and

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.800 
to pull that port protection out and
then<00:02:30.459> we're<00:02:30.609> going<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.760> just<00:02:31.000> go<00:02:31.180> round<00:02:31.569> the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
then we're going to just go round the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.119 
then we're going to just go round the
rest<00:02:32.019> of<00:02:32.139> the<00:02:32.230> case<00:02:32.439> and<00:02:32.709> just<00:02:32.889> ease

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
rest of the case and just ease

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.429 
rest of the case and just ease
everything<00:02:33.639> else<00:02:33.819> in<00:02:34.290> including<00:02:35.290> that

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
everything else in including that

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.410 
everything else in including that
section<00:02:35.950> there<00:02:36.219> and<00:02:37.030> we're<00:02:37.150> just<00:02:37.209> going<00:02:37.299> to

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
section there and we're just going to

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.899 
section there and we're just going to
pull<00:02:37.719> this<00:02:37.900> port<00:02:38.260> protector<00:02:39.219> out<00:02:39.370> as<00:02:39.489> well<00:02:39.639> and

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
pull this port protector out as well and

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.000 
pull this port protector out as well and
then<00:02:40.419> pop<00:02:40.689> it<00:02:40.719> back<00:02:40.870> into<00:02:41.200> place<00:02:41.319> just<00:02:41.799> so<00:02:41.919> it

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
then pop it back into place just so it

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.629 
then pop it back into place just so it
fits<00:02:42.280> in<00:02:42.489> nicely<00:02:43.200> like<00:02:44.200> so<00:02:44.499> so<00:02:45.099> that<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.430> it

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
fits in nicely like so so that is it

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.809 
fits in nicely like so so that is it
fitted<00:02:46.209> into<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.719> case<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.169> this<00:02:48.069> is<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.519> lot

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
fitted into the case and this is a lot

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.520 
fitted into the case and this is a lot
of<00:02:48.939> protection<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:49.870> we've<00:02:50.019> got<00:02:50.109> the<00:02:50.230> hard

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
of protection so we've got the hard

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.819 
of protection so we've got the hard
plastic<00:02:51.340> back<00:02:52.060> we've<00:02:52.659> got<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.109> silicon

to take some knocks so some very very
good<00:02:58.090> protection<00:02:58.480> here<00:02:58.900> now<00:02:59.560> let's<00:02:59.709> have<00:02:59.799> a

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
good protection here now let's have a

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:01.679 
good protection here now let's have a
look<00:02:59.919> round<00:03:00.069> at<00:03:00.430> port<00:03:00.669> access<00:03:00.849> well<00:03:01.329> on<00:03:01.510> the

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:01.689 
look round at port access well on the

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:03.599 
look round at port access well on the
bottom<00:03:01.989> we've<00:03:02.620> got<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.769> little<00:03:02.919> cutout<00:03:03.219> you<00:03:03.489> can

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
bottom we've got a little cutout you can
