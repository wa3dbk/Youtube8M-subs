00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
there's some skeletons maybe kind of

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.070 
there's some skeletons maybe kind of
like<00:00:29.820> how<00:00:29.939> we<00:00:29.970> had<00:00:30.179> Michael<00:00:30.510> Myers<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.929> get<00:00:31.050> a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
like how we had Michael Myers you get a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.170 
like how we had Michael Myers you get a
care<00:00:31.380> package<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.279> become<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.579> skeleton

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
care package and you become a skeleton

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.990 
care package and you become a skeleton
there<00:00:33.719> was<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.840> gnome<00:00:34.079> right<00:00:34.320> there<00:00:34.670> but<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.700> can

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.420 
on red that's uh that seems Opie but but
yeah<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.870> other<00:00:48.989> map<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.469> mutiny<00:00:50.190> which

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
yeah the other map is mutiny which

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.189 
yeah the other map is mutiny which
should<00:00:50.640> switch<00:00:50.910> right<00:00:51.270> now<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.170> a

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
should switch right now and it is a

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.709 
should switch right now and it is a
pirate<00:00:52.620> ship<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.250> like<00:00:53.430> pirate<00:00:53.820> ships<00:00:54.120> looks

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
pirate ship I like pirate ships looks

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.049 
pirate ship I like pirate ships looks
pretty<00:00:55.260> awesome<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.129> he<00:00:56.699> throws<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
pretty awesome and he throws the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.930 
pretty awesome and he throws the
canister<00:00:57.539> grenade<00:00:57.930> thing<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.699> then<00:00:59.699> he<00:00:59.820> had

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
canister grenade thing and then he had

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.209 
canister grenade thing and then he had
to<00:01:00.120> stop<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.690> don't<00:01:01.020> know<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.469> pirate<00:01:02.190> ship

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
to stop I don't know it's a pirate ship

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.039 
to stop I don't know it's a pirate ship
and<00:01:02.640> another<00:01:02.879> pirate<00:01:03.180> ship<00:01:03.390> here<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.840> shoots

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
and another pirate ship here that shoots

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.260 
and another pirate ship here that shoots
rockets<00:01:04.320> onto<00:01:05.129> your<00:01:05.339> pirate<00:01:05.670> ship<00:01:05.850> pretty

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
rockets onto your pirate ship pretty

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.690 
rockets onto your pirate ship pretty
awesome<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.170> suppose<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.860> then<00:01:08.490> we<00:01:08.670> have

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
awesome I suppose and then we have

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.940 
awesome I suppose and then we have
ghosts<00:01:09.119> as<00:01:09.240> well<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.080> guess<00:01:10.619> there's<00:01:10.799> like

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
ghosts as well so I guess there's like

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.760 
ghosts as well so I guess there's like
two<00:01:11.159> things<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.640> here<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.240> get<00:01:12.770> from

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
two things in here that you can get from

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.770 
two things in here that you can get from
the<00:01:13.950> thing<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.280> then<00:01:14.369> favela<00:01:14.850> from<00:01:15.270> model<00:01:15.509> for

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
the thing and then favela from model for

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.499 
the thing and then favela from model for
to<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.619> one<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> better<00:01:17.880> maps<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.330> guess

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
to the one of the better maps I guess

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.480 
to the one of the better maps I guess
from<00:01:18.630> one<00:01:18.780> over<00:01:18.930> 42<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.830> mono<00:01:20.070> or<00:01:20.250> for<00:01:20.400> two

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
from one over 42 I like mono or for two

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.859 
from one over 42 I like mono or for two
maps<00:01:20.700> I'm<00:01:20.880> glad<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.119> they're<00:01:21.420> bringing<00:01:21.720> them

have<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.610> extinction<00:01:39.090> map<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.659> call<00:01:40.079> it

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
have the extinction map I call it

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.950 
have the extinction map I call it
awakening<00:01:40.650> it's<00:01:40.799> episode<00:01:41.159> 3<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:42.630> will<00:01:42.840> get

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
awakening it's episode 3 and we will get

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.359 
awakening it's episode 3 and we will get
to<00:01:43.110> learn<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.470> truth<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.829> says<00:01:44.009> something

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
to learn the truth it says something

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.830 
to learn the truth it says something
that<00:01:44.520> actually<00:01:44.670> I'm<00:01:45.119> not<00:01:45.270> caught<00:01:45.509> up<00:01:45.540> with

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
that actually I'm not caught up with

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.080 
that actually I'm not caught up with
extinction<00:01:46.229> mode<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.159> none<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.790> makes

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
extinction mode so none of this makes

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.389 
extinction mode so none of this makes
sense<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.540> me<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.590> kind<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.799> spoilers<00:01:50.250> if

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
sense to me so it's kind of spoilers if

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.800 
sense to me so it's kind of spoilers if
you<00:01:50.430> haven't<00:01:50.490> played<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.880> other<00:01:50.970> maps<00:01:51.210> so
