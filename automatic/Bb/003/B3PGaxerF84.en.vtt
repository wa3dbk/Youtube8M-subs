change much if anything the only thing I

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.670 
change much if anything the only thing I
would<00:02:10.489> change<00:02:10.519> is<00:02:11.060> possibly<00:02:11.989> leaning<00:02:12.440> back

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
would change is possibly leaning back

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.990 
would change is possibly leaning back
just<00:02:13.010> like<00:02:13.610> that

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
just like that

that<00:02:14.209> small<00:02:14.720> slight<00:02:15.290> bit<00:02:15.709> might<00:02:16.700> make<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.000> big

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.900 
that small slight bit might make a big
difference<00:02:17.750> because<00:02:18.680> if<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.220> am<00:02:19.459> looking<00:02:19.670> from

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
difference because if I am looking from

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.520 
difference because if I am looking from
too<00:02:20.120> far<00:02:20.330> or<00:02:20.629> too<00:02:20.660> down<00:02:20.959> low
