the other day I was messing around on

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.050 
the other day I was messing around on
the<00:00:04.580> overlocker

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 
the overlocker

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.550 
the overlocker
you<00:00:05.180> know<00:00:05.299> as<00:00:05.450> you<00:00:05.600> do<00:00:05.810> you<00:00:05.990> just<00:00:06.200> get<00:00:06.290> the<00:00:06.470> F

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:06.560 
you know as you do you just get the F

you know as you do you just get the F
overlocker<00:00:06.979> out<00:00:07.189> and<00:00:07.370> sort<00:00:07.520> of<00:00:07.549> mess<00:00:07.970> around

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:08.149 
overlocker out and sort of mess around

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.330 
overlocker out and sort of mess around
with<00:00:08.480> it<00:00:08.540> and<00:00:09.110> I<00:00:09.230> was<00:00:09.350> thinking<00:00:09.500> about<00:00:09.890> a

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
with it and I was thinking about a

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.870 
with it and I was thinking about a
spiral<00:00:10.970> log<00:00:11.180> cabin<00:00:11.600> that<00:00:11.630> I<00:00:11.870> had<00:00:12.080> done<00:00:12.320> on<00:00:12.880> the

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
spiral log cabin that I had done on the

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.590 
spiral log cabin that I had done on the
sewing<00:00:14.060> machine

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:14.600 
sewing machine

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.500 
sewing machine
I<00:00:14.830> considered<00:00:15.830> could<00:00:16.219> you<00:00:16.369> do<00:00:16.609> spiral<00:00:17.300> log

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
I considered could you do spiral log

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.770 
I considered could you do spiral log
cabin<00:00:17.960> on<00:00:18.140> the<00:00:18.340> overlocker<00:00:19.340> could<00:00:20.150> you<00:00:20.300> do<00:00:20.600> it

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:20.780 
cabin on the overlocker could you do it

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.800 
cabin on the overlocker could you do it
crazy<00:00:21.350> and<00:00:21.800> what<00:00:22.340> would<00:00:22.580> happen<00:00:22.880> if<00:00:23.330> I<00:00:23.630> think

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
crazy and what would happen if I think

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.320 
crazy and what would happen if I think
all<00:00:23.900> the<00:00:23.990> time<00:00:24.170> you<00:00:24.320> want<00:00:24.500> to<00:00:24.560> play<00:00:25.330> experiment

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
all the time you want to play experiment

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.000 
all the time you want to play experiment
and<00:00:26.780> you<00:00:26.869> can<00:00:27.020> experiment<00:00:27.619> don't<00:00:27.770> use<00:00:27.890> the

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
and you can experiment don't use the

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.040 
and you can experiment don't use the
very<00:00:28.160> best<00:00:28.220> fabrics<00:00:28.820> use<00:00:29.270> the<00:00:29.480> rubbish<00:00:29.780> mule

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
very best fabrics use the rubbish mule

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.740 
very best fabrics use the rubbish mule
stash<00:00:30.380> and<00:00:30.710> how<00:00:30.920> a<00:00:30.949> little<00:00:31.130> play<00:00:31.400> and<00:00:31.699> I<00:00:32.270> played

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
stash and how a little play and I played

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.950 
stash and how a little play and I played
around<00:00:32.899> with<00:00:33.649> two<00:00:34.039> colors<00:00:34.449> using<00:00:35.449> a<00:00:35.539> technique

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
around with two colors using a technique

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.020 
around with two colors using a technique
that<00:00:35.989> I<00:00:36.199> had<00:00:36.469> done<00:00:36.649> on<00:00:36.890> regular<00:00:37.429> log<00:00:37.609> cabin

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
that I had done on regular log cabin

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.910 
that I had done on regular log cabin
where<00:00:38.179> I<00:00:38.210> created<00:00:38.629> spiral<00:00:39.199> and<00:00:39.379> I<00:00:39.620> did<00:00:39.800> it

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
where I created spiral and I did it

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.189 
where I created spiral and I did it
round<00:00:40.159> a<00:00:40.280> crazy<00:00:40.670> center<00:00:41.149> and<00:00:41.420> I<00:00:41.539> chose<00:00:41.870> to<00:00:42.170> use

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
round a crazy center and I chose to use

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:43.209 
round a crazy center and I chose to use
the<00:00:42.620> overlocker

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
the overlocker

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:44.950 
the overlocker
because<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.640> overlocker<00:00:44.059> cuts<00:00:44.449> as<00:00:44.629> it<00:00:44.749> sews

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
because the overlocker cuts as it sews

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.349 
because the overlocker cuts as it sews
as<00:00:45.170> it<00:00:45.260> goes<00:00:45.469> and<00:00:45.679> it's<00:00:46.039> quick<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.519> one<00:00:47.239> of<00:00:47.300> the

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
as it goes and it's quick and one of the

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:48.910 
as it goes and it's quick and one of the
few<00:00:47.510> things<00:00:47.690> in<00:00:47.839> this<00:00:47.929> world<00:00:48.109> I<00:00:48.409> don't<00:00:48.440> like<00:00:48.800> to

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
few things in this world I don't like to

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.329 
few things in this world I don't like to
do<00:00:49.039> is<00:00:49.159> anything<00:00:49.609> slowly<00:00:49.999> so<00:00:50.960> this<00:00:51.260> is<00:00:51.499> spiral

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
do is anything slowly so this is spiral

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.450 
do is anything slowly so this is spiral
log-cabin<00:00:52.609> using<00:00:53.569> just<00:00:53.960> two<00:00:54.409> colors<00:00:54.620> now

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
log-cabin using just two colors now

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.799 
log-cabin using just two colors now
there's<00:00:55.670> no<00:00:55.760> reason<00:00:55.969> why<00:00:56.239> you<00:00:56.269> have<00:00:56.420> to<00:00:56.659> make

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
there's no reason why you have to make

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.779 
there's no reason why you have to make
such<00:00:57.049> a<00:00:57.079> big<00:00:57.319> block<00:00:57.620> you<00:00:58.069> could<00:00:58.249> always<00:00:58.460> take

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
such a big block you could always take

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.759 
such a big block you could always take
for<00:00:59.120> smaller<00:00:59.449> blocks<00:00:59.749> and<00:00:59.989> put<00:01:00.350> them<00:01:00.559> together

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
for smaller blocks and put them together

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.759 
for smaller blocks and put them together
so<00:01:01.760> this<00:01:01.879> is<00:01:01.969> two<00:01:02.179> colors<00:01:02.389> a<00:01:02.749> crazy<00:01:03.289> look

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
so this is two colors a crazy look

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.499 
so this is two colors a crazy look
haven't<00:01:04.190> done<00:01:04.519> on<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:04.970> overlocker

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
haven't done on the overlocker

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.459 
haven't done on the overlocker
you<00:01:06.229> could<00:01:06.619> take<00:01:07.189> it<00:01:07.369> further<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:07.939> I<00:01:08.869> extended

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:09.469 
you could take it further and I extended

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.560 
you could take it further and I extended
my<00:01:09.619> play<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.159> I<00:01:10.219> decided<00:01:10.610> to<00:01:10.789> see<00:01:10.939> could<00:01:11.329> I<00:01:11.509> do

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
my play and I decided to see could I do

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.219 
my play and I decided to see could I do
a<00:01:11.990> spiral<00:01:12.530> using<00:01:13.520> four<00:01:14.090> colors<00:01:14.119> of<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:14.750> spiral

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
a spiral using four colors of the spiral

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.590 
a spiral using four colors of the spiral
and<00:01:15.380> get<00:01:16.159> a<00:01:16.340> very<00:01:16.640> different<00:01:17.060> design<00:01:17.210> and

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
and get a very different design and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.330 
and get a very different design and
would<00:01:18.049> it<00:01:18.170> work<00:01:18.350> on<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.740> overlock<00:01:19.009> and<00:01:19.280> the

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
would it work on the overlock and the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.510 
would it work on the overlock and the
answer<00:01:19.700> is<00:01:19.820> yes<00:01:20.240> it<00:01:20.450> does<00:01:20.659> I<00:01:21.189> was<00:01:22.189> then<00:01:22.340> asked

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
answer is yes it does I was then asked

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.599 
answer is yes it does I was then asked
to<00:01:22.640> write<00:01:22.789> an<00:01:22.969> article<00:01:23.090> for<00:01:23.570> a<00:01:23.630> magazine<00:01:23.689> and

to write an article for a magazine and

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:27.609 
to write an article for a magazine and
the<00:01:25.609> magazine<00:01:25.640> required<00:01:26.509> me<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:26.869> do<00:01:27.109> things<00:01:27.320> in

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
the magazine required me to do things in

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.719 
the magazine required me to do things in
pink<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.159> I<00:01:28.609> don't<00:01:29.000> do<00:01:29.390> pink<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.950> I<00:01:30.979> decided<00:01:31.460> I

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
pink and I don't do pink so I decided I

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.840 
pink and I don't do pink so I decided I
would<00:01:31.759> use<00:01:32.090> my<00:01:32.500> newfound<00:01:33.500> way<00:01:34.009> of<00:01:34.310> doing<00:01:34.549> crazy

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
would use my newfound way of doing crazy

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.020 
would use my newfound way of doing crazy
