underneath the horizontal line they're

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.979 
underneath the horizontal line they're
just<00:00:36.149> two<00:00:37.460> arcs<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.640> either<00:00:38.820> side<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.450> then

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
just two arcs on either side and then

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.639 
just two arcs on either side and then
one<00:00:40.350> art<00:00:40.559> for<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.010> little<00:00:41.879> smile<00:00:42.530> next<00:00:43.530> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
to use the horizontal line to mark where

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.450 
to use the horizontal line to mark where
the<00:01:03.899> edge<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.320> veins<00:01:04.530> go<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.100> I'm<00:01:05.309> just

as you can probably tell there's really

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.100 
as you can probably tell there's really
very<00:01:34.979> little<00:01:35.369> difference<00:01:36.360> between<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.810> boy

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
very little difference between the boy

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.280 
very little difference between the boy

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.919 

yeah<00:01:51.369> it<00:01:51.490> looks<00:01:51.700> like<00:01:51.759> the<00:01:52.060> ponytail<00:01:52.570> in<00:01:52.810> the

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
yeah it looks like the ponytail in the

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.510 
yeah it looks like the ponytail in the
edge<00:01:53.109> of<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.320> heart<00:01:53.740> there<00:01:54.070> are<00:01:54.490> touching<00:01:55.149> so

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
edge of the heart there are touching so

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.679 
edge of the heart there are touching so
I'm<00:01:57.520> going<00:01:57.700> to<00:01:57.729> fix<00:01:57.939> that<00:01:58.149> later<00:01:58.359> when<00:01:58.659> I

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
I'm going to fix that later when I

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:12.880 
I'm going to fix that later when I
outline<00:01:59.229> everything

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.240 

when<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.460> draw<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.820> eyes<00:02:14.060> of<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.480> TV<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:15.230> want<00:02:16.190> to

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
when I draw the eyes of the TV I want to

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.880 
when I draw the eyes of the TV I want to
make<00:02:16.370> them<00:02:16.490> nice<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:16.730> bold<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:17.660> thick<00:02:17.930> so

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
make them nice and bold and thick so

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.920 
make them nice and bold and thick so
they<00:02:19.010> can<00:02:19.220> be<00:02:19.340> seen<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:23.120> also<00:02:23.450> they're<00:02:23.630> less

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
they can be seen and also they're less

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.600 
they can be seen and also they're less
likely<00:02:23.960> to<00:02:24.410> be<00:02:24.530> confused<00:02:25.040> with<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.310> mouth

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.710 

it's<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.700> first<00:02:28.940> thing<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.210> draws<00:02:29.570> your

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
it's the first thing that draws your

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:46.000 
it's the first thing that draws your
attention<00:02:29.810> are<00:02:30.230> those<00:02:30.380> dark<00:02:31.010> eyes

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.690 

not<00:02:47.010> lining<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.520> hair<00:02:47.790> bow<00:02:49.010> I'm<00:02:50.010> going<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.520> fix

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.120 
not lining the hair bow I'm going to fix
that<00:02:50.850> ponytail<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:52.050> bring<00:02:52.770> it<00:02:52.890> in<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.100> little

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
that ponytail and bring it in a little

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.700 
that ponytail and bring it in a little
bit<00:02:53.490> so<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.000> doesn't<00:02:54.300> touch<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.750> edge<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:55.350> the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
bit so it doesn't touch the edge of the

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:05.570
