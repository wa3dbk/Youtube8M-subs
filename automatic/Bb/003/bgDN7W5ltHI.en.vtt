Wow<00:02:51.960> okay<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:55.110> believe<00:02:55.740> this<00:02:55.890> is<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.220> GPS

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
Wow okay so I believe this is the GPS

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.680 
Wow okay so I believe this is the GPS
right<00:02:59.220> here<00:03:01.610> take<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.640> look<00:03:02.820> at<00:03:02.970> that<00:03:03.180> in<00:03:03.390> a

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
right here take a look at that in a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:11.270 
right here take a look at that in a
minute<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:06.650> that's<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:09.560> lifetime<00:03:10.560> map

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
minute and that's the lifetime map

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.350 
minute and that's the lifetime map
updates<00:03:11.550> so<00:03:12.180> pretty<00:03:12.420> cool<00:03:13.820> all<00:03:14.820> right<00:03:15.000> in<00:03:15.120> the

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
updates so pretty cool all right in the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.870 
updates so pretty cool all right in the
box<00:03:15.600> we<00:03:15.930> have<00:03:17.630> not<00:03:18.630> sure<00:03:18.870> what<00:03:19.020> that<00:03:19.050> is<00:03:19.880> okay

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
box we have not sure what that is okay

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.560 
box we have not sure what that is okay
but<00:03:21.060> we<00:03:21.209> have<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:21.920> that's<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.220> car<00:03:24.000> charger<00:03:24.300> I

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
but we have it that's the car charger I

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.960 
but we have it that's the car charger I
believe<00:03:24.959> yep<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.800> get<00:03:26.370> into<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.640> cigarette

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
believe yep I get into the cigarette

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.580 
believe yep I get into the cigarette
lighter<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.870> we<00:03:28.800> can<00:03:28.950> charge<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:33.230> car<00:03:34.230> mount

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
lighter and we can charge it car mount

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.070 
lighter and we can charge it car mount
and<00:03:35.070> I<00:03:35.520> believe<00:03:35.790> just<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.209> can<00:03:36.390> stick<00:03:36.660> that<00:03:36.840> on

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
and I believe just you can stick that on

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.760 
and I believe just you can stick that on
the<00:03:37.380> windshield<00:03:37.739> just<00:03:38.540> adds<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.840> better<00:03:40.290> grip<00:03:40.590> I

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
the windshield just adds a better grip I

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.580 
the windshield just adds a better grip I
guess<00:03:40.980> I'm<00:03:41.220> not<00:03:41.370> sure<00:03:41.400> but<00:03:42.200> that's<00:03:43.200> what<00:03:43.440> it's

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
guess I'm not sure but that's what it's

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:51.640 
guess I'm not sure but that's what it's
most<00:03:43.830> likely<00:03:43.920> used<00:03:44.370> for<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:45.360> a<00:03:46.320> USB<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:50.420> just

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
most likely used for and a USB and just

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.160 
most likely used for and a USB and just
instructions<00:03:55.220> so<00:03:56.220> pretty<00:03:56.670> cool<00:03:57.049> all<00:03:58.049> right

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
instructions so pretty cool all right

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.509 
instructions so pretty cool all right

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
let's take a look at the GPS itself has

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.720 
let's take a look at the GPS itself has
a<00:04:02.640> critical<00:04:03.239> looking<00:04:04.190> screen<00:04:05.190> protector<00:04:05.700> on
