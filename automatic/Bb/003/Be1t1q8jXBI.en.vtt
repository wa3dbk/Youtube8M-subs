this<00:00:18.360> is<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.890> the<00:00:19.890> base<00:00:20.100> here<00:00:20.460> it's<00:00:21.390> the

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:21.540 
this is the the base here it's the

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.929 
this is the the base here it's the
outside<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.080> base<00:00:22.640> insides<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
outside of the base insides on the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.410 
outside of the base insides on the
inside<00:00:24.320> go<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.560> door<00:00:25.770> right<00:00:26.250> there<00:00:26.420> hand
