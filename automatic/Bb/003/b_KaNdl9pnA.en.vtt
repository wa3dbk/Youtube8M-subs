00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.600
 there are very good guys how are we in 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.000
 a new video more for the channel that 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.040
 is on 6 and 18 we are a part of 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.590
 death that the truth I do not know what name 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.160
 I'm going to put in but we start to see that 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.920
 we are here is the game 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.690
 death is called assault on the house of 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.690
 rajoy I do not know why rajoy 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:31.130
 but I do not know why it's called here 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:34.280
 the assault on the rajoy prison does not 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.559
 They are still in rajoy be an uncle who killed me 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.260
 good writer this is a subscriber 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.170
 I always play well so you have to have 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.760
 quite careful with that subscriber already 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.860
 I already know him because it's a bit of 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.860
 my terror that 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.710
 in the head 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:01.460
 how terrible you are, there will be 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.780
 deaths I put five minutes 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.070
 because if I put them to ten then it's going to 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.720
 delay a lot 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.770
 are all contracts since I like 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.880
 this live 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.329
 the lottery to kill was 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.420
 stalking and behind tomasich stein by 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:19.979
 back well we are four currently in 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.649
 this game I do not want to get many people 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.090
 because I see that it sounds is a very 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:30.479
 small so he would take his dead crystal 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:34.829
 I read that gives me comfort but you 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:38.330
 also where are you going to see 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.180
 another one here carefully pointed 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.090
 where you pointed that is what in 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.050
 serious is that this is from bad to worse 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.050
 it's there we have it 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.680
 fuck 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.830
 the chosen 30 thousand bullets 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.250
 and just die what madness seriously what 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.900
 madness every time I'm more surprised 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.430
 fourth because that death since not after 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.280
 casting to have other than in others 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.280
 It is back behind I tell you is not 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.860
 my connection is bad it is was 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:18.660
 because I stick to 30 bullets and Cuti 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.950
 terrible death has me deserved for 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.350
 stupid because you want to go up there is 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:29.810
 changing changing changing your 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.810

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:40.189

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:44.849
 well in front and another 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:46.829
 back not good we are good pointers 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.299
 I'm tied with the subscriber that's 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.159
 he really knows how to play a lot, so there's 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:54.650
 have to be quite careful that there 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:57.329
 one that that from behind again the same 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.680
 from behind as he likes to play 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.260
 to people from behind seriously is 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.680
 incredible, exactly two minutes remain 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.550
 so we have to put all our part 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:13.790

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.790

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.940

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:43.250

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.250
 I killed him once 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.709
 how was it that we kill ourselves good I'm a 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.420
 two points of the first one that is always 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.980
 when they play the games to death 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:01.000
 every time he wins me it's crazy 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:06.280
 that's fine there was one I'm already at a 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:10.739

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:36.580

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:39.310
 to the head we are out perfect 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.250

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.449
