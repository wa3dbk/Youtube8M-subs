you

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.560 

to<00:00:11.980> play<00:00:12.160> the<00:00:12.309> metal<00:00:12.519> start<00:00:12.970> with<00:00:13.090> an<00:00:13.210> e<00:00:13.330> power

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.570 
to play the metal start with an e power

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.830 
to play the metal start with an e power
chord<00:00:15.360> we<00:00:16.360> go

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.450 

one<00:00:19.770> more<00:00:19.890> time

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.279 

off<00:00:23.210> on<00:00:23.390> the<00:00:23.509> third<00:00:23.660> fret<00:00:23.929> of<00:00:23.990> the<00:00:24.109> low<00:00:24.169> E

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
off on the third fret of the low E

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.220 
off on the third fret of the low E
string

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
string

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.560 
string
and<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:27.370> pace<00:00:27.520> going<00:00:27.790> down<00:00:28.090> down<00:00:28.390> up<00:00:28.420> down

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
and the pace going down down up down

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.880 
and the pace going down down up down
down<00:00:30.900> then<00:00:31.900> we're<00:00:32.110> gonna<00:00:32.200> do<00:00:32.380> some<00:00:32.410> pull<00:00:32.710> offs

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
down then we're gonna do some pull offs

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.310 
down then we're gonna do some pull offs
on<00:00:33.040> the<00:00:33.130> a<00:00:33.160> string<00:00:33.520> here<00:00:33.730> third<00:00:34.090> fret<00:00:34.420> three<00:00:35.170> to

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
on the a string here third fret three to

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.470 
on the a string here third fret three to
zero

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.700 

so<00:00:37.750> three<00:00:38.050> to<00:00:38.199> zero<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.969> then<00:00:40.149> to<00:00:40.329> zero<00:00:40.710> and

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
so three to zero and then to zero and

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.080 
so three to zero and then to zero and
then<00:00:42.010> when<00:00:42.100> I<00:00:42.129> go<00:00:42.309> to<00:00:42.370> three<00:00:43.149> to<00:00:43.480> zero

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
then when I go to three to zero

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.580 
then when I go to three to zero
and<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.960> three<00:00:46.230> two<00:00:46.380> zero<00:00:46.410> two<00:00:47.360> zero<00:00:48.360> two<00:00:49.140> three

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
and so three two zero two zero two three

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:59.870 
and so three two zero two zero two three
to<00:00:50.160> zero<00:00:51.080> so<00:00:52.080> now<00:00:52.320> we<00:00:52.380> have

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.930 

now<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.330> second<00:01:00.690> time<00:01:00.810> we're<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.020> go

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:14.090 

so<00:01:04.940> that<00:01:05.059> would<00:01:05.180> be<00:01:05.300> three<00:01:05.630> two<00:01:06.020> zero<00:01:06.050> two

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.580 

third<00:01:15.030> time<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.570> play<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.750> first<00:01:16.380> rep

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
third time we just play the first rep

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.170 
third time we just play the first rep
again

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.090 

next<00:01:20.180> we<00:01:20.270> jump<00:01:20.510> into<00:01:20.659> an<00:01:20.960> F<00:01:21.200> power<00:01:21.470> chord<00:01:21.770> first

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
next we jump into an F power chord first

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.179 
next we jump into an F power chord first
fret<00:01:22.340> of<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:22.490> e-string<00:01:23.110> two<00:01:24.110> of<00:01:24.290> those<00:01:24.500> when<00:01:25.100> I

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
fret of the e-string two of those when I

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:26.590 
fret of the e-string two of those when I
use<00:01:25.340> my<00:01:25.369> ring<00:01:25.640> finger<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:26.060> slide<00:01:26.180> from<00:01:26.509> the

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
use my ring finger to slide from the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.280 
use my ring finger to slide from the
third<00:01:26.869> fret<00:01:27.140> of<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.409> D<00:01:27.710> to<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:27.979> fifth<00:01:28.190> fret

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
third fret of the D to the fifth fret

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.480 
third fret of the D to the fifth fret
then<00:01:30.290> right<00:01:30.470> away<00:01:30.680> do<00:01:30.860> a<00:01:30.890> pull<00:01:31.130> off<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:31.460> the

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
then right away do a pull off to the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.570 
then right away do a pull off to the
third<00:01:31.700> fret<00:01:32.290> and<00:01:33.290> then<00:01:33.619> third<00:01:33.860> fret<00:01:34.100> slides<00:01:34.399> to

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
third fret and then third fret slides to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.990 
third fret and then third fret slides to
the<00:01:34.610> second<00:01:34.970> fret

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
the second fret

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.790 
the second fret
then<00:01:37.930> we<00:01:38.110> are<00:01:38.230> I<00:01:38.260> do<00:01:38.500> a<00:01:38.650> pull-up

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.570 

and<00:01:41.920> it<00:01:42.850> would<00:01:42.970> be<00:01:43.120> three

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
and it would be three

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.450 
and it would be three
and<00:01:45.670> five<00:01:46.390> three<00:01:46.690> two<00:01:46.900> three<00:01:47.650> two<00:01:47.740> zero

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.100 

zero<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.600> five<00:01:52.260> three<00:01:52.950> two<00:01:53.250> three<00:01:54.150> two<00:01:54.570> zero

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
zero so five three two three two zero

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.010 
zero so five three two three two zero
two<00:01:55.830> zero<00:01:56.460> it's<00:01:56.940> all<00:01:57.090> pull<00:01:57.299> offs<00:01:57.510> and<00:01:57.659> slides

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.550 

after<00:02:02.799> that

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.470 

we<00:02:07.280> do<00:02:07.430> a<00:02:07.460> two<00:02:07.790> three<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:08.509> zero

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480 
we do a two three to zero

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:18.280 
we do a two three to zero
so<00:02:11.480> now<00:02:11.629> we<00:02:11.690> have

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.509 

now<00:02:19.290> we<00:02:19.349> start<00:02:19.799> again<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.159> I'll<00:02:20.219> put<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.459> all

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
now we start again so I'll put it all

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.670 
now we start again so I'll put it all
together
