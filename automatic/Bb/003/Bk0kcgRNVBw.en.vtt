00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
exposed to other diseases people that

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.230 
exposed to other diseases people that
keep<00:00:25.710> their<00:00:25.920> cats<00:00:26.160> inside<00:00:26.730> like<00:00:27.029> you've

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
keep their cats inside like you've

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.939 
keep their cats inside like you've
recommended<00:00:27.869> they're<00:00:28.289> like<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.590> said<00:00:28.800> you're

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
recommended they're like you said you're

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.759 
recommended they're like you said you're
going<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.900> eliminate<00:00:30.900> some<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.320> vaccines

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
going to eliminate some of the vaccines

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.310 
going to eliminate some of the vaccines
that<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:32.070> don't<00:00:32.250> need<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.550> give<00:00:32.700> all<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.000> time

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
that we don't need to give all the time

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.959 
that we don't need to give all the time
other<00:00:34.320> vaccines<00:00:34.860> are<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.190> important<00:00:35.700> because

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
other vaccines are so important because

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.119 
other vaccines are so important because
they<00:00:36.420> carry<00:00:37.050> human<00:00:37.410> health<00:00:37.590> hazards<00:00:37.980> with

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
they carry human health hazards with

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.290 
they carry human health hazards with
them<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.399> they're<00:00:38.579> mandatory<00:00:38.879> whether

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
them that they're mandatory whether

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.910 
them that they're mandatory whether
they're<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> house<00:00:39.899> or<00:00:40.140> not<00:00:40.260> other

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
they're in the house or not other

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.479 
they're in the house or not other
vaccines<00:00:41.930> we<00:00:42.930> give<00:00:43.110> them<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:43.950> cats<00:00:44.309> and

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
vaccines we give them to the cats and

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.190 
vaccines we give them to the cats and
they're<00:00:44.850> covering<00:00:45.450> them<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> lethal

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
they're covering them for a lethal

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.130 
they're covering them for a lethal
disease<00:00:46.469> if<00:00:47.010> they<00:00:47.160> get<00:00:47.450> feline<00:00:48.450> AIDS<00:00:48.690> or

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
disease if they get feline AIDS or

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.619 
disease if they get feline AIDS or
feeling<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.280> leukemia<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:50.910> they<00:00:51.030> die<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.480> it

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
feeling the leukemia and they die of it

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.180 
feeling the leukemia and they die of it
and<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.320> that's<00:00:52.440> why<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.800> think<00:00:53.010> those<00:00:53.160> are

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and so that's why we think those are

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.650 
and so that's why we think those are
vaccines<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.940> really<00:00:54.180> shouldn't<00:00:54.360> be<00:00:54.480> done

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
vaccines that really shouldn't be done

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.430 
vaccines that really shouldn't be done
on<00:00:54.840> all<00:00:54.989> cats<00:00:55.699> so<00:00:56.699> let's<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:57.899> start<00:00:58.109> out<00:00:58.289> and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
on all cats so let's just start out and

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.689 
on all cats so let's just start out and
go<00:00:58.530> through<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> different<00:00:59.129> ones<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.489> we're

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
go through the different ones that we're

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.330 
go through the different ones that we're
gonna<00:00:59.789> do<00:00:59.969> today<00:01:00.170> we<00:01:01.170> have<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> what<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.100> call<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
gonna do today we have a what we call a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.130 
gonna do today we have a what we call a
distemper<00:01:02.760> shot<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.480> covers<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.019> upper

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
distemper shot and that covers the upper

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.670 
distemper shot and that covers the upper
respiratory<00:01:04.790> as<00:01:05.790> well<00:01:06.450> as<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.960> couple<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.470> other

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
respiratory as well as a couple of other

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.160 
respiratory as well as a couple of other
common<00:01:08.369> diseases<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.270> all<00:01:09.450> cats<00:01:09.750> need<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.080> be

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
common diseases that all cats need to be

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.859 
common diseases that all cats need to be
protected<00:01:10.710> from<00:01:11.119> there<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.510> distemper

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
protected from there the distemper

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.740 
protected from there the distemper
actually<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.710> part<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.750> prevents

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
actually is part of it that prevents

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.300 
actually is part of it that prevents
them<00:01:15.869> from<00:01:15.930> getting<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.590> distemper'd

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
them from getting this distemper'd

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.510 
them from getting this distemper'd
problem<00:01:17.909> where<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.210> can't<00:01:18.420> get<00:01:18.600> panleukopenia

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
problem where it can't get panleukopenia

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.190 
problem where it can't get panleukopenia
and<00:01:20.520> leukopenia<00:01:20.939> simply<00:01:21.390> means<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.780> because

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
and leukopenia simply means it because

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.539 
and leukopenia simply means it because
they<00:01:22.350> get<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.650> virus<00:01:23.070> all<00:01:23.250> their<00:01:23.400> weight

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
they get this virus all their weight

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.640 
they get this virus all their weight
cells<00:01:23.820> die<00:01:24.090> out<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.869> they<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.170> die<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.530> that

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
cells die out and they can die of that

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.130 
cells die out and they can die of that
so<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.040> very<00:01:26.220> very<00:01:26.430> lethal<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.420> cats<00:01:27.659> and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
so it's very very lethal to cats and

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.270 
so it's very very lethal to cats and
it's<00:01:28.439> going<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.650> be<00:01:28.710> one<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:28.979> ones<00:01:29.100> we

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
it's going to be one of the ones we

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.910 
it's going to be one of the ones we
cover<00:01:29.520> today<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:31.290> other<00:01:31.439> thing<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.710> we

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
cover today the other thing that we

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.300 
cover today the other thing that we
wanted<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.280> do<00:01:32.400> today<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> distemper<00:01:33.689> shot

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
wanted to do today is a distemper shot

if your cat gets it they die of it and
so<00:01:44.939> we<00:01:45.329> want<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.600> get<00:01:45.689> your<00:01:45.869> cat<00:01:46.020> started<00:01:46.439> on

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
so we want to get your cat started on

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.679 
so we want to get your cat started on
this<00:01:46.680> vaccine<00:01:47.399> right<00:01:47.610> away<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.119> prevent<00:01:48.299> your

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
this vaccine right away to prevent your

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.719 
this vaccine right away to prevent your
cat<00:01:48.840> from<00:01:49.049> getting<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:50.100> transmitted<00:01:50.700> by

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
cat from getting it it's transmitted by

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.880 
cat from getting it it's transmitted by
another<00:01:51.060> cat<00:01:51.360> biting<00:01:51.810> your<00:01:51.990> cat<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.710> so

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
another cat biting your cat and so

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.580 
another cat biting your cat and so
you've<00:01:53.040> limited<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:54.509> cat's<00:01:54.750> exposure<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.500> it

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
you've limited the cat's exposure to it

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.469 
you've limited the cat's exposure to it
by<00:01:55.680> keeping<00:01:55.979> them<00:01:56.070> inside<00:01:56.219> but<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:57.149> think<00:01:57.329> that

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
by keeping them inside but we think that

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.920 
by keeping them inside but we think that
a<00:01:57.600> marauder<00:01:58.500> cat<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.979> break-in<00:01:59.369> or

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
a marauder cat that break-in or

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.630 
a marauder cat that break-in or
brainstorm<00:02:00.650> your<00:02:00.800> kite<00:02:00.980> to<00:02:01.130> get<00:02:01.280> out<00:02:01.430> in<00:02:01.550> you

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
brainstorm your kite to get out in you

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.670 
brainstorm your kite to get out in you
know<00:02:01.670> Noah<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:02.600> get<00:02:02.840> bitten<00:02:03.050> by<00:02:03.140> another<00:02:03.230> cat

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
know Noah and get bitten by another cat

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.740 
know Noah and get bitten by another cat
we<00:02:03.920> this<00:02:04.040> way<00:02:04.220> they're<00:02:04.400> always<00:02:04.580> protected<00:02:05.240> if

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
we this way they're always protected if

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.330 
we this way they're always protected if
it<00:02:05.930> was<00:02:06.080> a<00:02:06.110> virus<00:02:06.320> that<00:02:06.560> just<00:02:06.860> made<00:02:06.980> you<00:02:07.100> cats

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
it was a virus that just made you cats

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.320 
it was a virus that just made you cats
sick<00:02:07.550> for<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.730> little<00:02:07.910> while

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
sick for a little while

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.940 
sick for a little while
and<00:02:08.660> it<00:02:08.810> had<00:02:08.960> to<00:02:09.050> be<00:02:09.170> transmitted<00:02:09.649> by<00:02:09.710> another

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
and it had to be transmitted by another

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.320 
and it had to be transmitted by another
cat<00:02:10.160> we<00:02:10.280> may<00:02:10.399> not<00:02:10.580> do<00:02:10.759> it<00:02:10.880> but<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.120> is<00:02:11.180> a

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
cat we may not do it but this is a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.060 
cat we may not do it but this is a
lethal<00:02:11.570> virus<00:02:12.020> that<00:02:12.200> could<00:02:12.320> kill<00:02:12.530> your<00:02:12.620> cat<00:02:12.860> so

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
lethal virus that could kill your cat so

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.670 
lethal virus that could kill your cat so
we<00:02:13.100> think<00:02:13.310> it's<00:02:13.490> important<00:02:14.380> later<00:02:15.380> we're

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
we think it's important later we're

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.990 
we think it's important later we're
going<00:02:15.770> to<00:02:15.830> do<00:02:15.950> some<00:02:16.100> other<00:02:16.250> vaccines<00:02:16.760> when<00:02:16.940> we

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
going to do some other vaccines when we

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.270 
going to do some other vaccines when we
talk<00:02:17.210> about<00:02:17.540> other<00:02:17.750> vaccines<00:02:18.710> at<00:02:18.860> our<00:02:18.980> next

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
talk about other vaccines at our next

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.800 
talk about other vaccines at our next
visit<00:02:19.640> we're<00:02:19.820> going<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.030> want<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.270> also<00:02:20.630> update

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
visit we're going to want to also update

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.750 
visit we're going to want to also update
your<00:02:21.230> cab<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.680> get<00:02:21.800> him<00:02:21.920> started<00:02:22.100> on<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.340> rabies

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
your cab and get him started on a rabies

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.620 
your cab and get him started on a rabies
program<00:02:23.620> rabies<00:02:24.620> is<00:02:24.800> another<00:02:25.210> virus<00:02:26.210> that<00:02:26.480> can

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
program rabies is another virus that can

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.870 
program rabies is another virus that can
be<00:02:26.690> transmitted<00:02:27.380> from<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.950> wildlife<00:02:28.430> into

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
be transmitted from the wildlife into

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.720 
be transmitted from the wildlife into
our<00:02:29.030> cats<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.690> dogs<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.200> it's<00:02:31.100> lethal<00:02:31.520> for

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
our cats and dogs and it's lethal for

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.970 
our cats and dogs and it's lethal for
humans<00:02:31.760> as<00:02:32.180> well<00:02:32.360> as<00:02:32.480> cats<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:33.620> again<00:02:33.830> we

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
humans as well as cats and so again we

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.860 
humans as well as cats and so again we
think<00:02:34.190> all<00:02:34.370> cats<00:02:34.670> should<00:02:34.820> be<00:02:35.060> vaccinated<00:02:35.240> for

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
think all cats should be vaccinated for

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.230 
think all cats should be vaccinated for
rabies<00:02:35.930> because<00:02:36.740> if<00:02:37.220> you<00:02:37.370> can't<00:02:37.610> were<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.120> get

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
rabies because if you can't were to get

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.240 
rabies because if you can't were to get
rabies<00:02:38.630> chasing<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.260> bat<00:02:39.440> or<00:02:39.709> something<00:02:39.770> like

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
rabies chasing a bat or something like

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.160 
rabies chasing a bat or something like
that<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:41.060> bite<00:02:41.240> you<00:02:41.480> then<00:02:41.720> you'd<00:02:41.900> have<00:02:42.050> to

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
that and to bite you then you'd have to

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.320 
that and to bite you then you'd have to
get<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.380> shots<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.770> everything<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:43.400> it's

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
get the shots and everything so it's

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.900 
get the shots and everything so it's
it's<00:02:44.660> a<00:02:44.870> lethal<00:02:45.350> another<00:02:45.890> lethal<00:02:46.160> disease<00:02:46.700> but

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
it's a lethal another lethal disease but

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.030 
it's a lethal another lethal disease but
also<00:02:47.090> has<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:47.390> human<00:02:47.840> health<00:02:48.020> aspect<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.800> it<00:02:48.830> too

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
also has a human health aspect to it too

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.000 
also has a human health aspect to it too
because<00:02:49.160> we<00:02:49.370> can<00:02:49.520> get<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.790> so<00:02:50.680> those<00:02:51.680> are<00:02:51.920> the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
because we can get it so those are the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.890 
because we can get it so those are the
basic<00:02:52.459> vaccines<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:53.150> we<00:02:53.300> think<00:02:53.540> that<00:02:53.720> all

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
basic vaccines that we think that all

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.810 
basic vaccines that we think that all
cats<00:02:54.170> should<00:02:54.350> have<00:02:54.709> there<00:02:55.370> are<00:02:55.430> a<00:02:55.459> few<00:02:55.610> other

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
cats should have there are a few other

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.280 
cats should have there are a few other
vaccines<00:02:56.300> so<00:02:56.510> if<00:02:56.570> you<00:02:56.690> start<00:02:56.930> letting<00:02:57.110> your

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
vaccines so if you start letting your

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.960 
vaccines so if you start letting your
cat<00:02:57.500> out<00:02:57.709> then<00:02:57.980> we<00:02:58.070> should<00:02:58.250> talk<00:02:58.400> about<00:02:58.730> those

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
cat out then we should talk about those

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.970 
cat out then we should talk about those
but<00:02:59.810> since<00:03:00.050> your<00:03:00.170> cat's<00:03:00.350> going<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.590> be<00:03:00.680> inside

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
but since your cat's going to be inside

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.740 
but since your cat's going to be inside
as<00:03:01.250> we<00:03:01.370> recommend<00:03:01.790> with<00:03:01.940> most<00:03:02.180> we<00:03:02.390> won't<00:03:02.570> deal

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
as we recommend with most we won't deal
