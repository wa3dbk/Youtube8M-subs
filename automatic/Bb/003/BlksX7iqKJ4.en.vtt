00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
the whole strap came undone very very

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.650 
the whole strap came undone very very
easily<00:00:43.079> as<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.649> see<00:00:44.270> so<00:00:45.270> what<00:00:45.420> I've<00:00:45.510> done

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
is today I was doing a bit of testing

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.560 
is today I was doing a bit of testing
I'm<00:00:49.140> just<00:00:49.350> personally<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> medium

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
I'm just personally this is the medium

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.930 
I'm just personally this is the medium
to<00:00:51.719> large<00:00:51.960> strap<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.370> I'm<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.550> going<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.760> put

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
to large strap so I'm just going to put

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.060 
to large strap so I'm just going to put
that<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.530> I'm<00:00:55.530> gonna<00:00:55.680> show<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that on I'm gonna show you the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.680 
that on I'm gonna show you the
difference<00:00:56.579> in<00:01:00.410> actually<00:01:01.410> how<00:01:02.180> more<00:01:03.180> secure

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
difference in actually how more secure

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.840 
difference in actually how more secure
it<00:01:03.809> will<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:04.110> when<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.830> have<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.339> strap<00:01:05.640> on

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
it will be when you have this strap on

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.109 
it will be when you have this strap on
so<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> same<00:01:07.260> fit<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:08.280> fits<00:01:08.520> exactly<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
so it's the same fit it fits exactly the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.240 
so it's the same fit it fits exactly the
same<00:01:09.680> you<00:01:10.680> know<00:01:11.270> to<00:01:12.270> money<00:01:12.510> that's<00:01:12.720> there

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
same you know to money that's there

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.310 
same you know to money that's there
there<00:01:14.250> we<00:01:14.369> go<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.360> exactly<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> same<00:01:15.960> fit

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
there we go so it's exactly the same fit

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.530 
there we go so it's exactly the same fit
it's<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:16.890> tight<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.490> my<00:01:17.580> wrist<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.150> moving

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
around as it was it stays connected

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.700 
around as it was it stays connected
there's<00:01:21.150> something<00:01:21.479> locked<00:01:21.960> itself<00:01:22.259> because

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
there's something locked itself because

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.640 
there's something locked itself because
I<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:23.880> took<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.119> off<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.290> time

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.899 
small strap like I was and Iran probably
I'd<00:02:02.909> say<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.240> first<00:02:03.420> three<00:02:03.780> holes<00:02:04.880> have<00:02:05.880> a

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
I'd say the first three holes have a

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.630 
I'd say the first three holes have a
think<00:02:06.240> about<00:02:06.950> putting<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.129> putting<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.489> large

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
think about putting it putting a large

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.279 
think about putting it putting a large
strap<00:02:08.970> on<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.330> medium/large<00:02:09.780> because<00:02:10.170> it

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
strap on the medium/large because it

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.830 
strap on the medium/large because it
does<00:02:10.560> make<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> bit<00:02:11.849> more<00:02:12.060> secure<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.629> would

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
does make it a bit more secure I would

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.340 
does make it a bit more secure I would
imagine<00:02:12.989> if

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
imagine if

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.540 
imagine if
was<00:02:13.530> trying<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.770> take<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.040> off<00:02:14.220> your<00:02:14.370> wrist

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
was trying to take this off your wrist

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.740 
was trying to take this off your wrist
you<00:02:15.090> know<00:02:15.150> as<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.300> pickpocket<00:02:17.510> that<00:02:18.510> would<00:02:18.630> be

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
you know as a pickpocket that would be

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.900 
you know as a pickpocket that would be
more<00:02:19.440> secure<00:02:19.650> as<00:02:19.920> well<00:02:20.070> be<00:02:20.280> harder<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.610> get<00:02:20.850> off

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
more secure as well be harder to get off

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.390 
more secure as well be harder to get off
certainly<00:02:21.510> inaudible<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.920> came<00:02:23.100> off<00:02:23.220> way

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
certainly inaudible that came off way

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.730 
certainly inaudible that came off way
too<00:02:23.430> easy<00:02:23.760> for<00:02:23.910> me<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.260> this<00:02:25.260> I'm<00:02:25.620> probably

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
too easy for me so this I'm probably

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.690 
too easy for me so this I'm probably
going<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.070> swap<00:02:26.550> for<00:02:27.590> another<00:02:28.590> color<00:02:28.830> or

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
going to swap for another color or

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.520 
going to swap for another color or
another<00:02:30.030> size<00:02:30.510> black<00:02:31.970> bond<00:02:33.260> just<00:02:34.260> want<00:02:34.440> to

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
another size black bond just want to

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.410 
another size black bond just want to
