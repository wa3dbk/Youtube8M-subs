we've got a another quad truck on
demonstration<00:00:06.410> today<00:00:07.410> in<00:00:07.740> tomorrow<00:00:08.540> we're

demonstration today in tomorrow we're

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.110 
demonstration today in tomorrow we're
putting<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.370> sub<00:00:11.370> soiler<00:00:11.580> with<00:00:11.820> it

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
putting a sub soiler with it

this<00:00:12.660> field<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.080> one<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.440> fields<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:13.740> we

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
this field is one of the fields that we

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.039 
this field is one of the fields that we
ploughed<00:00:14.190> very<00:00:14.429> early<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:15.269> was<00:00:15.420> barley<00:00:15.870> and

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
ploughed very early it was barley and

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.179 
ploughed very early it was barley and
plowed<00:00:16.590> very<00:00:17.570> so<00:00:18.570> Polly<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.859> field<00:00:20.070> is

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
plowed very so Polly and this field is

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.040 
plowed very so Polly and this field is
quite<00:00:20.310> compact<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.000> intended<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.570> stops

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
quite compact so it intended to stops

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.470 
quite compact so it intended to stops
all<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.350> field<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:23.060> we're<00:00:24.060> doing<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.330> after

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
all this field but we're doing it after

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.480 
all this field but we're doing it after
we<00:00:24.689> plowed<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.170> but<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.070> see<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.340> this

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
we plowed it but you can see on this

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.959 
we plowed it but you can see on this
soil<00:00:26.699> how<00:00:27.449> hard<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.349> gets<00:00:28.590> very<00:00:28.740> quickly<00:00:31.969> so

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
soil how hard it gets very quickly so

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.819 
soil how hard it gets very quickly so
I'm<00:00:33.420> sort<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.809> quite<00:00:34.020> glad<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.350> cultivated

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
I'm sort of quite glad we cultivated

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.290 
I'm sort of quite glad we cultivated
it's<00:00:35.070> looking<00:00:35.340> very<00:00:35.370> rough<00:00:35.760> but<00:00:35.940> it's<00:00:36.059> coming

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
it's looking very rough but it's coming

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.420 
it's looking very rough but it's coming
for<00:00:36.450> beans<00:00:36.660> which<00:00:36.899> we<00:00:37.050> won't<00:00:37.230> drill<00:00:38.040> until<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
for beans which we won't drill until the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.670 
for beans which we won't drill until the
autumn<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.750> fine<00:00:43.079> if<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:43.350> rough<00:00:43.559> you

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
autumn so it's fine if it's rough you

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.869 
autumn so it's fine if it's rough you
should<00:00:43.860> get<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> lot<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.309> weather<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.760> before

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
should get a lot of weather on it before

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:54.550 
should get a lot of weather on it before
we<00:00:45.149> drill<00:00:45.329> it

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.210 

looks<00:00:55.100> like<00:00:55.250> it's<00:00:55.400> a<00:00:55.520> 500-horsepower<00:00:56.150> machine

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
looks like it's a 500-horsepower machine

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.240 
looks like it's a 500-horsepower machine
with<00:00:58.220> the<00:00:58.340> 500<00:00:58.970> lucky<00:00:59.180> gets<00:00:59.480> there<00:01:00.190> seems<00:01:01.190> to

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
with the 500 lucky gets there seems to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.010 
with the 500 lucky gets there seems to
be<00:01:01.340> you<00:01:01.640> see<00:01:01.880> that<00:01:02.060> it's<00:01:02.180> lifting<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:02.780> ground

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
be you see that it's lifting the ground

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.660 
be you see that it's lifting the ground
well<00:01:03.260> and<00:01:05.500> it's<00:01:06.500> also<00:01:06.680> just<00:01:06.860> helping<00:01:07.400> to<00:01:07.520> break

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
well and it's also just helping to break

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.910 
well and it's also just helping to break
down<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.060> clothes<00:01:08.270> just<00:01:08.480> a<00:01:08.570> little<00:01:08.810> bit<00:01:08.930> but

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
down the clothes just a little bit but

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.240 
down the clothes just a little bit but
as<00:01:10.010> I<00:01:10.130> say<00:01:10.340> I<00:01:10.580> quite<00:01:10.940> want<00:01:11.120> this<00:01:11.950> soul<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.130> be

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
as I say I quite want this soul to be

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.400 
as I say I quite want this soul to be
left<00:01:13.490> quite<00:01:13.730> rough<00:01:14.000> because<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:15.200> beans

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
left quite rough because the beans

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.220 
left quite rough because the beans
aren't<00:01:15.710> going<00:01:15.860> to<00:01:15.920> be<00:01:16.010> drilled<00:01:16.280> until<00:01:17.230> just

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
aren't going to be drilled until just

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.770 
aren't going to be drilled until just
after<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.560> 20th<00:01:18.920> of<00:01:18.980> October<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:20.570> we've

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
after the 20th of October and so we've

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.960 
after the 20th of October and so we've
got<00:01:20.900> plenty<00:01:21.140> of<00:01:21.290> time<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.650> get<00:01:21.770> some<00:01:21.980> rain<00:01:22.190> on

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
got plenty of time to get some rain on

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:30.530 
got plenty of time to get some rain on
that<00:01:23.300> weather<00:01:23.990> down<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.350> clods<00:01:24.590> a<00:01:24.710> bit

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.420 

this<00:01:31.080> is<00:01:31.290> inside<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:33.230> demonstrator<00:01:34.430> quadrat

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
this is inside the demonstrator quadrat

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.770 
this is inside the demonstrator quadrat
we<00:01:35.460> got<00:01:35.790> cases<00:01:36.240> 500

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.200 

it's

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
it's

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.620 
it's
to<00:01:41.870> dissimilar<00:01:42.409> to<00:01:42.729> our<00:01:43.729> existing<00:01:44.240> one

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
to dissimilar to our existing one

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.540 
to dissimilar to our existing one
whether<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.170> dip<00:01:46.380> things<00:01:46.620> like<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:47.340> got<00:01:47.520> a

SodaStream<00:01:48.000> we've<00:01:48.300> got<00:01:48.479> our<00:01:48.570> own<00:01:48.720> rzk<00:01:49.260> system

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
SodaStream we've got our own rzk system

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.230 
SodaStream we've got our own rzk system
with<00:01:49.710> our<00:01:49.920> own<00:01:50.100> screen<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.640> then<00:01:50.760> this<00:01:50.940> is<00:01:51.090> one

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
with our own screen and then this is one

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.080 
with our own screen and then this is one
that<00:01:51.390> comes<00:01:51.570> from<00:01:51.750> case<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:55.640> no<00:01:56.640> idea

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
that comes from case and the no idea

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.400 
that comes from case and the no idea
what<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.240> call<00:01:57.510> it<00:01:57.660> but<00:01:57.870> I'm<00:01:57.960> going<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.170> call<00:01:58.320> it

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
what I call it but I'm going to call it

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.900 
what I call it but I'm going to call it
the<00:01:58.500> joystick<00:01:59.040> probably<00:01:59.369> completely<00:01:59.670> wrong

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
the joystick probably completely wrong

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.240 
the joystick probably completely wrong
but<00:02:00.450> anyway<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:01.320> got<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.470> lot<00:02:01.619> more<00:02:01.650> functions

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
but anyway it's got a lot more functions

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.710 
but anyway it's got a lot more functions
on<00:02:02.400> there<00:02:02.580> so<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.790> can<00:02:02.940> control<00:02:03.330> it<00:02:03.510> from<00:02:03.600> the

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
on there so you can control it from the

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.810 
on there so you can control it from the
stick<00:02:03.960> rather<00:02:04.229> than<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:05.070> ours<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.460> have<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.700> be

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
stick rather than on ours you have to be

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.999 
stick rather than on ours you have to be
flicking<00:02:06.210> down<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.660> sort<00:02:07.410> of<00:02:07.470> panel<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.830> bit

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
flicking down to a sort of panel a bit

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.470 
flicking down to a sort of panel a bit
more<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:09.119> that's<00:02:09.330> quite<00:02:09.649> quite<00:02:10.649> good<00:02:11.480> it's

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
more so that's quite quite good it's

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.180 
more so that's quite quite good it's
about<00:02:12.600> 500<00:02:13.260> horsepower<00:02:13.500> mean<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.890> be<00:02:13.980> quite

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
about 500 horsepower mean to be quite

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.620 
about 500 horsepower mean to be quite
honest<00:02:14.490> we<00:02:14.640> don't<00:02:14.820> need<00:02:14.940> anything<00:02:15.180> more<00:02:15.420> than

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
honest we don't need anything more than

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.330 
honest we don't need anything more than
about<00:02:15.720> 400<00:02:16.230> horsepower<00:02:16.350> but<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.860> seems<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.220> me

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
about 400 horsepower but it seems to me

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.370 
about 400 horsepower but it seems to me
that<00:02:17.370> either<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.510> smallest<00:02:18.870> one<00:02:19.110> they<00:02:19.200> make

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
that either the smallest one they make

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.479 
that either the smallest one they make
is<00:02:19.500> about<00:02:19.650> 450<00:02:21.020> but<00:02:22.020> tractors<00:02:22.890> just<00:02:23.130> seem<00:02:23.370> to

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
is about 450 but tractors just seem to

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.600 
is about 450 but tractors just seem to
be<00:02:23.520> getting<00:02:23.870> bigger<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.050> bigger

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
be getting bigger and bigger

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.500 
be getting bigger and bigger
good<00:02:26.610> sound<00:02:26.790> like<00:02:27.030> an<00:02:27.120> old<00:02:27.180> man<00:02:29.150> but

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
good sound like an old man but

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.630 
good sound like an old man but
it<00:02:32.049> were<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.409> stick<00:02:32.680> with<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:32.890> contract<00:02:33.459> it

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
it were to stick with a contract it

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.250 
it were to stick with a contract it
seems<00:02:33.849> to<00:02:34.030> me<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.510> smallest<00:02:34.810> one<00:02:35.080> we're

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
seems to me that the smallest one we're

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.309 
seems to me that the smallest one we're
gonna<00:02:35.379> be<00:02:35.530> able<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.709> get<00:02:35.860> us<00:02:36.450> is<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.769> 450<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:40.480> when

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
gonna be able to get us is a 450 so when

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.920 
gonna be able to get us is a 450 so when
it<00:02:41.439> comes<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.769> changing<00:02:42.189> we'll<00:02:42.340> just<00:02:42.519> have<00:02:42.670> to

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
it comes to changing we'll just have to

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.679 
it comes to changing we'll just have to
see<00:02:43.930> what<00:02:44.049> else<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.349> around<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:46.209> see<00:02:46.540> what

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689 
see what else is around and see what

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.600 
see what else is around and see what
else<00:02:46.840> could<00:02:47.019> pull<00:02:47.200> this<00:02:47.349> sub<00:02:48.099> soiler<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.549> the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
else could pull this sub soiler and the

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.509 
else could pull this sub soiler and the
other<00:02:48.730> bits<00:02:49.000> of<00:02:49.090> pieces<00:02:49.299> we<00:02:49.540> got<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.400> make<00:02:51.400> it

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
other bits of pieces we got and make it

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.299 
other bits of pieces we got and make it
a<00:02:51.579> solution<00:02:51.819> at<00:02:51.909> that<00:02:51.970> point
