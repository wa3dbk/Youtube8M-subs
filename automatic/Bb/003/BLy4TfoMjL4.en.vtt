00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.360
 and very good youtube here about 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.009
 commenting on me as he will employ being 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.330
 demolished is not a gameplay the truth is 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.550
 I was very sorry because it is simple 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.230
 is recorded in 2.0 but my capture 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.370
 you already know that they will fly to the same, not always 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.889
 the xbox 360 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.240
 he recorded them with the capture of the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.130
 old for the see average and good then I 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.020
 breastplate breastplate that is just me I've lost 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.250
 everything he had recorded yesterday that 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.600
 will study a few services of 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.189
 molina as well as everything get back to 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.600
 but it is that this game loved 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.760
 very much the truth is already very well its 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.800
 can upload it in live and more in 2.0 but 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.539
 well for now, upload it if not 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.920
 we started strong we started the good 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.350
 second where the first one just kill me 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.520
 without being able to do almost anything and good 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.590
 This game is special because 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.360
 destroy reid and we were playing 3 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.700
 for 4 throughout the game this day 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.410
 I was super frustrated yesterday that is me 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.940
 I put to play then try like you 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.450
 he said to take out a game to do and 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.309
 such and my mother is that I swear that 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.230
 of seven games I 'm going to play six 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.730
 I played three people in my team 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.230
 obviously look for the companions see that 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.030
 does not go what we can not and start to 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.160
 stack and I'm left alone not so good 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.780
 these green as not the light ups 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.489
 I did not raise it by two points by choosing 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.899
 cinema mode because there are no cameras 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.309
 of death and such and then when he dies 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.420
 then touch the camera of the classmates if 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.549
 is not the same 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.960
 they missed the gameplay a lot 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.090
 seemed like putting it that way better not 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.500
 also a little more compact and not 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.390
 accept the length because if it would not last 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.399
 about 15 minutes red and tend to last 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.659
 long plan videos and this video already 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.790
 I say we got to the last round and it's 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.350
 very very long and a good departure 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.090
 general lately I'm having 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.159
 quite good personal level in the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.320
 videos that were happy but good 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.820
 that's not there would not be the case we're not going to 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.420
 see this gameplay as I said a little 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.950
 of the special not of the special future that 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.350
 is going to see in mode tell what it's going to be saying 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.729
 the 50 episodes and also good part 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.830
 of a few things that I want 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.929
 comment about the series that 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.600
 is within this series not the road 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.819
 to master team with alpha with black and with 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.020
 room and I also wanted to comment on a 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.850
 couple of things he wrote in the comments 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.899
 that I do not like at all and that therefore 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.610
 I would like to highlight 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.289
 also and then when it's just 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.610
 comment on that topic, as always 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.500
 I will comment a bit on the bei of 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.729
 how I'm playing it anyways 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.649
 moment is going to stay bottom line is worth 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.909
 comment it and so it's a game in 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.709
 which as always because I usually do 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.289
 several things I'm going with the mmc with the 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:09.209
 sniper mostly then I also get 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.590
 the mpt for russian ever commits 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.390
 a shit for example here I thought that 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.130
 the subject had seen but 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.300
 it was pretty silly you should know that yes 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.709
 who had seen me and was paying me 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.860
 a little here between explaining and I get caught 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.180
 not then what the gameplay said as 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.560
 cinema if there was some fake and 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.450
 so what it looks like is the way 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.130
 cinema no cameras cinema mode almost 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.890
 they are never the same as those of 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.200
 molina or whatever the play I mean 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.390
 recorded with the capturing well not so 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.280
 what good first 50 special 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.110
 suggest something and I think you will like it 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.970
 pretty what is my idea since good 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.860
 I've done some 2.0 I did the live 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.560
 that kind of direct to teacher that was 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.190
 recording the qualifiers and such 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.140
 well it occurred to me to make one or two 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.150
 gameplays is worth in that video equal its voice 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.830
 two gameplays teaching with the camera 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.060
 my hands when we played league I did it 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.739
 I once remove a nuclear teaching 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.209
 my hands you have it with the channel if 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.380
 you want to look for it, in fact I look for it 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.540
 me and the reflection the description yes 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.950
 you want to see how public play and such 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.450
 when I took out the nuclear and that is 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.190
 pretty funny I have not commented on the 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.320
 live I think but it's pretty web because 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.670
 if you see my hands playing and such but my 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.800
 idea would be to do it now in league mode 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.170
 with commemorating these 50 episodes of 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.470
 so league would be pretty cool 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.920
 to be able to do an episode even if they are two 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.180
 partiditas is a video of about 20 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.830
 minutes or so depends what 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.000
 play and I would like to play a mode 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.830
 fast more that seeks to destroy since 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.750
 is to destroy is a more stopped mode and 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.790
 maybe my hands are quieter but 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.020
 good in a hot spot a taken 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.070
 Flag something of that so you can see my 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.300
 working hands that a lot of people 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.980
 I had asked for it although I had already 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.690
 uploaded as I say the nuclear but 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.070
 well, you see, spits me out 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.540
 seen this way you see the freak control that 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.340
 I use and I will explain what you are seeing 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.540
 the teleplay gameplay then what do you think 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.940
 The idea of ​​kids seems like an idea 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.080
 pretty successful and I think it's good that 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.360
 you're going to like it, so at the moment 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.920
 we're in episode 46 or 47 the same 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.450
 I do not remember what's left two or 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.470
 three videos before is special so 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.270
 you propose us we have time to 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.560
 rethink the special but I think that 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.060
 it's pretty good the direct to 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.740
 teachers and I can not do it anymore does not give me 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.240
 time because I played at 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.770
 qualifiers to also record something 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.020
 but in possible as guys and catch 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.400
 everyone and it came out a very thing 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.840
 shit not so good this was from 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.459
 done the following the qualifiers 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.590
 that I climbed teacher friends we had another 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.420
 time and good 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.920
 at seven you have to comment vale 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.300
 you ask me a lot too if 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.579
 I will continue playing league mode I will continue 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.430
 playing back the competitive in the 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.720
 herons and no good at first what 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.360
 I'm interested in warfare stands that do not 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.580
 I liked the ghost is that there is a way 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.740
 decent center league like this one this one 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.090
 I say it's a spectacular league but 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.620
 it's decent what I mean with this 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.639
 well, it creates a system of ranges that 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.530
 people are allowed to leave the 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.290
 items although they should penalize 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.669
 more still but well I do not know what 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.110
 fix a little bit and improve it 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.910
 it is and with that it went away it has appeared 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.110
 two whites and I'm satisfied and then 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.610
 Well, if I'm going to like the game 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.870
 competitive that I do not know anymore I do not know how 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.090
 will work surely play with 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.410
 the exo suit a lot of people have been 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.540
 talking and such I think yes it is going 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.740
 to play with the exo suit so it's not going to 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.090
 see that you get used a little and 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.380
 studying you fell they have to good 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.720
 it seems quite on the subject of 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.850
 high and such so go a little bit more or 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.520
 less trained in quotes and good 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.720
 I 'm not going to upload league mode 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.370
 I guess it's still the same first 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.720
 encouraged to go up a little league mode but 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.460
 that you know that I do intend to 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.960
 continue the series surely not in 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.550
 whites 2 equal some episode in plan 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.070
 remember came into reminder may that 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.820
 yes but mostly the series would be in the 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.820
 warfare phases that yes 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.100
 the prettiest more more little things respect 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.230
 to what he said before the series that usually 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.300
 come up with black with room and with alpha 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.220
 Well, it's because we have a 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.190
 team created from scratch as you know 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.960
 and well you see how when I'm with where 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.190
 the last round starts that good all 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.690
 the rounds that I do not win 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.640
 so they're all lost in case the 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.780
 vice question and the last one that's good 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.670
 Well, you'll see what happens, left the 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.240
 colleagues that his camera and such for what 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:47.360
 is what happens in what more good that 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.770
 consists in uploading a team to teacher and 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.090
 well the same we were in platinum and 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.200
 such although a new season began 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.580
 with which we have to thank 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.380
 qualifiers and play again though 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.030
 I believe that yes it will raise us to teacher 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.860
 now but it's good that there are a few 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.510
 and the series I think that between quotes it's going to 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.800
 come to an end shortly but 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.390
 well let's go there with what I do not like 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.180
 a lot of war in the comments regarding 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.580
 to the theme ps3 and xbox 360 astro usually happens 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.530
 when I upload the videos playing alone 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.730
 in Morelia you want them to play 360 and 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.200
 well this would be I have to record with 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.300
 them in ps3 because for example alpha not 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.500
 has equipment presents and room and neither 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.470
 blas that what it has but good 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.360
 better we adapt to room and alpha that does not 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.040
 they have it then no good last round 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.420
 It is worth what I tell you that I am going to 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.050
 do here here russia to butt to 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.520
 try to do 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.610
 of noise I take one in fact left to 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.729
 that the partner and then what does not 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:34.009
 like to read is by the console in what 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:36.229
 console you are always fighting is better 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:37.550
 the people ps3 a team three hundred then 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.110
 I tell the truth ties with your ex and 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.940
 good people and bad people or not 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.319
 discuss the level of a console other 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.210
 silly profession it seems that the 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:47.060
 companies pay you to defend your 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.620
 console does not look like it does not give me much 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.930
 pity to people who come to insult 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.580
 even for those issues I really do not know 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.979
 you look a little silly and with all the 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.569
 respect the world but it is that there is no if 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:58.069
 things is that it's stupid to walk 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:00.259
 We fight and insult ourselves because consoles 

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:02.090
 better a day like there are only more people 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:03.889
 you know you always wanted to present 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.060
 or xbox one we are not going to say that he has 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:07.430
 had more level but yes that level 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.500
 American at competitive level or serious 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.819
 how do you get support from activision and such 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.409
 because he has always had more support or 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:13.759
 greater competitive impact that does not want 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:16.219
 to say that petre people are worse or 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:18.469
 it's better that it has to be clear 

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:20.330
 we have no comments either 

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:22.610
 happens the series is and there are many people who 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.560
 does not know insulting or alpha friend or speaks 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.180
 with room and telling them they are bad not 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.889
 they know how to play to watch is not a series for 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.389
 teach them to play competitively or to 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:30.350
 doing something serious is simply a 

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:32.330
 series for what 

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.010
 so then let's just try 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.690
 upload a computer from scratch not so 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.010
 also have respect for colleagues 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.840
 who do not know how to play competitive but who 

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.680
 it defends itself quite well so all 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.080
 these kids I hope you liked it 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.580
 the assembly as we like favorites and 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.580
 it stops more goodbye
