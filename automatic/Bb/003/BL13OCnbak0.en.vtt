so<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.490> work<00:00:05.670> continues<00:00:06.299> on<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.870> 66<00:00:07.379> GTO

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
so the work continues on the 66 GTO

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.430 
so the work continues on the 66 GTO
project<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:08.790> last<00:00:09.510> time<00:00:09.840> we<00:00:10.019> showed<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.410> that

project and last time we showed you that

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.140 
project and last time we showed you that
we<00:00:10.769> were<00:00:10.889> going<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.099> move<00:00:11.250> away<00:00:11.460> from<00:00:11.670> the

four-speed<00:00:32.579> automatic<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.469> we're<00:00:34.469> gonna

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
four-speed automatic and we're gonna

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.280 
four-speed automatic and we're gonna
mount<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.160> on<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.550> back<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.030> our<00:00:36.149> L<00:00:36.420> 92<00:00:36.930> v8

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
mount this on the back of our L 92 v8

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.139 
mount this on the back of our L 92 v8
over<00:00:37.680> there<00:00:37.829> hanging<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.520> engine<00:00:38.940> hoist

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
over there hanging on the engine hoist

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.209 
over there hanging on the engine hoist
and<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.440> transmission<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.010> kind<00:00:41.190> of

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
and this transmission is kind of

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.090 
and this transmission is kind of
interesting<00:00:41.430> because<00:00:42.379> it<00:00:43.379> looks<00:00:43.800> kind<00:00:44.010> of

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
interesting because it looks kind of

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.619 
interesting because it looks kind of
like<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.730> know<00:00:44.820> basically<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> stock

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
like a you know basically like a stock

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.229 
like a you know basically like a stock
rebuild<00:00:46.610> this<00:00:47.610> one<00:00:47.850> doesn't<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.149> any

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
rebuild this one doesn't have any

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.990 
rebuild this one doesn't have any
artwork<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.079> when<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.230> say<00:00:49.500> artwork<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.969> can

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
artwork and when I say artwork you can

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.540 
artwork and when I say artwork you can
buy<00:00:51.350> transmissions<00:00:52.350> from<00:00:52.500> Bowler<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.280> are

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
buy transmissions from Bowler that are

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.410 
buy transmissions from Bowler that are
polished<00:00:54.510> or<00:00:54.980> airbrushed<00:00:55.980> or<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.520> flames<00:00:56.910> or

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
polished or airbrushed or have flames or

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.750 
polished or airbrushed or have flames or
all<00:00:57.780> kinds<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.199> nonsense<00:00:58.559> but<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.520> case

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
all kinds of nonsense but in this case

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.310 
all kinds of nonsense but in this case
we<00:00:59.940> wanted<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.539> has<00:01:00.690> kind<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.140> stack

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
we wanted one that has kind of a stack

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.039 
we wanted one that has kind of a stack
up<00:01:01.500> earring<00:01:01.739> case<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.879> again<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.899> looks

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
up earring case so it again it looks

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.380 
up earring case so it again it looks
like<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.979> stock<00:01:05.220> rebuild<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.210> it's

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
like a just a stock rebuild but it's

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.770 
like a just a stock rebuild but it's
definitely<00:01:06.570> not<00:01:07.520> baller<00:01:08.520> has<00:01:08.970> fortified<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
definitely not baller has fortified the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.690 
definitely not baller has fortified the
internals<00:01:10.229> on<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.890> be<00:01:11.010> able<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.250> handle

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
internals on this to be able to handle

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.859 
internals on this to be able to handle
an<00:01:11.909> advertised<00:01:13.130> 550<00:01:14.130> foot-pounds<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.700> torque

an advertised 550 foot-pounds of torque
easily<00:01:16.159> and<00:01:17.159> there<00:01:17.759> are<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> whole<00:01:18.180> bunch<00:01:18.210> of

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
easily and there are a whole bunch of

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.330 
easily and there are a whole bunch of
things<00:01:18.600> done<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.799> know<00:01:19.830> quickly

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
things done in a you know quickly

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.820 
things done in a you know quickly
basically<00:01:21.270> everywhere<00:01:22.049> item<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.590> that

could wear out use seals and clutches

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.440 
could wear out use seals and clutches
and<00:01:25.560> things<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.250> been<00:01:26.450> replaced

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
and things like that have been replaced

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.870 
and things like that have been replaced
but<00:01:28.290> there<00:01:28.439> been<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.619> lot<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.829> upgrades<00:01:29.460> made<00:01:29.729> as

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
but there been a lot of upgrades made as

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.090 
but there been a lot of upgrades made as
well<00:01:30.320> some<00:01:31.320> Corvette<00:01:31.710> servos<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.939> other

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
well some Corvette servos and and other

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.010 
well some Corvette servos and and other
elements<00:01:35.100> have<00:01:35.430> been<00:01:35.460> cryogenically<00:01:36.030> treated

elements have been cryogenically treated

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.050 
elements have been cryogenically treated
or<00:01:37.500> they've<00:01:37.799> been<00:01:37.829> replaced<00:01:38.340> with<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.610> billet

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
or they've been replaced with a billet

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.390 
or they've been replaced with a billet
stronger<00:01:39.570> piece<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.110> because<00:01:40.799> I'm<00:01:40.979> not<00:01:41.159> a

transmission expert bowler actually

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.030 
transmission expert bowler actually
sends<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.149> full<00:01:45.810> page<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.439> all<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.619> things<00:01:46.920> that

done to this particular transmission
which<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.869> think<00:01:55.439> they<00:01:55.530> call<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.890> their<00:01:56.070> 550

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
which is I think they call it their 550

which is I think they call it their 550
foot-pounds

with<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.120> converter<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.780> use<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.950> converter

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690

the<00:02:48.920> new<00:02:49.040> software<00:02:49.430> we'll<00:02:50.270> be<00:02:50.390> able<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.660> paddle

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
the new software we'll be able to paddle

the new software we'll be able to paddle
shift<00:02:51.200> up<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.560> down<00:02:51.740> through<00:02:52.310> eight<00:02:52.520> speeds

shift up and down through eight speeds

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:18.670 
shift up and down through eight speeds
so<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:53.630> should<00:02:53.780> be<00:02:53.810> pretty<00:02:53.960> cool

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.800 

this<00:03:19.680> is<00:03:19.830> dangerous<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:23.030> transmission<00:03:24.030> four

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
this is dangerous the transmission four

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.240 
this is dangerous the transmission four
feet<00:03:25.050> off<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.200> ground<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.710> engine<00:03:26.040> hanging

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
feet off the ground the engine hanging

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.940 
feet off the ground the engine hanging
but<00:03:27.090> it's<00:03:27.240> it's<00:03:27.840> really<00:03:28.080> not<00:03:28.170> that<00:03:28.230> bad

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
but it's it's really not that bad

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.780 
but it's it's really not that bad
it's<00:03:29.580> a<00:03:29.700> nice<00:03:29.850> way<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.090> be<00:03:30.300> able<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:32.700> know

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
it's a nice way to be able to you know

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.550 
it's a nice way to be able to you know
you<00:03:32.850> can<00:03:33.120> adjust<00:03:33.450> this<00:03:33.660> transmission<00:03:34.260> stand

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
you can adjust this transmission stand

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.320 
you can adjust this transmission stand
up<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:34.980> down<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.370> pitch<00:03:35.580> it<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.240> know

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
up and down and pitch it and you know

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.640 
up and down and pitch it and you know
lower<00:03:36.510> this<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:36.960> everything<00:03:37.170> can<00:03:37.380> kind<00:03:37.590> of

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
lower this so everything can kind of

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.230 
lower this so everything can kind of
mesh<00:03:37.830> together<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:38.580> that's<00:03:38.730> what<00:03:38.940> we<00:03:39.030> do<00:03:39.120> it

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
mesh together so that's what we do it

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.030 
mesh together so that's what we do it
this<00:03:39.330> way<00:03:39.390> but<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:40.050> got<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.320> be<00:03:40.380> careful<00:03:40.560> don't

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
this way but you got to be careful don't

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.130 
this way but you got to be careful don't
you<00:03:41.400> know<00:03:41.490> use<00:03:42.030> your<00:03:42.060> safety<00:03:42.600> chain<00:03:42.840> which

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
you know use your safety chain which

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:51.550 
you know use your safety chain which
we're<00:03:43.290> not<00:03:43.610> like<00:03:44.610> um<00:03:44.760> this<00:03:44.880> is<00:03:45.000> loosening<00:03:49.370> nice

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
we're not like um this is loosening nice

00:03:51.560 --> 00:04:03.360 
we're not like um this is loosening nice
boy<00:03:53.180> let's<00:03:54.180> put<00:03:54.330> it<00:03:54.420> back

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.830 

lose<00:04:04.370> your<00:04:04.549> safety<00:04:04.909> chain<00:04:05.150> so<00:04:05.420> you<00:04:05.450> don't<00:04:05.659> drop

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
lose your safety chain so you don't drop

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.069 
lose your safety chain so you don't drop
the<00:04:06.019> expensive<00:04:06.799> transmission<00:04:07.400> on<00:04:07.489> the<00:04:07.519> floor

this time we're real happy to find that
the<00:04:27.110> 4<00:04:27.350> l<00:04:27.440> 65<00:04:27.980> seems<00:04:28.850> to<00:04:28.970> fit<00:04:29.150> up<00:04:29.270> pretty<00:04:29.450> nicely

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
the 4 l 65 seems to fit up pretty nicely

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.610 
the 4 l 65 seems to fit up pretty nicely

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.159 
tell we've got a lot of clearance around
the<00:04:39.770> top<00:04:39.980> of<00:04:40.010> the<00:04:40.220> trends<00:04:40.790> it<00:04:41.570> doesn't<00:04:41.900> seem<00:04:42.050> to

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
the top of the trends it doesn't seem to

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.020 
the top of the trends it doesn't seem to
hang<00:04:42.320> down<00:04:42.620> very<00:04:42.919> low<00:04:43.160> you<00:04:43.550> know<00:04:43.669> it's<00:04:43.880> almost

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
hang down very low you know it's almost

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.300 
hang down very low you know it's almost
parallel<00:04:44.660> with<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.110> engine<00:04:45.470> oil<00:04:45.680> pin<00:04:46.010> so

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
parallel with the engine oil pin so

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.940 
parallel with the engine oil pin so
that's<00:04:46.490> good<00:04:46.730> we<00:04:47.540> got<00:04:47.960> to<00:04:48.110> do<00:04:48.320> a<00:04:48.350> little<00:04:48.530> work

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
that's good we got to do a little work

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.550 
that's good we got to do a little work
with<00:04:49.160> our<00:04:49.310> crossmember<00:04:50.000> and<00:04:50.470> we're<00:04:51.470> gonna

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
with our crossmember and we're gonna

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.129 
with our crossmember and we're gonna
tack<00:04:51.980> weld<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.490> mounts<00:04:52.910> for<00:04:53.330> the<00:04:53.450> engine<00:04:53.930> in

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
tack weld the mounts for the engine in

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.500 
tack weld the mounts for the engine in
place<00:04:54.610> so<00:04:55.610> we<00:04:55.910> know<00:04:56.030> where<00:04:56.180> to<00:04:56.240> drill<00:04:56.450> the

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
place so we know where to drill the

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.360 
place so we know where to drill the
holes<00:04:56.780> to<00:04:57.110> get<00:04:57.200> the<00:04:57.320> frame<00:04:57.530> page<00:04:57.770> that<00:04:58.070> we<00:04:58.160> made

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
holes to get the frame page that we made

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.180 
holes to get the frame page that we made
so<00:04:59.060> that<00:04:59.180> will<00:04:59.270> all<00:04:59.330> fit<00:04:59.540> up<00:04:59.720> and<00:05:00.010> this<00:05:01.010> thing

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
so that will all fit up and this thing

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.080 
so that will all fit up and this thing
will<00:05:01.280> be<00:05:01.310> bolted<00:05:01.580> in<00:05:01.850> in<00:05:02.570> no<00:05:02.780> time
