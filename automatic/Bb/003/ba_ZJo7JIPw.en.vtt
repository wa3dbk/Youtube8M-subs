the products that I use to heal the
chemical<00:04:28.130> peel<00:04:28.540> which<00:04:29.950> if<00:04:30.950> you<00:04:31.160> text<00:04:31.520> me<00:04:31.660> again

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
chemical peel which if you text me again

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:43.719 
chemical peel which if you text me again
I<00:04:33.200> will<00:04:33.290> share<00:04:33.620> those<00:04:33.890> products<00:04:34.400> with<00:04:34.580> you<00:04:37.060> so

at San into fungal and to enter

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.760 
at San into fungal and to enter
bacterial<00:04:56.659> and<00:04:57.219> so<00:04:58.219> I<00:04:58.759> just<00:04:59.539> love<00:04:59.839> it<00:05:00.020> I<00:05:00.169> use<00:05:00.559> it

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:04.939 
twice a day to cleanse my face make sure

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:11.320 
twice a day to cleanse my face make sure
that<00:05:05.330> my<00:05:05.419> face<00:05:05.659> is<00:05:05.689> all<00:05:06.110> clean<00:05:09.580> so<00:05:10.580> that's

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
that my face is all clean so that's

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.320 
that my face is all clean so that's
clean<00:05:11.839> and<00:05:12.199> then<00:05:13.129> I<00:05:13.249> apply<00:05:13.580> just<00:05:13.909> something

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
clean and then I apply just something

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:24.810 
clean and then I apply just something
little<00:05:14.960> cooling<00:05:16.569> healing<00:05:17.569> gel

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.820 

and<00:05:25.150> I<00:05:25.390> have<00:05:25.540> to<00:05:25.690> admit<00:05:25.720> after<00:05:26.260> the<00:05:26.650> chemical

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
and I have to admit after the chemical

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.580 
and I have to admit after the chemical
peel<00:05:27.390> yesterday<00:05:28.390> my<00:05:28.930> face<00:05:29.200> was<00:05:29.470> a<00:05:29.500> little

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
peel yesterday my face was a little

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.360 
peel yesterday my face was a little
sword<00:05:30.300> and<00:05:31.300> I<00:05:31.420> think<00:05:31.660> that's<00:05:31.840> to<00:05:32.050> be<00:05:32.170> expected

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
sword and I think that's to be expected

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:39.180 
sword and I think that's to be expected
because<00:05:33.370> it's<00:05:33.910> a<00:05:34.240> chemical<00:05:34.630> peel

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.100 

but<00:05:39.790> if<00:05:39.850> you<00:05:40.000> see<00:05:40.360> some<00:05:40.600> of<00:05:40.630> my<00:05:40.840> other<00:05:41.020> videos

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
but if you see some of my other videos

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.050 
but if you see some of my other videos
from<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:41.920> different<00:05:42.280> chemical<00:05:42.670> peels<00:05:42.850> that

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
from the different chemical peels that

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.900 
from the different chemical peels that
I've<00:05:43.180> used<00:05:43.510> the<00:05:43.930> CTA<00:05:44.380> is<00:05:44.830> a<00:05:45.310> lot<00:05:45.700> different

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
I've used the CTA is a lot different

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.780 
I've used the CTA is a lot different
from<00:05:46.210> this<00:05:46.450> field<00:05:46.840> and<00:05:47.340> that<00:05:48.340> your<00:05:48.580> face

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
from this field and that your face

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.030 
from this field and that your face
darkens<00:05:49.390> and<00:05:50.140> your<00:05:50.320> skin<00:05:52.170> dies<00:05:53.170> on<00:05:53.680> your<00:05:53.830> face

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
darkens and your skin dies on your face

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.940 
darkens and your skin dies on your face
and<00:05:54.370> then<00:05:54.640> it's<00:05:54.820> lops<00:05:55.120> off<00:05:55.360> which<00:05:56.320> is<00:05:56.650> a<00:05:56.680> very

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
and then it's lops off which is a very

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.360 
and then it's lops off which is a very
hard<00:05:57.940> process<00:05:58.210> to<00:05:58.570> go<00:05:58.720> through<00:05:59.310> but<00:06:00.310> this

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
hard process to go through but this

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.270 
hard process to go through but this
process<00:06:01.030> is<00:06:01.240> a<00:06:01.270> little<00:06:01.360> bit<00:06:01.630> easier<00:06:02.020> because

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
process is a little bit easier because

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.530 
process is a little bit easier because
you're<00:06:03.280> although<00:06:03.820> you<00:06:03.880> look<00:06:04.060> like<00:06:04.330> you<00:06:04.510> just

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
you're although you look like you just

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.860 
you're although you look like you just
have<00:06:04.870> real<00:06:05.140> bad<00:06:05.290> acne<00:06:06.000> or<00:06:07.000> some<00:06:07.180> acne<00:06:07.540> scarring

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
have real bad acne or some acne scarring

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.270 
have real bad acne or some acne scarring
it<00:06:08.260> doesn't<00:06:08.680> go<00:06:08.950> through<00:06:08.980> the<00:06:10.440> dying<00:06:11.440> face<00:06:11.830> and

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
it doesn't go through the dying face and

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.640 
it doesn't go through the dying face and
then<00:06:12.520> the<00:06:12.670> sloughing<00:06:13.030> off<00:06:13.360> but<00:06:14.200> it<00:06:14.380> gradually

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
then the sloughing off but it gradually

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.910 
then the sloughing off but it gradually
as<00:06:15.280> you<00:06:15.970> the<00:06:16.450> days<00:06:16.630> go<00:06:16.870> by<00:06:16.900> my<00:06:17.440> face<00:06:17.680> will

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
as you the days go by my face will

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.220 
as you the days go by my face will
continue<00:06:18.430> to<00:06:19.290> exfoliate<00:06:20.290> itself<00:06:21.130> and<00:06:21.540> then<00:06:22.540> I

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
continue to exfoliate itself and then I

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.340 
continue to exfoliate itself and then I
should<00:06:23.860> have<00:06:24.040> new<00:06:24.550> skin<00:06:24.880> so<00:06:25.330> we're<00:06:26.140> going<00:06:26.260> to

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
should have new skin so we're going to

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.320 
should have new skin so we're going to
wait<00:06:26.410> out<00:06:26.710> the<00:06:26.860> process<00:06:27.310> usually<00:06:27.580> at<00:06:27.940> seven

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
wait out the process usually at seven

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.510 
wait out the process usually at seven
days<00:06:28.510> with<00:06:29.020> the<00:06:29.110> alpha-beta<00:06:29.410> chemical<00:06:30.100> peel<00:06:30.280> I

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
days with the alpha-beta chemical peel I

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.970 
days with the alpha-beta chemical peel I
don't<00:06:30.790> know<00:06:30.970> how<00:06:31.180> many<00:06:31.390> days<00:06:31.630> but<00:06:32.470> they<00:06:32.770> say

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:32.980 
don't know how many days but they say

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.800 
don't know how many days but they say
you<00:06:33.040> can<00:06:33.370> actually<00:06:33.580> use<00:06:33.820> this<00:06:34.150> chemical<00:06:34.540> peel

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
you can actually use this chemical peel

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.410 
you can actually use this chemical peel
every<00:06:35.590> two<00:06:35.950> to<00:06:35.980> three<00:06:36.100> weeks<00:06:36.310> or<00:06:36.850> every<00:06:36.880> week

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:37.420 
every two to three weeks or every week

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:42.540 
every two to three weeks or every week
even<00:06:37.630> so<00:06:38.410> I'm<00:06:38.890> assuming<00:06:39.130> that<00:06:39.730> every<00:06:40.510> week<00:06:41.550> it

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
even so I'm assuming that every week it

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.490 
even so I'm assuming that every week it
regenerates<00:06:42.970> so<00:06:43.570> I'm<00:06:43.870> going<00:06:44.169> to<00:06:44.200> give<00:06:44.350> it<00:06:44.470> a

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500 
regenerates so I'm going to give it a

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.080 
regenerates so I'm going to give it a
week<00:06:44.650> and<00:06:44.980> I'll<00:06:45.550> be<00:06:45.700> back<00:06:45.880> with<00:06:46.060> another

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090 
week and I'll be back with another

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.990 
week and I'll be back with another
