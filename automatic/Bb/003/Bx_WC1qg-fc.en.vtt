00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.750
 the taskbar is very useful for 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:06.549
 Quick access to programs that 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.400
 are anchored and those that currently 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.740
 we have open at times could 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.049
 become a problem rather than a help 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.180
 if we do not have well configured the 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.460
 options of it this is what you 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.140
 I will explain below the bar 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.290
 depending on the resolution of your 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.750
 screen will have a specific width the 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.060
 normal position is the bottom of 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.300
 the screen is where I currently have 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.980
 the windows taskbar is this 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.910
 which is down here although we can 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.730
 move it to any of the other sides 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.370
 simply by clicking on it without 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.700
 letting go of the mouse we drag and see how 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.920
 it starts to be placed in the different 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.930
 parts the bottom is the most common 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.329
 and normally we will see it in this 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.210
 zone if you can not move it click 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.160
 right and make sure it's not 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.070
 option that says block the bar 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.989
 active tasks and what is simply the 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.239
 you select again and it's going to be removed 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.310
 the brand also if we wish we can 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.009
 hide it to take advantage of it 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.290
 space that occupies in the windows of the 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.780
 programs for example although it does not occupy 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.090
 large space could be useful for in the 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.610
 case of some programs show a 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.170
 little more from the top of the window I'm going to 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.970
 again right click on a 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.130
 blank area of â€‹â€‹the bar I'm going to 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.200
 select where it says properties 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.030
 we are seeing this window that has 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.780
 several options one of these options 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.350
 says to automatically hide the bar 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.649
 chores 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.110
 I'm going to select it press accept and 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.130
 we see how it has been hidden 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.830
 automatically to make it 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.470
 show simply bring the cursor closer 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.659
 towards the lower area and we see how 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.659
 it reappears when it moves away from that 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.849
 zone is going to hide again and so 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.380
 we can continue working in a 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:55.720
 normal with our program for example 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.849
 here I have several windows open I'm going 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.920
 to open this that says library and I'm going to 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:02.860
 maximize we see it as this window 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.929
 take full advantage of my height 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.710
 screen if I had the taskbar 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:10.470
 activate what is going to happen is this 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.810
 and the space occupied by the bar 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.600
 of tasks is not going to show and the 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.520
 window would show from this 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.040
 zone although it's really not a big 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.319
 space some programs for example the 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.450
 that I use like this from photoshop if not 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.810
 I have the exact height of this resolution 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.459
 that is 720 pixels is not reached 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.830
 completely show the bar 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.440
 tools if I hide the bar 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.270
 tasks if it shows up if you have the 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.340
 opportunity to see the courses that I've 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.380
 done about photoshop I do not show the 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.959
 taskbar you only see the 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.570
 window of the program I'm going to make it 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.180
 show again the bar that is not 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.670
 is hiding automatically I'm going to 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.760
 enter the option that marks a 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.070
 moment and now if the bar is already fixed 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.080
 of tasks the icons of the programs 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.330
 anchored and the buttons have a size 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.930
 specific as you can see these are the 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.510
 icons and these are the buttons 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.939
 they are already open programs and I close the 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.459
 window let's see how the icon looks 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:12.920
 of the program but when you open it you create that 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.109
 button this size is a standard size 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.640
 that has windows although there is another 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.920
 size that I'll show you in a 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.530
 moment if we have many programs or 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.099
 open windows the bar is going to 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.409
 saturate these buttons for example if 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:30.139
 I start to open more windows I'm going to do 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.569
 click on this we see how these buttons 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.489
 they start to get smaller in 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.889
 these cases we have several options for 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.859
 efficiently manage windows 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:42.019
 open first make the buttons e 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.879
 icons look smaller so that 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.560
 occupy less space I will enter 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.870
 again in the properties of the 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.169
 taskbar and let's see an option 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.930
 that says here using bar buttons 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.909
 small tasks I'm going to select this 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.700
 option and I'm going to press the button 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.980
 apply to see the changes and without 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.750
 we close this window now we see how 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.810
 the buttons become smaller 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.410
 including the taskbar has 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.360
 lower than what I had previously 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.940
 for people who have a view 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.549
 not very good maybe this option is not 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.250
 the best because everything is made smaller 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.739
 and obviously you have to strain the view 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.460
 in case you have problems so 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:28.490
 I do not recommend doing this another way or 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.560
 thing we can do to see better 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.720
 buttons and icons bar 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.270
 tasks in case we have many 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.419
 active windows like at this moment I 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.820
 I have in my bar is to make the 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.400
 taskbar so that you have more 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.229
 space for these buttons and icons this 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.360
 It is recommended only on screens 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.430
 large since there is plenty of room for 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.700
 can make the bar a little higher 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.590
 tasks without getting in our way in this case 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:59.450
 the resolution in which I am recording 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:01.190
 the course has a high of 720 pixels not 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.830
 it's very high but I also have a 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.530
 screen with a high of 1080 in that 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.720
 screen if it is a good option to do the 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.060
 bar a little higher tasks like 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.380
 you can see by doing the highest that is 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.570
 exactly 2 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.880
 high I had a moment ago 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.660
 buttons now do look bigger and 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.700
 they are also distributed in two lines 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.310
 now we have more space to be able 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.410
 enter the various windows that 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.300
 we have active finally we have the 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.070
 options to combine these are very 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.010
 interesting I'm going to go back in 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.610
 properties and we're going to see an area that 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.590
 He says buttons on the taskbar 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.570
 currently they say never to combine and 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.940
 this option what it does is show the 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.980
 buttons along with the titles of the 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.570
 windows but we can select by 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.660
 example is what it says here combine 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.460
 always and hide labels I'm going to 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.560
 press apply to see what is it 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.100
 what happens what happened is that 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.770
 windows automatically hides the 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.610
 labels ie the names of the 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.740
 windows 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.570
 I'm going to return it as it was a 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.880
 moment for you to see the difference in 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.300
 the case of the window is the browser 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.740
 of windows the word appears 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.980
 libraries note that when selecting 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.990
 combine and hide labels has been 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.780
 removed that name is only shown 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.110
 the icon 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.690
 but not only that , the 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.760
 windows of the same type how can we 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.350
 know when they are grouped because 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.830
 appears as a kind of column 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:34.139
 additional to the side of the icon in the case 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.820
 the Windows Explorer window 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.040
 we are seeing a column appear 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.350
 this means that there is another window 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.210
 besides this that you see here then 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.880
 all windows that are the same 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.610
 program are going to be grouped in this case 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.770
 in chrome I have more than two windows and the 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.200
 maximum column showing windows 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.970
 is 2 but as you can see they are 5 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.280
 windows I have open 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:59.760
 we currently have another option that says 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:02.490
 combine if the bar is full I will 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.200
 select it and press apply this 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.210
 means that when the buttons occupy 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.060
 the entire width of the bar are going to 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:11.220
 start to combine if they do not occupy it 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.590
 they will show how we are seeing it in 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.080
 this case they have not occupied it because I have 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.790
 the bar with a size higher than the 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.310
 normal but if I return it to its size 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.890
 normal we see what happens they have grouped 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:25.050
 again the windows but also note 

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.470
 that the buttons are a bit size 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.740
 plus 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:30.690
 than what we saw earlier because it 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.840
 are showing the titles of the 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:36.090
 windows with this option that says 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:38.580
 hide labels in addition to making them 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:41.340
 combine the windows we are also 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:43.020
 showing only the icon of the 

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.420
 program that is open these are 

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.970
 all the options we can do with 

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:50.100
 the taskbar to manage the 

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:53.010
 space that has the same this is going to 

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:55.050
 save time by locating a window 

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:58.640
 specific depending on the way 

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.640
 that we have it organized
