00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.730
 beautiful all guys welcome to the 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.230
 no checa that this was not my intro 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.700
 beautiful all your guys here 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.390
 that something moves that speaks to you today 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.700
 agazzi citro that the episode number 3 of 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.739
 hayes land of eden then the last time 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.780
 a little mess happened because those 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.460
 creeper passages have produced broken i 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.420
 balls if I can't tell in another 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.940
 way 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.750
 destroying me a lot of stuff e 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.100
 especially the streets led home 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.980
 hulk I too did a little too many sticks 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.500
 for a bit of torches okay does nothing ok 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.510
 36 are still many 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.790
 We are already starting to put them here because yes 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.400
 bastards always spur me on like this a 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.680
 random on the roads that are for now 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.530
 those closed more and I need them 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.019
 absolutely speaking some things that 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.930
 I normally need it I would have recovered 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.049
 8 euros perfect and wait if 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.180
 just in case, here's a perfect kit 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.850
 here I can make yellow and I will need it 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:20.049
 to make the gold block that if not me 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.929
 mistake should be somewhere 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.460
 there is no hell but that but what am I doing 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.390
 then of all that work I am 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.130
 recovering 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.950
 I was convinced that there was a gold block 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.139
 to do I do not know why but the wool me 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.990
 serves in the sense that that area we find 

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:36.909
 in dungeons but then i need it i need it 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:43.929
 little by little we continue these roads 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:45.310
 that still lead us to the lanes there 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.340
 however there is a sheep and not 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.350
 I don't think he has to kill the sheep 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.639
 recovers wool thanks to sheep not 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.859
 I believe it is this goal indeed it is 

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:55.539
 rather than in the crates too much wool 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:58.319
 but I didn't understand the rules above all 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:01.509
 that a clip has exploded on some signs 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.880
 and I couldn't read them thanks creeper 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.979
 thanks for now we'll just go to 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.100
 try to explore the map above all 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.650
 which is very large and above all do the 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.630
 roads so a bit of a break but it's a bit 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.920
 the principle of the map 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.090
 I would say just like usual 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.830
 let us recover the land we can 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.950
 recover because it is what we are 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.220
 keeps point or makes us roads more or 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.660
 less 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.840
 there is one thing 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.630
 so many furnaces I don't know what it is but how many 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.330
 hell of an island there is my mom but it is 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.990
 too long I spend at least 100 here 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.760
 episodes 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.540
 I would say to recover even the 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:41.230
 wood that I don't see for now 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.430
 can serve at least that you can 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.290
 obviously to make all the tools 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.390
 all you want but not for now 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.820
 I am not in crisis 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.350
 normally these things are there 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.140
 always interesting things including 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.460
 iron coal here is precisely see them 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.430
 the gold that I have not yet understood that 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:01.000
 hell I need to write it in the comments 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.710
 vaffa them I need you for nothing I do 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.450
 what the gold armor makes shit 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.390
 I know what they want me to do 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.730
 I rexton gold armor that that which 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.220
 I also do it with the ret stone and I don't 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.950
 I know we do n't mention having iron boom rest 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.260
 see the iron you see this is a lot 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.110
 useful here I agree what can 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.180
 serve the firm renzo thing shit me 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.760
 serves however is not I don't think it is 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.330
 complicated in the sense the resources are not 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.430
 a problem that the real problem is 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.940
 the wools because now since I started 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.380
 I have found nothing but no wool 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.410
 found sheep but I don't think that 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.300
 is what we need to find rules 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.790
 which then cannot be 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:47.740
 because they know the two seconds I die 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.570
 found a lot of iron in stick there is 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.940
 in abundance 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.459
 let's have a nice sword 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.430
 then sti gakki of the other tools between 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.989
 whose pick and stuff varies those 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.239
 I can easily do in stone 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.160
 but for now let us limit ourselves to doing things 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.730
 well then those that is a goat 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.550
 so maybe 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.159
 there is a goat a sheep therefore perhaps from 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.980
 there I can still recover 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:16.510
 wool but not to make the monument but 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:21.109
 instead to make the bed I need 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:23.570
 therefore I would say to leave her vivaqua e 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.280
 for now, hospital that is getting dark 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.990
 I did not put torci is not good 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.760
 no not good it 's okay if I'm not there 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.979
 torches is not okay look no good 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.600
 you absolutely put swear torches 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.880
 see if this stupid new sheep 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.350
 Jun commits suicide because you have something 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.840
 what interests me is your wool 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.320
 normally the gentle creeper not 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:47.810
 they should be there and then what I had to do 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:49.669
 make shears made of ferrous shears now 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.210
 I would say to rest the iron 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.919
 that we have here also this then iron 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.280
 and they that we have more here 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:00.169
 now these things here stopped here 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:06.590
 I know we need more blocks for 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:13.880
 to make armor then here are 55 85 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:16.010
 plus 8 but 13 13 plus 72024 blocks of 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.840
