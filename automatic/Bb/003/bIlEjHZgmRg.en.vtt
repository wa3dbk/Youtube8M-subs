and so we had to gather the wood and so

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.600 
and so we had to gather the wood and so
on<00:02:13.180> for<00:02:13.209> a<00:02:13.450> fire<00:02:13.750> okay<00:02:14.739> and<00:02:14.950> we<00:02:15.310> were<00:02:15.430> by<00:02:15.580> a

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
on for a fire okay and we were by a

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.600 
on for a fire okay and we were by a
stream<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:16.660> we<00:02:16.780> did<00:02:16.989> that<00:02:17.040> we<00:02:18.040> gathered<00:02:18.430> some

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
stream so we did that we gathered some

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.820 
stream so we did that we gathered some
rocks<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.270> premise<00:02:19.989> with<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.260> rocks<00:02:20.500> is

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
rocks and the premise with the rocks is

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.990 
rocks and the premise with the rocks is
you're<00:02:21.130> going<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.340> eat<00:02:21.459> them<00:02:21.640> we're<00:02:21.790> going<00:02:21.940> to

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
you're going to eat them we're going to

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.270 
you're going to eat them we're going to
heat<00:02:22.150> them<00:02:22.300> in<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.450> fire<00:02:22.890> once<00:02:23.890> they<00:02:24.040> heat<00:02:24.250> it

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
heat them in the fire once they heat it

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.750 
heat them in the fire once they heat it
up<00:02:24.519> made<00:02:25.510> some<00:02:25.750> tongs<00:02:26.190> pick<00:02:27.190> up<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.519> rocks

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
up made some tongs pick up the rocks

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.600 
up made some tongs pick up the rocks
place<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.900> in<00:02:28.989> here<00:02:29.230> like<00:02:29.380> that<00:02:29.620> that'll<00:02:30.430> boil

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
place it in here like that that'll boil

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.890 
place it in here like that that'll boil
the<00:02:30.760> water<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.060> that<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.330> might<00:02:31.480> take<00:02:31.690> two

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
the water and that it might take two

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.479 
the water and that it might take two
changes<00:02:32.319> of<00:02:32.410> rock<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.860> bar<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.160> water<00:02:33.340> this

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
changes of rock to bar the water this

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.390 
changes of rock to bar the water this
probably<00:02:34.030> holds<00:02:34.330> about<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.599> quart<00:02:35.050> no<00:02:35.920> that's

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
probably holds about a quart no that's

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.070 
probably holds about a quart no that's
more<00:02:36.580> than<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.760> quart<00:02:37.060> how<00:02:37.540> about<00:02:37.720> you<00:02:37.870> more

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
more than a quart how about you more

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.250 
more than a quart how about you more
about<00:02:38.349> two<00:02:38.769> quarts<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.670> two<00:02:39.730> quarts<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.450> say

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
about two quarts a two quarts so say

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.750 
about two quarts a two quarts so say
anyway<00:02:41.620> it's<00:02:41.799> a<00:02:41.830> substantial<00:02:42.400> amount<00:02:42.519> of

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
anyway it's a substantial amount of

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.440 
anyway it's a substantial amount of
water<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.510> not<00:02:43.660> only<00:02:43.690> couldn't<00:02:44.230> we<00:02:45.420> purify<00:02:46.420> it

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
water so not only couldn't we purify it

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.809 
water so not only couldn't we purify it
we<00:02:47.200> could<00:02:47.350> cook<00:02:47.530> with<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:47.890> cooking<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.519> sort

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
we could cook with it cooking it to sort

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.789 
we could cook with it cooking it to sort
of<00:02:48.850> make<00:02:49.000> soup<00:02:49.299> mix<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.900> make<00:02:49.930> coffee<00:02:50.380> let's

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
of make soup mix to make coffee let's

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.650 
of make soup mix to make coffee let's
show<00:02:50.950> them<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.220> tongs<00:02:51.459> real<00:02:51.730> quick<00:02:51.970> this<00:02:52.480> is

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
show them the tongs real quick this is

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.390 
show them the tongs real quick this is
something<00:02:52.930> similar<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.230> what<00:02:53.319> we<00:02:53.590> had<00:02:53.769> we

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
something similar to what we had we

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.039 
something similar to what we had we
found<00:02:54.700> Yoko<00:02:54.970> along<00:02:55.299> the<00:02:55.450> way<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:55.870> we

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
found Yoko along the way and we

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.080 
found Yoko along the way and we
basically<00:02:56.350> we<00:02:57.010> feel<00:02:57.250> stripped<00:02:57.519> it<00:02:57.700> down<00:02:57.730> the

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
basically we feel stripped it down the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.520 
basically we feel stripped it down the
fibers<00:02:58.510> we<00:02:58.630> didn't<00:02:58.840> make<00:02:58.900> any<00:02:58.959> course<00:02:59.380> we

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
fibers we didn't make any course we

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.410 
fibers we didn't make any course we
don't<00:02:59.650> have<00:02:59.739> to<00:02:59.830> get<00:02:59.980> fancy<00:03:00.220> was<00:03:00.519> just<00:03:00.700> really

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
don't have to get fancy was just really

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.820 
don't have to get fancy was just really
down<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:01.840> dirty<00:03:01.989> and<00:03:02.140> we<00:03:02.260> just<00:03:02.470> made<00:03:02.620> some

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
down and dirty and we just made some

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.770 
down and dirty and we just made some
tongs<00:03:03.069> just<00:03:03.640> need<00:03:03.819> to<00:03:03.940> stick<00:03:04.090> them<00:03:04.239> so<00:03:04.450> we<00:03:04.600> can

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
tongs just need to stick them so we can

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
at 210 and you actually purify

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.500 
at 210 and you actually purify
everything<00:03:14.500> in<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.680> water<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.100> 170<00:03:15.790> so<00:03:16.359> when

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.009 
this water is boiling you guys have
purified<00:03:18.370> any<00:03:18.790> biological<00:03:19.600> contamination

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
purified any biological contamination

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.660 
purified any biological contamination
stead<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.680> talk<00:03:20.890> about<00:03:21.040> it<00:03:21.250> one<00:03:21.370> which<00:03:21.489> almost

something like this you want the water
close<00:03:37.720> as<00:03:37.900> possible<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:39.010> this<00:03:39.160> is<00:03:39.280> where<00:03:39.430> our

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
close as possible so this is where our

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.160 
close as possible so this is where our
rocks<00:03:39.819> are<00:03:40.030> being<00:03:40.269> heated<00:03:40.420> right<00:03:40.750> now<00:03:40.780> they're

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
rocks are being heated right now they're

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.740 
rocks are being heated right now they're
in<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.380> fire<00:03:41.620> that<00:03:41.920> we're<00:03:42.670> right<00:03:42.850> here<00:03:42.880> so

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
in the fire that we're right here so

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.539 
in the fire that we're right here so
it's<00:03:43.930> going<00:03:44.019> to<00:03:44.109> be<00:03:44.230> really<00:03:44.410> easy<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:45.100> transfer

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
it's going to be really easy to transfer

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.599 
it's going to be really easy to transfer
the<00:03:46.120> rocks<00:03:46.390> to<00:03:47.049> this<00:03:47.260> trough<00:03:47.560> easy<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.400> take

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
the rocks to this trough easy to take

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.640 
the rocks to this trough easy to take
the<00:03:48.760> water<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.329> put<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:49.959> in<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.140> trough<00:03:50.380> and
