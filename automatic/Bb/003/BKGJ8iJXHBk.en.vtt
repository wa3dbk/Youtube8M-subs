00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.299

 we have a 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.420
 the receiver up and down I made 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.240
 for his new place in a local company 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.110
 here where I live of very good quality and 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.110
 very good prices 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:47.900
 we have the pistol grip is made 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:51.980
 by sea ​​coll is the model that is the 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.780
 angle is not as open as you give 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.890
 with what comes regularly the air 15 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.220
 it's a little bit more 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.440
 down that allows that as is a 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.060
 short rifle was going to be closer to you 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.890
 body 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.860
 or more comfortable to handle we have it 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.440
 macbook chargers with window you can 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.440
 see how many bullets you have left 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.620
 we have a free flow wenger 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.670
 we have one 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.620
 Maipú grip grip looks straight ahead 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.420
 and from behind are macul the two are 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.580
 fully adjustable we have the spout 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.659
 7 and a half inches that's pretty 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.120
 short for being short obviously you're going to 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:43.470
 to lose 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:47.730
 force in it the ammunition that you are 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.879
 using but it's still completely lethal 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.310
 in the purpose of this weapon by the 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:56.250
 size is for confrontations to very 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.360
 short distance to the idea function that you 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:04.430
 I see this rifle from in to bring a house 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.430
 and go door to door 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.909
 as they say here here I came to 2 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.280
 it's something rather short something shot 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:19.330
 up to 100 meters without any problem 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.780
 the goal then I consider that at 100 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:27.210
 meters and maybe maybe a lot more would be 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:32.550
 perfectly the state we have this 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:35.360
 flash kan for being a short pipe there 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.680
 many gases and you can burn without 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.100
 they are still coming out here what 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.990
 causes a flare and the sound is 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:48.180
 pretty strong what this does is 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.970
 send the gases and all the gunpowder 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.819
 that is burning send it forward 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.450
 just like the sound 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.450
 that 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.170
 help especially if you're in a field 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.260
 of shooting you have people shooting at a 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.980
 side of you 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.810
 if you had a normal one the gases 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.930
 they come out for the sides and it's pretty 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.519
 noisy 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.870
 the position as 400 shot in this weapon without 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:23.250
 no failure 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.800
 the caliber 556 weapon but as the 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:31.169
 rest of my rifles the only thing that fired 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:35.520
 it's 223 caliber because it's cheaper that 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:38.070
 Ammunition 223 is a little more dirty 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.570
 what the weapon requires 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.570
 it cleans more constantly 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:50.420
 very happy with the result I think 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.360
 it looks good and works well so 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:56.259
 what else can you expect 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.020
 I've had it with a recipe too 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:03.139
 now I want to use it with these sights and 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.320
 see how it works I have a lot more 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:09.100
 trust 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:12.580
 in view of this class because it is a 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:15.900
 it really has electronics and in the 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.900
 inside and it can fail you 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.080
 let's show you more closely 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:32.009
 The bolt 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.009
 It is also made by his hands 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.500
 and it worked perfectly 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:22.170
