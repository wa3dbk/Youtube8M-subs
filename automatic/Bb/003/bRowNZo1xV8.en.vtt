00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:12.990
 Hello, I want to show you what 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:16.260
 did this motorcycle tula t-200 91 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:22.939
 motorcycle release was a long time 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:29.369
 indoors stood by grandfather 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:32.040
 bought decided not to restore all was 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.660
 the motorcycle is sandblasted completely 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:41.460
 all disassembled by itself and repainted in 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:48.320
 new light in black is called 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:51.090
 space is very very dark blue metallic 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:57.500
 if you look closely you can see 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:59.969
 varnished the engine went through changed 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.980
 piston piston 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.439
 Well, the cylinder left as hardening native 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.100
 there was no big news dear 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.260
 I decided 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.890
 principle still went you went that is but i 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:15.330
 just how would I explain it 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.369
 didn't like little was a little bit 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.479
 anyway lift someone as acceptable but i 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.700
 just wanted to do already 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.290
 long term anyway everyone wanted everything 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.320
 pads change things anyway 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.560
 temporarily unknown to correct and 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.780
 the engine is put on the hexagon 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.899
 all bolts are absolutely hexagons 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.670
 everything is tightened compacted much 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.149
 better than all those screwdrivers native corners 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.679
 were that door there all nonsense 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.429
 here I installed there two caps 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.229
 rubber bands 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:49.299
 here also put a seal because 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:52.869
 that not to rub the seat native so 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:59.600
 these then your was in perfect condition 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:02:02.000
 I am very much tested so 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.319
 things mrazota put new guys here 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.319
 also pay attention to become gum 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.489
 seal from the factory was a small gap 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.790
 that is not very beautiful 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.400
 it was considered that there was a seat and went there 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.989
 here just a little bit so I made a gum 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.849
 and tass machine with door seal 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:30.820
 the good thing is actually all grams 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:30.820
 traitor to do everything exactly 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:42.290
 Well, so in general, that's the whole bike as 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.680
 like a white diode on fire 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.700
 worth 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.069
 which is smaller battery signal as well 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.280
 in general, as it happens with us 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.970
 in a good condition 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.970
 when I show you
