00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 you should have seen the new ones 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.490
 inverted refrigerators 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.799
 those who have the refrigerator in the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.840
 up and a freezer on the bottom but 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.429
 with the advantage of these models over the 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.200
 traditional refrigerators 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.089
 our appliance specialist 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.890
 fernando hit shows us 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.080
 the main advantage of a refrigerator 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.970
 Inverted is because as the ergonomics 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.380
 refrigerator is at the top of the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.060
 equipment everything that we most people 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.310
 used is always at hand mainly 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.439
 the drawer of fruits vegetables and veggies 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.849
 which is always the item that is in the part 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.949
 lower refrigerator 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.030
 she stays more or less in the middle part 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.130
 of the equipment 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.890
 Another advantage of these models is that 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.079
 freezer he has drawers that facilitate the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.120
 organization of foods other than 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.140
 conventional models that have only 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.030
 shelves 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.110
 if we compare this model of electrolux 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:53.210
 is the b 52 x which has 454 liters of 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.010
 capacity with the w52 x model that has 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.480
 456 liters capacity and is a 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.550
 traditional refrigerator 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.649
 we notice that there are differences between 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.470
 refrigerator and freezer capacity 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.479
 for the models in this inverted model the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.600
 refrigerator has 310 liters of 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.210
 capacity and a freezer has 144 liters 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.330
 while the traditional model 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.100
 refrigerator has 343 liters and a freezer 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.420
 has 113 liters 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.790
 I did not find any explanation 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.860
 to justify the difference in the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.720
 capabilities but I believe it is 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.640
 to the fact that the freezer door 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.659
 Do not get too low and we can 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.700
 I opened it without needing insurance ba 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.960
 to sum up the inverted refrigerators 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.729
 function in the same way as the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.259
 traditional coolers such as 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.189
 generally we use the most 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.900
 refrigerator 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.430
 the fact that he is at the top of the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.579
 equipment facilitates access to 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.579
 foods 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.660
 the fact that it is inverted does not change the 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.850
 energy consumption compared to the 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.950
 traditional model with refrigerators 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.810
 invested were released they had the 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.119
 much higher price than the refrigerator 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.430
 conventional but today this 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.979
 difference is much less significant and there
