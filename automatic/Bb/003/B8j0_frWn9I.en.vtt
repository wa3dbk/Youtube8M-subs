00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
that's where you can actually really use

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.409 
that's where you can actually really use
what<00:06:06.160> you've<00:06:06.310> achieved<00:06:06.460> and<00:06:06.850> build<00:06:07.000> on<00:06:07.210> it<00:06:07.360> I

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
what you've achieved and build on it I

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:09.510
