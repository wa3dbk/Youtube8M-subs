 power is like a drug never is 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.300
 quite 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.619
 it is able to wear down people 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.010
 up to drive you crazy 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.460
 and as edmund burke said greater than the 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.980
 its most dangerous power is its abuse for 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.950
 which should not surprise us if many 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.890
 Governors and kings of history have been 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.930
 among the most wicked and ruthless characters 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.140
 of humanity with a single gesture 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.079
 command decided the fate of an o 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.879
 of thousands of people 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.370
 there are an infinite number of sovereigns and 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.010
 rulers who have consecrated theirs 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.309
 yield but few can match 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.160
 for wickedness and cruelty vlad iii of 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.390

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.670
 inspired by bram stoker that in 1897 sketched 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.559
 and what today is considered the novel 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.270
 famous forward of history

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.710
 and known throughout the world thanks to 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.290
 hollywood that has produced many films 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.420
 based on this figure is among the many 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.500
 Perhaps the most famous and precisely 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.270
 dracula of 1992 directed by francis ford 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.430
 coppola 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.439
 in this video we will tell you the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.730
 story that inspired this sadist 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:41.320
 character that is the story of vlad iii 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:44.350
 vlad iii was born November 2, 1431 a 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.360

 vlad ii also known as vlad 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.450
 dracul since he had obtained before 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.150
 the title of knight of the order of 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.400
 dragon an order whose main purpose 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.100
 was to protect interests 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.100
 of Catholicism in the East and of 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.020
 counter the Ottoman Empire 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.570
 this recognition was for blood 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.610
 according to a very important event that 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.310
 it will also mark the fate of the whole 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.370
 dynasty arrives from which in fact the name 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.830
 dracul that I was less means dragon o 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.440
 even the devil 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.810
 during his reign vlad ii used the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.850
 dragon symbol on its coins 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.710
 war banners and started 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.680
 even turn to voices of his own 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.230
 presumed pact with the devil the same 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.840
 vlad iii loved to be called and he was 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.310
 cool er that I was less means son of 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.850
 dracula and dominated the wall from the 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.740
 1456 to 1462 with incredible brutality 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.560
 and cruelty 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.540
 so much so that even today in the area yes 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.300
 he says his curse is still 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.040
 alive but what he did to deserve so much 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.049
 return 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.209
 we wanted blood was their basement 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.700
 obsessed with a particular method of 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.680
 torture impalement 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:17.000
 so much so that its most used name 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.700
 and breeds for that is the impaler he 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.060
 he usually learned the victim of people 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.819
 very far interrupting from time to time 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.550
 so much the torture to be able to shield it 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.640
 in visits following also loved the 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.040
 spectacular impaler once did 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.130
 even a forest of 20,000 Turks 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.200
 impaled and very often organized by 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.620
 banquets right in front of this is 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.540
 a touch of a showman but his 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.489
 cruelty does not stop this is a 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.519
 macabre act of torture 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:52.220
 in fact we know that in the club occasion 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.769
 rimini the sick and beggars in a 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.810
 palace of kings days and leave them at 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:00.769
 burn him to make the site either 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.170
 were a salt and wealthy people all 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.239
 this information comes from the diaries 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.489
 of the same club that used to be 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.239
 write that by bringing the number of 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.460
 victims 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.520
 and the tortures inflicted on them 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:17.070
 but what were the causes of so much 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.190
 aberration the explanation would not be 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.320
 episodes of his childhood at age 13 was 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.780
 been captured and held captive by the 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.410
 Turks here was the victim of an attack 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.390
 Sexual part of the sultan was really 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.930
 this episode to unleash him in 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.690
 its debauchery in fact during this 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.850
 period of imprisonment blood asked the 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.650
 guards to bring mice and birds to him 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.630
 to learn them and tear off their feathers 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:49.020
 you can imagine the fear that it inspired 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.940
 in his subjects blood indeed punished 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.460
 every crime and every form of 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.070
 recklessness with capital punishment without 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.590
 the least remorse 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.750
 but in his way he showed himself to be benevolent 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.950
 towards those who followed the 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.680
 its laws 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.510
 in fact it is said that in his kingdom 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.910
 there was a golden cup next to each 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.100
 fountain in such a way that even i 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.500
 poorer peasants could use the 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.590
 to drink and feel even for just one 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.930
 minute like the rich noble was 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.810
 there is also an engraving that read 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.110
 who allows themselves to steal this thing 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.780
 will be searched and found without any 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.660
 delay will be sentenced to death with 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.790
 The stake's punishment will be exposed 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.430
 of everything in the town square like 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.980
 straight example for those who would never have a 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.380
 similar thought 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.670
 the list of his atrocities is still 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.090
 very long 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.580
 for example in 1461 he impaled 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.550
 tens of thousands of people in 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.100
 only three hours to then sprinkle it with 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.800
 honey in order to attract any kind of 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:59.250
 insect and further increase the 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.050
 torment of the poor victims but the 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.690
 legend that fomented the myth of 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.760
 vampire tells about the vlad mania 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.100
 learn young virgins and di 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.100
 tap the blood he kept in one 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.290
 a little placed between the mugs of wine 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.510
 it seems that the prince loved and tastes 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.720
 precious liquid during the nights of 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:22.980
 full moon and called to offer to his parents 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:26.190
 unaware guests the life of vlad 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.560
 comes to an end in 1476 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.230
 when he died in combat against the 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.910
 Turks near Bucharest and in the 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.310
 desperate attempt to stop 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.900
 the enemy advance had used some 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.500
 fighting techniques ever 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:43.050
 experienced before it was indeed the first 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.180
 recruit an army of peasants for 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.250
 fight the enemies and decided 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.169
 voluntarily to destroy on his 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:52.110
 territory with the skies and mass that of the 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:53.919
 every possible source of 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.039
 supply that could result 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:59.139
 useful to his enemies and even comes to 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:01.139
 poison the wells to prevent theirs 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:03.909
 water use 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:06.789
 before the corpse was buried 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:09.699
 that continued to instill fear came 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:11.710
 beheaded with this burial 

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:13.870
 the earthly story of the count ends 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:17.289
 vlad the impaler son of dracula 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:21.789
 called dracula and here begins the legend 

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:23.949
 that we all know now you know that 

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:24.969
 no matter how frightening the count may be 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:27.099
 dracula 

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:30.189
 there is absolutely no comparison with vlad 

00:07:27.099 --> 00:07:32.469
 iii that it was certainly much more cruel 

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:35.409
 and hugely worse than 

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:37.509
 any vampire
