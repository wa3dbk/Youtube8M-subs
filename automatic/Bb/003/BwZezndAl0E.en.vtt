I<00:01:32.549> didn't<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:32.909> about<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.420> bladder<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.020> much

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
I didn't like about this bladder so much

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.490 
I didn't like about this bladder so much
is<00:01:35.210> cleaning<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.270> hose<00:01:36.479> did<00:01:37.110> get<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> little

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
is cleaning the hose did get a little

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.260 
is cleaning the hose did get a little
bit<00:01:37.650> difficult<00:01:38.250> because<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.000> fill

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
bit difficult because you have to fill

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.120 
bit difficult because you have to fill
around<00:01:39.420> or<00:01:39.750> taking<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.229> handle<00:01:40.650> off<00:01:40.799> before

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
around or taking this handle off before

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.219 
around or taking this handle off before
you<00:01:41.220> could<00:01:41.400> take<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.060> hose<00:01:42.240> off<00:01:42.509> which<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.200> a

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
you could take the hose off which is a

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.249 
you could take the hose off which is a
bit<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.920> pain<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.790> ass<00:01:45.240> however<00:01:46.049> that's

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
bit of a pain in the ass however that's

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.020 
bit of a pain in the ass however that's
been<00:01:46.439> sold<00:01:46.710> within<00:01:47.040> your<00:01:47.310> butter<00:01:47.549> as<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.880> can

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
been sold within your butter as you can

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.969 
been sold within your butter as you can
see<00:01:48.210> here<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:48.750> much<00:01:49.079> easier<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.740> able<00:01:49.829> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
see here it's much easier to be able to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.429 
see here it's much easier to be able to
disconnect<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.610> hose<00:01:50.960> overall<00:01:51.960> though<00:01:52.140> if

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
disconnect the hose overall though if

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.679 
disconnect the hose overall though if
this<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.040> only<00:01:53.250> thing<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.509> your

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:41.659 
now this helps you drive the bladder but
two<00:05:35.910> things<00:05:36.200> number<00:05:37.200> one<00:05:37.560> it's<00:05:39.440> not<00:05:40.440> too<00:05:41.340> bad

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
two things number one it's not too bad

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.990 
two things number one it's not too bad
to<00:05:41.940> get<00:05:42.180> inside<00:05:42.810> but<00:05:43.560> it<00:05:43.890> does<00:05:44.220> require<00:05:44.550> a

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
to get inside but it does require a

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.130 
to get inside but it does require a
little<00:05:45.600> bit<00:05:45.780> of<00:05:45.990> effort<00:05:46.560> to<00:05:46.770> get<00:05:46.950> in<00:05:47.220> there

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
little bit of effort to get in there

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.560 
little bit of effort to get in there
properly<00:05:49.850> that's<00:05:50.850> actually<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:51.300> easiest

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
properly that's actually the easiest

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.460 
properly that's actually the easiest
table<00:05:51.990> so<00:05:52.229> we've<00:05:52.380> gone<00:05:52.530> in<00:05:52.740> before<00:05:54.260> so<00:05:55.260> there's

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
table so we've gone in before so there's

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.000 
table so we've gone in before so there's
that

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
that

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.830 
that
annaclaire<00:05:56.370> I<00:05:56.760> don't<00:05:57.120> know<00:05:57.180> how<00:05:57.360> this<00:05:57.479> works

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
annaclaire I don't know how this works

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.510 
annaclaire I don't know how this works
yeah<00:05:58.200> I<00:05:58.229> guess<00:05:58.560> the<00:05:58.650> clan<00:05:58.860> you'll<00:05:59.130> hook<00:05:59.280> it<00:05:59.430> up

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
yeah I guess the clan you'll hook it up

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.550 
yeah I guess the clan you'll hook it up
somehow<00:05:59.930> offer<00:06:00.930> clotheslines<00:06:03.050> pain<00:06:04.050> in<00:06:04.350> the

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
somehow offer clotheslines pain in the
