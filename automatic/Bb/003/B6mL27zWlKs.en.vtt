your<00:00:04.859> world<00:00:05.040> waiter<00:00:05.370> in<00:00:06.150> micro<00:00:06.629> one<00:00:06.839> point

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
your world waiter in micro one point

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.470 
your world waiter in micro one point
three<00:00:07.230> point<00:00:07.500> two<00:00:07.649> on<00:00:07.830> using<00:00:08.189> them<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.639> it

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
three point two on using them and it

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.810 
three point two on using them and it
works<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.960> thing<00:00:10.139> for<00:00:10.320> one<00:00:10.500> point<00:00:10.710> two<00:00:10.889> point<00:00:11.130> I

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
works a thing for one point two point I

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.209 
works a thing for one point two point I
think<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.660> wasn't<00:00:12.809> one<00:00:13.080> point<00:00:13.290> eight<00:00:13.380> until

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
think it wasn't one point eight until

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.840 
think it wasn't one point eight until
now<00:00:14.519> I'm<00:00:15.389> sure<00:00:15.599> they<00:00:15.719> would

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
now I'm sure they would

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.490 
now I'm sure they would
so<00:00:19.340> let's<00:00:20.340> just<00:00:20.430> make<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.789> place<00:00:21.270> they<00:00:22.020> place

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
so let's just make the place they place

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.019 
so let's just make the place they place
about<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.250> doesn't<00:00:23.460> matter<00:00:23.609> happening<00:00:23.880> it

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
about in it doesn't matter happening it

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:33.209 
about in it doesn't matter happening it
is<00:00:24.150> really<00:00:24.420> by<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> severe<00:00:25.710> issue<00:00:25.980> size

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.219 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:56.569 

and<00:00:33.699> we<00:00:34.210> started<00:00:34.510> from<00:00:35.289> here

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
that's how much you're willing to go

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.050 
that's how much you're willing to go
tall<00:02:39.390> it's<00:02:40.200> just<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.470> keep<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.890> water<00:02:41.060> that's

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
tall it's just to keep the water that's

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.210 
tall it's just to keep the water that's
why<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.239> kept<00:02:42.420> decreasing<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.870> signs<00:02:43.220> and

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
why you kept decreasing the signs and

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.120 
why you kept decreasing the signs and
now<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.549> see<00:02:44.850> why<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:46.290> now<00:02:46.500> if<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.739> nice<00:02:46.860> water

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
now you see why so now if a nice water

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.759 
now you see why so now if a nice water
here<00:02:47.450> so<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.540> place<00:02:48.720> water<00:02:48.959> on<00:02:49.140> top<00:02:49.260> every

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
here so you place water on top every

00:02:49.769 --> 00:03:01.259 
here so you place water on top every
sign<00:02:50.299> and<00:02:51.299> keep<00:02:51.660> on<00:02:51.810> going<00:02:51.930> up<00:02:52.079> like<00:02:52.140> that

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.800 

there<00:03:02.269> we<00:03:02.360> go

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
there we go

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.770 
there we go
so<00:03:03.470> you<00:03:03.530> see<00:03:03.800> he<00:03:03.950> looks<00:03:04.099> like<00:03:04.400> this<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:08.720> now

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
so you see he looks like this and now

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.479 
so you see he looks like this and now
this<00:03:09.140> place<00:03:09.590> a<00:03:09.620> boat<00:03:09.950> on<00:03:10.190> water<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:11.170> Internet

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
this place a boat on water and Internet

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.070 
this place a boat on water and Internet
so<00:03:13.489> you<00:03:14.390> just<00:03:14.569> go<00:03:14.989> into<00:03:15.739> it<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:17.420> it<00:03:17.780> goes<00:03:17.900> up

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
so you just go into it and it goes up

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.059 
so you just go into it and it goes up
itself<00:03:18.440> I'm<00:03:19.099> not<00:03:19.160> doing<00:03:19.489> anything<00:03:19.730> right<00:03:19.970> now

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
itself I'm not doing anything right now

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.210 
itself I'm not doing anything right now
so<00:03:22.069> it's<00:03:22.250> just<00:03:22.430> really<00:03:22.760> easy<00:03:23.330> to<00:03:23.569> do<00:03:24.220> unless

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
so it's just really easy to do unless

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.970 
so it's just really easy to do unless
you're<00:03:25.430> in<00:03:26.200> survival<00:03:27.200> then<00:03:27.590> you<00:03:27.680> have<00:03:27.769> to

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
you're in survival then you have to

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.580 
you're in survival then you have to
craft<00:03:28.220> well<00:03:28.430> for<00:03:28.610> science<00:03:28.970> but<00:03:29.870> but

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
craft well for science but but

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.220 
craft well for science but but
fortunately<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:31.450> it's<00:03:32.450> update<00:03:32.780> you<00:03:33.019> can

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
fortunately and it's update you can

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.850 
fortunately and it's update you can
easily<00:03:33.530> craft<00:03:34.489> saris<00:03:34.819> and<00:03:34.970> stack<00:03:35.239> them<00:03:35.860> so

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
easily craft saris and stack them so

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:45.610 
easily craft saris and stack them so
it's<00:03:37.040> just<00:03:39.459> nice<00:03:40.459> pitch<00:03:44.230> also<00:03:45.230> you<00:03:45.290> can<00:03:45.470> take

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
it's just nice pitch also you can take

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.970 
it's just nice pitch also you can take
as<00:03:45.829> much<00:03:45.950> as<00:03:46.010> you<00:03:46.250> want<00:03:46.459> up<00:03:47.079> and<00:03:48.079> like<00:03:48.319> you<00:03:48.590> can

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
as much as you want up and like you can

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.009 
as much as you want up and like you can
make<00:03:49.160> him<00:03:51.099> respect<00:03:52.099> upon<00:03:52.340> here<00:03:52.989> where<00:03:53.989> that

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
make him respect upon here where that

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:07.690 
make him respect upon here where that
bottom<00:03:54.349> goes<00:03:54.530> up

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:18.460 

dad<00:04:08.700> go

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:27.749 

through<00:04:19.100> this<00:04:19.400> boat

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.249 

the<00:04:28.759> sunroom<00:04:29.150> thought<00:04:29.509> there<00:04:29.990> might<00:04:30.110> be<00:04:30.139> a

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:30.259 
the sunroom thought there might be a

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:33.010 
the sunroom thought there might be a
glitch<00:04:30.409> with<00:04:30.710> 1.3<00:04:31.159> inertial<00:04:31.819> and<00:04:32.629> can't<00:04:32.870> place

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
glitch with 1.3 inertial and can't place

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:41.170 
glitch with 1.3 inertial and can't place
a<00:04:33.050> body<00:04:33.289> and<00:04:33.650> you<00:04:33.680> stop<00:04:33.949> working<00:04:39.819> in<00:04:40.819> a<00:04:40.970> damn

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
a body and you stop working in a damn

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.980 
a body and you stop working in a damn
war
