all right now what I need to do is get

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.320 
all right now what I need to do is get
measurement<00:03:02.200> of<00:03:02.320> my<00:03:02.530> ring<00:03:02.950> size<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:04.060> then<00:03:04.210> I

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
measurement of my ring size and then I

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.010 
measurement of my ring size and then I
will<00:03:04.510> go<00:03:04.690> or<00:03:04.960> up<00:03:05.110> new<00:03:05.260> o-rings<00:03:06.690> alright<00:03:07.690> so

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
will go or up new o-rings alright so

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.150 
will go or up new o-rings alright so
here<00:03:08.260> are<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:10.440> clean<00:03:11.440> plates<00:03:11.830> cleaned<00:03:12.250> off

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
here are the clean plates cleaned off

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.890 
here are the clean plates cleaned off
that's<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.310> time<00:03:15.520> which<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:15.850> use<00:03:18.660> now<00:03:19.660> put

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
that's the time which I use now put
