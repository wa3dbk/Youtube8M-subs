at<00:00:14.730> Los<00:00:15.059> Angeles<00:00:15.269> Airport<00:00:15.750> runway<00:00:16.139> two<00:00:16.410> five

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
at Los Angeles Airport runway two five

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.950 
at Los Angeles Airport runway two five
right<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.460> there<00:00:18.390> are<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> couple<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.840> few

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
right so there are a couple of few

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.090 
right so there are a couple of few
things<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.289> need<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.529> take<00:00:19.680> care<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.859> by

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
things you need to take care of by

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.519 
things you need to take care of by
landing<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.609> aircraft<00:00:21.449> not<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:22.050> but<00:00:22.320> any

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
landing this aircraft not this but any

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.740 
landing this aircraft not this but any
aircraft<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:23.130> any<00:00:23.789> flight<00:00:24.090> simulator<00:00:24.330> so

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
aircraft in any flight simulator so

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.880 
aircraft in any flight simulator so
first<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.140> all<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.849> my<00:00:27.199> my<00:00:28.199> alignment<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
first of all is my my alignment in the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.470 
first of all is my my alignment in the
centreline<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.580> runway<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:30.060> should<00:00:30.300> keep

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
centreline of the runway I should keep

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.450 
centreline of the runway I should keep
my<00:00:30.660> self<00:00:30.929> aligned<00:00:31.260> with<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.560> runway<00:00:31.679> with<00:00:32.430> a

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
my self aligned with the runway with a

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.150 
my self aligned with the runway with a
centerline<00:00:32.910> as<00:00:33.270> much<00:00:33.600> as<00:00:33.750> possible<00:00:34.010> then<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
centerline as much as possible then the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.610 
centerline as much as possible then the
next<00:00:35.399> thing<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.700> speed<00:00:36.030> at<00:00:36.840> my<00:00:37.200> current<00:00:37.440> weight

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
next thing is speed at my current weight

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.280 
next thing is speed at my current weight
which<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.829> fifty<00:00:38.219> percent<00:00:38.489> full<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.290> should

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
which is fifty percent full I should

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.299 
which is fifty percent full I should
maintain<00:00:40.829> about<00:00:41.430> 150<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.120> 155<00:00:42.540> knots<00:00:43.309> three

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
maintain about 150 to 155 knots three

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.330 
maintain about 150 to 155 knots three
degrees<00:00:44.670> pitch<00:00:44.910> up<00:00:45.180> and/or<00:00:46.010> your<00:00:47.010> spiral

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
degrees pitch up and/or your spiral

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.490 
degrees pitch up and/or your spiral
should<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:47.789> arm<00:00:48.000> gear<00:00:48.390> should<00:00:48.629> be<00:00:48.780> down<00:00:48.989> flaps

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
should be arm gear should be down flaps

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.069 
should be arm gear should be down flaps
at<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> full<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.340> don't<00:00:50.910> apply<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.390> brakes

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
at the full and don't apply the brakes

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.689 
at the full and don't apply the brakes
so<00:00:52.260> from<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> beginning<00:00:52.680> apply<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.309> brakes

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
so from the beginning apply the brakes

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.770 
so from the beginning apply the brakes
after<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.239> have<00:00:54.329> touchdown

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
after you have touchdown

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.950 
after you have touchdown
so<00:00:55.649> okay<00:00:56.430> then<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.510> next<00:00:57.750> thing<00:00:57.870> is

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
so okay then and the next thing is

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.900 
so okay then and the next thing is
altitude<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.620> should<00:00:58.800> try<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.070> maintain<00:00:59.370> your

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
altitude you should try to maintain your

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.450 
altitude you should try to maintain your
right<00:01:00.690> now<00:01:00.870> I'm<00:01:00.989> doing<00:01:01.140> an<00:01:01.289> ILS<00:01:01.559> approach<00:01:01.710> so

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
right now I'm doing an ILS approach so

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.969 
right now I'm doing an ILS approach so
as<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.449> see<00:01:03.660> there's<00:01:04.080> an<00:01:04.229> indicator<00:01:04.559> out<00:01:04.769> here

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
as you see there's an indicator out here

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.070 
as you see there's an indicator out here
so<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> triangle<00:01:06.180> as<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.689> see<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
so the triangle as you see in the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.370 
so the triangle as you see in the
indicator<00:01:07.470> should<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:08.570> right<00:01:09.570> adjacent<00:01:10.049> to

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
indicator should be right adjacent to

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.830 
indicator should be right adjacent to
the<00:01:10.729> rectangle<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.970> if<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.510> above<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the rectangle and if it's above the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.179 
the rectangle and if it's above the
rectangle<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.439> means<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:13.950> need<00:01:14.130> to

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
rectangle it means that I need to

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.789 
rectangle it means that I need to
increase<00:01:14.430> my<00:01:14.640> oxygen<00:01:15.150> slightly<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:16.140> it's

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
increase my oxygen slightly if it's

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.249 
increase my oxygen slightly if it's
below<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.189> rectangle<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.330> means<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.990> need<00:01:19.049> to

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
below the rectangle it means I need to

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.620 
below the rectangle it means I need to
reduce<00:01:19.500> my<00:01:19.710> altitude<00:01:20.090> yes<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.390> adjacent

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
reduce my altitude yes so it's adjacent

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.550 
reduce my altitude yes so it's adjacent
now<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.200> should<00:01:22.409> maintain<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:24.290> so<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.409> two

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
now I should maintain that so the two

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.929 
now I should maintain that so the two
bars<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.040> see<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.400> runway<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.670> should

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
bars that you see on the runway I should

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.380 
bars that you see on the runway I should
try<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.210> land<00:01:27.659> my<00:01:27.900> aircraft<00:01:28.170> there

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.050 

at<00:01:32.390> about<00:01:32.690> 20<00:01:33.170> at<00:01:33.710> about<00:01:33.920> 20<00:01:34.190> feet<00:01:34.310> I<00:01:34.460> will<00:01:34.520> pull

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
at about 20 at about 20 feet I will pull

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.560 
at about 20 at about 20 feet I will pull
up<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:35.530> set<00:01:36.530> my<00:01:36.680> thrusters<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.280> zero<00:01:37.610> and<00:01:37.820> then

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
up and set my thrusters to zero and then

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.400 
up and set my thrusters to zero and then
once<00:01:38.780> F<00:01:38.990> -<00:01:39.140> done<00:01:39.350> I<00:01:39.530> will<00:01:39.590> set<00:01:40.460> brakes<00:01:41.060> I<00:01:41.410> will

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
once F - done I will set brakes I will

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.260 
once F - done I will set brakes I will
apply<00:01:42.620> the<00:01:42.680> brakes<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:43.340> once<00:01:43.640> my<00:01:43.820> nose<00:01:43.850> gear

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
apply the brakes and once my nose gear

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.230 
apply the brakes and once my nose gear
Esther's<00:01:44.690> down<00:01:44.900> I<00:01:45.080> will<00:01:45.730> you<00:01:46.730> need<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:47.090> you

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
Esther's down I will you need to you

00:01:47.240 --> 00:02:04.690 
Esther's down I will you need to you
know<00:01:47.980> start<00:01:48.980> the<00:01:49.070> reverse<00:01:49.610> thrust<00:02:03.490> yeah<00:02:04.490> so

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
know start the reverse thrust yeah so

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.310 
know start the reverse thrust yeah so
we're<00:02:04.850> on<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.060> ground<00:02:05.300> you<00:02:05.450> see<00:02:05.479> how<00:02:05.810> close<00:02:06.110> I

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
we're on the ground you see how close I

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
flaps to zero so as you saw during you

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.760 
flaps to zero so as you saw during you
saw<00:02:28.520> you<00:02:28.730> might<00:02:28.760> have<00:02:29.060> noticed<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:29.770> during

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
saw you might have noticed that during

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.740 
saw you might have noticed that during
the<00:02:30.950> just<00:02:31.370> few<00:02:31.670> seconds<00:02:31.970> before<00:02:32.090> dress<00:02:32.360> down<00:02:32.510> a

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
the just few seconds before dress down a

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.009 
the just few seconds before dress down a
message<00:02:33.470> came<00:02:33.709> regarding<00:02:34.370> stall<00:02:34.670> now<00:02:35.239> that<00:02:35.630> we

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
message came regarding stall now that we

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.540 
message came regarding stall now that we
were<00:02:36.170> actually<00:02:36.320> we<00:02:36.920> were<00:02:37.040> actually<00:02:37.430> not

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
were actually we were actually not

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.940 
were actually we were actually not
stalling<00:02:38.000> but<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.420> was<00:02:38.600> because<00:02:39.019> our<00:02:39.320> pitch

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
stalling but it was because our pitch

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.850 
stalling but it was because our pitch
was<00:02:40.160> a<00:02:40.190> little<00:02:40.610> bit<00:02:40.730> higher<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.510> a<00:02:42.080> thrusters

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
was a little bit higher and a thrusters

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.890 
was a little bit higher and a thrusters
were<00:02:43.040> at<00:02:43.310> zero<00:02:43.760> so<00:02:44.090> that's<00:02:44.300> why<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.540> message

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
were at zero so that's why the message

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.960 
were at zero so that's why the message
had<00:02:45.019> come<00:02:45.260> otherwise<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.280> was<00:02:46.459> a<00:02:46.489> perfectly

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
had come otherwise it was a perfectly

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.300 
had come otherwise it was a perfectly
smooth<00:02:47.420> landing

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
smooth landing

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.250
