is to take the pen capsule and shove it
firmly<00:01:18.850> into<00:01:19.300> the<00:01:19.540> tip<00:01:21.899> once<00:01:22.899> it's<00:01:23.140> in<00:01:23.289> there

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
firmly into the tip once it's in there

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.590 
firmly into the tip once it's in there
firmly<00:01:23.680> cut<00:01:24.610> it<00:01:24.729> off<00:01:24.910> with<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.270> heavy

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
firmly cut it off with the heavy

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:34.550 
firmly cut it off with the heavy
scissors<00:01:29.910> should<00:01:30.910> look<00:01:31.090> exactly<00:01:31.420> like<00:01:31.720> that

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.290 

once<00:01:35.560> that's<00:01:35.740> done<00:01:36.070> you<00:01:36.610> will<00:01:36.759> no<00:01:36.910> longer<00:01:36.940> need

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
once that's done you will no longer need

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.380 
once that's done you will no longer need
the<00:01:37.539> scissors<00:01:38.160> or<00:01:39.160> the<00:01:39.460> tube<00:01:41.460> now<00:01:42.490> we<00:01:42.880> will

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
the scissors or the tube now we will

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.310 
the scissors or the tube now we will
turn<00:01:43.600> our<00:01:43.750> attention<00:01:44.160> the<00:01:45.160> sawzall<00:01:45.729> blade

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
turn our attention the sawzall blade

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.650 
turn our attention the sawzall blade
we're<00:01:47.320> gonna<00:01:47.440> be<00:01:47.590> grinding<00:01:48.100> off<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:49.090> extras

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
we're gonna be grinding off the extras

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.980 
we're gonna be grinding off the extras
so<00:01:50.440> it<00:01:50.560> can<00:01:50.679> fit<00:01:51.009> easily<00:01:51.220> in<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.570> compartment

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
so it can fit easily in the compartment

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.810 
so it can fit easily in the compartment
right<00:01:53.680> here<00:01:55.350> since<00:01:56.350> grinding<00:01:56.920> will<00:01:57.189> be<00:01:57.430> very

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
right here since grinding will be very

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.730 
right here since grinding will be very
noisy<00:01:58.360> and<00:01:58.390> very<00:01:59.130> flashing<00:02:00.130> hard<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:01.000> use<00:02:01.270> I

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
noisy and very flashing hard to use I

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.649 
noisy and very flashing hard to use I
will<00:02:02.740> not<00:02:03.040> be<00:02:03.220> filming<00:02:03.549> any<00:02:03.880> other<00:02:04.060> grinding

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
will not be filming any other grinding

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.020 
will not be filming any other grinding
but<00:02:05.020> I<00:02:05.049> will<00:02:05.229> show<00:02:05.439> you<00:02:05.500> step<00:02:05.650> by<00:02:06.040> step<00:02:06.070> start

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
but I will show you step by step start

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.090 
but I will show you step by step start
by<00:02:07.329> grinding<00:02:07.509> off<00:02:07.840> all<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.229> extras<00:02:08.739> for<00:02:08.979> the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
by grinding off all the extras for the

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.449 
by grinding off all the extras for the
blade<00:02:09.310> until<00:02:09.670> it<00:02:09.970> can<00:02:10.090> fit<00:02:11.040> within<00:02:12.040> reason

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
blade until it can fit within reason

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.970 
blade until it can fit within reason
this<00:02:13.030> part<00:02:15.900> now<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:16.930> blades<00:02:17.410> been<00:02:17.620> grinded

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
this part now that blades been grinded

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.979 
this part now that blades been grinded
down<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.370> where<00:02:18.519> it<00:02:18.670> will<00:02:18.820> roughly<00:02:19.540> fit<00:02:19.840> in

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
down to where it will roughly fit in

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.490 
down to where it will roughly fit in
here<00:02:20.400> all<00:02:21.400> we<00:02:21.670> need<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:22.000> do<00:02:22.120> now<00:02:22.329> is<00:02:22.870> grind<00:02:23.350> the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
here all we need to do now is grind the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.740 
here all we need to do now is grind the
blade<00:02:23.709> out<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.310> so<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.030> will<00:02:25.120> fit<00:02:25.390> in<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.630> other

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
blade out I so it will fit in the other

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.770 
blade out I so it will fit in the other
end<00:02:26.019> of<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.200> short<00:02:26.470> bead<00:02:27.209> what<00:02:28.209> we<00:02:28.329> also<00:02:28.480> need

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
end of the short bead what we also need

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.220 
end of the short bead what we also need
to<00:02:28.900> do<00:02:29.049> is<00:02:29.799> grind<00:02:30.100> it<00:02:30.220> down<00:02:30.250> more<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:31.989> it<00:02:32.110> will

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
to do is grind it down more so it will

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.520 
to do is grind it down more so it will
not<00:02:32.459> touch<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.670> end<00:02:33.850> of<00:02:34.000> this<00:02:34.209> because<00:02:34.720> that

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
not touch the end of this because that

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.949 
not touch the end of this because that
just<00:02:35.799> won't<00:02:35.920> fit<00:02:36.180> since<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.329> will<00:02:37.390> be<00:02:37.450> melted

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
just won't fit since it will be melted

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.900 
just won't fit since it will be melted
down<00:02:38.079> into<00:02:38.440> here<00:02:38.920> we<00:02:39.220> won't<00:02:39.400> need<00:02:39.519> to<00:02:39.670> do<00:02:39.880> that

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
down into here we won't need to do that

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.110 
down into here we won't need to do that
but<00:02:40.360> if<00:02:40.720> your<00:02:41.160> jigsaw<00:02:42.160> blade<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.610> longer<00:02:42.970> than

but if your jigsaw blade is longer than

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.150 
but if your jigsaw blade is longer than
the<00:02:43.269> one<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:43.450> was<00:02:43.570> using<00:02:43.989> you<00:02:44.380> will<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:44.920> need<00:02:45.040> to

the one I was using you will you need to

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.110 
the one I was using you will you need to
cut<00:02:45.310> it<00:02:45.430> down<00:02:45.549> a<00:02:45.610> bit

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
cut it down a bit
