of it because that'll have to be welded
up<00:03:33.769> here<00:03:34.769> somewhere<00:03:35.579> where<00:03:36.000> once<00:03:36.329> I<00:03:36.450> get<00:03:36.570> this

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
up here somewhere where once I get this

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.800 
up here somewhere where once I get this

probably<00:04:12.780> lightly<00:04:13.230> weld<00:04:13.470> them<00:04:13.650> in<00:04:13.829> you<00:04:14.640> know

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
probably lightly weld them in you know

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.340 
probably lightly weld them in you know
so<00:04:15.329> if<00:04:15.420> ever<00:04:15.630> I<00:04:15.660> do<00:04:15.780> have<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:15.959> remove<00:04:16.140> them<00:04:16.260> I

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
so if ever I do have to remove them I

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.440 
so if ever I do have to remove them I
could<00:04:16.470> just<00:04:16.620> cut<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.130> weld<00:04:17.250> right<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.239> was

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
could just cut the weld right it was

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.270 
could just cut the weld right it was
like<00:04:18.510> cut<00:04:18.750> in<00:04:18.840> half<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.470> all<00:04:19.560> I<00:04:19.620> do<00:04:19.769> is<00:04:19.979> get<00:04:20.130> up

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
like cut in half and all I do is get up

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.880 
like cut in half and all I do is get up
pair<00:04:20.850> of<00:04:20.940> threaded<00:04:21.299> rod<00:04:21.590> regular<00:04:22.590> threaded

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
pair of threaded rod regular threaded

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.250 
pair of threaded rod regular threaded
rod<00:04:23.039> and<00:04:23.190> reverse<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.610> rod<00:04:23.880> but<00:04:24.060> finding<00:04:24.750> 3/4

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260

you<00:04:26.990> think<00:04:27.290> I<00:04:27.530> gotta<00:04:28.070> order<00:04:28.250> some<00:04:28.370> offline<00:04:29.350> he

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
you think I gotta order some offline he

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.080 
you think I gotta order some offline he
only<00:04:30.500> saw<00:04:30.650> three-foot<00:04:31.040> chunk<00:04:31.310> we'll<00:04:31.520> need<00:04:31.790> six

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
only saw three-foot chunk we'll need six

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.020 
only saw three-foot chunk we'll need six
inches<00:04:32.390> but<00:04:32.630> whatever<00:04:33.070> but<00:04:34.070> yeah<00:04:34.490> then<00:04:35.000> a

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
inches but whatever but yeah then a

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.600 
inches but whatever but yeah then a
couple<00:04:35.390> nuts<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:35.960> you<00:04:36.050> B<00:04:36.200> will<00:04:36.470> adjust<00:04:37.430> it

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
couple nuts and you B will adjust it

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.630 
couple nuts and you B will adjust it
back<00:04:37.790> and<00:04:38.030> forth<00:04:38.270> and<00:04:39.310> that'll<00:04:40.310> be<00:04:40.430> how<00:04:40.580> you

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
back and forth and that'll be how you

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.030 
back and forth and that'll be how you
adjust<00:04:40.820> your<00:04:41.210> torn<00:04:42.080> into<00:04:42.290> out<00:04:43.870> and<00:04:44.870> then<00:04:45.830> with

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
adjust your torn into out and then with

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.590 
adjust your torn into out and then with
couple<00:04:46.460> extra<00:04:46.670> knots<00:04:46.820> TV<00:04:47.030> will<00:04:47.180> lock<00:04:47.360> it<00:04:47.510> into

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
couple extra knots TV will lock it into

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.330 
couple extra knots TV will lock it into
place<00:04:47.750> something<00:04:48.080> original<00:04:48.620> design<00:04:49.010> went<00:04:49.250> to

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
place something original design went to

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.590 
place something original design went to
log<00:04:49.550> you<00:04:49.760> anyway<00:04:50.030> it's<00:04:50.180> not<00:04:50.330> that<00:04:50.480> it<00:04:50.570> should

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
log you anyway it's not that it should

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.200 
log you anyway it's not that it should
ever<00:04:50.840> move<00:04:51.380> I<00:04:51.590> mean<00:04:51.740> how<00:04:51.890> would<00:04:52.160> it<00:04:52.190> but<00:04:53.090> it

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
ever move I mean how would it but it

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.480 
ever move I mean how would it but it
allows<00:04:53.540> you<00:04:53.720> to<00:04:53.810> lock<00:04:53.990> into<00:04:54.230> place<00:04:54.470> you<00:04:55.370> know

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
allows you to lock into place you know

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.510 
allows you to lock into place you know
so<00:04:56.590> then<00:04:57.590> I<00:04:57.740> yeah<00:04:58.010> then<00:04:58.190> it's<00:04:58.280> just<00:04:58.340> a<00:04:58.460> matter

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
so then I yeah then it's just a matter

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.630 
so then I yeah then it's just a matter
of<00:04:58.700> connecting<00:04:58.970> that<00:04:59.210> to<00:05:00.130> the<00:05:01.130> steering<00:05:01.460> box

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
of connecting that to the steering box

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.110 
of connecting that to the steering box
which<00:05:01.910> I<00:05:02.300> got<00:05:02.510> another<00:05:02.720> piece<00:05:03.380> of<00:05:03.440> pipe<00:05:03.740> that

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
which I got another piece of pipe that

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.490 
which I got another piece of pipe that
I'll<00:05:05.120> connect<00:05:05.390> that<00:05:05.510> to<00:05:05.570> together<00:05:06.110> soul

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
I'll connect that to together soul

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.100 
I'll connect that to together soul
steering<00:05:07.490> once<00:05:07.700> they<00:05:07.850> get<00:05:07.940> the<00:05:08.420> arm<00:05:08.600> roll<00:05:08.960> it

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
steering once they get the arm roll it

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.670 
steering once they get the arm roll it
up<00:05:09.290> and<00:05:09.470> bolted<00:05:10.040> on<00:05:10.160> is<00:05:11.230> than<00:05:12.230> he<00:05:12.350> has<00:05:12.530> to

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
up and bolted on is than he has to

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.170 
up and bolted on is than he has to
moving<00:05:12.950> pretty<00:05:13.250> much<00:05:13.430> is<00:05:13.550> almost<00:05:13.730> done<00:05:13.970> them

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
moving pretty much is almost done them

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.240 
moving pretty much is almost done them
so<00:05:15.790> that's<00:05:16.790> probably<00:05:17.390> about<00:05:17.630> it<00:05:17.810> so<00:05:18.320> yeah<00:05:19.130> as

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
so that's probably about it so yeah as

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.620 
so that's probably about it so yeah as
far<00:05:19.400> as<00:05:19.460> radio<00:05:19.820> your<00:05:19.940> goal<00:05:20.120> is<00:05:20.210> cleaning<00:05:20.540> the

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
far as radio your goal is cleaning the

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.030 
far as radio your goal is cleaning the
hood<00:05:20.810> it<00:05:20.930> shouldn't<00:05:21.230> I<00:05:21.350> don't<00:05:21.620> see<00:05:21.740> that<00:05:21.860> being

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
hood it shouldn't I don't see that being

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.200 
hood it shouldn't I don't see that being
a<00:05:22.160> force<00:05:22.400> see<00:05:22.520> that<00:05:22.670> being<00:05:22.820> a<00:05:22.880> problem<00:05:23.000> with

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
a force see that being a problem with

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.630 
a force see that being a problem with
hoods<00:05:23.450> tall<00:05:23.750> enough<00:05:24.160> either<00:05:25.160> if<00:05:25.340> I<00:05:25.430> use<00:05:25.610> that

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
hoods tall enough either if I use that

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.460 
hoods tall enough either if I use that
radiator<00:05:26.300> or<00:05:26.540> the<00:05:26.570> other<00:05:26.810> one<00:05:26.960> that<00:05:27.080> I<00:05:27.110> got<00:05:27.350> in

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
radiator or the other one that I got in

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.760 
radiator or the other one that I got in
my<00:05:27.590> van<00:05:28.630> you<00:05:29.630> know<00:05:29.690> still<00:05:30.080> in<00:05:30.110> there<00:05:30.380> either

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
my van you know still in there either

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.500 
my van you know still in there either
which<00:05:31.250> are<00:05:31.430> on<00:05:31.610> inside<00:05:31.880> you<00:05:32.030> shouldn't<00:05:32.420> be<00:05:32.480> a

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
which are on inside you shouldn't be a

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.190 
which are on inside you shouldn't be a
problem

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
problem

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.810

you<00:05:33.560> know<00:05:33.650> if<00:05:33.710> it<00:05:33.830> tilts<00:05:34.010> up<00:05:34.220> the<00:05:34.370> other<00:05:34.520> way<00:05:34.700> it

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
you know if it tilts up the other way it

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.270 
you know if it tilts up the other way it
should<00:05:35.090> clear<00:05:35.570> just<00:05:35.780> fine<00:05:35.990> this<00:05:36.980> is<00:05:37.160> this<00:05:37.220> a

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
should clear just fine this is this a

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.690 
should clear just fine this is this a
cool<00:05:37.910> hood<00:05:38.800> that's<00:05:39.800> a<00:05:39.920> closed<00:05:40.250> hood

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700
