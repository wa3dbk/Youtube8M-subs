awesome arcade machine plays awesome

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.080 
awesome arcade machine plays awesome
games<00:00:06.629> like<00:00:06.930> Metal<00:00:07.140> Slug<00:00:07.350> 2<00:00:07.790> contain<00:00:08.790> such

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
games like Metal Slug 2 contain such

games like Metal Slug 2 contain such
awesome<00:00:09.510> games<00:00:09.750> it<00:00:10.050> takes<00:00:10.410> awesomely<00:00:11.040> big

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
awesome games it takes awesomely big

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.459 
awesome games it takes awesomely big
cartridges<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:12.690> was<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.019> good<00:00:13.259> they

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
cartridges it was so good they

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.770 
cartridges it was so good they
manufacture<00:00:14.070> them<00:00:14.219> for<00:00:14.400> almost<00:00:14.549> 15<00:00:15.240> years

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
manufacture them for almost 15 years

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.320 
manufacture them for almost 15 years
but<00:00:16.440> times<00:00:16.680> do<00:00:16.980> move<00:00:17.220> on<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.820> although<00:00:18.150> it's

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
but times do move on and although it's

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.019 
but times do move on and although it's
still<00:00:18.449> awesome<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.410> could<00:00:19.680> now<00:00:19.859> be<00:00:20.130> even<00:00:20.609> more

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
still awesome it could now be even more

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.679 
still awesome it could now be even more
awesome<00:00:21.680> take<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.859> video<00:00:23.100> an<00:00:23.279> audio<00:00:23.550> output

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
awesome take the video an audio output

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.330 
awesome take the video an audio output
having<00:00:24.689> been<00:00:24.869> designed<00:00:25.080> all<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.769> way<00:00:25.890> back<00:00:26.130> in

the Vale 880's its video output is

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.980 
the Vale 880's its video output is
basically<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.400> same<00:00:29.580> as<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> old<00:00:30.060> TV<00:00:30.359> format

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
basically the same as the old TV format

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.280 
basically the same as the old TV format
with<00:00:31.230> some<00:00:31.500> differences<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:33.059> audience<00:00:33.420> out

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
converted to analog we need to make some

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.730 
converted to analog we need to make some
modifications<00:01:05.900> here's<00:01:06.900> where<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.200> wimp<00:01:07.530> out<00:01:07.680> a

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
modifications here's where I wimp out a

modifications here's where I wimp out a
bit<00:01:08.070> not<00:01:08.729> wanting<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.150> risk<00:01:09.390> damaging<00:01:09.659> my

expensive cartridge race Neo Geo I

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.929 
expensive cartridge race Neo Geo I
experimented<00:01:13.650> with<00:01:13.890> one<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.549> cheaper

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
experimented with one of the cheaper

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.999 
experimented with one of the cheaper
later<00:01:15.180> boards<00:01:15.630> which<00:01:15.930> had<00:01:16.140> hardware<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.920> a

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
later boards which had hardware and a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
game combined into one these chips form

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.550

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
parts of the digital to analog video

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.130 
parts of the digital to analog video
conversion<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.909> we<00:01:23.939> tap<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.390> video<00:01:24.630> signals

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
conversion so we tap the video signals

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.830 
conversion so we tap the video signals
off<00:01:25.320> here<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.369> audio<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.939> converted<00:01:27.479> by<00:01:27.630> this

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
off here the audio is converted by this

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.319 
off here the audio is converted by this
chip<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:28.860> take<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.250> inputs<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
chip so we take the inputs to that to

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.580 
chip so we take the inputs to that to
the<00:01:31.229> NeoGeo<00:01:31.829> being<00:01:32.250> old<00:01:32.579> runs<00:01:33.150> at<00:01:33.329> 5<00:01:33.540> volts<00:01:33.590> so

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the NeoGeo being old runs at 5 volts so

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.830 
the NeoGeo being old runs at 5 volts so
the<00:01:34.710> next<00:01:34.920> stop<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.520> signal<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.119> voltage

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
the next stop for the signal is voltage

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.980 
the next stop for the signal is voltage
dividers<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.560> bring<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.130> 5<00:01:38.640> volts<00:01:39.060> input<00:01:39.360> down

work with then into a low-end fpga which

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.969 
work with then into a low-end fpga which

the static glow of the scan lines of the

a button arcade games are all about
quick<00:03:10.620> reflexes<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.090> fpga<00:03:12.629> code<00:03:13.079> adds<00:03:13.440> as

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
quick reflexes so the fpga code adds as

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.160 
quick reflexes so the fpga code adds as
little<00:03:14.040> delay<00:03:14.310> as<00:03:14.489> possible<00:03:14.940> in<00:03:15.569> fact<00:03:15.930> it's

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
little delay as possible in fact it's

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.979 
little delay as possible in fact it's
just<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.500> hundred<00:03:16.829> microseconds<00:03:17.569> modern<00:03:18.569> tvs

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
just a hundred microseconds modern tvs

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.780 
just a hundred microseconds modern tvs
like<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.470> add<00:03:19.590> their<00:03:19.769> own<00:03:19.799> delays<00:03:20.250> but<00:03:20.609> as<00:03:20.700> we

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
like to add their own delays but as we

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.530 
like to add their own delays but as we
can<00:03:20.970> see<00:03:21.150> here<00:03:21.450> it's<00:03:21.840> not<00:03:21.900> bad<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:24.090> that's<00:03:24.329> all

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
can see here it's not bad and that's all

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.640 
can see here it's not bad and that's all
I<00:03:24.569> have<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:24.959> say<00:03:25.169> about<00:03:25.260> it

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
I have to say about it

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.860 
I have to say about it
as<00:03:26.190> always<00:03:26.669> the<00:03:27.090> code<00:03:27.269> is<00:03:27.419> available<00:03:27.540> on

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
as always the code is available on

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.750 
as always the code is available on
github<00:03:28.109> so<00:03:28.919> go<00:03:29.069> grab<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.430> if<00:03:29.579> you're

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
github so go grab it if you're

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.000 
github so go grab it if you're
interested<00:03:30.299> I'm<00:03:30.989> sure<00:03:31.319> we<00:03:31.530> proved<00:03:31.799> wrong

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
interested I'm sure we proved wrong

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.620 
interested I'm sure we proved wrong
within<00:03:32.400> minutes<00:03:32.579> but<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.120> don't<00:03:33.389> believe

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
within minutes but I don't believe

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.629 
within minutes but I don't believe
there's<00:03:34.049> any<00:03:34.260> publicly<00:03:34.889> available<00:03:35.099> working

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
there's any publicly available working

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
code for encoding audio over HDMI so if

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.129 
code for encoding audio over HDMI so if
you're<00:03:38.849> interested<00:03:39.060> in<00:03:39.389> doing<00:03:39.569> that<00:03:39.720> then

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
you're interested in doing that then

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.889 
you're interested in doing that then
check<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.560> out<00:03:40.680> as<00:03:40.859> well
