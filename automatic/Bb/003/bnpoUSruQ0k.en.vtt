a<00:03:07.260> three-day<00:03:08.160> delay<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:09.239> think<00:03:09.900> we're<00:03:10.019> about

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
a three-day delay I think we're about

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.710 
a three-day delay I think we're about
ready<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.590> get<00:03:10.739> started<00:03:11.190> on<00:03:11.280> this<00:03:11.519> and<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:12.060> went

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
ready to get started on this and I went

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.420 
ready to get started on this and I went
ahead<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.110> pulled<00:03:13.410> up<00:03:13.620> this<00:03:13.769> corner<00:03:14.070> post

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
ahead and pulled up this corner post

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.039 
ahead and pulled up this corner post
because<00:03:15.030> it's<00:03:15.209> going<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:15.420> be<00:03:15.510> in<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.690> way<00:03:15.810> of

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
because it's going to be in the way of

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.920 
because it's going to be in the way of
trying<00:03:16.320> to<00:03:16.440> get<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.489> blocks<00:03:18.299> up<00:03:18.570> to<00:03:18.810> the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
trying to get the blocks up to the

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.560 
trying to get the blocks up to the
concrete<00:03:19.410> here<00:03:19.769> so<00:03:20.100> got<00:03:21.060> that<00:03:21.239> out<00:03:21.420> of<00:03:21.450> the

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
concrete here so got that out of the

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.110 
concrete here so got that out of the
ground<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:22.140> out<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.410> way<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.940> like<00:03:23.940> this

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
ground and out of the way and like this

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.550 
ground and out of the way and like this
chain<00:03:24.390> Lee<00:03:24.570> part<00:03:25.049> of<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.170> fence<00:03:25.410> will

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
chain Lee part of the fence will

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.640 
chain Lee part of the fence will
probably<00:03:25.980> come<00:03:26.820> down<00:03:26.850> later<00:03:27.840> on<00:03:28.079> but<00:03:28.410> I'm<00:03:28.530> not

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
probably come down later on but I'm not

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.280 
probably come down later on but I'm not
worrying<00:03:28.950> about<00:03:29.010> that<00:03:29.190> now<00:03:29.420> but<00:03:30.420> yep

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
worrying about that now but yep

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.530 
worrying about that now but yep
so<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.950> think<00:03:32.549> it's<00:03:32.730> time<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:33.000> get<00:03:33.120> started<00:03:33.299> on

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
so I think it's time to get started on

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.090 
so I think it's time to get started on
this<00:03:35.720> we<00:03:36.720> got<00:03:36.840> some<00:03:37.170> light<00:03:37.350> flying<00:03:37.620> directly

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
this we got some light flying directly

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:45.550 
this we got some light flying directly
overhead

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.589 

well<00:03:47.660> getting<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.830> footing<00:03:49.830> dug<00:03:50.040> here<00:03:50.599> trim

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
well getting the footing dug here trim

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.930 
well getting the footing dug here trim
back<00:03:51.750> my<00:03:51.959> azaleas<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.560> little<00:03:52.769> bit<00:03:52.950> or<00:03:53.730> getting

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
back my azaleas a little bit or getting

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.170 
back my azaleas a little bit or getting
the<00:03:54.150> outline<00:03:54.450> going<00:03:55.069> all<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:56.310> way<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.519> a<00:03:56.790> post

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
the outline going all the way to a post

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.869 
the outline going all the way to a post
where<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:57.780> used<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:58.050> be<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:59.010> tree<00:03:59.370> stump<00:03:59.670> might

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
where it used to be the tree stump might

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.770 
where it used to be the tree stump might
be<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.090> bit<00:04:00.300> of<00:04:00.390> a<00:04:00.450> problem<00:04:00.720> but<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.680> won't<00:04:02.010> be

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
be a bit of a problem but it won't be

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.479 
be a bit of a problem but it won't be
too<00:04:03.780> bad<00:04:03.810> we've<00:04:04.410> got<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:04.620> marked<00:04:05.010> right<00:04:05.220> there

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
too bad we've got it marked right there

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.089 
too bad we've got it marked right there
it<00:04:06.330> might<00:04:06.510> be<00:04:06.569> in<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.900> way<00:04:07.049> that<00:04:07.410> we'll<00:04:07.920> see

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
it might be in the way that we'll see

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.949 
it might be in the way that we'll see
how<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.310> goes<00:04:08.480> all<00:04:09.480> right<00:04:09.690> looks<00:04:10.049> like<00:04:10.170> the

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
how it goes all right looks like the

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.809 
how it goes all right looks like the
footing<00:04:12.959> is<00:04:13.170> dug<00:04:13.590> I'll<00:04:14.280> get<00:04:14.489> right<00:04:14.580> for<00:04:14.730> the

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
footing is dug I'll get right for the

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.659 
footing is dug I'll get right for the
concrete<00:04:15.269> well<00:04:16.229> that's<00:04:16.560> four<00:04:17.160> bags<00:04:17.459> of

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
concrete well that's four bags of

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.699 
concrete well that's four bags of
concrete<00:04:17.910> so<00:04:18.450> far<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:19.019> we've<00:04:19.320> still<00:04:19.500> got<00:04:19.680> a

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
concrete so far and we've still got a

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.300 
concrete so far and we've still got a
little<00:04:19.799> ways<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.070> go

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
little ways to go

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.240 
little ways to go
we've<00:04:23.310> only<00:04:23.430> got<00:04:23.720> about<00:04:24.720> six<00:04:25.260> bags<00:04:25.530> left<00:04:25.919> in

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
we've only got about six bags left in

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.659 
we've only got about six bags left in
there<00:04:26.490> so<00:04:26.820> hopefully<00:04:27.330> we'll<00:04:27.960> have<00:04:28.080> enough<00:04:28.669> all

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
there so hopefully we'll have enough all

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.400 
there so hopefully we'll have enough all
right<00:04:29.850> putting<00:04:30.360> us<00:04:30.570> down<00:04:32.090> it<00:04:33.090> only<00:04:33.300> took<00:04:33.570> seven

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
right putting us down it only took seven

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.860 
right putting us down it only took seven
bags<00:04:34.770> of<00:04:35.010> concrete<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:35.910> we'll<00:04:36.270> just<00:04:36.419> use<00:04:36.510> that

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
bags of concrete so we'll just use that

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.680 
bags of concrete so we'll just use that
inside<00:04:37.289> the<00:04:37.410> blocks<00:04:37.669> all<00:04:38.669> right<00:04:39.000> so<00:04:39.389> the<00:04:39.539> wall

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
end because yeah bit of a slope had to

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.830 
end because yeah bit of a slope had to
account<00:06:05.199> for<00:06:05.819> so<00:06:06.819> that's<00:06:07.120> all<00:06:07.300> loaded<00:06:07.569> up<00:06:07.779> with

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:14.770 
of all ten bags of hardened concrete

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.650 
of all ten bags of hardened concrete
that<00:07:15.190> was<00:07:15.280> left<00:07:15.520> over<00:07:15.670> from<00:07:15.850> last<00:07:16.150> year<00:07:16.540> so

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:16.660 
that was left over from last year so

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.600 
that was left over from last year so
that's<00:07:17.020> all<00:07:17.260> busted<00:07:17.710> up<00:07:17.830> and<00:07:18.010> inside<00:07:18.430> the

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.610 
that's all busted up and inside the

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:23.550 
that's all busted up and inside the
blocks<00:07:18.850> and<00:07:21.090> yeah<00:07:22.090> at<00:07:22.930> least<00:07:23.170> we<00:07:23.260> got<00:07:23.410> rid<00:07:23.500> of

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 
blocks and yeah at least we got rid of

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.540 
blocks and yeah at least we got rid of
all<00:07:23.710> that<00:07:23.770> and<00:07:24.250> I<00:07:25.440> got<00:07:26.440> some<00:07:26.620> block<00:07:27.220> debris

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:27.550 
all that and I got some block debris

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.460 
all that and I got some block debris
left<00:07:27.850> over<00:07:28.000> it<00:07:28.270> usually<00:07:28.630> gets<00:07:28.720> busted<00:07:29.020> up<00:07:29.290> and

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:29.470 
left over it usually gets busted up and

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.810 
left over it usually gets busted up and
put<00:07:29.590> in<00:07:29.710> there<00:07:29.860> but<00:07:30.010> guess<00:07:30.400> there<00:07:30.550> wasn't

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:30.820 
put in there but guess there wasn't

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.070 
put in there but guess there wasn't
enough<00:07:30.970> room<00:07:31.150> for<00:07:31.180> all<00:07:31.450> that<00:07:31.690> so<00:07:31.870> I'll<00:07:31.960> just

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 
enough room for all that so I'll just

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.070 
enough room for all that so I'll just
have<00:07:32.230> to<00:07:32.320> get<00:07:32.470> rid<00:07:32.560> of<00:07:32.650> it<00:07:32.830> but<00:07:33.700> yeah<00:07:34.690> again

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:35.080 
have to get rid of it but yeah again

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.430 
have to get rid of it but yeah again
this<00:07:35.290> turned<00:07:35.500> out<00:07:35.650> pretty<00:07:35.740> good<00:07:35.980> and<00:07:37.440> glad

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:38.440

this turned out pretty good and glad
it's<00:07:38.590> done<00:07:38.790> probably<00:07:39.790> a<00:07:39.940> little<00:07:40.120> overkill<00:07:40.540> you

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:40.900 
it's done probably a little overkill you

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.140 
it's done probably a little overkill you
know<00:07:41.080> not<00:07:41.590> really<00:07:41.740> fully<00:07:42.340> necessary<00:07:42.820> but<00:07:43.000> ya

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:43.150

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.060 
know it least got a either a place to
sit<00:07:45.880> or<00:07:46.090> a<00:07:46.120> workbench<00:07:46.990> if<00:07:47.290> need<00:07:47.500> be<00:07:47.530> or
