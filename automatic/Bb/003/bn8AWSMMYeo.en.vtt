00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.980
 fine 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.279
 A hug, bye. 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.080
 after a busy day like today we 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.439
 I get home almost without battery 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.849
 different from lg optimus alive 7 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.849
 There are still many hours of battery life. 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.280
 did you know that LG has a 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.989
 sister company called lg kan who is a leader 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.280
 world market in the battery market for 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.180
 eletric cars 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.890
 There you go. 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.150
 Imagine the batteries it produces 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.040
 This is a victory and not a phone. 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.269
 is any car do not take a look 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.120
 on these machines 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:04.559
 are electric cars of the largest 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.090
 car makers in the world is just a car in whom 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.970
 has expertise in developing batteries 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.920
 for cases like these it sure will. 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.200
 offer the most powerful battery as well 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.570
 for smartphones and that's why you 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.970
 You'll understand now why the battery came out. 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.369
 plus is the best on the market 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.259
 I asked for the victory to get these two 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.800
 containers to represent two 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:30.590
 batteries one and the other of 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:34.170
 lg optimus 4x smartphones hdl 9 and l7 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.050
 common batteries are composed only 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.570
 by graphite cores that are 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.210
 large particles represented here 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.240
 For those big balls, how can you? 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.210
 realize they do not fully fulfill the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.990
 leaving too much empty space in the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.380
 medium 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.080
 This means that we will have less 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.570
 particles accumulating energy in the battery 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.509
 the batteries of lg cell phones 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.390
 optimus who own the technology is left 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.689
 plus are also composed of nuclei of 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.079
 graphite, but they also rely on the 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:13.590
 addition of silicon oxide to the 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:16.739
 graphite cores and looks only at 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.470
 are reduced to almost zero 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.700
 that means the batteries is gone 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.070
 plus lg accumulate much more energy 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.310
 very cool example marcel but in 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:34.049
 practice this means what it means 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:37.829
 battery savings of 5 to 25% or 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:41.430
 be a top-of-the-line device like the LG 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:43.920
 optimus 4x hd you pull out of the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.100
 morning and will only need to return to 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.840
 carry on bedtime 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.210
 using the whole day with high 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.360
 performance on devices with 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.070
 average specification as the lg optimus r 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.320
 7 er 9 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.650
 You can use up to two days 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.080
 followed without having to carry 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.020
 the durability of the battery for much more 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.390
 than most smartphones 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:14.180
 just manage the connectivity 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.830
 wireless as 3g bluetooth wifi and gps 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.380
 leaving off what you are not off 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.360
 using that moment you already gave 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.190
 understand that the battery went out plus 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.740
 present on several smartphones in the line 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.870
 lg optimus is much higher than 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.360
 any other device is not personal 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.910
 It is also important to mention that even 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.460
 lg optimus devices that do not have 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.830
 technology is gone plus has a great 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.240
 battery performance compared to 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.370
 market competitors 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.400
 wow I think I need a 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.470
 This battery I put into my life but already 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.400
 it's a good size she's not the lg 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.370
 optimus 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.709
 so that's it folks the best battery 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.690
 for the smartphone family 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.330
 complete and powerful market 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.500
 I hope you have enjoyed coming 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.130
 much more out there 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.130
 to the next
