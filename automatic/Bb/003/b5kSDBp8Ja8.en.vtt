between<00:05:07.280> this<00:05:07.460> and<00:05:07.760> whoops<00:05:08.570> Mario<00:05:08.930> Kart<00:05:09.169> other

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
between this and whoops Mario Kart other

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.629 
between this and whoops Mario Kart other
than<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:09.560> fact<00:05:09.770> that<00:05:09.860> it's<00:05:10.039> on<00:05:10.160> your<00:05:10.280> iPhone

different characters oh sorry I'm
actually<00:05:18.590> not<00:05:18.919> bad<00:05:19.099> at<00:05:19.250> this<00:05:19.370> game<00:05:19.460> I'm<00:05:19.789> just

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
actually not bad at this game I'm just

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.279 
actually not bad at this game I'm just
terrible<00:05:20.360> at<00:05:20.510> it<00:05:20.630> while<00:05:20.780> playing<00:05:20.990> through<00:05:21.169> an

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
terrible at it while playing through an

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.190 
terrible at it while playing through an
iPhone<00:05:21.820> on<00:05:22.820> an<00:05:23.150> iPad<00:05:23.479> that's<00:05:23.900> double

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
iPhone on an iPad that's double

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.589 
iPhone on an iPad that's double
confusing<00:05:24.680> so<00:05:25.669> there<00:05:25.789> you<00:05:25.849> have<00:05:25.910> it<00:05:26.030> it's<00:05:26.360> a

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
confusing so there you have it it's a

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:29.320 
confusing so there you have it it's a
lot<00:05:26.930> of<00:05:27.050> fun<00:05:27.340> and<00:05:28.340> I<00:05:28.700> think<00:05:28.970> it's<00:05:29.120> worthwhile

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
lot of fun and I think it's worthwhile

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.350 
lot of fun and I think it's worthwhile
to<00:05:30.130> pick<00:05:31.130> up<00:05:31.280> especially<00:05:31.880> since<00:05:32.030> it's<00:05:32.180> free

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
to pick up especially since it's free

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.350 
to pick up especially since it's free
big<00:05:33.080> my<00:05:33.560> two<00:05:33.620> big<00:05:33.979> things<00:05:34.669> that<00:05:34.820> I<00:05:34.940> don't<00:05:35.180> like

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
big my two big things that I don't like

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.469 
big my two big things that I don't like
about<00:05:35.389> this<00:05:36.099> one<00:05:37.099> is<00:05:37.340> the<00:05:37.610> fact<00:05:37.880> that<00:05:38.030> it<00:05:38.330> does

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
about this one is the fact that it does

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.120 
about this one is the fact that it does
not<00:05:38.599> have<00:05:38.810> online<00:05:39.200> multiplayer<00:05:39.560> you<00:05:39.889> can<00:05:40.039> only

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
not have online multiplayer you can only

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.730 
not have online multiplayer you can only
play<00:05:40.370> locally<00:05:40.789> which<00:05:40.970> is<00:05:41.120> a<00:05:41.150> huge<00:05:41.450> bummer<00:05:41.740> and

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
play locally which is a huge bummer and

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.400 
play locally which is a huge bummer and
then<00:05:43.190> the<00:05:43.310> other<00:05:43.550> is<00:05:43.910> that<00:05:44.510> this<00:05:45.080> is<00:05:45.229> not

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
then the other is that this is not

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.159 
then the other is that this is not
connected<00:05:45.710> to<00:05:45.919> the<00:05:46.430> web<00:05:46.880> version<00:05:47.570> which<00:05:47.990> I

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
connected to the web version which I

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.520 
connected to the web version which I
think<00:05:48.669> if<00:05:49.669> I<00:05:49.789> if<00:05:50.060> my<00:05:50.090> if<00:05:50.630> memory<00:05:50.840> serves<00:05:50.960> a

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
think if I if my if memory serves a

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.950 
think if I if my if memory serves a
third<00:05:51.830> of<00:05:52.039> Korea<00:05:52.340> has<00:05:52.580> played<00:05:52.880> on<00:05:53.240> the<00:05:53.840> web

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
third of Korea has played on the web
