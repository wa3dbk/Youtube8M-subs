galaxy<00:01:45.000> lies<00:01:45.770> Genesis<00:01:46.770> itself<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.729> creation

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
galaxy lies Genesis itself the creation

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.810 
galaxy lies Genesis itself the creation
of<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.840> universe<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.649> explosion<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.610> Big

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
of the universe the explosion the Big

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.789 
of the universe the explosion the Big
Bang<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.299> created<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> entire<00:01:52.079> universe

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
Bang that created the entire universe

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.249 
Bang that created the entire universe
that's<00:01:53.189> what<00:01:53.460> lies<00:01:53.640> beyond<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.720> galaxy<00:01:55.200> so

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
that's what lies beyond this galaxy so

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.100 
that's what lies beyond this galaxy so
we<00:01:55.380> are<00:01:55.500> one<00:01:55.710> step<00:01:55.979> closer<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.119> we're<00:01:57.960> one

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
we are one step closer to that we're one

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.020 
we are one step closer to that we're one
step<00:01:58.350> closer<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.890> actually<00:01:59.369> getting<00:01:59.729> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
step closer to actually getting the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.060 
step closer to actually getting the
secret<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.079> origin<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.040> universe

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
secret of the origin of the universe

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.490 
secret of the origin of the universe
itself<00:02:02.969> what<00:02:03.450> happens<00:02:03.810> next<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.290> this

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
itself what happens next in this

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.920 
itself what happens next in this
potential<00:02:05.100> discovery<00:02:05.759> how<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.420> confirmed

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
potential discovery how is it confirmed

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.779 
potential discovery how is it confirmed
and<00:02:07.469> we<00:02:07.500> learned<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.280> actually<00:02:08.610> not<00:02:08.640> a

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
and we learned that it is actually not a

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.729 
and we learned that it is actually not a
candidate<00:02:09.300> but<00:02:09.450> real<00:02:09.720> as<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.020> point<00:02:10.259> out<00:02:10.349> well

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
candidate but real as you point out well

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.500 
candidate but real as you point out well
we<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.129> analyze<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.610> light<00:02:11.790> again

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
we have to analyze the light again

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.330 
we have to analyze the light again
Space<00:02:12.720> Telescope<00:02:13.230> its<00:02:13.439> shutter<00:02:13.709> was<00:02:13.890> open<00:02:13.920> for

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
Space Telescope its shutter was open for

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.580 
Space Telescope its shutter was open for
a<00:02:14.400> hundred<00:02:14.849> hours<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:15.810> know<00:02:15.900> at<00:02:16.019> a<00:02:16.049> camera<00:02:16.349> you

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
a hundred hours you know at a camera you

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.530 
a hundred hours you know at a camera you
only<00:02:16.739> open<00:02:17.099> it<00:02:17.189> for<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.370> half<00:02:17.549> a<00:02:17.670> second<00:02:18.120> lesson

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
only open it for a half a second lesson

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.449 
only open it for a half a second lesson
there's<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.930> hundred<00:02:19.530> hours<00:02:19.799> to<00:02:20.129> get<00:02:20.280> that

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
there's a hundred hours to get that

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.449 
there's a hundred hours to get that
faint<00:02:20.879> light<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.780> photograph<00:02:22.349> by<00:02:23.129> the<00:02:23.189> Hubble

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
faint light to photograph by the Hubble

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.339 
faint light to photograph by the Hubble
Space<00:02:23.489> Telescope<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.480> has<00:02:24.599> to<00:02:24.750> be<00:02:24.840> verified

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
Space Telescope so it has to be verified

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.780 
Space Telescope so it has to be verified
each<00:02:25.709> year<00:02:25.860> we<00:02:26.010> hope<00:02:26.129> we<00:02:26.250> come<00:02:26.400> back<00:02:26.549> on<00:02:26.760> when

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
each year we hope we come back on when

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.089 
each year we hope we come back on when
more<00:02:27.629> verification<00:02:27.870> comes<00:02:28.439> in<00:02:28.590> but<00:02:28.680> right<00:02:28.890> now

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
more verification comes in but right now

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.420 
more verification comes in but right now
this<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.310> sterling<00:02:29.640> news<00:02:29.940> thank<00:02:30.269> you
