we're knee to knee with like a cup of

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.009 
we're knee to knee with like a cup of
coffee<00:03:52.650> between<00:03:53.159> us<00:03:53.489> trying<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.030> figure<00:03:54.989> out

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
coffee between us trying to figure out

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.240 
coffee between us trying to figure out
this<00:03:55.349> stuff<00:03:55.680> together<00:03:56.239> which<00:03:57.470> maybe<00:03:58.470> we<00:03:59.069> need

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
this stuff together which maybe we need

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.520 
this stuff together which maybe we need
right<00:03:59.459> now

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.770 

yeah<00:04:03.280> well<00:04:03.520> I<00:04:03.550> think<00:04:03.700> that<00:04:04.090> going<00:04:04.480> and

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
yeah well I think that going and

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.620 
yeah well I think that going and
traveling<00:04:05.230> very<00:04:05.770> literally<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:07.030> very<00:04:07.330> literal

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
traveling very literally to very literal

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.620 
traveling very literally to very literal
places<00:04:08.020> is<00:04:08.200> about<00:04:09.130> as<00:04:09.370> much<00:04:09.820> the<00:04:10.030> opposite<00:04:10.480> of

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
places is about as much the opposite of

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.500 
places is about as much the opposite of
like<00:04:11.320> the<00:04:11.620> Facebook<00:04:12.100> blogosphere<00:04:12.510> virtual

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510

I'm not sure whether people live in that

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.370 
I'm not sure whether people live in that
world<00:04:24.130> quite<00:04:24.460> as<00:04:24.550> much<00:04:24.730> as<00:04:24.940> as<00:04:25.380> commentators

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
world quite as much as as commentators

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.010 
world quite as much as as commentators
like<00:04:26.680> to<00:04:26.830> imagine<00:04:27.250> that<00:04:27.370> they<00:04:27.520> do<00:04:27.580> I<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:28.900> know

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
like to imagine that they do I you know

like to imagine that they do I you know
I<00:04:29.050> still<00:04:29.980> feel<00:04:30.040> like<00:04:30.430> people<00:04:30.580> have<00:04:30.790> a<00:04:30.850> lot<00:04:31.060> of

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
I still feel like people have a lot of

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.170 
I still feel like people have a lot of
interpretive<00:04:31.770> interpersonal<00:04:32.910> contact<00:04:33.910> and

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
interpretive interpersonal contact and

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.610 
interpretive interpersonal contact and
communication<00:04:34.990> with<00:04:35.080> each<00:04:35.110> other<00:04:35.350> in<00:04:35.500> really

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
communication with each other in really

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.920 
communication with each other in really
real<00:04:35.830> ways<00:04:36.040> although<00:04:36.420> there's<00:04:37.420> nothing<00:04:37.780> like

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
real ways although there's nothing like

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.840 
real ways although there's nothing like
actually<00:04:38.200> going<00:04:38.680> to<00:04:38.920> Naples<00:04:39.280> and<00:04:39.430> eating<00:04:39.760> a

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.780 
actually going to Naples and eating a
pizza<00:04:40.060> you<00:04:40.660> know<00:04:40.780> um<00:04:41.050> to<00:04:41.950> make<00:04:42.490> you<00:04:42.580> feel<00:04:42.700> like

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790

you're<00:04:42.940> really<00:04:43.060> in<00:04:43.180> a<00:04:43.360> place<00:04:43.510> doing<00:04:44.020> a<00:04:44.200> thing

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
you're really in a place doing a thing

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.490 
you're really in a place doing a thing
but<00:04:45.700> I<00:04:45.760> don't<00:04:46.030> think<00:04:46.270> that<00:04:46.540> I'm<00:04:46.900> not<00:04:47.080> sure<00:04:47.290> that

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
but I don't think that I'm not sure that

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.190 
but I don't think that I'm not sure that
the<00:04:47.650> dream<00:04:48.010> of<00:04:48.040> pilgrimage<00:04:48.850> is<00:04:49.120> new<00:04:49.600> you<00:04:50.080> know

the dream of pilgrimage is new you know
I<00:04:50.500> think<00:04:51.190> it's<00:04:51.660> hardwired<00:04:52.660> into<00:04:52.990> us<00:04:53.290> in<00:04:53.620> some

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
I think it's hardwired into us in some

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.530 
I think it's hardwired into us in some
way<00:04:54.190> the<00:04:54.850> yearning<00:04:55.260> to<00:04:56.340> to<00:04:57.340> step<00:04:57.669> aside<00:04:57.850> from

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
way the yearning to to step aside from

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.680 
way the yearning to to step aside from
the<00:04:58.780> fold<00:04:59.080> and<00:04:59.410> the<00:04:59.590> clan<00:04:59.919> and<00:05:00.310> go<00:05:01.180> off<00:05:01.330> into

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
distance is that's something that is

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.230

earth and I think the way I did it was

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.730 
earth and I think the way I did it was
just<00:05:20.320> a<00:05:20.890> way<00:05:21.040> that<00:05:21.070> was<00:05:21.790> reflective<00:05:22.419> of<00:05:22.740> you
