you<00:03:58.100> have<00:03:58.220> an<00:03:58.310> issue<00:03:58.460> with<00:03:58.790> this<00:03:59.450> burning<00:03:59.840> out

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
you have an issue with this burning out

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.280 
you have an issue with this burning out
like<00:04:00.760> you<00:04:01.760> got<00:04:02.240> it<00:04:02.360> if<00:04:02.630> you're<00:04:02.930> doing<00:04:03.080> this<00:04:03.140> on

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
like you got it if you're doing this on

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.760 
like you got it if you're doing this on
the<00:04:03.410> server<00:04:03.650> check<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.250> plugins<00:04:04.640> because

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
the server check the plugins because

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.100 
the server check the plugins because
we're<00:04:06.770> the<00:04:06.800> torch<00:04:07.370> is<00:04:07.550> facing<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.360> other<00:04:08.960> way

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
we're the torch is facing the other way

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.140 
we're the torch is facing the other way
you<00:04:09.260> should<00:04:09.410> empower<00:04:09.890> that<00:04:10.280> because<00:04:11.030> they're

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
you should empower that because they're

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.400 
you should empower that because they're
both<00:04:11.330> facing<00:04:11.540> different<00:04:11.870> ways<00:04:12.110> and<00:04:12.290> are

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
both facing different ways and are

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.290 
both facing different ways and are
supposed<00:04:12.710> to<00:04:12.740> be<00:04:12.830> activated<00:04:13.340> and<00:04:13.700> go<00:04:14.030> into

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
supposed to be activated and go into

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.070 
supposed to be activated and go into
each<00:04:14.630> other<00:04:15.549> so<00:04:16.549> just<00:04:16.910> ask<00:04:17.060> your<00:04:17.239> admin<00:04:17.780> if<00:04:17.989> you

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
each other so just ask your admin if you

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.930 
each other so just ask your admin if you
can't<00:04:18.260> see<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.410> plugins<00:04:18.830> or<00:04:19.010> whatever<00:04:19.760> plugs

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
can't see the plugins or whatever plugs

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.860 
can't see the plugins or whatever plugs
they<00:04:20.180> have<00:04:20.709> ok<00:04:22.270> so<00:04:23.270> just<00:04:23.390> connect<00:04:23.720> that<00:04:23.840> up

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
they have ok so just connect that up

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.620 
they have ok so just connect that up
with<00:04:24.170> the<00:04:24.290> input<00:04:25.000> and<00:04:26.000> then<00:04:26.210> on<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.480> output

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
with the input and then on the output

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.430 
with the input and then on the output
you<00:04:27.380> go<00:04:27.530> in<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.740> back<00:04:27.890> and<00:04:28.420> then<00:04:29.420> just<00:04:29.630> go

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
you go in the back and then just go

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.880 
you go in the back and then just go
straight<00:04:30.950> into<00:04:31.340> that<00:04:31.520> piston<00:04:35.500> just<00:04:36.500> like<00:04:36.650> that

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
straight into that piston just like that

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.240 
straight into that piston just like that
so<00:04:37.760> that<00:04:37.910> way<00:04:38.110> when<00:04:39.110> you<00:04:39.260> activate<00:04:39.860> this<00:04:40.040> T

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
so that way when you activate this T

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.690 
so that way when you activate this T
flip-flop<00:04:40.700> it<00:04:40.970> turns<00:04:41.810> this<00:04:42.320> off<00:04:42.620> which<00:04:43.430> would

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
flip-flop it turns this off which would

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.270 
flip-flop it turns this off which would
pull<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.240> block<00:04:44.720> back<00:04:44.990> in<00:04:45.200> and<00:04:45.920> if<00:04:46.040> there's<00:04:46.190> no

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
pull the block back in and if there's no

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.040 
pull the block back in and if there's no
block<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.820> breasts<00:04:47.480> of<00:04:47.540> repeater<00:04:47.840> ok

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
block the breasts of repeater ok

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.270 
block the breasts of repeater ok
empowered<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:48.440> piston<00:04:48.770> if<00:04:48.890> we<00:04:48.950> can't<00:04:49.130> pry<00:04:49.250> out

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
empowered the piston if we can't pry out

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.610 
empowered the piston if we can't pry out
the<00:04:49.370> piston<00:04:49.730> it<00:04:49.820> turns<00:04:50.000> off<00:04:50.290> which<00:04:51.290> makes<00:04:51.500> it

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
the piston it turns off which makes it

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.000 
the piston it turns off which makes it
very<00:04:51.680> calm<00:04:52.160> very<00:04:52.190> little<00:04:53.120> work<00:04:54.080> going<00:04:54.530> on<00:04:54.650> here

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
very calm very little work going on here

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.850 
very calm very little work going on here
and<00:04:55.520> it<00:04:55.700> works<00:04:55.850> out<00:04:56.090> really<00:04:56.300> good<00:04:59.410> and<00:05:00.410> then<00:05:00.560> so

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
and it works out really good and then so

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.770 
and it works out really good and then so
what<00:05:01.220> you<00:05:01.310> want<00:05:01.460> to<00:05:01.550> do<00:05:01.640> is<00:05:02.180> just<00:05:02.240> stop<00:05:02.630> the

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
what you want to do is just stop the

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.970 
what you want to do is just stop the
clock<00:05:02.990> up<00:05:04.870> as<00:05:05.870> you<00:05:05.990> can<00:05:06.140> see<00:05:06.290> it<00:05:06.380> works<00:05:06.560> very

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
clock up as you can see it works very

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.500 
clock up as you can see it works very
good<00:05:07.900> so<00:05:08.900> just<00:05:09.110> turn<00:05:09.290> it<00:05:09.440> off

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
good so just turn it off

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.570 
good so just turn it off
and<00:05:11.290> there<00:05:11.860> you<00:05:11.980> go<00:05:13.860> and<00:05:14.860> so<00:05:15.100> if<00:05:15.250> the<00:05:15.370> clock

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
and there you go and so if the clock

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.190 
and there you go and so if the clock
doesn't<00:05:15.790> start<00:05:15.940> from<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.480> server<00:05:16.690> for<00:05:17.050> some

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
doesn't start from the server for some

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.230 
doesn't start from the server for some
reason<00:05:17.500> all<00:05:18.040> you<00:05:18.190> want<00:05:18.340> to<00:05:18.430> do<00:05:18.550> just<00:05:18.850> dig<00:05:19.090> down

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
reason all you want to do just dig down

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.340 
reason all you want to do just dig down
here<00:05:20.250> put<00:05:21.250> a<00:05:21.280> block<00:05:21.520> their<00:05:22.230> continued<00:05:23.230> it

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
here put a block their continued it

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:29.660 
here put a block their continued it
along

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:35.270 

and<00:05:30.670> just<00:05:30.970> connect<00:05:31.270> it<00:05:31.360> up

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.580 

just<00:05:36.280> like<00:05:36.400> that<00:05:36.550> so<00:05:37.240> for<00:05:37.840> some<00:05:37.990> reason<00:05:38.020> the

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
just like that so for some reason the

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.800 
just like that so for some reason the
clock<00:05:38.800> doesn't<00:05:39.010> start<00:05:39.160> like<00:05:39.490> this<00:05:39.670> all<00:05:40.630> you

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
clock doesn't start like this all you

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.920 
clock doesn't start like this all you
have<00:05:40.900> to<00:05:40.960> do<00:05:41.220> just<00:05:42.220> press<00:05:42.430> this<00:05:42.550> button<00:05:42.790> and<00:05:43.120> it

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
have to do just press this button and it

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.340 
have to do just press this button and it
starts<00:05:44.200> it<00:05:44.290> up<00:05:44.380> again<00:05:45.420> and<00:05:46.420> so<00:05:46.780> that's<00:05:47.020> how<00:05:47.290> you

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
starts it up again and so that's how you

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.570 
starts it up again and so that's how you
make<00:05:47.470> it<00:05:47.680> so<00:05:48.430> like<00:05:48.850> the<00:05:49.030> video<00:05:49.240> and<00:05:49.270> subscribe
