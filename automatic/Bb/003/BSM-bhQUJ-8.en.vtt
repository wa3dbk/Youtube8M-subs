00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
serrated pieces on the back which we saw

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.249

earlier<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.549> our<00:01:23.850> model<00:01:24.509> number<00:01:24.750> two<00:01:24.960> and

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
earlier on on our model number two and

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.200 
earlier on on our model number two and
we've<00:01:25.470> got<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> digit<00:01:26.009> capture<00:01:26.340> hole<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:27.090> this

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
we've got a digit capture hole so this

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.830 
we've got a digit capture hole so this
is<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.450> much<00:01:27.600> more<00:01:27.750> aggressive<00:01:27.869> tool<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.840> it's

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
is a much more aggressive tool and it's

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.310 
is a much more aggressive tool and it's
named<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.290> Ronson<00:01:31.770> ater<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.670> actually<00:01:33.060> had<00:01:33.270> a
