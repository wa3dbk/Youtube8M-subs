mentally tough I know I put in all these
hours<00:04:32.139> and<00:04:32.550> that's<00:04:33.550> not<00:04:33.729> that's<00:04:33.909> really<00:04:34.270> a<00:04:34.300> big

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
hours and that's not that's really a big

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.960 
hours and that's not that's really a big
goal<00:04:34.840> is<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:35.740> put<00:04:35.949> in<00:04:36.070> more<00:04:36.250> time<00:04:36.310> than<00:04:36.849> my

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
goal is to put in more time than my

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.270 
goal is to put in more time than my
opponent<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:37.539> know<00:04:38.409> I'm<00:04:38.650> working<00:04:38.949> harder<00:04:39.159> than

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.890 
opponent I know I'm working harder than
my<00:04:39.400> opponent<00:04:39.789> he<00:04:40.389> probably<00:04:40.630> knows<00:04:40.810> it<00:04:40.990> too

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
my opponent he probably knows it too

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.689 
my opponent he probably knows it too
that's<00:04:43.900> a<00:04:44.050> big<00:04:44.229> break<00:04:44.380> down<00:04:44.620> on<00:04:44.740> him<00:04:44.949> he<00:04:45.550> knows

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
that's a big break down on him he knows

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.060 
that's a big break down on him he knows
I'm<00:04:45.909> really<00:04:46.389> in<00:04:46.479> top<00:04:46.659> condition<00:04:47.070> already

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
I'm really in top condition already

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.700 
I'm really in top condition already
coming<00:04:48.250> after<00:04:48.580> him

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710

I'm<00:04:49.830> just<00:04:50.340> that<00:04:50.490> much<00:04:50.520> ahead<00:04:50.910> of<00:04:50.970> him<00:04:51.120> before<00:04:51.360> I

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
I'm just that much ahead of him before I

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.990 
I'm just that much ahead of him before I
even<00:04:51.539> start<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:51.930> match<00:04:52.580> and<00:04:53.580> through<00:04:53.759> all<00:04:53.880> this

even start to match and through all this

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.300 
even start to match and through all this
training<00:04:54.300> it<00:04:54.600> makes<00:04:54.630> me<00:04:55.020> when<00:04:55.800> I<00:04:55.830> got<00:04:56.039> that

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
training it makes me when I got that

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.590 
training it makes me when I got that
I've<00:04:56.669> never<00:04:56.850> got<00:04:57.000> to<00:04:57.090> where<00:04:57.240> bomb<00:04:57.419> and

I've never got to where bomb and

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.330 
I've never got to where bomb and

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
conditioning all I have to do is wrestle

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.980 
conditioning all I have to do is wrestle
as<00:04:59.610> hard<00:04:59.820> as<00:04:59.910> I<00:05:00.000> can<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.360> whole<00:05:00.509> time<00:05:00.690> I'm<00:05:00.840> out

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
as hard as I can the whole time I'm out

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:07.550 
as hard as I can the whole time I'm out
there<00:05:04.639> the<00:05:05.639> Russians<00:05:06.150> they're<00:05:06.990> very<00:05:07.139> strong

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.219 
there the Russians they're very strong
very<00:05:08.009> very<00:05:08.310> strong<00:05:08.639> and<00:05:09.449> then<00:05:09.810> part<00:05:10.080> one<00:05:10.199> of

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
very very strong and then part one of

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.870 
very very strong and then part one of
the<00:05:10.320> reasons<00:05:10.620> I<00:05:10.830> guess<00:05:11.009> they<00:05:11.250> are<00:05:11.370> on<00:05:11.490> a<00:05:11.520> really

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
the reasons I guess they are on a really

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.810 
the reasons I guess they are on a really
strict<00:05:12.060> weight<00:05:12.330> program<00:05:13.160> Japanese<00:05:14.160> are

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
strict weight program Japanese are

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.310 
strict weight program Japanese are
really<00:05:14.880> slick<00:05:15.389> they<00:05:15.840> can<00:05:16.050> they<00:05:16.169> got

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
really slick they can they got

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.290 
really slick they can they got
tremendous<00:05:16.500> technique<00:05:17.039> and<00:05:17.729> they<00:05:17.940> really<00:05:18.210> got

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
tremendous technique and they really got

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.420 
tremendous technique and they really got
a<00:05:18.360> lot<00:05:18.690> of<00:05:18.720> good<00:05:18.900> pros

then that the only metal that could be

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.879 
then that the only metal that could be
better<00:06:51.490> but<00:06:51.820> being<00:06:52.690> Olympic<00:06:53.080> gold<00:06:53.260> and<00:06:53.530> that's

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:53.889 
better but being Olympic gold and that's
