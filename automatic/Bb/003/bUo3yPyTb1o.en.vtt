00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.270
 hello everybody I cover therapy 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.750
 welcome to this new video 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.790
 how many times we have put have been 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.560
 imposed we say not really safe 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.840
 well it happened to me to put it to 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.759
 example outside a car 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.860
 even outside a helicopter e 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.570
 unfortunately I didn't have these yet 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.020
 security laces we say they are 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:38.559
 remained very anxious about losing 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.359
 this camera means to go 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.489
 about € 500 in smoke 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:45.250
 well there are these laces in 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:49.420
 safety of the words of about 10 euros 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.489
 which allow us to say enjoy a 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.100
 little more what you are 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.800
 doing while your body is 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.010
 thus filming available colors 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.050
 we have yellow green fluo as far as 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.250
 regards the measures we have 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:10.800
 measuring 20 cm the sts me 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.990
 30 centimeters and the skin that measures 45 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.060
 centimeters therefore luckily these 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.650
 laces that are produced entirely 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.140
 in italy from the guys of go smooth with 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.900
 highly existing par accord material 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.520
 coming directly from the USA well 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.600
 how they are made these straps have 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.570
 two slots as you see at both ends 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.850
 one end with only one thread 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.720
 very thin that we will call the thread of 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:44.550
 security and on the other hand we have one 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.610
 Velcro tape the body in the middle is 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.860
 covered with a rubber sheath taken 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.700
 by some they are compatible with all 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.170
 Cases that have a skeleton frame 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.320
 feature that I come a lot 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.270
 sectoral these laces and this thread 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.480
 security guys this thread of 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.470
 safety 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:09.100
 it's a very crucial thread let's say why 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.420
 is what should be reported in the promo needle 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.330
 so let's see the two options 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.930
 assembly that we have for these purposes 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.240
 security on our go pro thread 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.840
 which must be extremely durable 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.510
 it's very thin to get inside 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.270
 of our body and in particular for 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.490
 as for mounting on 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.300
 sportellino del lago pro 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.970
 let's see just that 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:39.400
 assembly consists in detaching it 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:42.520
 cover from the talk ace and insert 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.980
 our security thread on the septum 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.250
 metallic of the door in this 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.250
 way 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.730
 once passed immediately below 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:03:01.170
 metallic we will pass the loop of a 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.170
 parà rope and carrying out all the thread 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.530
 we are going to create the knot on the dr septum 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.180
 metallic in this crucial way 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.020
 in helping as much as this 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.230
 passage because the wire must be 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.870
 extreme and subtle is to be brought by 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.970
 a part on one side of the door 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.700
 in particular the left one 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.740
 at this point we take the rest of the 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.440
 houses and we adapt it to mental bear 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:40.000
 that making sure that the thread 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:44.680
 don't get stuck let's say you don't 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.440
 fear even if the thread touches the lipstick 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.270
 Metallic plastic parts will not go to 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.200
 ruin just because it is made of 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.180
 specially designed materials 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:59.569
 and I refer to particular material 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:02.069
 which the multifibra is the polyester 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:05.730
 material on which the boys of cones yes 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:09.660
 they do a lot of research and a lot of development 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:13.980
 second method instead which does not provide for it 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.799
 disassembly of the kate itself but exploits the 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.739
 presence of screw ice below 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:23.729
 kaiser then just take the 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.070
 safety wire port between the two hooks 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.680
 below the case in this way 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.560
 and at this point 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.020
 rea 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.060
 18 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:41.069
 to flip and reinsert inside 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:44.860
 of the two plastic hooks of the pro lake 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:48.610
 this will offer a security let's say of the 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.050
 90 percent of the breakages of the 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.050
 hooks of the lake prof 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.240
 here and if a suction cup should come off 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.590
 or break a hook anyway 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.599
 externally to what is the case 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:05.069
 your clumsy with the prof 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:07.810
 however, it will be saved between the two 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:10.389
 I prefer hooking methods 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.130
 use the one that gives me 100 for 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.630
 one hundred 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.710
 going anyway with a minimum of 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.520
 manual to remove the door of the 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.349
 lake pro 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.150
 finally we have to complete the assembly 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:25.270
 of the goalie ski on the back inserting 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.659
 the blue learn between the two 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:34.139
 screw coupling other group companies 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:34.139
 rock by inserting the screw inhabit 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:43.330
 and going to anchor in a safe place 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.330
 the velcro tape 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:51.629
 a question that needs to be asked is which 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.610
 goli length shes choose a 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:56.520
 regardless of the price the s 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:59.039
 it costs less than a l but which one is the most 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.020
 comfortable well it depends on you know what it is 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.940
 used 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.860
 the advice I give you if for example 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:09.960
 you want to use your goalie 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:12.539
 shes for example on a helmet or where 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.949
 however, the anchor point is a lot 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:18.750
 near maybe the handlebars of a bike i 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:20.789
 doors your dog points 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.150
 anchor are always very close there 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:26.520
 I recommend being a m obviously is 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.860
 a middle l where the council 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.270
 I recommend it in places where maybe the 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.900
 anchor point is very distant 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:36.569
 such as motorcycles and cars 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.610
 the advice therefore that I give you which is to 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:40.560
 my opinion if you want to save money and 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.190
 avoid taking the bardo from three 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.620
 laces take an f is a m is 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.539
 definitely the most versatile thing that 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.090
 you can have because joining the two 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:53.580
 laccett you go to get a l 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:57.560
 udu laccetti very simple just do 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.560
 pass the slots one inside the other 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:06.000
 we insert the second one 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:09.810
 and at the end of the operation we will have ours 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.300
 accept hooked and extended with from 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:16.680
 a safety wire part 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:18.210
 the knot is the good Velcro webbing 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.370
 guys I hope this video can 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.870
 to have been to your liking 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:24.660
 comment on this video as well 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.850
 if you will make some kind of doubt or 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:29.040
 I also invite you to visit the 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:32.610
 my facebook page where I published 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.620
 a video with instructions to win 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:37.350
 another of these goalie laces 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:41.450
 shields I greet you and leave you at 

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.450
 resistance of these hello hands
