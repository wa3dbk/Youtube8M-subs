00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
hey guys welcome back to pain talk today

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.690 
hey guys welcome back to pain talk today
we're<00:00:07.140> going<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.319> talk<00:00:07.470> about<00:00:07.649> candy<00:00:08.250> finishes

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
we're going to talk about candy finishes

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.419 
we're going to talk about candy finishes
what<00:00:09.510> they<00:00:09.660> are<00:00:09.809> how<00:00:10.019> they<00:00:10.170> work<00:00:10.219> why<00:00:11.219> they're

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
what they are how they work why they're

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.150 
what they are how they work why they're
a<00:00:11.460> challenge<00:00:12.500> there's<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.559> lot<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.799> confusion

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
a challenge there's a lot of confusion

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.799 
a challenge there's a lot of confusion
about<00:00:14.309> candy<00:00:14.820> paint<00:00:15.030> jobs<00:00:15.299> out<00:00:15.480> there<00:00:15.509> they

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
about candy paint jobs out there they

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.230 
about candy paint jobs out there they
are<00:00:15.839> one<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.230> more<00:00:16.410> complicated<00:00:17.240> finishes

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
are one of the more complicated finishes

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.599 
are one of the more complicated finishes
and<00:00:18.480> most<00:00:19.350> people<00:00:19.680> don't<00:00:19.890> really<00:00:20.160> know<00:00:20.369> what

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
and most people don't really know what

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.109 
and most people don't really know what
they<00:00:20.760> are

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
they are

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.300 
they are
so<00:00:21.359> for<00:00:22.080> example<00:00:22.439> when<00:00:22.560> somebody<00:00:22.740> tells<00:00:23.070> me

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
so for example when somebody tells me

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.880 
so for example when somebody tells me
I'm<00:00:24.019> base<00:00:25.019> coating<00:00:25.439> my<00:00:25.560> guitar<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:25.980> candy<00:00:26.789> red

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
I'm base coating my guitar and candy red

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.700 
I'm base coating my guitar and candy red
you're<00:00:28.890> not<00:00:29.039> that's<00:00:30.289> candy<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.529> base

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
you're not that's candy is in the base

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.459 
you're not that's candy is in the base
coat<00:00:31.969> what<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> candy<00:00:33.390> paint<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.410> a

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
coat what a candy paint is is a

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.639 
coat what a candy paint is is a
completely<00:00:35.430> transparent<00:00:35.989> paint<00:00:36.989> essentially

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
completely transparent paint essentially

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.440 
completely transparent paint essentially
it's<00:00:38.370> typically<00:00:38.760> made<00:00:38.910> with<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.090> dye<00:00:39.390> as

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
it's typically made with a dye as

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.600 
it's typically made with a dye as
opposed<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.110> pigment<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.649> whereas<00:00:41.100> your

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
opposed to a pigment so whereas your

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.580 
opposed to a pigment so whereas your
standard<00:00:41.940> paint<00:00:42.180> laughs<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.809> ground-up

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
standard paint laughs a ground-up

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.520 
standard paint laughs a ground-up
pigment<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.640> gives<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.239> opacity

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
pigment in it that gives it the opacity

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.180 
pigment in it that gives it the opacity
that<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.710> has<00:00:47.700> inherently<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.860> candy<00:00:49.860> finish

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
that it has inherently a candy finish

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.569 
that it has inherently a candy finish
has<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> dye<00:00:51.300> mixed<00:00:51.750> into<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.559> clear<00:00:53.309> base

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
has a dye mixed into a clear base

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.340 
has a dye mixed into a clear base
essentially<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:55.610> instead<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.879> light

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
essentially so instead of the light

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.689 
essentially so instead of the light
going<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.739> hitting<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.100> pigment<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.609> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
going in and hitting the pigment in the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.130 
going in and hitting the pigment in the
paint<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.090> reflecting<00:01:00.539> out<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.840> showing<00:01:01.020> you

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
paint and reflecting out and showing you

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.369 
paint and reflecting out and showing you
that<00:01:01.320> color<00:01:01.789> what<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.879> does<00:01:03.059> with<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> dye<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.840> it

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
that color what it does with a dye is it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.950 
that color what it does with a dye is it
goes<00:01:04.559> through<00:01:05.070> hits<00:01:06.000> whatever's<00:01:06.420> below<00:01:06.630> it

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
goes through hits whatever's below it

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.649 
goes through hits whatever's below it
and<00:01:07.200> reflects<00:01:07.950> back<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.119> tint<00:01:09.390> over

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
and reflects back with that tint over

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.770 
and reflects back with that tint over
top<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.700> they<00:01:11.970> do<00:01:12.030> have<00:01:12.150> paints<00:01:12.720> out

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
top of it so they do have paints out

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.320 
top of it so they do have paints out
though<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.170> they<00:01:13.290> call<00:01:13.760> candy<00:01:14.760> base<00:01:15.030> coats

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
though that they call candy base coats

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.690 
though that they call candy base coats
and<00:01:15.509> stuff<00:01:15.600> like<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.170> isn't<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:17.340> isn't<00:01:17.549> a

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
and stuff like that it isn't it isn't a

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.899 
and stuff like that it isn't it isn't a
true<00:01:17.909> candy<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.990> case<00:01:19.280> what<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.520> it's

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
true candy in that case what it is it's

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.469 
true candy in that case what it is it's
designed<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.750> emulate<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.710> they've<00:01:23.100> got

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
designed to emulate that so they've got

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.760 
designed to emulate that so they've got
kind<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.570> different<00:01:24.900> parts<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.560> make

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
kind of different parts in it that make

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.560 
kind of different parts in it that make
it<00:01:25.920> look<00:01:26.189> like<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.880> has<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.150> depth<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
it look like it has the depth of the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.840 
it look like it has the depth of the
candy<00:01:27.869> finish<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.950> candy<00:01:29.280> finish<00:01:29.549> will

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
candy finish but a candy finish will

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.120 
candy finish but a candy finish will
look<00:01:30.210> considerably<00:01:31.140> deeper<00:01:31.409> than<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.829> normal

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
look considerably deeper than a normal

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.730 
look considerably deeper than a normal
finished<00:01:32.430> candy<00:01:32.729> paints<00:01:33.000> are<00:01:33.119> actually<00:01:33.740> what

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
finished candy paints are actually what

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.859 
finished candy paints are actually what
they<00:01:34.890> use<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> lot<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.549> very<00:01:35.790> expensive<00:01:36.240> cars

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
they use on a lot of very expensive cars

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.620 
they use on a lot of very expensive cars
to<00:01:37.710> make<00:01:37.890> them<00:01:38.040> look<00:01:38.189> like<00:01:38.340> they're

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
to make them look like they're

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.929 
to make them look like they're
very<00:01:38.899> deep<00:01:39.140> finish<00:01:39.560> it's<00:01:39.829> also<00:01:40.009> what<00:01:40.369> my

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
very deep finish it's also what my

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.590 
very deep finish it's also what my
family<00:01:41.420> uses<00:01:41.630> on<00:01:42.049> his<00:01:42.409> true<00:01:43.039> fire<00:01:43.390> effect<00:01:44.390> and

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
family uses on his true fire effect and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.170 
family uses on his true fire effect and
what<00:01:45.079> a<00:01:45.110> lot<00:01:45.350> of<00:01:45.469> a<00:01:45.770> lot<00:01:46.460> of<00:01:46.579> painters<00:01:46.909> since

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
what a lot of a lot of painters since

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.700 
what a lot of a lot of painters since
I'm<00:01:47.329> abused<00:01:47.720> for<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:47.960> same<00:01:48.170> thing<00:01:48.409> pretty

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
I'm abused for the same thing pretty

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.760 
I'm abused for the same thing pretty
much<00:01:48.890> all<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:49.220> him<00:01:49.310> I<00:01:49.399> think<00:01:49.460> hopefully<00:01:50.770> so

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
much all to him I think hopefully so

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.980 
much all to him I think hopefully so
like<00:01:51.979> I<00:01:52.070> said<00:01:52.280> a<00:01:52.310> candy<00:01:52.759> allows<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.810> light<00:01:53.960> to

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
like I said a candy allows the light to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.719 
like I said a candy allows the light to
pass<00:01:54.289> through<00:01:54.350> it<00:01:54.679> kill<00:01:55.189> whatever's<00:01:55.549> behind

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
pass through it kill whatever's behind

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.899 
pass through it kill whatever's behind
it<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:56.299> come<00:01:56.960> back<00:01:56.990> it<00:01:57.950> requires<00:01:58.340> more<00:01:58.610> coats

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
it and come back it requires more coats

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.090

in a lot of cases they will heat up more

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.729 
in a lot of cases they will heat up more
than<00:02:55.819> your<00:02:55.970> normal<00:02:56.120> finish<00:02:56.569> as<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.900> solvent

than your normal finish as the solvent
to<00:02:57.769> evaporate<00:02:58.690> which<00:02:59.690> can<00:02:59.900> cause<00:03:00.049> them<00:03:00.290> to

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
to evaporate which can cause them to

to evaporate which can cause them to
room<00:03:01.150> masking<00:03:02.150> sometimes<00:03:02.840> they<00:03:03.139> like<00:03:03.380> cause

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
room masking sometimes they like cause

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.949

something<00:03:55.019> like<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:55.439> because<00:03:55.799> those<00:03:56.189> white

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
something like that because those white

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.909 
something like that because those white
yellows<00:03:57.030> have<00:03:57.209> such<00:03:57.389> a<00:03:57.420> low<00:03:57.629> color<00:03:57.900> value<00:03:58.260> but

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
yellows have such a low color value but

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.399 
yellows have such a low color value but
it<00:03:59.040> will<00:03:59.159> keep<00:03:59.370> getting<00:03:59.519> darker<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.989> darker

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
it will keep getting darker the darker

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.860 
it will keep getting darker the darker
the<00:04:01.739> candy<00:04:02.159> the<00:04:02.730> less<00:04:02.909> coats<00:04:03.180> you'll<00:04:03.389> need<00:04:03.599> to

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
the candy the less coats you'll need to

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.050 
the candy the less coats you'll need to
achieve<00:04:04.220> that<00:04:05.220> full<00:04:05.579> dark<00:04:05.939> deep<00:04:06.359> look<00:04:06.720> because

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
achieve that full dark deep look because

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.500 
achieve that full dark deep look because
we<00:04:09.060> could<00:04:09.209> dark<00:04:09.419> equipment<00:04:10.370> but<00:04:11.370> don't<00:04:12.299> make

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
we could dark equipment but don't make

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.089 
we could dark equipment but don't make
the<00:04:12.569> mistake<00:04:12.689> of<00:04:13.019> thinking<00:04:13.230> that<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:13.739> can<00:04:13.950> go

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
the mistake of thinking that you can go

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.129 
the mistake of thinking that you can go
in<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.549> do<00:04:14.639> a<00:04:14.669> pink<00:04:14.970> candy<00:04:15.450> paint<00:04:15.659> job<00:04:15.930> and

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
in and do a pink candy paint job and

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.960 
in and do a pink candy paint job and
then<00:04:16.739> lighten<00:04:17.190> it<00:04:17.280> up<00:04:17.370> with<00:04:17.579> a<00:04:17.609> different

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
then lighten it up with a different

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.479 
then lighten it up with a different
color<00:04:18.150> after<00:04:18.620> it<00:04:19.620> won't<00:04:19.829> work<00:04:20.009> you<00:04:20.250> would<00:04:20.370> have

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
color after it won't work you would have

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.400 
color after it won't work you would have
to<00:04:20.669> actually<00:04:20.759> repaint<00:04:21.389> the<00:04:21.509> entire<00:04:21.599> thing<00:04:22.139> in

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
to actually repaint the entire thing in

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.230 
to actually repaint the entire thing in
your<00:04:22.560> base<00:04:22.710> color<00:04:23.009> and<00:04:23.250> then<00:04:23.849> come<00:04:24.060> up<00:04:24.090> with

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
your base color and then come up with

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.080 
your base color and then come up with
the<00:04:24.419> candies<00:04:24.750> again<00:04:25.430> you<00:04:26.430> can't<00:04:26.669> be<00:04:26.820> spot

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
the candies again you can't be spot

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.310 
the candies again you can't be spot
touch-ups<00:04:27.570> with<00:04:27.750> them<00:04:27.870> either<00:04:28.110> really

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
touch-ups with them either really

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.100 
touch-ups with them either really
because<00:04:29.099> they're<00:04:29.250> so<00:04:29.370> transparent<00:04:30.060> any<00:04:30.750> kind

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
because they're so transparent any kind

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.320 
because they're so transparent any kind
of<00:04:31.849> overlap

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
of overlap

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.990 
of overlap
that's<00:04:33.690> not<00:04:33.930> even<00:04:34.110> will<00:04:34.740> show<00:04:35.010> this<00:04:35.669> is<00:04:35.849> why

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
that's not even will show this is why

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000 
that's not even will show this is why
candy<00:04:36.449> paint<00:04:36.659> jobs<00:04:36.900> on<00:04:37.110> things<00:04:37.349> like<00:04:37.440> cars<00:04:37.800> are

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
candy paint jobs on things like cars are

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.000 
candy paint jobs on things like cars are
so<00:04:38.159> expensive<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:39.229> time-consuming<00:04:40.229> they're

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
so expensive and time-consuming they're

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.350 
so expensive and time-consuming they're
very<00:04:41.250> very<00:04:41.550> specialized<00:04:43.460> because<00:04:44.460> anywhere

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
very very specialized because anywhere

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.170 
very very specialized because anywhere
where<00:04:45.570> you've<00:04:45.720> got<00:04:46.280> more<00:04:47.280> paint<00:04:47.639> overlapping

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
where you've got more paint overlapping

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.310 
where you've got more paint overlapping
than<00:04:48.599> the<00:04:49.110> rest<00:04:49.789> it's<00:04:50.789> going<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:51.090> show<00:04:51.270> up<00:04:51.419> due

than the rest it's going to show up due

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.800 
than the rest it's going to show up due
to<00:04:52.349> that<00:04:52.560> transparency<00:04:53.190> so<00:04:53.669> whereas<00:04:54.570> you

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
to that transparency so whereas you

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.930 
to that transparency so whereas you
would<00:04:55.260> normally<00:04:55.590> do<00:04:55.680> a<00:04:55.710> 50%<00:04:56.370> overlap<00:04:56.610> with

a full candy paint job on something
expensive<00:05:10.050> if<00:05:10.169> you've<00:05:10.289> never<00:05:10.470> tried<00:05:10.710> it

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919

and that's that's about it just be
careful<00:05:17.430> with<00:05:17.849> it<00:05:18.060> I<00:05:18.270> just<00:05:18.690> wanted<00:05:18.900> to<00:05:18.990> clarify

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
careful with it I just wanted to clarify

careful with it I just wanted to clarify
what<00:05:19.680> it<00:05:19.770> actually<00:05:20.190> is<00:05:20.340> because<00:05:20.610> a<00:05:20.789> lot<00:05:21.000> of

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
what it actually is because a lot of

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.580 
what it actually is because a lot of
people<00:05:21.180> don't<00:05:21.479> understand<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:22.080> concept<00:05:22.110> of

people don't understand the concept of

the canyon paint job candy red isn't a

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150
