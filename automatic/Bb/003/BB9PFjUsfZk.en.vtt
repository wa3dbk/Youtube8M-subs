00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
so as an environmental biologist what's

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.770 
so as an environmental biologist what's
your<00:00:02.250> take<00:00:02.399> on<00:00:02.580> ultra<00:00:03.030> high<00:00:03.149> temperature

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
your take on ultra high temperature

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.570 
your take on ultra high temperature
pasteurization<00:00:04.770> of<00:00:04.859> milk<00:00:04.920> would<00:00:05.310> you<00:00:05.400> drink

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
pasteurization of milk would you drink

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.309 
pasteurization of milk would you drink
that<00:00:05.700> no<00:00:06.509> I<00:00:06.540> wouldn't<00:00:06.839> I<00:00:07.020> mean<00:00:07.049> there's

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
that no I wouldn't I mean there's

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.620 
that no I wouldn't I mean there's
nothing<00:00:07.620> there<00:00:07.859> really<00:00:08.220> right<00:00:08.460> let's<00:00:09.360> just

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
nothing there really right let's just

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.299 
nothing there really right let's just
think<00:00:09.780> about<00:00:09.900> it<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.320> mean<00:00:10.349> honestly<00:00:11.040> on<00:00:11.219> the

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
think about it I mean honestly on the

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.240 
think about it I mean honestly on the
logical<00:00:11.849> level<00:00:12.000> aside<00:00:12.480> from<00:00:12.690> any<00:00:12.900> second<00:00:13.290> we

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
logical level aside from any second we

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.120 
logical level aside from any second we
have<00:00:14.460> we<00:00:15.179> have<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.360> milk<00:00:16.109> product<00:00:16.500> that's

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
have we have a milk product that's

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.939 
have we have a milk product that's
boiled<00:00:17.609> it's<00:00:18.330> homogenized<00:00:19.050> meaning<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.740> all

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
boiled it's homogenized meaning that all

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.279 
boiled it's homogenized meaning that all
of<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.310> fats<00:00:20.580> are<00:00:20.910> made<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:21.990> that's<00:00:22.109> because

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
of the fats are made and that's because

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.890 
of the fats are made and that's because
people<00:00:22.710> don't<00:00:22.970> like<00:00:23.970> oh<00:00:24.150> man<00:00:24.510> when<00:00:24.660> milks

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
people don't like oh man when milks

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.630 
people don't like oh man when milks
separating<00:00:25.470> there's<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.740> water<00:00:26.039> product<00:00:26.490> and

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
separating there's a water product and

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.250 
separating there's a water product and
there's<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.849> cream<00:00:27.119> product<00:00:27.539> on<00:00:27.689> top<00:00:27.900> I'm

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
there's a cream product on top I'm

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.990 
there's a cream product on top I'm
confused<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.039> why<00:00:29.189> that's<00:00:29.400> happening<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.849> don't

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
confused on why that's happening I don't

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.950 
confused on why that's happening I don't
want<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.210> shake<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.480> up<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:30.660> we're<00:00:30.779> going<00:00:30.869> to

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
want to shake it up so we're going to

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.990 
want to shake it up so we're going to
we're<00:00:31.289> going<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.439> mix<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.859> all<00:00:31.949> together<00:00:32.130> well

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
we're going to mix it all together well

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.180 
we're going to mix it all together well
mixing<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.480> all<00:00:33.630> like<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.160> actually<00:00:35.160> changes

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
mixing it all like that actually changes

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.459 
mixing it all like that actually changes
that<00:00:35.820> lipid<00:00:36.270> structure<00:00:36.899> we're<00:00:37.050> changing<00:00:37.380> that

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
that lipid structure we're changing that

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.200 
that lipid structure we're changing that
patch<00:00:37.739> structure<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.850> not<00:00:39.030> as

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
patch structure and it's not as

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.600 
patch structure and it's not as
bioavailable<00:00:39.600> when<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.530> heat<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.800> it's

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
bioavailable when we heat it it's

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.590 
bioavailable when we heat it it's
totally<00:00:42.270> killing<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:43.050> molecule<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.160> we<00:00:44.280> have

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
totally killing that molecule so we have

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.700 
totally killing that molecule so we have
like<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.660> said<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.110> relationships<00:00:46.620> between

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
like I said the relationships between

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.639 
like I said the relationships between
proteins<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.059> enzymes<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:49.110> enzymes

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
proteins and enzymes so enzymes

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.069 
proteins and enzymes so enzymes
predigest<00:00:50.430> those<00:00:50.850> proteins<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.600> many<00:00:51.780> people

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
predigest those proteins so many people

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.260 
predigest those proteins so many people
you<00:00:52.110> hear<00:00:52.410> say<00:00:52.620> lactose<00:00:53.430> intolerant<00:00:54.030> things

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
you hear say lactose intolerant things

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.990 
you hear say lactose intolerant things
like<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.570> but<00:00:55.260> if<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.579> lactase

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
like that but if you have the lactase

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.990 
like that but if you have the lactase
and<00:00:57.270> milk<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.660> breaks<00:00:57.870> down<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.289> lactose

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000

when<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.700> heat<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.060> milk<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.450> killing<00:01:09.900> those

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
when we heat the milk it's killing those

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.440 
when we heat the milk it's killing those
enzymes<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.220> letting<00:01:11.580> those<00:01:11.790> proteins

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
enzymes and it's letting those proteins

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.510 
enzymes and it's letting those proteins
survive<00:01:12.869> okay<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:13.890> you're<00:01:14.189> getting<00:01:14.310> that

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
survive okay so you're getting that

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.760 
survive okay so you're getting that
protein<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.689> have<00:01:15.869> no<00:01:16.170> way<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.380> break<00:01:16.619> it

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
protein but you have no way to break it

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.890 
protein but you have no way to break it
down<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.280> it's<00:01:17.670> not<00:01:17.850> by<00:01:18.090> available<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.840> your

down and it's not by available to your
body<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.860> why<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.310> many<00:01:20.460> people<00:01:20.549> are<00:01:20.939> with

body is that why so many people are with
what<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.570> collective's<00:01:22.140> exactly

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
what the collective's exactly

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.660 
what the collective's exactly
that's<00:01:23.530> where<00:01:23.680> we<00:01:23.830> get<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:23.980> terminology<00:01:24.550> for

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
that's where we get the terminology for

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.310 
that's where we get the terminology for
leftist<00:01:25.000> like<00:01:25.330> oh<00:01:25.480> and<00:01:25.660> left<00:01:25.810> just<00:01:25.960> employer<00:01:26.200> I

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
leftist like oh and left just employer I

leftist like oh and left just employer I
can't<00:01:26.560> have<00:01:26.710> that<00:01:26.860> milk<00:01:27.130> well<00:01:27.610> actually<00:01:27.670> you

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
can't have that milk well actually you

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.610 
can't have that milk well actually you
could<00:01:28.120> probably<00:01:28.330> have<00:01:28.540> rods<00:01:28.780> raw<00:01:29.110> dairy<00:01:29.350> and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
could probably have rods raw dairy and

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.560 
could probably have rods raw dairy and
be<00:01:29.770> just<00:01:30.250> fine<00:01:30.490> because<00:01:30.880> it<00:01:31.000> has<00:01:31.120> plenty<00:01:31.390> of

be just fine because it has plenty of

be just fine because it has plenty of
lactase<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.470> break<00:01:32.680> down<00:01:32.830> that<00:01:32.890> lactose<00:01:33.490> we
