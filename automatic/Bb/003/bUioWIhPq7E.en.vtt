00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
found the bass were shallow and i

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.670 
found the bass were shallow and i
decided<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.780> give<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.989> shot<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.410> we<00:01:01.559> ended

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
decided to give it a shot and we ended

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.070 
decided to give it a shot and we ended
up<00:01:01.829> catching<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.340> few<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.539> kind<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.809> came<00:01:03.960> to

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
up catching a few and I kind of came to

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.450 
up catching a few and I kind of came to
the<00:01:04.110> conclusion<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.830> whether<00:01:05.189> we<00:01:05.339> are

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
the conclusion that whether we are

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.980 
the conclusion that whether we are
catching<00:01:05.640> males<00:01:06.000> or<00:01:06.240> females<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.930> were

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
catching males or females we were

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.450 
catching males or females we were
catching<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.409> little<00:01:07.650> bit<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.799> both<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.280> my

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
catching a little bit of both in my

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.630 
catching a little bit of both in my
opinion<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:09.810> females<00:01:10.799> had<00:01:10.979> not<00:01:11.189> laid<00:01:11.460> their

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
opinion the females had not laid their

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.880 
opinion the females had not laid their
eggs<00:01:11.670> yet<00:01:12.240> though<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.869> that's<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.560> kind<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.799> a

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
eggs yet though and that's the kind of a

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.920 
eggs yet though and that's the kind of a
deal<00:01:14.010> with<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> spawn<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.760> if<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.540> females

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
deal with the spawn is if the females

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.359 
deal with the spawn is if the females
had<00:01:16.170> laid<00:01:16.409> their<00:01:16.619> eggs<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.189> they<00:01:17.310> were

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
had laid their eggs and they were

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.580 
had laid their eggs and they were
sitting<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.880> their<00:01:18.030> beds<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.930> probably<00:01:19.320> would

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
sitting on their beds we probably would

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.130 
sitting on their beds we probably would
not<00:01:19.799> have<00:01:19.860> hooked<00:01:20.340> up<00:01:20.520> with<00:01:20.580> those<00:01:21.240> bass<00:01:21.689> with

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
not have hooked up with those bass with

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.820 
not have hooked up with those bass with
frogs<00:01:22.500> because<00:01:22.950> they're<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:23.970> basically<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
frogs because they're just basically the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.469 
frogs because they're just basically the
BET<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.220> females<00:01:26.580> try<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.880> guard<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.360> know

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
BET the females try to guard you know

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.200 
BET the females try to guard you know
guard<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.020> eggs<00:01:28.549> but<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> don't<00:01:29.790> really<00:01:29.939> know

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
guard the eggs but I don't really know

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.660 
guard the eggs but I don't really know
how<00:01:30.240> big<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.869> threat<00:01:31.079> topwater<00:01:31.650> frog<00:01:32.130> poses

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
how big of a threat topwater frog poses

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.069 
how big of a threat topwater frog poses
maybe<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.119> bigger<00:01:33.329> than<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.659> think<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:34.049> just

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
maybe it's bigger than I think I just

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.300 
maybe it's bigger than I think I just
don't<00:01:34.320> think<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.710> big<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.040> threat<00:01:35.159> i

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
don't think it's that big of a threat i

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.280 
don't think it's that big of a threat i
think<00:01:35.549> they'd<00:01:35.700> rather<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.150> watch<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.390> kind

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
think they'd rather just watch it kind

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.020 
think they'd rather just watch it kind
of<00:01:37.320> go<00:01:37.409> over<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> top<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.009> not<00:01:38.100> really<00:01:38.280> you

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
of go over the top and not really you

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.960 
of go over the top and not really you
know<00:01:39.060> go<00:01:39.509> after<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:41.130> thing<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.400> they

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
know go after it but the thing is they

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.080 
know go after it but the thing is they
were<00:01:42.030> cruising<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.540> shallows<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.880> they<00:01:44.880> said

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
were cruising the shallows and they said

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.249 
were cruising the shallows and they said
they<00:01:45.180> made<00:01:45.360> their<00:01:45.509> beds<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:45.930> they<00:01:45.990> hadn't

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
they made their beds but they hadn't

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.270 
they made their beds but they hadn't
laid<00:01:46.320> their<00:01:46.530> eggs<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:46.950> they<00:01:47.070> weren't

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
laid their eggs it so they weren't

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.120 
laid their eggs it so they weren't
really<00:01:47.490> protective<00:01:48.229> in<00:01:49.229> my<00:01:49.500> opinion<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.070> is

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
really protective in my opinion this is

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.859 
really protective in my opinion this is
just<00:01:50.460> kind<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.700> my<00:01:50.820> conclusion<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.509> when<00:01:51.780> we

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
just kind of my conclusion is when we

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.430 
just kind of my conclusion is when we
were<00:01:51.930> thrown<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.229> frog<00:01:52.470> set

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
were thrown the frog set

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.170 
were thrown the frog set
they<00:01:53.500> were<00:01:53.560> hitting<00:01:54.280> it<00:01:54.550> they<00:01:54.940> weren't

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
they were hitting it they weren't

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.730 
they were hitting it they weren't
necessarily<00:01:55.690> eating<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:56.260> they<00:01:56.410> were<00:01:56.470> just

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
necessarily eating it they were just

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.260 
necessarily eating it they were just
trying<00:01:57.010> to<00:01:57.070> get<00:01:57.250> it<00:01:57.400> away<00:01:57.520> from<00:01:57.670> their<00:01:58.030> bed

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
trying to get it away from their bed

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.030 
trying to get it away from their bed
whether<00:01:58.540> they<00:01:58.750> had<00:01:58.930> laid<00:01:59.170> their<00:01:59.380> eggs<00:01:59.560> or<00:01:59.830> not

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
whether they had laid their eggs or not

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.400 
whether they had laid their eggs or not
that<00:02:00.400> was<00:02:00.550> their<00:02:00.790> goal<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.360> we<00:02:02.260> basically

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
that was their goal and we basically

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.080 
that was their goal and we basically
what<00:02:03.130> we<00:02:03.220> did<00:02:03.280> with<00:02:03.400> our<00:02:03.460> frog<00:02:03.730> is<00:02:03.910> we

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
what we did with our frog is we

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.580 
what we did with our frog is we
basically<00:02:04.210> just<00:02:04.480> pissed<00:02:04.900> them<00:02:05.050> off<00:02:05.200> enough<00:02:05.560> to

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
basically just pissed them off enough to

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.380 
basically just pissed them off enough to
the<00:02:05.740> point<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:06.250> where<00:02:06.520> they<00:02:06.730> would<00:02:06.880> hit<00:02:07.090> it<00:02:07.210> and

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
the point to where they would hit it and

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.660 
the point to where they would hit it and
we<00:02:08.080> missed<00:02:08.380> a<00:02:08.500> lot<00:02:08.650> more<00:02:08.830> than<00:02:09.040> we<00:02:09.130> caught<00:02:09.340> we

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
we missed a lot more than we caught we

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.990 
we missed a lot more than we caught we
had<00:02:09.790> a<00:02:09.820> whole<00:02:10.090> bunch<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.420> strikes<00:02:11.730> but<00:02:12.730> I<00:02:12.760> just

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
had a whole bunch of strikes but I just

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.700 
had a whole bunch of strikes but I just
wanted<00:02:13.240> to<00:02:13.300> kind<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.510> say<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.930> because<00:02:14.110> i

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
wanted to kind of say that because i

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.520 
wanted to kind of say that because i
feel<00:02:15.130> like<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:16.030> if<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:17.020> know<00:02:17.050> named<00:02:17.320> this<00:02:17.470> a

feel like it if I you know named this a

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.380 
feel like it if I you know named this a
bad<00:02:17.830> fishing<00:02:18.040> video<00:02:18.430> or<00:02:18.520> whatever<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:19.270> guys

going to be thinking that are you guys
maybe<00:02:20.950> we'll<00:02:21.250> go<00:02:21.340> try<00:02:21.400> for<00:02:21.790> top<00:02:21.940> water<00:02:22.150> frogs

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
maybe we'll go try for top water frogs

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.120 
maybe we'll go try for top water frogs
bed<00:02:22.720> fishing<00:02:23.020> which<00:02:23.140> go<00:02:23.350> for<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.710> you<00:02:23.830> can<00:02:23.860> I

bed fishing which go for it you can I
just<00:02:24.460> didn't<00:02:24.640> want<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.850> guys<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.090> get<00:02:25.180> the

just didn't want you guys to get the

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.610 
just didn't want you guys to get the
impression<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.690> that's<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:26.080> great<00:02:26.410> bed

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
impression that that's a great bed

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.320 
impression that that's a great bed
fishing<00:02:26.950> maybe<00:02:27.070> cuz<00:02:27.310> it's<00:02:27.490> probably<00:02:27.970> not

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
you're probably better off the soft

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.560 
you're probably better off the soft
plastic<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.760> flipping<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.150> pitching<00:02:31.210> it

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
plastic and flipping and pitching it

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.760

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
but basically he said what we're doing

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.160 
but basically he said what we're doing
was<00:02:36.820> working<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.210> Frog<00:02:37.390> really<00:02:37.690> really<00:02:37.870> slow

just<00:02:48.520> irritating<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.690> bass<00:02:49.960> to<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.440> point<00:02:50.740> to

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
just irritating the bass to the point to

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.590 
just irritating the bass to the point to
where<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:51.190> would<00:02:51.310> strike<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.330> just<00:02:52.480> wanted

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
where it would strike and I just wanted

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.120 
where it would strike and I just wanted
to<00:02:52.840> kind<00:02:53.260> of<00:02:53.290> explain<00:02:53.620> that<00:02:53.800> because<00:02:53.920> I

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
to kind of explain that because I

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.320 
to kind of explain that because I
figured<00:02:54.340> I'd<00:02:54.400> be<00:02:54.490> a<00:02:54.520> lot<00:02:54.640> of<00:02:54.700> questions<00:02:55.060> on<00:02:55.180> how

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
figured I'd be a lot of questions on how

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.640 
figured I'd be a lot of questions on how
we<00:02:55.390> are<00:02:55.570> catching<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:55.930> why<00:02:56.080> we're<00:02:56.320> catching

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
we are catching on why we're catching

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.290 
we are catching on why we're catching
them<00:02:56.740> because<00:02:57.670> like<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:57.940> said<00:02:58.030> they<00:02:58.150> weren't

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
them because like I said they weren't

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.580 
them because like I said they weren't
eating<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:58.750> they<00:02:58.870> were<00:02:58.989> just<00:02:59.200> doing<00:02:59.500> it

eating it they were just doing it

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.990 
eating it they were just doing it
because<00:02:59.620> they<00:03:00.040> were<00:03:00.100> frustrated<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:00.820> it<00:03:00.850> is

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
because they were frustrated that it is

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.699 
because they were frustrated that it is
over<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.270> top<00:03:01.300> of<00:03:01.450> their<00:03:01.600> bed<00:03:01.750> but<00:03:01.989> anyways
