hair<00:00:11.099> strands<00:00:11.429> lately<00:00:11.790> but<00:00:12.000> you<00:00:12.509> just<00:00:12.719> kind<00:00:12.900> of

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929

mind<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:14.160> think<00:00:14.820> it's<00:00:14.940> kind<00:00:15.059> of

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
mind and and I think it's kind of

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.430 
mind and and I think it's kind of
interesting<00:00:15.330> because<00:00:15.509> i<00:00:15.690> do<00:00:15.750> have<00:00:15.990> curly<00:00:16.410> hair

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
interesting because i do have curly hair

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.160 
interesting because i do have curly hair
so<00:00:17.119> obviously<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.480> not<00:00:18.510> straight<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:21.170> you

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
so obviously this is not straight so you

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.240 
so obviously this is not straight so you

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250

while<00:00:52.050> you're<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:52.410> back<00:00:52.620> top<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.610> my<00:00:53.670> hair's

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
while you're here back top of my hair's

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.880 
while you're here back top of my hair's
already<00:00:54.059> drive<00:00:54.360> bottom<00:00:55.289> will<00:00:55.440> take<00:00:55.620> forever

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
already drive bottom will take forever

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.810 
already drive bottom will take forever
to<00:00:55.980> dry<00:00:57.199> it<00:00:58.199> needs<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.500> brush<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.160> buy<00:00:59.340> them<00:00:59.550> I

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
to dry it needs a brush to buy them I

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.729 
to dry it needs a brush to buy them I
think<00:01:00.480> if<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.660> have<00:01:00.989> curly<00:01:01.170> hair<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.440> know

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
think if you have curly hair you know

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.619 
think if you have curly hair you know
the<00:01:01.890> rule<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.280> do<00:01:02.910> not<00:01:03.000> suppress<00:01:03.270> your<00:01:03.420> hair

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
the rule is do not suppress your hair

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.679 
the rule is do not suppress your hair
because<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.619> will<00:01:04.830> get<00:01:04.979> frizz<00:01:05.430> ball<00:01:05.659> okay<00:01:06.659> um

because you will get frizz ball okay um

the<00:02:03.729> second<00:02:03.939> section<00:02:04.119> can<00:02:04.329> be<00:02:04.359> a<00:02:04.450> little<00:02:04.600> bit

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
the second section can be a little bit

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:25.880 
the second section can be a little bit
harder<00:02:04.990> because<00:02:05.200> you've<00:02:05.500> already<00:02:05.710> done

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.040 

okay<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:26.610> now<00:02:26.790> they're<00:02:26.940> just<00:02:27.150> both<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.690> them<00:02:27.840> to

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
okay so now they're just both of them to

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.500 
okay so now they're just both of them to
the<00:02:28.140> left<00:02:28.380> they're<00:02:28.650> both<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:29.130> his<00:02:29.280> left<00:02:29.700> since

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
the left they're both in his left since

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.480 
the left they're both in his left since
they<00:02:30.630> both<00:02:30.780> interested<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.500> left<00:02:31.680> ear<00:02:31.800> so

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
they both interested to the left ear so

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.710 
they both interested to the left ear so
if<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.670> trusted<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.240> right<00:02:33.450> you're<00:02:33.630> going

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
if you trusted to the right you're going

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.180 
if you trusted to the right you're going
to<00:02:33.810> want<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.080> twist<00:02:34.260> them<00:02:34.440> over<00:02:34.740> each<00:02:34.830> other<00:02:34.980> to

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
to want to twist them over each other to

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.100 
to want to twist them over each other to
the<00:02:35.280> left<00:02:35.520> it's<00:02:36.030> inside<00:02:36.300> listen<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.870> left

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
the left it's inside listen to the left

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.720 
the left it's inside listen to the left
I'm<00:02:37.470> gonna<00:02:37.709> just<00:02:37.830> wasn't<00:02:38.160> sure<00:02:38.190> right<00:02:38.430> so<00:02:38.610> it's

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
I'm gonna just wasn't sure right so it's

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.420 
I'm gonna just wasn't sure right so it's
the<00:02:38.819> opposite<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:39.990> this<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.860> back<00:02:40.980> one<00:02:41.190> but

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
the opposite so this is the back one but

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.250 
the opposite so this is the back one but
it's<00:02:41.550> going<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.730> go<00:02:41.850> over<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.750> right<00:02:42.930> and

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
it's going to go over to the right and

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.500 
it's going to go over to the right and
you<00:02:43.950> can<00:02:44.130> if<00:02:44.520> they<00:02:44.640> unravel<00:02:45.000> at<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.270> bottom

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
you can if they unravel at the bottom

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.990 
you can if they unravel at the bottom
you<00:02:45.600> can<00:02:45.660> always<00:02:46.020> kiss<00:02:46.290> them<00:02:46.530> again<00:02:47.000> so

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
you can always kiss them again so

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.930 
you can always kiss them again so
essentially<00:02:48.300> by<00:02:48.570> am<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:49.170> guess<00:02:50.130> doing<00:02:50.520> them<00:02:50.670> to

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
essentially by am I guess doing them to

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.390 
essentially by am I guess doing them to
opposite<00:02:51.900> sides<00:02:51.930> it's<00:02:52.770> going<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.040> stay<00:02:53.370> like

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
opposite sides it's going to stay like

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.740 
opposite sides it's going to stay like
that<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.150> also<00:02:54.680> make<00:02:55.680> sure<00:02:55.709> look<00:02:56.100> so<00:02:56.370> cool<00:02:56.750> so

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
that and also make sure look so cool so

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.800 
that and also make sure look so cool so
then<00:02:58.260> just<00:02:58.440> take<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.739> hair<00:02:58.920> tie<00:02:59.540> I'm<00:03:00.540> actually

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
then just take a hair tie I'm actually

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.160 
then just take a hair tie I'm actually
made<00:03:01.110> this<00:03:01.320> one<00:03:02.360> me<00:03:03.360> about<00:03:03.600> selling<00:03:03.930> them<00:03:04.050> on

fishtail<00:04:24.120> braid<00:04:24.360> so<00:04:24.480> if<00:04:24.540> you<00:04:24.600> know<00:04:24.720> how<00:04:24.810> to

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
fishtail braid so if you know how to

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.300 
fishtail braid so if you know how to
fishtail<00:04:25.290> you<00:04:25.830> don't<00:04:26.010> need<00:04:26.130> to<00:04:26.190> pay<00:04:26.280> attention

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
fishtail you don't need to pay attention

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.460 
fishtail you don't need to pay attention
this<00:04:26.730> but<00:04:27.000> um<00:04:27.150> this<00:04:27.600> can<00:04:27.780> be<00:04:27.840> done<00:04:27.930> on<00:04:28.139> dry<00:04:28.440> hair

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
this but um this can be done on dry hair

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.500 
this but um this can be done on dry hair
too<00:04:28.950> I<00:04:29.220> think<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:29.639> fish<00:04:29.910> tails<00:04:30.150> look<00:04:30.300> a<00:04:30.360> lot

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
too I think that fish tails look a lot

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.310 
too I think that fish tails look a lot
better<00:04:30.690> on<00:04:30.990> straight<00:04:31.440> hair<00:04:33.080> just<00:04:34.080> because

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
better on straight hair just because

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.810 
better on straight hair just because
they<00:04:34.470> can<00:04:34.620> get<00:04:34.740> thinner<00:04:35.010> but<00:04:35.280> when<00:04:35.460> my<00:04:35.580> hair<00:04:35.790> is

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
they can get thinner but when my hair is

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.460 
they can get thinner but when my hair is
wet<00:04:36.060> if<00:04:36.300> I<00:04:36.389> brushed<00:04:36.660> out<00:04:36.900> like<00:04:37.080> right<00:04:37.320> out

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
wet if I brushed out like right out

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.020 
wet if I brushed out like right out
after<00:04:37.800> i<00:04:38.070> get<00:04:38.190> out<00:04:38.250> of<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.430> shower<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.850> looks

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
after i get out of the shower it looks

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.760 
after i get out of the shower it looks
good<00:04:39.240> because<00:04:39.720> then<00:04:39.930> it's<00:04:40.080> still<00:04:40.320> like<00:04:40.440> really

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
good because then it's still like really

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.950 
good because then it's still like really
wet<00:04:40.919> and<00:04:40.950> so<00:04:41.160> it's<00:04:41.310> sort<00:04:41.460> of<00:04:41.610> straight<00:04:41.910> um<00:04:42.150> so

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
wet and so it's sort of straight um so

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.090 
wet and so it's sort of straight um so
I'm<00:04:43.020> just<00:04:43.169> glad<00:04:43.260> I<00:04:43.350> guess<00:04:43.560> I'm<00:04:43.800> going<00:04:43.950> to<00:04:44.010> teach

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
needs to be grippy and that's why when

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.629 
needs to be grippy and that's why when
you're<00:04:51.510> as<00:04:51.570> wet<00:04:51.780> it's<00:04:51.990> easy<00:04:52.169> to<00:04:52.380> do<00:04:52.560> so<00:04:53.490> you're

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
you're as wet it's easy to do so you're

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
small cuz otherwise we'll end up looking

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.330 
small cuz otherwise we'll end up looking
like<00:05:21.750> a<00:05:21.930> radio<00:05:22.140> operator<00:05:22.229> and<00:05:22.620> he<00:05:23.039> went<00:05:23.220> to<00:05:23.280> all

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
like a radio operator and he went to all

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.520 
like a radio operator and he went to all
that<00:05:23.370> work<00:05:23.640> for<00:05:23.669> nothing<00:05:23.850> take<00:05:24.570> a<00:05:24.630> regular<00:05:24.780> PPR

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
that work for nothing take a regular PPR

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.409 
that work for nothing take a regular PPR
a<00:05:25.890> small<00:05:26.370> piece<00:05:26.550> from<00:05:26.729> the<00:05:26.789> right<00:05:27.090> one<00:05:27.270> and

a small piece from the right one and

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.469 
a small piece from the right one and
cross<00:05:28.229> it<00:05:28.260> over<00:05:28.470> the<00:05:28.680> right<00:05:28.830> one<00:05:29.010> and<00:05:29.360> over<00:05:30.360> the

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
cross it over the right one and over the

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.540 
cross it over the right one and over the
left<00:05:30.600> one<00:05:30.870> into<00:05:31.200> the<00:05:31.320> back<00:05:31.470> and<00:05:32.100> you<00:05:32.220> can<00:05:32.340> pull

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
left one into the back and you can pull

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.180 
left one into the back and you can pull
the<00:05:32.669> pieces<00:05:32.789> from<00:05:33.180> like<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:34.260> inside<00:05:34.710> back<00:05:34.950> I

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
the pieces from like the inside back I

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.279 
the pieces from like the inside back I
always<00:05:35.340> find<00:05:35.550> that<00:05:35.669> easiest<00:05:36.210> and<00:05:36.570> then<00:05:37.050> wraps

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
always find that easiest and then wraps

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.969 
always find that easiest and then wraps
around<00:05:37.440> the<00:05:37.560> whole<00:05:37.710> thing<00:05:38.630> so<00:05:39.830> just<00:05:40.830> keep

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
around the whole thing so just keep

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.270 
around the whole thing so just keep
doing<00:05:41.310> that

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.469 

it's<00:05:45.280> pretty<00:05:45.669> simple<00:05:45.940> once<00:05:46.150> you<00:05:46.210> get<00:05:46.360> the<00:05:46.449> hang

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
it's pretty simple once you get the hang

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.320 
it's pretty simple once you get the hang
of<00:05:46.690> it<00:05:46.810> so<00:05:47.430> little<00:05:48.430> teeny<00:05:48.729> piece<00:05:48.970> from<00:05:49.180> the

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
of it so little teeny piece from the

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.930 
of it so little teeny piece from the
right<00:05:49.479> section<00:05:49.780> from<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:50.110> back<00:05:50.380> go<00:05:51.100> over<00:05:51.820> the

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
right section from the back go over the

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.629 
right section from the back go over the
right<00:05:52.120> section<00:05:52.449> and<00:05:53.130> over<00:05:54.130> the<00:05:54.220> left<00:05:54.340> section

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 
right section and over the left section

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.760 
right section and over the left section
and<00:05:54.910> pull<00:05:55.150> and<00:05:55.300> put<00:05:55.630> it<00:05:55.750> in<00:05:55.900> the<00:05:56.380> back<00:05:56.530> of<00:05:56.560> the

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
and pull and put it in the back of the

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.950 
and pull and put it in the back of the
last<00:05:56.949> section<00:05:57.190> and<00:05:57.400> pull<00:05:57.580> tight<00:06:00.360> I<00:06:01.360> think<00:06:01.810> this

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
last section and pull tight I think this

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.230 
last section and pull tight I think this
may<00:06:02.169> have<00:06:02.199> been<00:06:02.320> the<00:06:02.440> piece<00:06:02.680> that<00:06:02.710> I<00:06:02.860> just

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
may have been the piece that I just

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:09.990 
may have been the piece that I just
could<00:06:04.240> cancel<00:06:04.449> it<00:06:04.750> out
