I<00:00:10.860> had<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.580> wheel<00:00:11.910> set<00:00:12.360> up<00:00:12.509> on<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.719> bit<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.410> a

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
I had the wheel set up on a bit of a

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.880 
I had the wheel set up on a bit of a
dash<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:14.040> was<00:00:14.219> making<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:14.880> had<00:00:15.750> some<00:00:16.020> random

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
dash like I wanted I've actually changed

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.560 
dash like I wanted I've actually changed
all<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.710> buttons<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.460> don't<00:00:35.880> know<00:00:36.090> if<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.390> can

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
all the buttons I don't know if you can

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.420 
all the buttons I don't know if you can
see<00:00:36.870> but<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.200> actually<00:00:37.440> ended<00:00:37.680> up<00:00:38.070> finding

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
see but I actually ended up finding

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.790 
see but I actually ended up finding
these<00:00:38.730> three<00:00:39.390> switch<00:00:39.719> panels<00:00:40.260> with<00:00:40.590> these

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
these three switch panels with these

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
these three switch panels with these
nice<00:00:41.450> chrome<00:00:42.450> bars<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.200> stuff<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:44.370> switches

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
nice chrome bars and stuff the switches

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.279 
nice chrome bars and stuff the switches
themselves<00:00:45.390> are<00:00:45.510> Chrome<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.050> they<00:00:46.140> actually

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
themselves are Chrome and they actually

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.440 
themselves are Chrome and they actually
light<00:00:46.680> up<00:00:46.829> red<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.309> don't<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.059> set<00:00:48.360> up

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
light up red I don't have that set up

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.000 
light up red I don't have that set up
right<00:00:48.629> now<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.289> will<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> bit<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.950> a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
right now but that will be a bit of a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.760 
right now but that will be a bit of a
future<00:00:50.660> so<00:00:51.660> there's<00:00:51.899> three<00:00:52.110> switches<00:00:52.559> each

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
future so there's three switches each

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.920 
future so there's three switches each
light<00:00:53.129> up<00:00:53.250> red<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.640> each<00:00:53.760> side<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:56.930> thought

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
light up red on each side I thought

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.420 
light up red on each side I thought
those<00:00:58.109> were<00:00:58.140> kind<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.530> nice<00:00:58.680> kids<00:00:59.010> basically

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
those were kind of nice kids basically

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.700 
those were kind of nice kids basically
the<00:00:59.640> wheel<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.359> see<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.809> black<00:01:01.260> silver

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the wheel you can see is black silver

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.950 
the wheel you can see is black silver
and<00:01:02.039> red<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.550> now<00:01:02.969> all<00:01:03.180> my<00:01:03.210> switches<00:01:03.809> are

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
and red and now all my switches are

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.590 
and red and now all my switches are
black<00:01:04.290> silver<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.920> red<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.580> also<00:01:06.119> still<00:01:06.540> have

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
black silver and red I also still have

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.200 
black silver and red I also still have
the<00:01:06.869> little<00:01:07.080> button<00:01:07.229> that's<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.770> here<00:01:08.210> I've

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the little button that's in here I've

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.920 
the little button that's in here I've
actually<00:01:09.500> disconnected<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.619> from<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
actually disconnected it from the

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.510 
actually disconnected it from the
joystick<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.680> actually<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.040> here

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
joystick and it's actually just here

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.090 
joystick and it's actually just here
right<00:01:14.700> now<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.659> will<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:16.049> wired<00:01:16.320> into<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
right now this will be wired into the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.310 
right now this will be wired into the
unit<00:01:17.430> itself<00:01:17.790> into<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.420> button<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.290> that

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
unit itself into this button so that

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.050 
unit itself into this button so that
basically<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.250> button<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.820> button

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
basically this button and this button

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.399 
basically this button and this button
will<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> same<00:01:21.689> but<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.020> way<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.380> use

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
will be the same but that way I can use

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.920 
will be the same but that way I can use
this<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:22.890> my<00:01:22.920> shifter<00:01:23.520> which<00:01:24.119> was<00:01:24.330> originally

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
this as my shifter which was originally

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.460 
this as my shifter which was originally
intended<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:26.340> main<00:01:26.549> purpose<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:28.229> as<00:01:28.320> you

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
intended for the main purpose so as you

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.350 
intended for the main purpose so as you
can<00:01:28.590> see<00:01:28.770> now<00:01:28.950> my<00:01:28.979> setup<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.729> basically<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
can see now my setup is basically the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.310 
can see now my setup is basically the
same<00:01:31.610> kind<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.670> hard<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.970> see<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:33.390> my<00:01:33.780> key<00:01:34.079> is

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
same kind of hard to see but my key is

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.140 
same kind of hard to see but my key is
still<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:34.829> my<00:01:35.040> key<00:01:36.140> shots<00:01:37.140> my<00:01:37.320> truck<00:01:37.590> off

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
still just my key shots my truck off

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.789 
still just my key shots my truck off
this<00:01:39.150> little<00:01:39.450> switch<00:01:39.750> here<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.200> now<00:01:40.380> for<00:01:40.650> my

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
this little switch here is now for my

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.639 
this little switch here is now for my
fuel<00:01:41.130> flick<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.360> truck<00:01:42.780> starts<00:01:43.170> fueling

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
fuel flick it up truck starts fueling

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.410 
fuel flick it up truck starts fueling
that<00:01:45.890> way<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> don't<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.340> hold<00:01:47.460> enter<00:01:47.850> just

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
that way I don't have to hold enter just

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.149 
that way I don't have to hold enter just
because<00:01:48.600> I'm<00:01:48.750> lazy<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.290> then<00:01:49.860> as<00:01:49.950> soon<00:01:50.100> as

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
because I'm lazy and then as soon as

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:50.840 
because I'm lazy and then as soon as
it's<00:01:50.340> done

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
it's done

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.539 
it's done
flick<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.630> hang<00:01:51.810> up<00:01:52.009> the<00:01:53.009> other<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.430> have

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
flick it to hang up the other one I have

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.520 
flick it to hang up the other one I have
here<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.180> actually<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:54.600> for<00:01:54.899> my<00:01:55.079> parking

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
here is actually just for my parking

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.700 
here is actually just for my parking
brake

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
brake

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.420 
brake
just<00:01:57.460> a<00:01:57.610> little<00:01:57.820> knob<00:01:58.000> on<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.240> dash<00:01:58.479> basically

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
just a little knob on the dash basically

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.580 
just a little knob on the dash basically
so<00:02:00.430> that's<00:02:00.580> pretty<00:02:00.790> much<00:02:00.880> it<00:02:01.030> for<00:02:01.330> now<00:02:01.590> my

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
so that's pretty much it for now my

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.550 
so that's pretty much it for now my
future<00:02:02.799> plans<00:02:03.250> are<00:02:03.549> to<00:02:04.020> obviously<00:02:05.020> have<00:02:05.260> all

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
future plans are to obviously have all

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.410 
future plans are to obviously have all
the<00:02:05.740> switches<00:02:05.979> hooked<00:02:06.340> up<00:02:06.520> I'd<00:02:06.700> like<00:02:06.909> all<00:02:07.090> six

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
the switches hooked up I'd like all six

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.320 
the switches hooked up I'd like all six
hooked<00:02:07.659> up<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.800> little<00:02:09.039> joystick<00:02:09.340> I'm<00:02:09.970> gonna

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
hooked up the little joystick I'm gonna

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.809 
hooked up the little joystick I'm gonna
actually<00:02:10.600> strip<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.530> down<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.490> it's<00:02:12.730> just

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
actually strip that down and it's just

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.840 
actually strip that down and it's just
gonna<00:02:13.209> go<00:02:13.420> into<00:02:13.870> like<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.110> little<00:02:14.850> component

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
gonna go into like a little component

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.190 
gonna go into like a little component
box<00:02:16.060> like<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.360> little<00:02:16.690> do-it-yourself<00:02:17.850> kind<00:02:18.850> of

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
box like a little do-it-yourself kind of

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.410 
box like a little do-it-yourself kind of
plastic<00:02:20.200> utility<00:02:20.770> box<00:02:21.120> that'll<00:02:22.120> just<00:02:22.270> get

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
plastic utility box that'll just get

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.809 
plastic utility box that'll just get
mounted<00:02:22.870> on<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.110> back<00:02:23.260> somewhere<00:02:23.890> so

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
mounted on the back somewhere so

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.580 
mounted on the back somewhere so
basically<00:02:25.120> all<00:02:25.209> this<00:02:25.540> internal<00:02:26.110> is<00:02:26.200> gonna<00:02:26.410> go

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
basically all this internal is gonna go

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.229 
basically all this internal is gonna go
into<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.920> box<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.430> little<00:02:27.520> bit<00:02:27.670> bigger<00:02:27.910> than<00:02:28.060> this

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
into a box a little bit bigger than this

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.479 
into a box a little bit bigger than this
and<00:02:28.780> it'll<00:02:28.930> just<00:02:29.140> be<00:02:29.320> hard<00:02:29.650> mounted<00:02:30.100> right<00:02:30.310> to

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
and it'll just be hard mounted right to

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.180 
and it'll just be hard mounted right to
the<00:02:30.610> -<00:02:30.850> I'm<00:02:31.750> gonna<00:02:31.930> put<00:02:32.170> another<00:02:32.260> blackboard

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
the - I'm gonna put another blackboard

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.910 
the - I'm gonna put another blackboard
going<00:02:33.760> across<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.570> top<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.050> that<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.650> kind<00:02:35.860> of

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
going across the top so that it kind of

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.560 
going across the top so that it kind of
covers<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.340> top<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:36.910> each<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.420> switches

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
covers the top of each of the switches

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.810 
covers the top of each of the switches
and<00:02:38.050> it'll<00:02:38.530> obviously<00:02:38.650> cover<00:02:39.070> over<00:02:39.430> top<00:02:39.640> of

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
and it'll obviously cover over top of

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.720 
and it'll obviously cover over top of
this<00:02:40.530> besides<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.830> I<00:02:41.860> want<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.310> wire<00:02:42.489> that

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
this besides that I want to wire that

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.000 
this besides that I want to wire that
little<00:02:43.060> switch<00:02:43.360> in<00:02:43.390> if<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.440> remember<00:02:44.890> this

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
little switch in if you remember this

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.860 
little switch in if you remember this
was<00:02:45.250> just<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.580> tiny<00:02:45.820> little<00:02:46.060> switch<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:46.690> I<00:02:46.720> had

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
was just a tiny little switch that I had

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.770 
was just a tiny little switch that I had
placed<00:02:47.140> inside<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.920> shifter<00:02:48.420> I'm<00:02:49.420> just<00:02:49.600> with

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
placed inside the shifter I'm just with

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.870 
placed inside the shifter I'm just with
a<00:02:49.810> little<00:02:50.140> tiny<00:02:50.380> button<00:02:50.769> glue<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.700> bag

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
a little tiny button glue to the bag

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.030 
a little tiny button glue to the bag
just<00:02:52.180> for<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.480> resistance<00:02:55.530> works<00:02:56.530> perfectly

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
just for the resistance works perfectly

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.800 
just for the resistance works perfectly
no<00:02:57.459> just<00:02:57.670> for<00:02:57.970> whatever<00:02:58.090> I<00:02:58.300> need<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.660> for

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
no just for whatever I need it for

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.199 
no just for whatever I need it for
that's<00:02:59.080> gonna<00:02:59.290> be<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.590> shifter<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.209> other

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
that's gonna be the shifter so other

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.310 
that's gonna be the shifter so other
than<00:03:01.299> that<00:03:01.420> that's<00:03:01.570> pretty<00:03:01.840> much<00:03:02.019> where<00:03:02.260> it

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
than that that's pretty much where it

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.560 
than that that's pretty much where it
stands<00:03:02.620> now<00:03:02.860> so<00:03:03.280> yeah<00:03:03.820> I<00:03:03.850> want<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.209> get<00:03:04.299> all<00:03:04.450> the
