00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:25.970
 the world that we would win but I feel 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.279
 that you can not go to the desert here 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:33.650
 we are going to do the boxing of the 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:36.100
 forbidden desert me either but it 's 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.100
 prohibited 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.420
 please leave what I have thought of 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.879
 this improvised performance good then 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.739
 let's go here the forbidden desert that is 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.540
 the second part 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:53.470
 I do not know what to call it from the forbidden island 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.470
 in the same game but different 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.030
 if you want the 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.640
 but well, here we have the box 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.910
 of metal a little bit bigger than that of 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.910
 the island 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:17.650
 10 to 45 minutes are exposed with a 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.590
 game and from 2 to 5 players a lot 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.870
 they like cooperative games a lot 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.520
 cooperative the forbidden one had a lot 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.920
 success and this the truth that has also 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.900
 liked pretty inditex that says that 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.440
 it's more cool and everyone will have to see 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.940
 at home with her friends with her friends 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.810
 while peru poquita the boy 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.810
 access the box 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.740
 for other things 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.310
 the sand that the players 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:05.299
 Destructions in full color with 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.299
 diagrams like webber is fine because 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.530
 yes 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:29.659
 the flying is a fantasy game like 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:31.640
 you can put parts the objective if you 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.129
 you remember the other was to find some 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.810
 treasures and here then one thing that is very 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.459
 cool we have to find the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.260
 pieces of our embroidery machine then 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.439
 to get out from certain in the 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.970
 which we can not we can not go out and we 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.970
 swallow our doctor 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.470
 certain things 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.799
 the same the pawns with our 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.799
 eggs 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:14.820
 castilla of fragments of pure 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.820
 are here 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:26.790
 the piece 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:33.709
 because 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:43.370
 stations and castles between games 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.370
 five years 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:54.450
 because here are the motherboards 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.450
 of the characters the climber 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:01.850
 everyone has their skill did not say 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:04.760
 something navigator explorer and if there are six 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.230
 profiles six colors to save five 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.440
 players so I guess so for 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.440
 you choose 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.000
 special 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.350
 in this blue game if we get the blue 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.510
 you will die is predicted here we have the 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.960
 letters these are a few portfolios a type 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.960
 of letters 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:32.710
 of objects and so on because you can go 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:37.300
 doing things on stage and here 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:41.100
 we have the same letters that mark the 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.100
 time for the island to move 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:05:03.360
 it's easier than the storm 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.770
 this a lot 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:23.440
 on the one hand and on the other hand 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:24.640
 in red as you see a lot of dunes 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.620
 you have one to bore 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.750
 like this if he does not want to play afterwards 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.370
 fire you put a rug and 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.370
 Obviously what is cooler than they are 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.960
 the steelers of the city is that 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.210
 the desert is being eaten 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.790
 ruins of these that on the one hand 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.010
 this is the initial 7 is supposed to 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.600
 you arrive with the humpback ship and on the other 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.870
 side then the other side what is caught 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.870
 this 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.850
 As you can see they are pretty cool 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:52.850
 where you want to cina twice 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.110
 good 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:01.569
 down 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:08.169
 that is put at the beginning of the games to 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:10.779
 put in a hostile to create the zone 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:16.479
 of game that are also different from 

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:18.629
 departure variety moving moves the 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.629
 board 

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:27.919
 look how nice 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:33.860
 guys to the people 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.680
 good good while Peru continues with its 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.300
 fantasies we already said goodbye and 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.650
 the proximity we will see is evident 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.650
 Certain prohibited
