00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
 on buddy starting to wonder a bit

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.120 
 on buddy starting to wonder a bit
by<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.250> my<00:00:20.460> methodology<00:00:21.210> but<00:00:21.750> no<00:00:22.500> you're<00:00:22.710> good

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
by the my methodology but no you're good

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.279 
by the my methodology but no you're good
yeah<00:00:23.760> just<00:00:24.359> hopping<00:00:24.660> across<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.930> big<00:00:25.170> one

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
yeah just hopping across a big one

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.580 
yeah just hopping across a big one
eventually<00:00:25.500> it's<00:00:26.010> just<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.189> marathon<00:00:27.500> on<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
eventually it's just a marathon on the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.779 
eventually it's just a marathon on the
ground<00:00:28.830> unless<00:00:29.220> there's<00:00:29.550> something<00:00:29.730> you

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
ground unless there's something you

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.690 
ground unless there's something you
don't<00:00:29.910> know<00:00:30.029> about<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.449> coil<00:00:32.899> we<00:00:33.899> should<00:00:34.140> um

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
don't know about the coil we should um

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.979 
don't know about the coil we should um
very<00:00:35.700> plenty<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.120> targets<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> ground<00:00:36.870> and

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
very plenty of targets in the ground and

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.209 
very plenty of targets in the ground and
going<00:00:37.170> over<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.500> testing<00:00:37.829> them<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.040> they're

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219
