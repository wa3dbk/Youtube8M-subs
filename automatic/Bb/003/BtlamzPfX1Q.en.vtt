00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hi greets you roll man director in 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.060
 500 dollars in 60 days dotcom and in 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.670
 this video I'm going to talk about seo for 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.380
 videos 10 points to keep in mind in the 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.639
 positioning of your videos on youtube 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.349
 the first thing we have to have in 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.059
 account is the keyword is to say no 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.800
 we can make a video for any 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.630
 motive is not just making a video 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.850
 to try to position ourselves we have 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.769
 than to look for a word and it's because of 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.869
 next reason for point number 2 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.150
 we have to look for a word that has a 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.710
 certain number of searches and a certain 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.320
 in a competition either that is 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.000
 excessive not the third point would be the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.640
 way we upload our file 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.890
 Youtube may seem silly but 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.350
 it is important point number four the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.579
 title we need then as we have already 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.070
 searched for a word to be 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.930
 position we need to put that 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.750
 word in the title and well why not 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.399
 we can put something else as tips or something 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.140
 that also calls attention to 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.600
 that people click on our video 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.460
 point number 5 the description must be 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.230
 set it up in a certain way and then 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.480
 logically the keyword they have 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.129
 to be included in this in this little 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.710
 description that does not have to be very 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.240
 big 6 important point tags 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.130
 also that to use too many 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.619
 if we liked the keyword then 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.399
 maybe that word and two words that 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.990
 so they are relevant point 7 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.570
 important also the number of 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.009
 how many more reproductions 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.799
 reproductions has our video then 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.750
 better what to see us from youtube and better 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.049
 will position us then well then 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.479
 there are certain ways do not be careful 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.039
 with how those reproductions are generated 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.929
 that are real reproductions of 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.420
 real people because if you could not 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.399
 have certain problems number of me 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.319
 you like how many more I like 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.630
 a video then equally well youtube not 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.490
 it will see us better and it will position us 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.020
 better so good then you have to 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.780
 get our video to have 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.850
 The more I like the better point number 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.590
 nine the comments is very important 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.850
 well also have the comments 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.619
 when a video 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.420
 it draws attention normally 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.759
 people leave a comment and then 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.890
 that on YouTube you see it from in a certain 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.349
 way is very positive for the 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.209
 positioning of that video and by 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.039
 last number 10 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.560
 the incoming links is important that 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.110
 our video has some center before 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.849
 good incoming is nothing more than 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.830
 from a social network for example the 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.800
 link to our video we would say that 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.180
 from that social network there is a link 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.250
 focused on our video that would be in 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.349
 the central because there are many networks 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.470
 social since we can share our 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.540
 video lots of social networks 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.670
 in many more places than good because 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.040
 do not nominate case simply in this 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.690
 video I wanted to explain these 10 points 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.310
 that seem very important to me at the time 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.420
 to position a video on youtube and 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.239
 that if you leave we're going to make a 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.519
 I'm going to read them all 10 so that 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.069
 you stay pretty clear point number 1 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.989
 keywords point number two the 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.880
 number of searches and the competition that 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.920
 has that keyword point number 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.440
 three the way to upload the file to 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.959
 youtube point number four the title 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.970
 that must carry the keyword point 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.220
 number five a small description with 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.230
 the keyword point number six in 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.720
 not many labels the keyword 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.610
 and two related point number seven 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.380
 get increase the number of 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.810
 reproductions of our video point 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.330
 number eight get how many more 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.400
 like better point number nine 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.860
 get comments on our videos 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.890
 and point number 10 get links 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.010
 incoming for our videos this 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.030
 way our video is going to position 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.070
 relatively fast if we have made a 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.370
 good search the word surely in 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:40.160
 a matter of hours already with this I say goodbye 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.660
