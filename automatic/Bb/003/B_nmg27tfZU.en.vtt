bypass<00:01:43.500> into<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.190> person<00:01:44.520> up<00:01:44.640> top<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.090> doing

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
bypass into the person up top and doing

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.180 
bypass into the person up top and doing
the<00:01:45.390> jump<00:01:45.630> throw<00:01:45.929> and<00:01:46.200> paying<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.560> guy<00:01:46.679> so<00:01:47.069> on

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
the jump throw and paying the guy so on

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.300 
the jump throw and paying the guy so on
the<00:01:47.310> ground<00:01:47.929> you<00:01:48.929> usually<00:01:49.140> don't<00:01:49.319> see<00:01:49.560> do<00:01:50.069> this

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
the ground you usually don't see do this

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.100 
the ground you usually don't see do this
because<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.090> do<00:01:51.179> a<00:01:51.209> lot<00:01:51.390> more<00:01:51.450> damage<00:01:51.780> just

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
because I can do a lot more damage just

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.480 
because I can do a lot more damage just
by<00:01:52.289> passing<00:01:52.740> back<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.039> the<00:01:53.130> guy<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.429> left

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
by passing back to the guy on the left

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.910 
by passing back to the guy on the left
side<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.060> field<00:01:54.330> if<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.229> are<00:01:55.500> at<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> end

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
side of the field if you are at the end

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.230 
side of the field if you are at the end
of<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.069> game<00:01:56.100> or<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.580> really<00:01:56.850> want<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.090> get

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
of the game or you really want to get

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.149 
of the game or you really want to get
rid<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.569> certain<00:01:57.899> player<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.590> can<00:01:58.740> pass<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
rid of a certain player you can pass the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.580 
rid of a certain player you can pass the
guy<00:01:59.310> up<00:01:59.459> top<00:01:59.670> into<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.209> damage<00:02:00.539> now<00:02:01.530> you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
guy up top into the damage now you

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.429 
guy up top into the damage now you
notice<00:02:01.830> that<00:02:01.950> Boris<00:02:02.369> also<00:02:02.789> has<00:02:02.939> accelerated

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
notice that Boris also has accelerated

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.499 
notice that Boris also has accelerated
accept<00:02:04.439> his<00:02:04.770> doesn't<00:02:05.250> tend<00:02:05.789> to<00:02:05.970> cause<00:02:06.149> much

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
accept his doesn't tend to cause much

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.150 
accept his doesn't tend to cause much
trouble<00:02:06.539> for<00:02:06.959> you<00:02:07.170> because<00:02:07.530> he<00:02:07.619> throws<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.039> at

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
trouble for you because he throws it at

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.070 
trouble for you because he throws it at
the<00:02:08.399> midline<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.269> it<00:02:09.360> doesn't<00:02:09.660> have<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> lot<00:02:10.050> of

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
the midline so it doesn't have a lot of

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.380 
the midline so it doesn't have a lot of
opportunity<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.979> speed<00:02:11.250> up<00:02:11.400> usually<00:02:12.239> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
opportunity to speed up usually the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.970 
opportunity to speed up usually the
biggest<00:02:12.569> confusion<00:02:13.200> with<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.349> accelerator

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
biggest confusion with the accelerator

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.280 
biggest confusion with the accelerator
is<00:02:14.250> when<00:02:14.849> he<00:02:14.970> actually<00:02:15.209> doesn't<00:02:15.629> get<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.959> often

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
is when he actually doesn't get it often

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.960 
is when he actually doesn't get it often
does<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> normal<00:02:16.920> throw<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.730> actually

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
does a normal throw and that actually

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.520 
does a normal throw and that actually
comes<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.420> hit<00:02:18.629> you<00:02:18.780> faster<00:02:19.290> than<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
comes to hit you faster than the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:30.970 
comes to hit you faster than the
accelerator

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.230 

okay<00:02:31.980> now<00:02:32.100> most<00:02:32.310> people<00:02:32.430> think<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:32.910> can't<00:02:32.940> do

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
okay now most people think you can't do

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.030 
okay now most people think you can't do
power<00:02:33.480> moves<00:02:33.750> against<00:02:34.050> sideline<00:02:34.500> guys<00:02:34.740> but

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
power moves against sideline guys but

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.059 
power moves against sideline guys but
watch<00:02:35.190> what<00:02:35.220> Steve<00:02:35.640> does<00:02:36.380> did<00:02:37.380> an<00:02:37.470> accelerator

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
watch what Steve does did an accelerator

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.620 
watch what Steve does did an accelerator
right<00:02:38.340> against<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.730> top<00:02:38.910> sidelined<00:02:39.420> I've

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
right against the top sidelined I've

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.290 
right against the top sidelined I've
USSR<00:02:40.370> most<00:02:41.370> people<00:02:41.700> know<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.180> would

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
USSR most people know that you would

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.880 
USSR most people know that you would
just<00:02:42.360> throw<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.870> ball<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.200> hit<00:02:43.320> somebody<00:02:43.560> for

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
just throw the ball and hit somebody for

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.590 
just throw the ball and hit somebody for
some<00:02:44.070> fun<00:02:44.250> but<00:02:44.520> since<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.850> accelerator<00:02:45.390> goes

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
some fun but since the accelerator goes

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.300 
some fun but since the accelerator goes
down<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.050> ground<00:02:46.200> level<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:46.740> early<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.160> can

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
down to ground level so early you can

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.250 
down to ground level so early you can
also<00:02:47.640> score<00:02:48.030> power<00:02:48.300> moves<00:02:48.690> against<00:02:49.110> the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
also score power moves against the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.020 
also score power moves against the
sideline<00:02:49.650> guys<00:02:49.860> they<00:02:50.490> come<00:02:50.670> back<00:02:50.850> eventually

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
sideline guys they come back eventually

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.850 
sideline guys they come back eventually
as<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.510> can<00:02:51.630> see<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.930> guy<00:02:52.050> head<00:02:52.290> back<00:02:52.500> towards

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
as you can see the guy head back towards

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.770 
as you can see the guy head back towards
the<00:02:52.920> left<00:02:53.130> but<00:02:53.700> it's<00:02:54.000> fun<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.480> can<00:02:54.660> get

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
the left but it's fun and you can get

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:04.290 
the left but it's fun and you can get
root<00:02:54.989> guys<00:02:55.170> for<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.470> while<00:02:55.590> by<00:02:55.830> doing

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.390 

okay<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:05.420> that<00:03:05.510> does<00:03:05.690> it<00:03:05.780> for<00:03:05.810> USSR<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:07.190> last

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
okay and that does it for USSR the last

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.740 
okay and that does it for USSR the last
thing<00:03:07.640> you're<00:03:07.730> going<00:03:07.910> plays<00:03:08.180> are<00:03:08.360> shadowed

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
thing you're going plays are shadowed

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.690 
thing you're going plays are shadowed
these<00:03:09.410> are<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.650> same<00:03:09.890> guys<00:03:10.160> that<00:03:10.190> you<00:03:10.490> chose

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
these are the same guys that you chose

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.700 
these are the same guys that you chose
to<00:03:10.850> play<00:03:11.150> in<00:03:11.390> snow<00:03:11.510> star<00:03:11.990> would<00:03:12.200> except<00:03:12.590> they

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
to play in snow star would except they

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.590 
to play in snow star would except they
have<00:03:12.800> bulked<00:03:13.070> up<00:03:13.160> stats<00:03:13.490> so<00:03:14.150> they<00:03:14.270> have<00:03:14.360> great

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
have bulked up stats so they have great

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.840 
have bulked up stats so they have great
endurance<00:03:14.930> we<00:03:15.800> catch<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.190> ball<00:03:16.340> a<00:03:16.370> lot<00:03:16.550> better

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
endurance we catch the ball a lot better

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.430 
endurance we catch the ball a lot better
and<00:03:17.090> they<00:03:17.210> also<00:03:17.360> throw<00:03:17.660> some<00:03:17.840> power<00:03:18.020> moves<00:03:18.110> at

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
and they also throw some power moves at

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.260 
and they also throw some power moves at
me<00:03:18.620> if<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.160> want<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.520> have<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.670> slightly<00:03:20.000> easier

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
me if you want to have a slightly easier

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.120 
me if you want to have a slightly easier
time<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:20.930> can<00:03:21.080> choose<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.290> weaker<00:03:21.650> player<00:03:21.890> for

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
time you can choose a weaker player for

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.160 
time you can choose a weaker player for
the<00:03:22.160> USSR<00:03:22.820> around<00:03:23.060> like<00:03:23.270> Mike<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:23.750> omit<00:03:24.140> a

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
the USSR around like Mike and omit a

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.660 
the USSR around like Mike and omit a
player<00:03:24.440> that<00:03:24.470> throws<00:03:24.830> powerful<00:03:25.280> shots<00:03:25.520> like

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
player that throws powerful shots like

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.030 
player that throws powerful shots like
Samuel<00:03:26.060> Randy<00:03:26.450> I<00:03:26.630> think<00:03:27.170> that<00:03:27.320> be<00:03:27.470> last<00:03:27.650> final

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
Samuel Randy I think that be last final

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.950 
Samuel Randy I think that be last final
wouldn't<00:03:28.730> want<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:29.000> choose<00:03:29.240> job<00:03:29.510> because<00:03:29.840> it

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
wouldn't want to choose job because it
