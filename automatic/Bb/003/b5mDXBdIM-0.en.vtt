00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:02.030
 knows 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:03.290
 when 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.280
 augusta in public 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.739
 these 

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:10.329
 when they are public 

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:13.459
 their works 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.329
 the decision was divided as when there is a way with two bulls are bad 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:19.880
 the decision to follow 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.880
 they want to skin the bullfighter and others want to pay 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:27.319
 many people said that it was installed 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:31.399
 and there were two or three who said there you have a people 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.930
 Years passed 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.160
 and all the einstein's follies turned into genius 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.910
 I've already told you the story 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.090
 one of the ideas that the tube 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.750
 he dismissed it said he said this what I just said is the worst mistake 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.170
 in my career 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.210
 at the end of the twentieth century beginning of the 21st century 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.190
 we discovered 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.640
 that what you owe and there it is in that it is nonsense turned out to be true 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.270
 the strange idea that I had and I felt that there is a force 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.930
 per cent of repulsion between objects located at a great distance 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.830
 which is a kind of counterpart of gravity 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.100
 that happens with all times 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.550
 with the crisis with him 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.580
 chávez 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.320
 this gentleman 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.910
 Among other things 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.180
 He assured that all living beings 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.790
 they come from a common ancestor 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.460
 when he said this 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.109
 people just did not want to hear it said 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:33.970
 said this is crazy first 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.370
 living beings do not descend from other living beings 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.280
 horses have horses 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.280
 the area of ​​the facts come from the mayor and his 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.510
 min species do not descend from other species 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.970
 there have always been horses since they were created by rivers 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.310
 then we realized that Darwin was indeed right 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.640
 that species evolve 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.290
 little by little all the fundamental ideas all the precepts 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.540
 fundamentals and the theory of evolution 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.540
 they have been confirmed 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:11.789
 the only one that seems impossible to confirm is the one that I mentioned to him 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:12.839
 moment 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.839
 all living beings have a common ancestor 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.459
 It gives the impression that it is like this 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.429
 this is a cell in my cache 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.429
 big par 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.199
 these cells 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:39.839
 a plasma musician 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.109
 a body and it has a loop 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:43.829
 inside the nucleus 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.679
 ain adrienne deoxyribonucleic acid 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:50.489
 that is wrapped together with other proteins called histones to form 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.629
 these structures that are called as they are 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.789
 if I grab a cell from a hedgehog 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:03:00.269
 a cell of a rotisserie or a cell of a protozoan I'm going to see 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.149
 the same 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:03.650
 I'm going to see harem wrapped in stories 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.370
 I'm going to see the same kind of proteins that are taken care of april carefully 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.710
 the age molecule in etiler the information that is recorded in it 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.699
 to produce proteins 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.969
 all living beings have the same molecular machinery all 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:19.859
 that as it suggests 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.079
 that we all come from a common ancestor 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.189
 but is not 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.309
 alves it is possible to demonstrate 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:32.009
 ideas about the physical world 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:34.489
 with truncheons 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.489
 in the story that brings you because it details and in the text 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.419
 he presented the case of a scientist half biologist half mathematician 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:47.269
 that he got to analyze the chemical composition of certain proteins very 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.379
 peculiar that exists in a lot of living beings efe 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:55.279
 there are proteins that can be found on an old bus on a picket in a 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:56.949
 second the council 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:00.129
 there are proteins that are the cells of all living beings are 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.099
 You can study these molecules 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.819
 that are almost equal in all cases you can study the small 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:06.969
 differences 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:10.449
 and then make an artistic proposal a joke theme 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:11.679
 design 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:13.979
 let's suppose 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.979
 that life appeared in two or three places 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.639
 putin caracas his evolution or by his own way 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.579
 that I should not have done in the case of these proteins 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:28.899
 there should be a very large difference between the proteins of certain groups 

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:30.749
 for example of certain bacteria 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:31.750
 in relation 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.479
 to all mammals 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.580
 what found skeletons weights particular proteins that are common 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.660
 all living things are too similar 

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:43.229
 as if they had 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.699
 appeared independently in several groups of organs 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.099
 if life appears in three different places 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:54.099
 I'll have to make a lot of coincidence that in all three cases 

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:57.979
 these lives that were evolving on their own 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.849
 will develop the same type sport 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.069
 if all living beings on planet earth have these proteins 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.259
 particular in the nucleus of our cells 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.199
 it's because we defend a common ancestor 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.199
 the last great idea 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.050
 of Darwin's theory of evolution has just been shown not with a fossil 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.089
 but with mathematics 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:19.939
 really you and me 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:22.610
 and all living beings on earth 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.400
 all living beings who have participated in all events 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.410
 great terrible miserable of them 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.740
 in the history of the earth 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.639
 a common ancestor 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.400
 life on earth is one with many different manifestations 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.110
 one of them 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.650
 and email and remember that without writing if you like 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.230
 Take your coffee and we give ourselves a new home
