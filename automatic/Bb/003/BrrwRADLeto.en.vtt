00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
you got to cut to perfect miters to fit

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.430 
you got to cut to perfect miters to fit
into<00:00:11.460> that<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.790> you<00:00:11.880> have<00:00:12.000> no<00:00:12.179> option<00:00:12.690> it's

into that and you have no option it's

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.039 
into that and you have no option it's
either<00:00:13.590> fits<00:00:14.280> or<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.549> doesn't<00:00:14.759> if<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.599> started

either fits or it doesn't if you started
with<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.350> top<00:00:17.029> cut<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.210> miters<00:00:18.800> nail<00:00:19.800> it

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
with the top cut you to miters nail it

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.670 
with the top cut you to miters nail it
on<00:00:20.160> then<00:00:21.090> cut<00:00:21.330> your<00:00:21.480> miter<00:00:21.660> on<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.990> leg<00:00:22.350> and

on then cut your miter on the leg and
you<00:00:23.160> put<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.580> up<00:00:23.699> there<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.000> it's<00:00:24.119> out<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> hair

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
you put it up there and it's out a hair

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.259 
you put it up there and it's out a hair
you<00:00:24.840> can<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.140> choice<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.410> recut<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:25.949> or<00:00:26.269> you

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
you can have a choice to recut it or you

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.200 
you can have a choice to recut it or you
could<00:00:27.449> say<00:00:27.689> it's<00:00:27.810> just<00:00:28.050> out<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:29.039> know<00:00:29.210> 64th

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
could say it's just out of you know 64th

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.659 
could say it's just out of you know 64th
move<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.619> fits<00:00:31.800> tight<00:00:32.099> glue<00:00:32.520> it

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
move it so that it fits tight glue it

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.900 
move it so that it fits tight glue it
stay<00:00:33.320> nail<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.350> then<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.130> start<00:00:35.399> bend<00:00:35.730> your

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
stay nail it then you start bend your

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.100 
stay nail it then you start bend your
molding<00:00:36.180> just<00:00:36.360> out<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> little<00:00:36.690> bit<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:36.989> it's

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
molding just out a little bit so it's

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.410 
molding just out a little bit so it's
going<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.260> come<00:00:37.469> down<00:00:37.530> literally<00:00:38.430> it'll<00:00:38.670> come

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
going to come down literally it'll come

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.060 
going to come down literally it'll come
like<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.379> then<00:00:40.800> you're<00:00:40.920> going<00:00:41.010> to

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
like this and then you're going to

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.530 
like this and then you're going to
straighten<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.489> out<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:41.730> it's<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.030> minuscule

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
straighten it out but it's so minuscule

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.270 
straighten it out but it's so minuscule
that<00:00:42.690> you're<00:00:42.809> not<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.170> see<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.379> right<00:00:44.070> so

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
that you're not going to see it right so

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.500 
that you're not going to see it right so
you've<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:49.430> nope<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.670> would<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.149> cut<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
you've just nope I would just cut it and

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.930 
you've just nope I would just cut it and
stick<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.750> out<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.739> what<00:00:52.890> we'll<00:00:53.010> do<00:00:53.160> here<00:00:55.940> yes

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
stick it out so what we'll do here yes

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.119 
stick it out so what we'll do here yes
yeah<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.690> I'll<00:00:57.780> show<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:57.960> why<00:00:58.199> we'll<00:00:58.890> do<00:00:59.010> that

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
yeah and I'll show you why we'll do that

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:14.430 
yeah and I'll show you why we'll do that
rogue<00:00:59.340> faster

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.640 

yep

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:31.350 

ok

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.790 

now<00:01:32.360> here's<00:01:32.600> a<00:01:32.660> here's<00:01:33.140> a<00:01:33.260> bit<00:01:33.440> of<00:01:33.470> a<00:01:33.590> conundrum

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
now here's a here's a bit of a conundrum

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.470 
now here's a here's a bit of a conundrum
you<00:01:34.250> cut<00:01:34.460> your<00:01:34.610> miter<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:37.300> you<00:01:38.300> got<00:01:38.450> to

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
you cut your miter and you got to

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.650 
you cut your miter and you got to
measure<00:01:38.810> you<00:01:39.740> got<00:01:39.860> to<00:01:39.950> measure<00:01:40.130> a<00:01:40.220> length<00:01:40.660> so

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
measure you got to measure a length so

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.690 
measure you got to measure a length so
how<00:01:41.810> do<00:01:41.870> you<00:01:41.990> hold<00:01:42.230> that<00:01:42.440> where<00:01:43.340> you<00:01:43.490> need<00:01:43.670> it

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
how do you hold that where you need it

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.780 
how do you hold that where you need it
to<00:01:43.940> be<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:44.840> you<00:01:44.900> cut<00:01:45.110> it<00:01:45.260> an<00:01:46.010> easy<00:01:46.190> way<00:01:46.370> to<00:01:46.490> do<00:01:46.700> it

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
to be so you cut it an easy way to do it

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.420 
to be so you cut it an easy way to do it
is<00:01:46.880> you've<00:01:47.120> got<00:01:47.330> a<00:01:47.360> miter<00:01:47.660> saw<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.250> you<00:01:49.250> got<00:01:49.400> a

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
is you've got a miter saw and you got a

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.930 
is you've got a miter saw and you got a
bench<00:01:52.180> you<00:01:53.180> can<00:01:53.330> take<00:01:53.510> this<00:01:54.550> take<00:01:55.550> this<00:01:55.580> piece

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
bench you can take this take this piece

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.300 
bench you can take this take this piece
of<00:01:56.120> board<00:01:56.360> bring<00:01:57.140> it<00:01:57.260> to<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.500> I've<00:01:57.620> gotta<00:01:57.860> stop

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
of board bring it to the I've gotta stop

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.400 
of board bring it to the I've gotta stop
here<00:01:58.640> bring<00:01:59.330> it<00:01:59.360> right<00:01:59.750> onto<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.080> edge<00:02:00.290> of

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
here bring it right onto the edge of

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.170 
here bring it right onto the edge of
that<00:02:00.470> stop<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:01.280> can<00:02:01.430> see<00:02:01.760> now<00:02:01.910> you<00:02:01.970> can

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
that stop so you can see now you can

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.240 
that stop so you can see now you can
hook<00:02:02.300> your<00:02:02.360> tape<00:02:02.660> measure<00:02:02.690> on<00:02:03.170> here<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:04.010> go<00:02:04.190> to

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
hook your tape measure on here and go to

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.780 
hook your tape measure on here and go to
wherever<00:02:04.460> you<00:02:04.729> want<00:02:04.940> okay<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:07.280> little<00:02:07.550> trick

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
wherever you want okay the little trick

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.719 
wherever you want okay the little trick

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
that not too tough but if you don't know

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.130 
that not too tough but if you don't know
it<00:02:10.910> or<00:02:11.060> you<00:02:11.090> don't<00:02:11.270> think<00:02:11.450> about<00:02:11.750> it<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:11.959> going

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
it or you don't think about it you going

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.840 
it or you don't think about it you going
on<00:02:12.260> now<00:02:12.470> how<00:02:12.590> do<00:02:12.650> I<00:02:12.740> measure<00:02:12.920> these<00:02:13.190> right<00:02:13.430> so

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
on now how do I measure these right so

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.070 
on now how do I measure these right so
I've<00:02:13.940> got<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:14.270> lined<00:02:14.510> up<00:02:14.660> there<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.050> I

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
I've got that lined up there and I

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:23.170 
I've got that lined up there and I
forgot<00:02:15.350> my<00:02:15.470> measurement<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:21.880> like<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:23.030> use

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
forgot my measurement I like to use

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.620 
forgot my measurement I like to use
about<00:02:23.450> an<00:02:23.570> eighth<00:02:23.780> of<00:02:23.990> an<00:02:24.140> inch<00:02:25.360> why<00:02:26.360> aren't

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
about an eighth of an inch why aren't

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.720 
about an eighth of an inch why aren't
you<00:02:26.750> measure<00:02:26.959> them<00:02:27.110> right<00:02:27.320> from<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.650> end<00:02:30.730> I'll

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
you measure them right from the end I'll

00:02:31.730 --> 00:03:00.509 
you measure them right from the end I'll
show<00:02:32.540> you<00:02:32.600> in<00:02:32.959> one<00:02:33.200> second

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.430 

the<00:03:01.519> reason<00:03:01.790> we're<00:03:01.910> not<00:03:01.959> measuring<00:03:02.959> from<00:03:03.290> the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
the reason we're not measuring from the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.900 
the reason we're not measuring from the
inside<00:03:03.830> to<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.040> inside<00:03:04.430> because<00:03:04.640> I<00:03:04.760> don't

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
inside to the inside because I don't

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.410 
inside to the inside because I don't
want<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:06.200> try<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:06.560> make<00:03:06.709> this<00:03:07.420> completely

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
want to try and make this completely

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.930 
want to try and make this completely
flush<00:03:08.870> like<00:03:09.170> that<00:03:09.489> because<00:03:10.489> then<00:03:10.730> when<00:03:10.849> you

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
flush like that because then when you

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.220 
flush like that because then when you
paint<00:03:11.239> this<00:03:11.420> you're<00:03:11.660> always<00:03:11.840> going<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:11.989> see

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
paint this you're always going to see

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.900 
paint this you're always going to see
that<00:03:12.410> line<00:03:12.709> it's<00:03:13.099> going<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.310> be<00:03:13.459> in<00:03:13.640> and<00:03:13.819> out

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
that line it's going to be in and out

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.000 
that line it's going to be in and out
it's<00:03:14.239> just<00:03:14.330> it's<00:03:14.599> not<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:15.170> very<00:03:15.470> good<00:03:15.560> way<00:03:15.769> to<00:03:15.799> do

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
it's just it's not a very good way to do

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.580 
it's just it's not a very good way to do
that<00:03:16.190> if<00:03:16.760> you<00:03:16.940> move<00:03:17.209> that<00:03:17.420> back<00:03:17.720> an<00:03:18.110> eighth<00:03:18.440> of

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
that if you move that back an eighth of

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.190 
that if you move that back an eighth of
an<00:03:18.709> inch<00:03:18.829> like<00:03:19.160> this<00:03:19.780> then<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:20.900> can<00:03:21.019> run<00:03:21.170> a

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
an inch like this then you can run a

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.930 
an inch like this then you can run a
little<00:03:21.440> bead<00:03:21.560> of<00:03:21.590> caulking<00:03:21.920> down<00:03:22.280> there<00:03:22.549> and

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
little bead of caulking down there and

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.270 
little bead of caulking down there and
it<00:03:23.569> looks<00:03:23.840> like<00:03:24.110> you<00:03:24.470> designed<00:03:24.890> it<00:03:25.069> that<00:03:25.099> way

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
it looks like you designed it that way

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.089 
it looks like you designed it that way
if<00:03:25.880> you<00:03:26.000> go<00:03:26.239> and<00:03:26.660> put<00:03:27.110> it<00:03:27.200> like<00:03:27.349> this<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.620> paint

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
if you go and put it like this and paint

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.770 
if you go and put it like this and paint
it<00:03:28.250> you'll<00:03:28.430> see<00:03:28.730> that<00:03:28.760> mark<00:03:29.269> you'll<00:03:29.480> see<00:03:29.630> that

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
it you'll see that mark you'll see that

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.050 
it you'll see that mark you'll see that
line<00:03:30.079> and<00:03:30.410> it<00:03:30.890> ends<00:03:31.130> up<00:03:31.190> looking<00:03:31.250> like<00:03:31.640> you

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
line and it ends up looking like you

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.210 
line and it ends up looking like you
really<00:03:32.329> didn't<00:03:32.690> know<00:03:32.870> what<00:03:33.200> you<00:03:33.950> should<00:03:34.130> have

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
really didn't know what you should have

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.180 
really didn't know what you should have
been<00:03:34.340> doing<00:03:34.610> okay<00:03:34.989> and<00:03:35.989> that<00:03:36.650> reveal<00:03:36.950> can<00:03:37.099> be

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
been doing okay and that reveal can be

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.620 
been doing okay and that reveal can be
as<00:03:37.280> big<00:03:37.430> as<00:03:37.549> you<00:03:37.700> want<00:03:37.910> you<00:03:38.090> could<00:03:38.239> make<00:03:38.450> it

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
as big as you want you could make it

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.199 
as big as you want you could make it
this<00:03:39.410> big<00:03:39.470> if<00:03:39.829> you<00:03:39.950> want<00:03:40.160> right<00:03:40.549> as<00:03:40.730> long<00:03:40.940> as<00:03:41.000> if

inch on one door make it an intermittent

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.490 
inch on one door make it an intermittent
on<00:03:46.250> your<00:03:46.459> window<00:03:46.760> casing<00:03:47.239> on<00:03:47.510> your<00:03:47.840> doors<00:03:48.109> on

no<00:04:05.930> this<00:04:06.930> one<00:04:07.110> might<00:04:07.260> this<00:04:07.409> door<00:04:07.620> might<00:04:07.830> not<00:04:07.980> be

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
no this one might this door might not be

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.740 
no this one might this door might not be
great<00:04:08.550> because<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:08.940> didn't<00:04:09.150> level<00:04:09.420> it<00:04:09.540> in<00:04:09.659> i

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
great because I didn't level it in i

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.449 
great because I didn't level it in i
just<00:04:09.780> threw<00:04:10.170> it<00:04:10.200> in<00:04:10.349> sonos<00:04:10.799> most<00:04:11.159> doors

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
just threw it in sonos most doors

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.930 
just threw it in sonos most doors
they're<00:04:12.360> going<00:04:12.599> to<00:04:12.750> be<00:04:13.310> completely<00:04:14.310> plumb<00:04:14.700> if

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
they're going to be completely plumb if

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.849 
they're going to be completely plumb if
they're<00:04:15.060> hung<00:04:15.209> properly<00:04:15.780> if<00:04:16.199> I<00:04:16.440> hang<00:04:16.680> this

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
they're hung properly if I hang this

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.920 
they're hung properly if I hang this
like<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:17.729> if<00:04:17.970> that<00:04:18.090> doors<00:04:18.269> hung<00:04:18.479> like<00:04:18.690> that

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
like that if that doors hung like that

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.050 
like that if that doors hung like that
and<00:04:19.500> I've<00:04:19.650> got<00:04:19.829> this<00:04:19.979> at<00:04:20.160> a<00:04:20.190> 45<00:04:20.729> well<00:04:20.910> that's

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
and I've got this at a 45 well that's

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.610 
and I've got this at a 45 well that's
going<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.239> be<00:04:21.299> coming<00:04:21.510> down<00:04:21.870> like<00:04:22.079> this<00:04:22.350> like

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
going to be coming down like this like

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.620 
going to be coming down like this like
you<00:04:22.710> just<00:04:22.889> start<00:04:23.790> off<00:04:23.940> with<00:04:24.120> a<00:04:24.150> mess<00:04:24.419> before

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
you just start off with a mess before

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.020 
you just start off with a mess before
you<00:04:24.840> get<00:04:24.960> started<00:04:25.110> so<00:04:25.800> you<00:04:25.860> in<00:04:26.220> that<00:04:26.490> case<00:04:26.820> if

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
you get started so you in that case if

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.670 
you get started so you in that case if
it<00:04:27.180> was<00:04:27.330> that<00:04:27.360> way<00:04:27.690> then<00:04:28.290> you'd<00:04:28.410> have<00:04:28.440> to

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
it was that way then you'd have to

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.530 
it was that way then you'd have to
figure<00:04:28.889> out<00:04:29.010> this<00:04:29.250> angle<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:29.880> say<00:04:30.150> okay<00:04:30.389> well

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
figure out this angle and say okay well

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.300 
figure out this angle and say okay well
there's<00:04:30.690> no<00:04:30.840> longer<00:04:31.020> a<00:04:31.169> 45<00:04:31.710> it's<00:04:32.010> going<00:04:32.160> to<00:04:32.220> be

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
there's no longer a 45 it's going to be

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.600 
there's no longer a 45 it's going to be
a<00:04:32.340> 42<00:04:32.850> degree<00:04:33.210> that<00:04:33.690> one's<00:04:33.840> going<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:33.990> be<00:04:34.430> 52<00:04:35.430> or

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
a 42 degree that one's going to be 52 or

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.700 
a 42 degree that one's going to be 52 or
whatever<00:04:35.910> right<00:04:36.150> so<00:04:36.960> but<00:04:37.229> normally<00:04:37.680> they

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
whatever right so but normally they

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.980 
whatever right so but normally they
should<00:04:38.010> be<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.400> 90<00:04:39.030> this<00:04:39.180> door<00:04:39.479> should<00:04:39.660> be<00:04:39.810> put

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
should be a 90 this door should be put

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.770 
should be a 90 this door should be put

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:53.540 
door gets slammed all the time then that

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.690 
door gets slammed all the time then that
joint<00:06:54.050> can<00:06:54.229> open<00:06:54.470> up<00:06:54.560> a<00:06:54.710> little<00:06:54.919> throw<00:06:55.640> a
