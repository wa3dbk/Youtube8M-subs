there<00:07:27.830> still<00:07:28.130> is<00:07:28.190> a<00:07:28.340> possibility<00:07:28.910> of<00:07:29.240> your

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:29.390 
there still is a possibility of your

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.690 
there still is a possibility of your
convoys<00:07:29.810> being<00:07:30.110> rated<00:07:30.380> where<00:07:31.190> you<00:07:31.250> have<00:07:31.400> to<00:07:31.520> go

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:31.700 
convoys being rated where you have to go

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.530 
convoys being rated where you have to go
and<00:07:32.020> defend<00:07:33.020> them<00:07:33.280> but<00:07:34.280> eventually<00:07:35.090> we're

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:35.540 
and defend them but eventually we're

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.300 
and defend them but eventually we're
going<00:07:35.630> to<00:07:35.720> get<00:07:35.870> liberation<00:07:36.320> missions<00:07:37.100> they're

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:37.310 
going to get liberation missions they're

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.640 
going to get liberation missions they're
called<00:07:37.520> where<00:07:38.210> as<00:07:38.510> you<00:07:38.570> complete<00:07:39.470> the

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:39.650 
called where as you complete the

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.440 
called where as you complete the
liberation<00:07:40.190> missions<00:07:40.640> I<00:07:40.850> believe<00:07:41.210> that's

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:41.450 
liberation missions I believe that's

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.960 
liberation missions I believe that's
going<00:07:41.690> to<00:07:41.840> lower<00:07:42.260> the<00:07:42.590> chance<00:07:43.220> of<00:07:43.490> them<00:07:43.700> being

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:43.970 
going to lower the chance of them being

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.870 
going to lower the chance of them being
rated<00:07:45.580> pretty<00:07:46.580> sure<00:07:46.880> so<00:07:47.390> if<00:07:47.690> that<00:07:47.720> is<00:07:47.930> true

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:48.880 
rated pretty sure so if that is true

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.070 
rated pretty sure so if that is true
it's<00:07:49.880> kind<00:07:50.060> of<00:07:50.090> like<00:07:50.180> liberating<00:07:50.720> parts<00:07:50.960> of

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 
it's kind of like liberating parts of

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.860 
it's kind of like liberating parts of
the<00:07:51.140> city<00:07:51.370> once<00:07:52.370> that<00:07:52.730> starts<00:07:53.270> i'm<00:07:53.690> going<00:07:53.780> to

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:53.870 
the city once that starts i'm going to

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.570 
the city once that starts i'm going to
start<00:07:54.050> really<00:07:54.260> working<00:07:54.350> on<00:07:54.740> those<00:07:54.920> so<00:07:55.340> i<00:07:55.400> can

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:55.580 
start really working on those so i can

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.340 
start really working on those so i can
hopefully<00:07:55.820> just<00:07:56.120> send<00:07:56.360> out<00:07:56.510> cowboys<00:07:57.110> without
