00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.870
 the motives 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.850
 but not so something new 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.770
 and it is that this has some 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.450
 remodeling in my room I hope they 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.800
 I like it very much and I would like for you to give me 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.390
 your opinion if you liked more how 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.040
 they were asking more how is it now 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.450
 truth is that in comments I'm interested 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.100
 very much your opinion I would like me 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.540
 tell me if you like it or not today I'm a 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.540
 idea to convert the pinto 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.370
 in this 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.000
 it seems like complicated not but in 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.740
 reality is very easy and anyone can 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.940
 do it at home so what do you 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.110
 it seems if we are going to see what are the 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.110
 materials to make this garment 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.019
 the main thing is a shirt that stops 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.300
 the best results would be that 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.550
 have sleeves or a little longer and the 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.100
 long also be a little longer then it 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.600
 they will give an account because I tell them this and 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.870
 also have a round neck and 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.920
 not instead of tejera as sharp as possible 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.920
 he finds in his house 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.159
 and optionally pins and some ornament 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.380
 If you want to know how to make these muñoz 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.250
 have clicked here where I explain how 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.250
 do it easily 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.150
 the materials now let's see how 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.490
 redesign this garment 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.380
 this is super easy the first thing I have 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.090
 what to do is cut through some seams 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.710
 of the shirt in this drawing I'm going to 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.430
 specify what are the seams that 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.430
 we have to cut 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.329
 as it is the only seam that we do not have 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.329
 what to cut is the one sleeve 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.009
 Y 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.220
 now let's completely open the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.349
 fabric and should stay something like this 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.120
 we have to fold the garment in this way 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.550
 it is very important that at this moment in 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.160
 the outer part of the garment that of the 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.720
 top side now if you want they can 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.940
 mark with pins although it is not 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.100
 indispensable to do this only we 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.750
 It remains to sew with thread and needle in case not 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.550
 you know you should simply pass the thread 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.560
 through the needle hole and then 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.780
 They make a very simple knot to join the 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.550
 ends of the thread and ready is very easy 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.319
 if they did not understand me they can ask 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.120
 someone older or someone who has an idea 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.120
 I know why it's super easy 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.590
 we know what the two sleeves would be 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.969
 It would be the sewing machine very much 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.950
 better but good we always try 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:00.950
 simplify everything as much as possible 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.870
 we only have to turn the sleeves 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.300
 so that the seam is on the side of 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.890
 inside and do not look and we already have another 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.930
 jacket 'workshop and is as you want it 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.120
 say good our garment designed in 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.280
 we can decorate it as we sing 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.319
 apply some lockers and passes it seems 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.519
 a pin hook and a nice but if 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.810
 they want they can put buttons for 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.950
 close it and make it more beautiful and 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.990
 prolix 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.220
 two 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.220
 in these girls and boys 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.190
 the comments that they made me in the 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.750
 previous video in law all my life 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.250
 comments and the band that made me very 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.870
 happy the reaction that they had the 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.460
 most of you I can not answer 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.710
 all because simply the truth 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.060
 they were many comments but know 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.550
 who get a smile with each 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.320
 comment and I thought that the selection 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.580
 of the weekly question González because the 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.580
 question about two weeks ago 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.610
 and now we see which are the best 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.610
 answers 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.690
