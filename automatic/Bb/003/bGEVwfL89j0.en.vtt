probably<00:04:16.860> thinking<00:04:17.100> where<00:04:17.459> else<00:04:17.700> can<00:04:17.940> you<00:04:18.000> run

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:18.300 
probably thinking where else can you run

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.620 
probably thinking where else can you run
Thomson<00:04:19.110> room<00:04:19.580> no<00:04:20.580> too<00:04:21.209> good<00:04:21.420> for<00:04:21.570> the

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
Thomson room no too good for the

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.900 
Thomson room no too good for the
Thompson<00:04:21.959> room<00:04:22.100> actually<00:04:23.100> I<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.370> feel<00:04:23.670> at<00:04:23.850> the

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
Thompson room actually I I feel at the

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.480 
Thompson room actually I I feel at the
Thompson<00:04:24.240> room<00:04:24.390> I'm<00:04:25.200> running<00:04:25.350> respond<00:04:25.830> both

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
Thompson room I'm running respond both

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.580 
Thompson room I'm running respond both
spots<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:27.420> be<00:04:27.570> exact<00:04:28.140> so<00:04:28.950> um<00:04:30.080> yeah<00:04:31.080> let's<00:04:31.410> do

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
spots to be exact so um yeah let's do

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.310 
spots to be exact so um yeah let's do
this<00:04:31.770> I<00:04:32.270> really<00:04:33.270> don't<00:04:33.420> have<00:04:33.510> any<00:04:33.750> strategies

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
this I really don't have any strategies

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.130 
this I really don't have any strategies
for<00:04:34.530> these<00:04:34.650> rooms<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:35.040> just<00:04:35.220> started<00:04:35.820> running

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
for these rooms I just started running

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.780 
for these rooms I just started running
it's<00:04:37.140> more<00:04:37.350> entertaining<00:04:37.650> that<00:04:38.040> way<00:04:38.190> for<00:04:38.670> some

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
it's more entertaining that way for some

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.650 
it's more entertaining that way for some
reason<00:04:39.150> I<00:04:39.530> also<00:04:40.530> up<00:04:40.890> if<00:04:41.700> you<00:04:41.910> want<00:04:42.120> to<00:04:42.300> uh<00:04:42.330> you

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
reason I also up if you want to uh you

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.450 
reason I also up if you want to uh you
can<00:04:42.810> tell<00:04:42.990> me<00:04:43.080> what<00:04:43.260> map<00:04:43.440> one<00:04:44.040> of<00:04:44.160> the<00:04:44.250> neck

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
can tell me what map one of the neck

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.250 
can tell me what map one of the neck
stick<00:04:44.760> is<00:04:44.970> this<00:04:45.450> thing<00:04:45.630> doesn't<00:04:45.930> take<00:04:46.080> that

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
stick is this thing doesn't take that

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.460 
stick is this thing doesn't take that
long<00:04:46.320> that<00:04:46.950> I<00:04:46.980> was<00:04:47.250> on<00:04:47.400> grouped<00:04:47.910> actually<00:04:48.470> any

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
long that I was on grouped actually any

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.940 
long that I was on grouped actually any
if<00:04:49.920> I<00:04:50.070> was<00:04:50.220> on<00:04:50.250> if<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.270> look<00:04:51.810> there<00:04:52.200> if<00:04:52.440> you<00:04:52.710> say

knock knock or she kno know what those
ones<00:04:56.610> will<00:04:56.730> be<00:04:56.760> pretty<00:04:57.060> easy<00:04:57.090> but<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:59.820> other

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
ones will be pretty easy but the other

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.550 
ones will be pretty easy but the other
ones<00:05:00.150> that<00:05:00.270> actually<00:05:00.360> takes<00:05:00.750> some<00:05:01.290> time<00:05:01.500> to

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
ones that actually takes some time to

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.010 
ones that actually takes some time to
get<00:05:01.920> to<00:05:02.000> 25<00:05:03.000> +<00:05:03.530> coz<00:05:05.420> they<00:05:06.420> have<00:05:06.510> respawning

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
get to 25 + coz they have respawning

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.840 
get to 25 + coz they have respawning
zombies<00:05:07.350> that's<00:05:07.700> normal<00:05:08.750> Lydia<00:05:09.750> yeah<00:05:10.580> so<00:05:11.580> I

they've<00:06:06.200> been<00:06:06.350> cured<00:06:06.830> because<00:06:07.160> I<00:06:07.340> can<00:06:07.520> see<00:06:07.639> now

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:07.790 
they've been cured because I can see now

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.200 
they've been cured because I can see now
yeah<00:06:08.120> so<00:06:08.840> apparently<00:06:09.710> I'm<00:06:10.280> training<00:06:10.760> in<00:06:11.030> the

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
yeah so apparently I'm training in the

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.270 
yeah so apparently I'm training in the
Thomson<00:06:11.630> ER<00:06:11.690> and<00:06:13.990> doesn't<00:06:14.990> seem<00:06:15.770> like<00:06:16.070> the

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
Thomson ER and doesn't seem like the

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.400 
Thomson ER and doesn't seem like the
video<00:06:16.669> as<00:06:16.850> much<00:06:17.090> more<00:06:17.330> length<00:06:17.570> so<00:06:17.930> that's<00:06:18.200> not

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
video as much more length so that's not

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.790 
video as much more length so that's not
a<00:06:18.470> good<00:06:18.560> sign<00:06:18.710> okay<00:06:19.310> so<00:06:19.820> Thompson<00:06:20.780> room<00:06:21.080> most

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
a good sign okay so Thompson room most

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.400 
a good sign okay so Thompson room most
of<00:06:21.950> you<00:06:22.070> probably<00:06:22.310> think<00:06:23.000> this<00:06:23.240> is<00:06:23.450> the<00:06:24.260> best

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.410 
of you probably think this is the best

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.950 
of you probably think this is the best
possible<00:06:25.340> place<00:06:25.490> to<00:06:25.760> Train<00:06:26.000> like<00:06:26.240> it's<00:06:26.690> not

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
possible place to Train like it's not

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.850 
possible place to Train like it's not
this<00:06:27.680> place<00:06:27.919> I'm<00:06:28.460> doing<00:06:28.820> it<00:06:28.940> probably<00:06:29.330> wrong

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
this place I'm doing it probably wrong

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.530 
this place I'm doing it probably wrong
just<00:06:30.860> running<00:06:31.040> in<00:06:31.220> a<00:06:31.280> circle<00:06:31.430> anywhere<00:06:32.060> like<00:06:32.389> a

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
plane circled it's a bad idea but oh

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.430 
plane circled it's a bad idea but oh
