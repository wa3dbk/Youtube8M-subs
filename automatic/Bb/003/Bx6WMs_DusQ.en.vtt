00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020

something<00:00:07.319> that<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.470> hadn't<00:00:07.830> showed<00:00:08.040> you<00:00:08.160> in

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
something that I hadn't showed you in

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.400 
something that I hadn't showed you in
the<00:00:08.309> last<00:00:08.370> video<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.880> did<00:00:09.440> I<00:00:12.170> don't<00:00:13.170> know<00:00:13.259> if

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
the last video I did I don't know if

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.110 
the last video I did I don't know if
anybody's<00:00:13.830> ever<00:00:13.950> laying<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.580> course<00:00:14.910> people

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
anybody's ever laying of course people

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.779 
anybody's ever laying of course people
thought<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.870> use<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.470> photo<00:00:17.130> shop<00:00:17.369> along

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
thought of this I use a photo shop along

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.359 
thought of this I use a photo shop along
with<00:00:17.970> flash<00:00:18.350> the<00:00:19.350> reason<00:00:19.560> why<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.680> do<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.100> is

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
with flash the reason why I do that is

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.279 
with flash the reason why I do that is
because<00:00:20.550> stills<00:00:21.210> look<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.539> lot<00:00:21.720> better<00:00:21.930> if<00:00:22.170> you

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
because stills look a lot better if you

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.670 
because stills look a lot better if you
use<00:00:22.350> Photoshop<00:00:23.010> um<00:00:24.170> let's<00:00:25.170> see<00:00:25.260> if<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.380> can<00:00:25.410> show

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
blurred out the backgrounds here a bit

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.819 
blurred out the backgrounds here a bit
and<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:46.379> made<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.510> foreground<00:00:48.510> hero<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.289> little

on a background for this so I found a

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.870 
on a background for this so I found a
picture<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:54.020> of<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.140> subway<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.770> edited<00:01:56.729> it
