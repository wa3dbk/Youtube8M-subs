a complete fair test I'm so I have it's
going<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.630> generate<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:25.200> number<00:03:25.590> between<00:03:25.739> 1<00:03:26.130> and

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
going to generate a number between 1 and

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.670 
going to generate a number between 1 and
38,000<00:03:27.150> 543<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.020> let's<00:03:28.200> go<00:03:28.290> ahead<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:28.440> do<00:03:28.560> this

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
38,000 543 so let's go ahead and do this

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:38.590 
38,000 543 so let's go ahead and do this
one<00:03:29.720> two<00:03:30.720> three<00:03:32.480> four<00:03:33.480> five<00:03:34.370> six<00:03:36.830> seven<00:03:37.830> eight

one two three four five six seven eight
nine<00:03:41.540> ten<00:03:42.770> so<00:03:43.770> the<00:03:43.950> number<00:03:44.250> is<00:03:44.280> twenty<00:03:44.820> four

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
nine ten so the number is twenty four

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.870 
nine ten so the number is twenty four
