 Tunisians 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.050
 thank you editions magazine that the mount of the electric vehicle renault 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.189
 in images, in pictures 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:15.210
 if being in the contents of this first issue 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.480
 back to the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show where bloggers 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.860
 been invited to discover the 100% electric concept-car range to go 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.270
 further meeting with thierry koskas this director of the vehicle program 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.589
 electric renault 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.839
 he presents the manufacturer's strategy for this ambitious project 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.550
 it is an international car show concerned about the respect of 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.740
 environment and very electric held from 17 to 27 September to 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.569
 frankfurt 

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:47.009
 in this frame renault presented a full range of zero vehicles 

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:51.550
 emission of the small city car to the family sedan on this occasion 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.860
 our blogger specializing in environmental issues and the 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.469
 sustainable mobility car enthusiasts 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.999
 were invited to cover the show on the renault stand they were able to 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:04.629
 meet the teams at work on the front electric vehicle project 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.629
 to test the kangoo be-bop that of the other 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.540
 why the vehicle is very little today basically three 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.310
 reasons 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.329
 first to respond to the challenges of reviving the performance and 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:23.740
 global warming 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.220
 you have to fill your CO2 emissions 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.320
 today the wells the trix the only technology that would allow german 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.280
 percent and significantly lower emissions from these 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.310
 waves it's a zero emission vehicle 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.320
 the second reason is that 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.470
 with the arrival of progress on battery technology 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.090
 we are able to offer vehicles with a range of 160 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.110
 kilometers which is largely enough in everyday use that we 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.700
 have the vehicle 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.680
 and finally the third reason is that the cricket vehicle also a vehicle 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.759
 economic for customers to buy it will cost them the same price as a 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.350
 thermal vehicle and then to the used it will cost them cheaper 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.479
 that the petrol or diesel vehicle they used to use 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.290
 concretely the renault strategy these two lead this revolution 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.090
 duo of electric vehicles of the zero emission vehicle 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.690
 it means to be a major player 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.530
 for for the establishment of the ecosystem and infrastructure in 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.039
 particular 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:23.669
 the necessary around the electric vehicle a battery chain 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:29.419
 all German integrate from manufacturing until the second life and 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:31.660
 100% recycling of batteries 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.910
 but also the establishment of charging stations 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.210
 and% of stations and battery exchange that we will do in partnership 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.870
 with actors 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.649
 electricity companies 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:43.989
 operators 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.609
 states so that eventually 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.140
 the day the vehicle 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.010
 tonight on the market oh well to the infrastructure is available and the 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.500
 customer will have a perfect solution of monsanto to use his car 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.329
 woerth
