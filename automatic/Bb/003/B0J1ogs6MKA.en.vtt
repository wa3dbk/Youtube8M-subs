00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.260
 the Chronicles of Narnia 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.920
 the chronicles of narnia the lion is the sorcerer and the wardrobe we get 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.610
 that the stigma of games based on hollywood films 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.279
 considered below the critical 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.210
 may not be a great title but has a relatively solid mechanics 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.650
 the player's choice of success in the fantasy world 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:30.989
 if the chronicles of narnia hypothesis 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.730
 missing some similarities the adaptations for the video games are 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.360
 even more similar 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.060
 both are action-adventure games with elements of exploration in which 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.390
 I need to use the abilities of the different characters to advance 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.080
 this episode based on the second book tells the story of the four brothers who 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.070
 We won if there was not this second world war 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.519
 to escape the danger of constant air strikes 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.759
 they end up living with a 'teacher' given to Haiti 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
 in a large house far from the center of the conflict 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.289
 there in one of the rooms 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:14.840
 to the mysterious closet that leads to a fantastic world of narnia 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.610
 a place where living mythological creatures speak animals and where the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.610
 magic is common 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.420
 but so far this has been 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.170
 is condemned to one hectare in the winter by the front will be the white 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.359
 whose reign will only end 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:38.310
 when the two sons of Adam and the two daughters of Eve sit upon the four 

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:41.340
 kurt castle shifts era valley 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.229
 with the help of the lion aslan 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.329
 creator and ruler of narnia the four brothers embark on an adventure 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.250
 fantastic 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.600
 first of all 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.850
 it must be said that the Czech producer - tels 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.200
 managed to give different personalities to Pedro 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.380
 suzana edmundo and lucia making them have very different characteristics 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.650
 and would be useful each May 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.570
 at the same time not to be factor and other 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.180
 some of the problems can be solved by more than one character 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.280
 for example 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.950
 Pedro and suzana are able to move heavy objects like a thousand bags 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.499
 while the young can walk on brittle surfaces 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:24.699
 in general 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:29.689
 the idea of â€‹â€‹an older regling takes care of the fighting while suzana has the 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.049
 ability to throw objects 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.540
 like tennis balls rangers 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.590
 besides being able to use a foul to make the enemies of b 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.870
 edmund in turn 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.480
 can climb on poles and trees 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.239
 and the little blonde lute balancing snowballs can go through holes 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.369
 narrow 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:53.520
 there are also skills available 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.579
 were two of the brothers work 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.939
 as a little piece of the world can hold hands and take a swivel 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.199
 run over anyone by the way 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.689
 powerful Russian fox as if it were a bowling ball 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.239
 to break obstacles 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.120
 in fifth 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.620
 depending on the team 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.499
 the combinations are quite varied 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:17.919
 more than half of the game comes down to overcoming obstacles 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.189
 using the skills of penguins and also in the environment 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:27.219
 composed of twigs bonfires snowballs and so it says 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:34.019
 there are also elements of exploitation in the early stages almost all 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.869
 objects of the chosen scenarios they 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:38.730
 they are usually coins 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.019
 but many also have other secret sectors 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.880
 coins allow you to buy new skills 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.589
 and improvements to the characters 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:52.219
 other tricks however are purchased throughout the season 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.349
 there are also some combats hampered by the tiresome repetition 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.000
 pedro iv 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.269
 many are best suited for these scenes 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.079
 because they rely more strongly on the coup and various titles 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.069
 some specialized liminar certain species 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.569
 depending on the chapter 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.219
 the player controls a group 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:17.840
 groups of two to four characters 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.510
 but obviously only one will be commanded directly while the others stand by 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.020
 artificial intelligence account 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.949
 but at any time the second player can enter the match 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.309
 the exchange of characters can be done at any time 

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:38.309
 and this works well in most situations 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:45.509
 when one more character the required to solve the problem stays a little more 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:46.849
 complicated 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:52.569
 already after the confusion increases it is more difficult to trigger the movements in pairs 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:56.600
 between one phase and another no one helps us break the routine 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.419
 The Chronicles of Narnia 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.729
 has a rather inconsistent visual appearance 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.850
 but in general it shows how the representations of the localities seen 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:07.809
 in the movie 

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:11.009
 in account case of experiences or protest house 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.279
 has a competent ambience 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.279
 external scenes do not bring the same quality 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.650
 the same irregularity predicted in the modeling of the characters 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.040
 that in general 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.370
 amy also the actors of the film but in a few years the sector did not completely 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.639
 many different 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.629
 the producer also did not spare in the use of scenes of the film 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:37.280
 and end up counting 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.389
 almost the entire plot 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.659
 the soundtrack is similar to that of the feature film 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:45.659
 with a lot of any kind of movies with a high investment 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:51.039
 the sound effects also have quality and the voiceovers are safe 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.090
 vandinho of the chronicles of narnia the auctioneable appetizing wardrobe 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.349
 can reproduce part of the magic of the children's story 10 days free 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.419
 how did you play 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:06.069
 may not be brilliant 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:09.779
 but those who were enchanted with the movie what they like me 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.520
 by day they are most likely to have good hours of fun 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:29.449
 school word 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:32.319
 At the same time 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:35.319
 horror 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:47.509
