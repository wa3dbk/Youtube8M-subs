00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
dot pattern and then this is the normal

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:36.910 
dot pattern and then this is the normal
su<00:00:35.239> ik<00:00:35.420> as<00:00:35.629> you<00:00:35.960> can<00:00:36.110> see<00:00:36.290> this<00:00:36.410> one<00:00:36.620> the<00:00:36.710> bigger

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
su ik as you can see this one the bigger

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.330 
su ik as you can see this one the bigger
than<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:37.730> other<00:00:37.940> one<00:00:38.440> this<00:00:39.440> one<00:00:39.680> is<00:00:39.710> 6<00:00:40.130> inches

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
was where I got them and use this to

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.270 
was where I got them and use this to
wick<00:00:49.219> you<00:00:49.250> have<00:00:49.489> to<00:00:49.610> tune<00:00:50.410> the<00:00:51.410> tail<00:00:51.739> which<00:00:52.100> is

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
wick you have to tune the tail which is

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.010 
wick you have to tune the tail which is
this<00:00:52.460> back<00:00:52.700> metal<00:00:52.940> part<00:00:53.270> and<00:00:53.540> you<00:00:53.629> bend<00:00:53.899> it

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
this back metal part and you bend it

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.040 
this back metal part and you bend it
down<00:00:54.230> or<00:00:54.710> or<00:00:55.700> up<00:00:55.969> or<00:00:56.149> sideways<00:00:56.539> or<00:00:56.750> however

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
down or or up or sideways or however

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.029 
down or or up or sideways or however
because<00:00:57.860> you<00:00:58.520> want<00:00:58.700> it<00:00:58.730> to<00:00:58.789> run<00:00:59.030> straight<00:00:59.360> down

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
because you want it to run straight down

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.049 
because you want it to run straight down
and<00:01:01.039> then<00:01:01.160> you're<00:01:01.250> gonna<00:01:01.340> let<00:01:01.579> it<00:01:01.670> float<00:01:01.850> back

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
and then you're gonna let it float back

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.660 
and then you're gonna let it float back
up<00:01:02.090> and<00:01:02.690> down<00:01:03.320> again<00:01:03.649> and<00:01:03.860> float<00:01:04.070> back<00:01:04.250> up<00:01:04.280> and

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
up and down again and float back up and

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.550 
up and down again and float back up and
you<00:01:05.270> don't<00:01:05.570> want<00:01:05.750> it<00:01:05.810> to<00:01:05.930> touch<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.229> top<00:01:06.410> of

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
you don't want it to touch the top of

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.320 
you don't want it to touch the top of
the<00:01:06.619> water<00:01:06.830> because<00:01:07.610> it's<00:01:07.880> acting<00:01:08.180> like<00:01:08.210> a

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
the water because it's acting like a

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.150 
the water because it's acting like a
dead<00:01:08.600> fish<00:01:08.899> and<00:01:08.929> you<00:01:09.140> want<00:01:09.319> it<00:01:09.440> to<00:01:09.560> be<00:01:09.649> a<00:01:09.800> semi

dead fish so that drives a pike in the
muskie<00:01:13.490> insane<00:01:13.880> and<00:01:14.149> this<00:01:15.050> is<00:01:15.170> just<00:01:15.350> made<00:01:15.530> out

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
muskie insane and this is just made out

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.070 
muskie insane and this is just made out
of<00:01:15.800> full<00:01:16.039> wood<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:16.580> drilled<00:01:17.330> in<00:01:17.450> hooks<00:01:17.720> and

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
of full wood and drilled in hooks and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.749 
of full wood and drilled in hooks and
it's<00:01:18.350> just<00:01:18.530> painted<00:01:18.950> so<00:01:19.940> and<00:01:20.300> then<00:01:20.869> to<00:01:21.349> tune<00:01:21.560> it

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
it's just painted so and then to tune it

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.029 
it's just painted so and then to tune it
you<00:01:22.759> just<00:01:22.940> spend<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.330> tail<00:01:23.539> down<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:24.500> bet<00:01:24.830> the

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
you just spend the tail down the bet the

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.919 
you just spend the tail down the bet the
more<00:01:25.220> bent<00:01:25.459> it<00:01:25.610> is<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:26.000> deeper<00:01:26.330> it<00:01:26.390> will<00:01:26.479> go<00:01:26.660> in

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
more bent it is the deeper it will go in

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.690 
more bent it is the deeper it will go in
the<00:01:27.200> longer<00:01:27.770> time<00:01:27.950> it'll<00:01:28.130> take<00:01:28.190> it<00:01:28.459> to<00:01:28.580> the

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
the longer time it'll take it to the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.410 
the longer time it'll take it to the
float<00:01:28.970> to<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.149> top

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
float to the top

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.740 
float to the top
but<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.590> shallower<00:01:31.429> it<00:01:31.550> is<00:01:31.759> it<00:01:32.000> just<00:01:32.119> goes

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
but the shallower it is it just goes

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.279 
but the shallower it is it just goes
down<00:01:32.899> a<00:01:32.959> little<00:01:33.170> bit<00:01:33.319> and<00:01:34.130> keeps<00:01:34.369> going<00:01:34.640> up<00:01:34.759> and

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
down a little bit and keeps going up and

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.809 
down a little bit and keeps going up and
it's<00:01:36.289> just<00:01:36.590> for<00:01:36.770> faster<00:01:37.099> retrieval<00:01:37.220> Zoar

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
it's just for faster retrieval Zoar

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.770 
it's just for faster retrieval Zoar
longer<00:01:38.090> achieves<00:01:38.420> however<00:01:38.810> you<00:01:38.899> want<00:01:39.080> it<00:01:39.140> and

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
longer achieves however you want it and

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.699 
longer achieves however you want it and
so<00:01:41.780> this<00:01:41.929> is<00:01:42.050> the<00:01:42.140> one<00:01:42.289> that<00:01:42.440> kept<00:01:42.590> getting

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709 
so this is the one that kept getting

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:45.070 
so this is the one that kept getting
crushed<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:44.179> can<00:01:44.330> see<00:01:44.569> it<00:01:44.720> worked<00:01:44.929> very

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
crushed and you can see it worked very

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.999 
crushed and you can see it worked very
well<00:01:45.940> there's<00:01:46.940> all<00:01:47.179> the<00:01:47.390> teeth<00:01:48.259> marks<00:01:48.739> and

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
well there's all the teeth marks and

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.699 
well there's all the teeth marks and
everything<00:01:49.459> and<00:01:49.700> just<00:01:50.349> basically<00:01:51.349> to<00:01:51.560> tie

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:51.709 
everything and just basically to tie

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:54.160 
everything and just basically to tie
this<00:01:51.770> on<00:01:52.039> you<00:01:52.250> just<00:01:52.369> get<00:01:52.580> an<00:01:52.670> 80-pound<00:01:53.209> fluoro

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
this on you just get an 80-pound fluoro

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.219 
this on you just get an 80-pound fluoro
leader<00:01:55.160> you<00:01:55.759> tie<00:01:55.940> it<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.239> loop<00:01:56.509> knot<00:01:56.720> at<00:01:56.989> the

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
leader you tie it a loop knot at the

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.969 
leader you tie it a loop knot at the
beginning<00:01:58.099> of<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.310> su<00:01:58.489> ik<00:01:59.440> you<00:02:00.440> tie<00:02:00.649> a<00:02:00.679> loop

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
beginning of the su ik you tie a loop

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.779 
beginning of the su ik you tie a loop
knot<00:02:01.190> onto<00:02:01.940> it<00:02:02.060> onto<00:02:02.810> this<00:02:02.989> split<00:02:03.950> split

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789

work and it was awesome because we
didn't<00:04:22.889> think<00:04:22.979> it<00:04:23.130> would<00:04:23.220> work<00:04:23.510> so<00:04:25.130> I'm

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
didn't think it would work so I'm

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.040 
didn't think it would work so I'm
casting<00:04:26.340> off<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.699> back<00:04:26.850> of<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.090> boat<00:04:27.270> so<00:04:27.540> I

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
casting off the back of the boat so I

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.430 
casting off the back of the boat so I
can<00:04:28.229> get<00:04:28.350> some<00:04:28.530> good<00:04:28.680> motion<00:04:28.949> range<00:04:29.699> of<00:04:29.880> motion

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
can get some good motion range of motion

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.200 
can get some good motion range of motion
get<00:04:31.440> some<00:04:31.590> good<00:04:31.740> casts<00:04:32.250> long<00:04:32.430> cast<00:04:32.760> because

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
get some good casts long cast because

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.200 
get some good casts long cast because
the<00:04:34.020> middle<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.680> sides<00:04:35.010> are<00:04:35.220> high<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:35.699> it's

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
the middle the sides are high and it's

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.170 
the middle the sides are high and it's
hard<00:04:36.540> to<00:04:36.630> cast<00:04:36.840> over<00:04:37.199> the<00:04:37.290> sides<00:04:38.180> you'll

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
hard to cast over the sides you'll

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.110 
hard to cast over the sides you'll
notice<00:04:39.540> the<00:04:40.020> Swick<00:04:40.410> in<00:04:40.530> its<00:04:40.650> mouth<00:04:40.910> t-boned<00:04:41.910> it

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
notice the Swick in its mouth t-boned it

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.439 
notice the Swick in its mouth t-boned it
which<00:04:42.690> is<00:04:42.840> what<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.080> pikes<00:04:43.350> do<00:04:43.790> so<00:04:44.790> they<00:04:45.270> just

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
which is what the pikes do so they just

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.300 
which is what the pikes do so they just
hit<00:04:46.080> him<00:04:46.229> on<00:04:46.290> the<00:04:46.350> side<00:04:46.440> which<00:04:46.979> means<00:04:47.160> they

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
hit him on the side which means they

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.040 
hit him on the side which means they
don't<00:04:47.460> hit<00:04:47.550> the<00:04:47.850> t-bone<00:04:48.180> is<00:04:48.389> when<00:04:48.750> they<00:04:48.810> hit<00:04:48.960> it

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
don't hit the t-bone is when they hit it

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.330 
don't hit the t-bone is when they hit it
on<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.139> side<00:04:49.229> so<00:04:49.770> they<00:04:49.889> don't<00:04:50.040> hit<00:04:50.100> it<00:04:50.220> in<00:04:50.310> the

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
on the side so they don't hit it in the

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.920 
on the side so they don't hit it in the
front<00:04:50.580> or<00:04:50.759> the<00:04:50.790> back<00:04:50.910> they<00:04:51.389> just<00:04:51.540> hit<00:04:51.630> right<00:04:51.870> on

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
front or the back they just hit right on

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:52.560 
front or the back they just hit right on
the<00:04:52.110> side

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
the side

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.620 
the side
they<00:04:53.570> get<00:04:53.690> the<00:04:53.810> whole<00:04:53.990> thing<00:04:54.200> in<00:04:54.260> their<00:04:54.440> mouth

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
they get the whole thing in their mouth

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.830 
they get the whole thing in their mouth
so<00:04:56.630> this<00:04:56.780> is<00:04:56.900> a<00:04:56.930> another<00:04:57.620> day<00:04:57.860> just<00:04:58.220> because

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
so this is a another day just because

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.230 
so this is a another day just because
the<00:04:59.840> pike<00:05:00.080> window<00:05:00.500> which<00:05:01.460> means<00:05:01.490> like<00:05:01.970> when<00:05:02.090> we

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
the pike window which means like when we

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.590 
the pike window which means like when we
catch<00:05:02.390> them<00:05:02.570> and<00:05:02.810> what<00:05:03.500> time<00:05:03.740> is<00:05:04.150> for<00:05:05.150> us<00:05:05.270> in

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
catch them and what time is for us in

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.400 
catch them and what time is for us in
Minnesota<00:05:05.840> when<00:05:06.260> we<00:05:06.350> go<00:05:06.500> is<00:05:06.800> five<00:05:07.220> to<00:05:07.580> eight

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
Minnesota when we go is five to eight

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:16.570 
Minnesota when we go is five to eight
because<00:05:09.410> as<00:05:09.890> soon<00:05:10.160> as<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.370> Sun<00:05:10.610> goes<00:05:15.340> this<00:05:16.340> one

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
because as soon as the Sun goes this one

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.690 
because as soon as the Sun goes this one
was<00:05:17.090> weird<00:05:17.390> I<00:05:17.920> casted<00:05:18.920> it<00:05:19.100> like<00:05:19.430> probably

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
was weird I casted it like probably

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.690 
was weird I casted it like probably
right<00:05:19.970> on<00:05:20.000> top<00:05:20.300> of<00:05:20.480> a<00:05:20.630> spawning<00:05:21.290> bed<00:05:21.620> and<00:05:21.890> I

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
right on top of a spawning bed and I

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.970 
right on top of a spawning bed and I
caught<00:05:22.970> a<00:05:23.000> largemouth<00:05:23.570> bass<00:05:24.080> and<00:05:24.470> I<00:05:24.590> didn't<00:05:24.860> I

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
caught a largemouth bass and I didn't I

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.470 
caught a largemouth bass and I didn't I
really<00:05:25.250> didn't<00:05:25.520> think<00:05:25.550> I'd<00:05:25.850> catch<00:05:26.060> it<00:05:26.240> because

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
really didn't think I'd catch it because

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.950 
really didn't think I'd catch it because
I<00:05:27.250> didn't<00:05:28.250> think<00:05:28.280> a<00:05:28.670> largemouth<00:05:29.420> bass<00:05:29.690> would

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
I didn't think a largemouth bass would

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.050 
I didn't think a largemouth bass would
hit<00:05:30.140> us<00:05:30.470> week<00:05:30.830> half<00:05:31.160> the<00:05:31.340> size<00:05:31.520> of<00:05:31.640> its<00:05:31.790> potty

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
hit us week half the size of its potty

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.960 
hit us week half the size of its potty
but<00:05:33.020> I<00:05:33.290> guess<00:05:33.620> anything<00:05:34.070> to<00:05:34.190> protect<00:05:34.340> its<00:05:34.790> eggs

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
but I guess anything to protect its eggs

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.420 
but I guess anything to protect its eggs
right<00:05:35.270> so<00:05:35.900> I<00:05:36.430> was<00:05:37.430> in<00:05:37.730> big<00:05:37.970> shock<00:05:38.300> and<00:05:38.950> then<00:05:39.950> he

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
right so I was in big shock and then he

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.190 
right so I was in big shock and then he
jumped<00:05:40.790> up<00:05:40.880> at<00:05:41.060> me<00:05:41.210> after<00:05:41.510> I<00:05:41.540> was<00:05:41.750> releasing

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
jumped up at me after I was releasing

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.630 
jumped up at me after I was releasing
him<00:05:42.320> and<00:05:42.560> there's<00:05:43.130> a<00:05:43.190> GoPro<00:05:44.440> so<00:05:45.440> in<00:05:46.190> this<00:05:46.370> clip

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
him and there's a GoPro so in this clip

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.480 
him and there's a GoPro so in this clip
my<00:05:47.210> grandma<00:05:47.630> and<00:05:47.810> my<00:05:48.350> cousin<00:05:49.040> Jake<00:05:49.250> are

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
my grandma and my cousin Jake are

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.450 
my grandma and my cousin Jake are
untangling<00:05:50.270> Jake's<00:05:51.020> husky<00:05:51.920> jerk<00:05:52.130> out<00:05:52.220> of<00:05:52.280> him

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
untangling Jake's husky jerk out of him

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.130 
untangling Jake's husky jerk out of him
that<00:05:52.640> after<00:05:53.030> he<00:05:53.120> just<00:05:53.270> caught<00:05:53.480> a<00:05:53.510> fish<00:05:53.780> and

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
that after he just caught a fish and

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.620 
that after he just caught a fish and
they<00:05:54.950> said<00:05:55.190> don't<00:05:55.340> catch<00:05:55.610> one<00:05:55.880> but<00:05:56.270> I<00:05:56.300> caught

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
they said don't catch one but I caught

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.280 
they said don't catch one but I caught
one<00:05:58.180> which<00:05:59.180> probably<00:06:00.020> shouldn't<00:06:00.230> have

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
one which probably shouldn't have

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.380 
one which probably shouldn't have
happened<00:06:00.710> it<00:06:01.370> wouldn't<00:06:01.700> have<00:06:01.790> happened<00:06:02.150> if

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.390 
happened it wouldn't have happened if

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.740 
happened it wouldn't have happened if
they<00:06:02.990> didn't<00:06:03.230> say<00:06:03.350> that<00:06:03.380> so<00:06:04.330> and<00:06:05.330> then<00:06:05.510> here's

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
they didn't say that so and then here's

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.420 
they didn't say that so and then here's
Jake<00:06:06.050> he's<00:06:06.230> gonna<00:06:06.350> go<00:06:06.560> get<00:06:06.710> the<00:06:06.860> boga<00:06:07.130> for<00:06:07.310> me

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
Jake he's gonna go get the boga for me

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.610 
Jake he's gonna go get the boga for me
because<00:06:07.760> it's<00:06:08.540> hard<00:06:08.900> to<00:06:09.050> land<00:06:09.230> the<00:06:09.440> fish

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
because it's hard to land the fish

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.550 
because it's hard to land the fish
without<00:06:09.800> iboga<00:06:10.550> because<00:06:11.020> it<00:06:12.020> could<00:06:12.260> bite<00:06:12.530> you

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
without iboga because it could bite you

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.970 
without iboga because it could bite you
or<00:06:13.070> you'd<00:06:13.850> cut<00:06:14.060> your<00:06:14.090> hands<00:06:14.480> on<00:06:14.600> his<00:06:14.720> gills<00:06:15.020> so
