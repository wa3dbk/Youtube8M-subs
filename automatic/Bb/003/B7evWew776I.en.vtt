00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:06.029
 happy about the latte steer a section of which he always like 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.859
 again right now I am KR 

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:10.419
 actually 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:14.519
 at the moment a little humor join in this whole Utta 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.090
 and therefore did not have 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.179
 not present in the elderly care 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:19.690
 in seventh place finish 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.350
 and 4 more 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.630
 Naturally 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.310
 encouraged from the port of New Zealand and Japan to all the euro 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.449
 as a result of Tuesday 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.330
 that is not true 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
 to the finish 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.050
 Lehmann 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.030
 was now 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.530
 GF Fulda 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.380
 Princeton 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.570
 just time 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.570
 above all 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.340
 unfortunately he is 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.600
 Silver costs from Manuel Meyer 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.600
 now is ugly Lisbon us pattern 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.840
 if you think of Lorenz children that peps relatively rare 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.710
 the goalkeeper 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.070
 Augenstein 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.570
 Coach short 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.420
 the balance 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.420
 Munich effective 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.950
 a strapless dress 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.650
 TV or 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.010
 IK and it 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.390
 you also climb a fair one 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.240
 4 could be 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.240
 elsewhere 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.360
 Arnulf Rainer 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.850
 in England Oberthur became his son-in-law 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.790
 30 0 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.770
 read here 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.510
 not averse in a scene 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.260
 an idyll 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.140
 what is the other reason relatively short and crisp 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.490
 around 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.180
 as if there is no clarity it is from the team 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.550
 she gives a fax 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.479
 It would cost three euros to lower the camera body and 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.189
 we have seven o'clock in the evening 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.859
 Solbakken at the first bite that can agree with that quite a bit 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:15.009
 boring 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:17.159
 PÃ¶lten I do not think so 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.749
 now report but now they found small areas 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:22.279
 to these bonds 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:24.179
 Schlarmann cozy 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:26.809
 some drive 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:30.260
 and accordingly I have that today so she wanted to dress properly 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.369
 the iPad actually costs 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:35.069
 AR has never been so easy 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.229
 after that 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:40.229
 so have so happy afterwards but it takes another step 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:41.449
 Towards playoffs 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.089
 and I thought so more 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:45.479
 they had one 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:47.689
 I hardly have backup 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.089
 i am a bit of the vocal and 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:51.239
 Mrs. Prof 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.679
 with special 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:53.879
 Fri. 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.249
 melodic thanks to Chu and wishes you have a nice day
