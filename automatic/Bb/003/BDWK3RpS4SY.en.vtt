some<00:01:24.380> fire-roasted<00:01:24.969> hunts<00:01:26.200> diced<00:01:27.200> tomatoes

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.529 

just<00:01:31.369> a<00:01:31.549> couple<00:01:31.880> cans<00:01:32.209> of<00:01:32.389> that<00:01:32.599> in<00:01:33.609> and<00:01:34.609> you're

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
just a couple cans of that in and you're

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:36.639 
just a couple cans of that in and you're
going<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.689> see<00:01:35.899> that<00:01:35.929> this<00:01:36.170> is<00:01:36.319> going<00:01:36.439> to<00:01:36.499> look

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
going to see that this is going to look

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.139 
going to see that this is going to look
very<00:01:36.709> thick<00:01:38.049> we're<00:01:39.049> going<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.259> add<00:01:39.469> some<00:01:40.149> beer

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
very thick we're going to add some beer

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.839 
very thick we're going to add some beer
and<00:01:41.389> it<00:01:41.959> will<00:01:42.079> look<00:01:42.259> very<00:01:42.529> loose<00:01:42.950> that's<00:01:43.429> okay

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:43.849 
and it will look very loose that's okay

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:49.359 
and it will look very loose that's okay
because<00:01:44.060> as<00:01:45.849> this<00:01:46.849> starts<00:01:47.329> put<00:01:48.049> down<00:01:48.469> it'll

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
because as this starts put down it'll

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.319 
because as this starts put down it'll
thicken<00:01:49.639> up<00:01:49.849> into<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:52.369> consistency<00:01:53.090> that<00:01:53.119> you

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
thicken up into the consistency that you

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.179 
thicken up into the consistency that you
like<00:01:53.659> so<00:01:53.869> I'm<00:01:53.929> going<00:01:54.079> to<00:01:54.139> pour<00:01:54.439> off<00:01:54.709> this<00:01:55.009> is<00:01:55.159> a

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
like so I'm going to pour off this is a

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.629 
like so I'm going to pour off this is a
messy<00:01:55.429> process<00:01:55.669> here<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.560> these<00:01:57.560> are<00:01:57.799> hunts

00:01:58.629 --> 00:01:58.639 
messy process here and these are hunts

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:00.339 
messy process here and these are hunts
whole<00:01:58.849> tomatoes<00:01:59.389> and<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.689> reason<00:01:59.899> why<00:02:00.049> I<00:02:00.079> use

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
whole tomatoes and the reason why I use

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.769 
whole tomatoes and the reason why I use
whole<00:02:00.590> Tomatoes<00:02:01.039> is<00:02:01.249> because<00:02:01.669> you<00:02:02.329> really

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:02.779 
whole Tomatoes is because you really

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:06.819 
whole Tomatoes is because you really
want<00:02:03.079> to<00:02:03.739> have<00:02:03.999> some<00:02:04.999> good<00:02:05.299> sized<00:02:05.779> chunks<00:02:06.739> of

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
want to have some good sized chunks of

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.170 
want to have some good sized chunks of
tomato<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:07.700> as<00:02:08.390> you<00:02:08.630> can<00:02:08.750> see<00:02:08.780> this<00:02:09.140> whole

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
tomato and as you can see this whole

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.110 
tomato and as you can see this whole
philosophy<00:02:11.180> behind<00:02:11.780> this<00:02:12.620> chili<00:02:13.070> is

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
philosophy behind this chili is

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.300 
philosophy behind this chili is
that<00:02:14.659> it<00:02:15.319> doesn't<00:02:15.799> feel<00:02:16.180> soupy<00:02:17.180> at<00:02:17.450> all<00:02:18.310> and

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
that it doesn't feel soupy at all and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.160 
that it doesn't feel soupy at all and
this<00:02:19.430> takes<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:19.849> couple<00:02:20.030> minutes<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.690> do<00:02:20.870> but

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
this takes a couple minutes to do but

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.360 
this takes a couple minutes to do but
it's<00:02:21.470> well<00:02:21.680> worth<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.980> extra<00:02:22.280> effort<00:02:23.140> if<00:02:24.370> we

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
it's well worth the extra effort if we

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.880 
it's well worth the extra effort if we
need<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.760> add<00:02:25.909> more<00:02:26.269> tomato<00:02:26.840> after<00:02:27.379> this<00:02:27.560> we

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
need to add more tomato after this we

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.640 
need to add more tomato after this we
will<00:02:28.099> use<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:29.390> pre-cut<00:02:30.790> diced<00:02:31.790> type<00:02:32.450> but<00:02:33.409> what

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
will use the pre-cut diced type but what

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.740 
will use the pre-cut diced type but what
we're<00:02:33.799> going<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.010> do<00:02:34.129> is<00:02:34.280> see<00:02:35.120> how<00:02:35.239> it<00:02:35.450> looks

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
we're going to do is see how it looks

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.630 
we're going to do is see how it looks
from<00:02:36.049> here<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.709> then<00:02:37.159> we're<00:02:37.310> going<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.519> throw

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
from here and then we're going to throw

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.009 
from here and then we're going to throw
some<00:02:37.940> beer<00:02:38.269> in<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:39.680> after<00:02:40.549> this<00:02:40.879> it<00:02:41.329> really<00:02:41.690> is

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
some beer in and after this it really is

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.220 
some beer in and after this it really is
about<00:02:42.319> cooking<00:02:42.769> it<00:02:42.860> down<00:02:43.069> in<00:02:43.900> adjusting<00:02:44.900> the

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
about cooking it down in adjusting the

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.710 
about cooking it down in adjusting the
seasons<00:02:45.849> I'll<00:02:46.849> probably<00:02:47.060> put<00:02:47.299> a<00:02:47.359> little<00:02:47.540> bit

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
seasons I'll probably put a little bit

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.809 
seasons I'll probably put a little bit
of<00:02:47.780> hot<00:02:47.989> sauce<00:02:48.019> and<00:02:48.500> depending<00:02:48.920> on<00:02:49.010> how<00:02:49.340> hot<00:02:49.609> it

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
of hot sauce and depending on how hot it

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.119 
of hot sauce and depending on how hot it
is<00:02:49.910> Oh<00:02:50.150> which<00:02:51.049> reminds<00:02:51.410> me<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.650> need<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.859> put<00:02:52.069> a

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
is Oh which reminds me I need to put a

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.580 
is Oh which reminds me I need to put a
little<00:02:52.400> bit<00:02:52.579> of<00:02:52.640> cayenne<00:02:52.910> pepper<00:02:53.329> I'm<00:02:53.599> haven't

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.159 
it's foaming up a little bit and that
loosened<00:04:29.460> it<00:04:29.580> up<00:04:29.669> a<00:04:29.849> lot<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:30.449> i'll<00:04:30.930> probably

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
loosened it up a lot and i'll probably

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.110 
loosened it up a lot and i'll probably
have<00:04:31.379> to<00:04:31.439> throw<00:04:31.740> in<00:04:31.919> actually<00:04:32.400> a<00:04:32.430> whole<00:04:32.759> nother
