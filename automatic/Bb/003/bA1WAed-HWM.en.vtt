00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.519
 Greet back people to wii play 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.019
 oldschool again with b max wood at the start 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.019
 and you are in another episode 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.880
 gdf five tips and tricks her he knows 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:21.180
 surely you are somewhere in wayne 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.890
 county on the move and far and wide 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.910
 nothing to worry about 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.080
 Hide except a few bushes 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.630
 I would just say that 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.519
 bushes that's exactly what I want to show you 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.020
 that you are a bit too 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:37.670
 Not only can the cops hide out 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.530
 behind walls in buildings, etc 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.540
 bushes also represent the obstacle 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.230
 dar or art visible years for the cops 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.460
 except for a few feet just a bit 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.460
 cause chaos here 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.160
 the men's choir I have already tried 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.290
 been shot chamber screen 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.899
 so I have the cops on the neck a star 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.280
 was enough to show that 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:12.600
 I'm looking for a nice shrubbery 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:13.320
 out of madness I love that comes 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.710
 a bit confusing 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.619
 I pack the cart here and he has me 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.360
 examined in the shrubbery team hide 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.649
 you better fresh from what is greater 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.130
 as her self goes in sneakers on 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:35.060
 sneak at night sneak 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.060
 sneak and put in the middle 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.210
 yes we could see I'm already in the middle 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.240
 in the search cone of the cops but it happens 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.240
 Nothing 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:56.840
 Ok, get out and look for me 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.100
 except for a few yards, I'll tell you 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.450
 maybe ten meters I am now 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.070
 already in the search cone would normally 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.200
 who see me now when I'm outside 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.500
 hard on the book but they see me 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.500
 Not 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.090
 that was it's people hit is invisible 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.850
 I think a cool thing 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:32.240
 especially when there is nothing to hide 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.980
 no house no projection no building 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.090
 no wall no wall 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:41.060
 Something like that has now 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.520
 I would not have included rockstar 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.270
 counted but I find very cool 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.070
 and with the beautiful sunrise today 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.550
