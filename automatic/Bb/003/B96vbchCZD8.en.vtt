00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
done and you're ready to sanitize then

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.209 
done and you're ready to sanitize then
there's<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.140> couple<00:00:58.379> ways<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.710> can<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.190> this

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
there's a couple ways you can do this

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.849 
there's a couple ways you can do this
you<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.670> immerse<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.539> bottle<00:01:01.109> into<00:01:01.289> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
you can immerse this bottle into a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.240 
you can immerse this bottle into a
bucket<00:01:02.190> full<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.699> sanitizer<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.920> wait<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:05.159> it

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
bucket full of sanitizer and wait for it

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.399 
bucket full of sanitizer and wait for it
to<00:01:05.280> completely<00:01:05.460> fill<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.930> once<00:01:07.200> it's

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
to completely fill and once it's

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.679 
to completely fill and once it's
completely<00:01:07.799> full<00:01:08.250> then<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.090> take<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.390> out<00:01:09.630> and

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
completely full then you take it out and

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.899 
completely full then you take it out and
drain<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.200> out<00:01:10.470> now<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.130> takes<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.610> certain

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
drain it out now that takes a certain

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.030 
drain it out now that takes a certain
amount<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.330> effort<00:01:12.680> that's<00:01:13.680> why<00:01:13.979> this

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
amount of effort that's why this

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.530 
amount of effort that's why this
particular<00:01:14.750> device<00:01:15.750> here<00:01:16.350> came<00:01:16.950> out<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.880> number

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
particular device here came out a number

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.770 
particular device here came out a number
of<00:01:18.630> years<00:01:18.840> ago<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.409> called<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.740> Venator<00:01:20.400> or

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
of years ago it's called a Venator or

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.140 
of years ago it's called a Venator or
sulfide<00:01:21.780> ER<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.170> what<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.950> guy<00:01:23.220> does<00:01:23.280> really

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
sulfide ER and what this guy does really

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.999 
sulfide ER and what this guy does really
all<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> thing<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> pump<00:01:25.560> with<00:01:25.979> a

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
all the thing is is a pump with a

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.370 
all the thing is is a pump with a
reservoir<00:01:26.549> okay<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.990> take<00:01:28.229> your

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
reservoir okay so you take your

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.590 
reservoir okay so you take your
sanitizing<00:01:29.040> solution<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.880> fill<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.299> up<00:01:30.420> about

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
sanitizing solution you fill it up about

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.469 
sanitizing solution you fill it up about
halfway<00:01:31.020> into<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.799> apparatus<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.970> then

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
halfway into this apparatus and then

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.319 
halfway into this apparatus and then
once<00:01:34.380> you're<00:01:34.590> ready<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.100> sanitize<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.759> bottle

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
once you're ready to sanitize a bottle

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.090 
once you're ready to sanitize a bottle
well<00:01:36.540> instead<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.960> having<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.350> immerse<00:01:37.890> it

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
well instead of having to immerse it

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.670 
well instead of having to immerse it
into<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> full<00:01:38.670> bucket<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.630> simply<00:01:40.020> invert<00:01:40.619> it

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
into a full bucket you simply invert it

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.670 
into a full bucket you simply invert it
put<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.820> same<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.390> when<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:43.350> full

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
put it on the same and when it's full

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.100 
put it on the same and when it's full
you<00:01:44.070> squeeze<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.939> down<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.299> there<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.869> will

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
you squeeze it down in there and it will

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.670 
you squeeze it down in there and it will
it<00:01:46.409> will<00:01:46.740> shoot<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.899> sanitizing<00:01:48.899> solution<00:01:49.560> up

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
it will shoot a sanitizing solution up

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.800 
it will shoot a sanitizing solution up
inside<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.460> bottle<00:01:50.780> sanitizing<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
inside of the bottle sanitizing the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.200 
inside of the bottle sanitizing the
inside<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.409> bottle<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.939> very

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
inside of the bottle so it's very

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.929 
inside of the bottle so it's very
effective<00:01:54.780> very<00:01:55.320> fast<00:01:55.770> way<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.219> sanitizing

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
effective very fast way of sanitizing

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.819 
effective very fast way of sanitizing
bottles<00:01:57.149> without<00:01:57.840> having<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.229> immerse<00:01:58.560> each

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
bottles without having to immerse each
