00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 when ordered plastic windows and 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.480
 plastic doors immediately drew 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.880
 focus on the windowsill and select them 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.660
 Of course it is very difficult because to watch 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.000
 need to have a cut they have like this to 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.350
 rectangle was not she did not want such 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.119
 here is a windowsill with sharp ribs 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.630
 I wanted ribs to be like this and 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.250
 any so they pass as interesting 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.960
 they burn we here these windowsill never 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.809
 we do not carry them on the shop window 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.910
 it was but they brought such which not 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.180
 It was and whom I did not want to order 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.629
 Well, so it remains, but here it is 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.210
 structure that's there it surfaces 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.070
 white and smooth and as if matte smooth 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:57.239
 some roughness of course there is but it 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.000
 very well, well, these are the planes 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.750
 they seem to bend down and these 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.159
 the ribs are visible and in the future I'm all 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.920
 I have seen further most likely with me 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.990
 there will be exactly the same 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.790
 stiffeners like that go under 45 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.460
 degrees or at some angle there and 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.360
 this way and that way they go there of course stiffness 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:22.140
 better and the surface that's it of course 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.689
 in the pimples this is also white but straight 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.740
 you can see and here these are the bumps that is 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.880
 you touch it like that 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.790
 different sills and that and that is not straight 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.090
 it is clear that on the windowsill that I 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.299
 I wanted to order a film there 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:43.500
 need to be stuck and this angle of rigidity 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.270
 this one he goes under such a slope 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.479
 that is, the angle to me is a straight but a little bit 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.350
 such a stub and of course another 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.600
 set of course in these places I 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:00.189
 Of course, foam is necessary 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.720
 add because you need to close them 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:06.100
 it is necessary and a stub 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.390
 Then for the blood you set the window sill 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.360
 here at the moment I touch 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.660
 I really have fingers like this 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.630
 walks imagine him here in this place 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.720
 really go here so here to the touch 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.660
 but then it will all manifest in all such 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.610
 here is the window sill high its rigidity well 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.850
 of course I don’t know which one to choose 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.600
 choose here the film choose here 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.680
 I do n’t know how to wear pants 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:40.510
 I do not understand even if you for example 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:42.010
 get on the windowsill of course here it is 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.870
 the distance needs to be made less 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.319
 necessarily less because pressure 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.260
 do so if we install these 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.540
 here is a piece of iron i'm installing glands i'm about 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:58.180
 set yourself so well and can this 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.530
 a piece of metal to stretch here is metal 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.500
 for sale here such 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.650
 letter g is stiff hard 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.610
 get him out in this way here too 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:13.180
 spin this vertical package 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.310
 Of course zaspa turi and here is his trough 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.299
 of course it will not be someone a third 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:22.890
 beach this stiffener down 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:26.430
 served and here set 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:33.390
 because the first is that the person will 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:35.550
 abut this part of the rigidity and here 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.520
 the wall is already passing there is of course on 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.459
 you can stand on the windowsill and 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.140
 problems will not want wine not spill 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.240
 today is a holiday, by the way, wreath mine 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.910
 your grape 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:56.220
 nothing is funny 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.750
 juice survived and everything is well as juice for 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.600
 the body is very good in kurov 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:05.390
 absorbs here I will stand on the window sill 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.390
 probably all my 90 or 100 kilograms 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.890
 I calmly get up 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.210
 you are welcome 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:29.420
 got up need to walk 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:35.240
 you can really get up on the windowsill 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:38.700
 to make the curtains hang 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.460
 sure to sill need to get up he 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.370
 holds the weight of the person but if we 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:50.670
 window sill let's say one foam but I don't 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:52.620
 only foam if i did say at me 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.830
 there is such a big distance 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.470
 what did this seal on the foam 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.070
 and then on top there is more foam of course this one 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.920
 compactor 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.020
 very tough and it holds if you 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.150
 for example let's say a foam that's such a layer 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.600
 of course make a windowsill I'm not 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.390
 I know 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.830
 hold or not but so windowsill 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:18.780
 holding up very well because we 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:22.590
 get up on foot and foot area is very 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.750
 big is created on these stiffeners 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.140
 and holds the weight man why not 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.240
 keep calm hold only 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.820
 this is a window sill for me of course not 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.350
 like it but its surface is better than that 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.060
 window sill we wanted to order 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:41.190
 that's all that's the difference 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:45.830
 plastic window sills and so everything 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.830
 just if u say 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:54.740
 here this is this dirt for 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.669
 and my example like this 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:01.430
 then wipe 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.120
 be sure to wipe here not 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.719
 rubbed 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:11.770
 and rub in no case on 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:11.770
 idea to take just such a jar 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:24.919
 but look and all the same with this 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:31.520
 window sill can wipe clean 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:34.639
 you watch all rubbed for women 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.279
 this is very convenient if u have some dirt 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:43.400
 will they calmly wipe we 

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:46.330
 stepped foot and dirty marks can 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.330
 rub gently 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:07.470
 cleanliness here is laid laminate and last 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:11.140
 I didn't give a row 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:13.890
 stretch this laminate well two three 

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:18.700
 of the day is worth this laminate without load and 

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:21.490
 then I will lay 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:24.190
 let's say 2-3 days worth this laminate but 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:29.140
 it is so to the point 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:33.930
 times the laminate reinforced and told about 

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.930
 this window sill seems to be next to now
