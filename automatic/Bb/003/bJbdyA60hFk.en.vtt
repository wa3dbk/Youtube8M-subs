use to blend coloured pencils besides
gamsol<00:00:10.650> there<00:00:11.250> are<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.460> number<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.759> odd

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
gamsol there are a number of odd

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.120 
gamsol there are a number of odd
different<00:00:12.509> alternatives<00:00:13.080> I'm<00:00:13.740> going<00:00:14.070> to

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
different alternatives I'm going to

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:24.769 
different alternatives I'm going to
share<00:00:14.309> with<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:23.269> okay<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.480> know<00:00:24.689> I've

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
share with you okay so you know I've

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.509 
share with you okay so you know I've
been<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.990> little<00:00:25.260> bit<00:00:25.380> on<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.560> practicum<00:00:26.220> with

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
been a little bit on a practicum with

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.700 
been a little bit on a practicum with
colored<00:00:26.970> pencils<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.720> I've<00:00:28.199> done<00:00:28.410> two

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
colored pencils and I've done two

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.040 
colored pencils and I've done two
different<00:00:28.859> videos<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.789> will<00:00:30.029> somehow<00:00:30.660> make

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
different videos and I will somehow make

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.680 
different videos and I will somehow make
links<00:00:31.439> over<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.920> area<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.360> can<00:00:33.510> see

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
links over in this area so you can see

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.420 
links over in this area so you can see
the<00:00:33.809> overview<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.469> gamsol<00:00:34.950> which<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.399> a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
the overview of gamsol which is a

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.690 
the overview of gamsol which is a
name-brand<00:00:36.059> for<00:00:36.600> an<00:00:36.690> odorless<00:00:37.320> mineral

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
name-brand for an odorless mineral

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.580 
name-brand for an odorless mineral
spirit<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.969> what<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.140> solve<00:00:40.410> it

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
spirit and what that is is to solve it

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.799 
spirit and what that is is to solve it
basically<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.219> will<00:00:41.309> break<00:00:41.550> down<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.510> wax

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
basically that will break down the wax

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.200 
basically that will break down the wax
in<00:00:43.200> pencils<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.370> move<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
in pencils so that you can move the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.610 
in pencils so that you can move the
pigments<00:00:45.660> around<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.200> make<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.469> blend

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
pigments around and make it all blend

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.700 
pigments around and make it all blend
being<00:00:47.100> pretty<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:48.420> ah<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.320> thing<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.620> about

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
being pretty so ah the thing is about

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.889 
being pretty so ah the thing is about
odorless<00:00:50.309> mineral<00:00:50.340> spirits<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.660> is

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
odorless mineral spirits is that it is

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.920 
odorless mineral spirits is that it is
flammable<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.730> toxic<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.750> even

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
flammable and it is toxic and even

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.600 
flammable and it is toxic and even
though<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.050> can't<00:00:55.440> smell<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> fumes<00:00:56.250> there

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
though you can't smell the fumes there

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.119 
though you can't smell the fumes there
are<00:00:56.760> still<00:00:57.120> fumes<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.870> had<00:00:58.109> which<00:00:58.770> are<00:00:58.949> bad

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
are still fumes to be had which are bad

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.400 
are still fumes to be had which are bad
for<00:00:59.250> your<00:00:59.340> brain<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.850> nobody<00:01:00.780> wants<00:01:01.050> crafts

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
for your brain and nobody wants crafts

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.579 
for your brain and nobody wants crafts
that<00:01:01.440> are<00:01:01.590> bad<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:01.980> your<00:01:02.039> brain<00:01:02.750> so<00:01:03.750> there<00:01:04.500> are

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
that are bad for your brain so there are

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.580 
that are bad for your brain so there are
some<00:01:04.739> other<00:01:04.949> alternatives<00:01:05.689> one<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.960> terpenoid

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
some other alternatives one is terpenoid

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.250 
some other alternatives one is terpenoid
and<00:01:07.950> natural<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:09.150> particular<00:01:09.540> product

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
and natural and this particular product

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.760 
and natural and this particular product
is<00:01:10.500> non-toxic<00:01:11.430> non-flammable<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:13.140> also<00:01:13.619> does

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
is non-toxic non-flammable and also does

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.830 
is non-toxic non-flammable and also does
not<00:01:13.920> have<00:01:14.189> an<00:01:14.369> odor<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> brush<00:01:15.420> cleaner

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
not have an odor this is a brush cleaner

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.950 
not have an odor this is a brush cleaner
it<00:01:16.229> also<00:01:16.560> has<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> slightly<00:01:17.070> yellow<00:01:17.640> hue<00:01:18.030> but<00:01:18.720> in

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
it also has a slightly yellow hue but in

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.499 
it also has a slightly yellow hue but in
my<00:01:19.400> experiments<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:21.060> doesn't<00:01:21.450> actually

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
my experiments it doesn't actually

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.950 
my experiments it doesn't actually
change<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.080> color<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.530> your<00:01:22.820> your<00:01:23.960> pigments

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
change the color of your your pigments

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.359 
change the color of your your pigments
or<00:01:25.110> your<00:01:25.229> colored<00:01:25.650> pencils<00:01:25.890> as<00:01:26.220> you're

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
or your colored pencils as you're

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.980 
or your colored pencils as you're
blending<00:01:26.580> them<00:01:26.850> another<00:01:27.540> great<00:01:27.659> alternative

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
blending them another great alternative

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.819 
blending them another great alternative
is<00:01:28.860> baby<00:01:29.670> oil<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.869> probably<00:01:31.320> already<00:01:31.560> have

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
is baby oil you probably already have

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.319 
is baby oil you probably already have
some<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.189> lying<00:01:32.490> around<00:01:32.640> somewhere

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
some this lying around somewhere

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.300 
some this lying around somewhere
notice<00:01:33.689> how<00:01:33.810> old<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.259> raggedy<00:01:34.619> my<00:01:34.770> bottle<00:01:35.130> is

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
notice how old and raggedy my bottle is

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.090 
notice how old and raggedy my bottle is
it's<00:01:35.670> because<00:01:36.030> my<00:01:36.210> babies<00:01:36.509> are<00:01:36.540> old<00:01:37.070> but<00:01:38.070> I

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
it's because my babies are old but I

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.980 
it's because my babies are old but I
still<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.490> some<00:01:38.670> lying<00:01:38.970> around<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.479> it

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
still have some lying around and it

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.730 
still have some lying around and it
works<00:01:40.259> pretty<00:01:40.950> darn<00:01:41.220> well<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.540> let's<00:01:43.500> get

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
works pretty darn well so let's get

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.310 
works pretty darn well so let's get
right<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:45.060> experiment<00:01:45.840> there<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.170> you

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
right to the experiment there and you

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.190 
right to the experiment there and you
can<00:01:46.500> see<00:01:46.710> how<00:01:46.950> each<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.280> these<00:01:47.579> look<00:01:48.140> okay<00:01:49.140> so

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
can see how each of these look okay so

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.990 
can see how each of these look okay so
let's<00:01:49.500> start<00:01:49.710> off<00:01:49.799> here<00:01:49.860> with<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.520> gamsol

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
let's start off here with the gamsol

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.280 
let's start off here with the gamsol
which<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.299> what<00:01:51.390> I've<00:01:51.479> been<00:01:51.600> playing<00:01:51.869> with<00:01:51.960> and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
which is what I've been playing with and

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.249 
which is what I've been playing with and
just<00:01:52.829> for<00:01:53.009> comparison<00:01:53.520> purposes<00:01:54.020> here<00:01:55.020> are

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
just for comparison purposes here are

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.560 
just for comparison purposes here are
two<00:01:56.100> different<00:01:56.340> kinds<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.610> pencils<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.299> use

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
two different kinds of pencils and I use

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.380 
two different kinds of pencils and I use
by<00:01:57.810> blending<00:01:58.320> them<00:01:58.500> with<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.100> gamsol<00:01:59.790> so

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
by blending them with the gamsol so

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.510 
by blending them with the gamsol so
here's<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.719> Crayola<00:02:00.930> pencil<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.680> less<00:02:02.219> expensive

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
here's a Crayola pencil a less expensive

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.280 
here's a Crayola pencil a less expensive
one<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> prismacolor<00:02:03.450> are<00:02:03.840> more<00:02:04.020> expensive

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
one and a prismacolor are more expensive

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.469 
one and a prismacolor are more expensive
and<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.770> can<00:02:05.040> see<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:06.030> yep

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
and you can see that yep

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.150 
and you can see that yep
they<00:02:06.630> both<00:02:06.810> blend<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.259> very<00:02:07.469> nicely<00:02:07.710> with<00:02:08.069> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
they both blend it very nicely with the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.600 
they both blend it very nicely with the
gamsol<00:02:08.550> but<00:02:08.940> what<00:02:09.690> about<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.500> terpenoid<00:02:11.310> well

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
gamsol but what about the terpenoid well

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.979 
gamsol but what about the terpenoid well
first<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:11.940> all<00:02:12.000> here's<00:02:12.300> how<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.629> looks<00:02:12.840> when

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
first of all here's how it looks when

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.400 
first of all here's how it looks when
you<00:02:13.110> pour<00:02:13.349> it<00:02:13.410> in<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:14.690> kind<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.810> amber

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
you pour it in it is kind of that amber

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.710 
you pour it in it is kind of that amber
color<00:02:16.459> there<00:02:17.459> really<00:02:17.700> isn't<00:02:17.970> an<00:02:18.209> odor<00:02:18.450> to

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
color there really isn't an odor to

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.160 
color there really isn't an odor to
speak<00:02:19.020> of<00:02:20.000> maybe<00:02:21.000> almost<00:02:21.420> like<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.840> little<00:02:22.080> bit

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
speak of maybe almost like a little bit

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.839 
speak of maybe almost like a little bit
like<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.319> citric<00:02:22.830> cleanser<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.550> know<00:02:23.670> those

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
like a citric cleanser you know those

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.059 
like a citric cleanser you know those
orange<00:02:24.330> glow<00:02:24.599> type<00:02:24.930> stuff<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.739> does<00:02:25.890> have

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
orange glow type stuff so it does have

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.500 
orange glow type stuff so it does have
that<00:02:26.250> little<00:02:26.400> bit<00:02:26.489> of<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.700> smell<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.209> it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
that little bit of a smell to it

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.510 
that little bit of a smell to it
here<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.200> two<00:02:28.379> samples<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:29.069> what<00:02:29.340> I've

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
here the two samples of what I've

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.490 
here the two samples of what I've
learned<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:30.180> though<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:30.930> here's<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.319> Crayola

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
learned it though so here's the Crayola

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.979 
learned it though so here's the Crayola
pencil<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.220> here's<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.610> prismacolor<00:02:33.450> both

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
pencil and here's the prismacolor both

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.440 
pencil and here's the prismacolor both
blended<00:02:34.470> with<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.129> terpenoid<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.209> as<00:02:36.330> you

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
blended with the terpenoid and as you

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.089 
blended with the terpenoid and as you
can<00:02:36.569> see<00:02:36.780> they<00:02:36.989> blend<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.379> out<00:02:37.470> pretty<00:02:37.800> nicely

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
can see they blend it out pretty nicely

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.640 
can see they blend it out pretty nicely
if<00:02:38.819> I<00:02:38.940> just<00:02:39.150> compare<00:02:39.959> it<00:02:39.989> right<00:02:40.170> here<00:02:40.410> with<00:02:40.500> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
if I just compare it right here with the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.130 
if I just compare it right here with the
gamsol<00:02:41.250> real<00:02:41.519> quick<00:02:41.849> you<00:02:42.599> can<00:02:42.780> see<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:43.110> I

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
gamsol real quick you can see that I

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.119 
gamsol real quick you can see that I
still<00:02:43.470> got<00:02:43.709> some

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
still got some

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.809 
still got some
you<00:02:44.430> know<00:02:44.489> comparable<00:02:45.410> blending<00:02:46.410> options<00:02:47.099> so

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
you know comparable blending options so

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.199 
you know comparable blending options so
then<00:02:48.000> number<00:02:48.180> three<00:02:48.569> is<00:02:48.599> baby<00:02:49.349> oil<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.430> here

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
then number three is baby oil and here

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.640 
then number three is baby oil and here
we<00:02:51.390> go<00:02:51.569> again

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
we go again

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.000 
we go again
let<00:02:53.010> me<00:02:53.099> swallow<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:54.120> got<00:02:54.959> very<00:02:55.230> nice<00:02:55.470> blending

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
let me swallow I got very nice blending

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.100 
let me swallow I got very nice blending
options<00:02:56.400> with<00:02:56.700> both<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.120> Crayola<00:02:57.330> pencil<00:02:57.900> and

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
options with both the Crayola pencil and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.070 
options with both the Crayola pencil and
the<00:02:58.230> prismacolor<00:02:58.590> maybe<00:02:59.780> if<00:03:00.780> you're<00:03:00.900> going<00:03:00.989> to

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
the prismacolor maybe if you're going to

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.050 
the prismacolor maybe if you're going to
use<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.470> baby<00:03:01.620> oil<00:03:01.920> maybe<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.310> slightly<00:03:02.670> higher

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
use the baby oil maybe a slightly higher

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.990 
use the baby oil maybe a slightly higher
pigmented<00:03:03.959> pencil<00:03:04.500> might<00:03:05.129> be<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.370> better<00:03:05.610> thing

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
pigmented pencil might be a better thing

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.399 
pigmented pencil might be a better thing
because<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.510> blends<00:03:06.780> if<00:03:06.959> it's<00:03:07.080> got<00:03:07.260> more

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
because it blends if it's got more

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.130 
because it blends if it's got more
pigment<00:03:08.010> in<00:03:08.129> it<00:03:08.250> but<00:03:08.790> up<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.450> plus<00:03:09.720> here<00:03:09.750> is

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
pigment in it but up the plus here is

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.110 
pigment in it but up the plus here is
that<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.379> baby<00:03:10.530> oil<00:03:10.769> actually<00:03:11.250> smells<00:03:11.519> very

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
that the baby oil actually smells very

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.479 
that the baby oil actually smells very
nice<00:03:12.769> lastly<00:03:13.769> we'll<00:03:14.010> leave<00:03:14.129> you<00:03:14.220> with<00:03:14.250> this

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
nice lastly we'll leave you with this

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.790 
nice lastly we'll leave you with this
last<00:03:14.700> little<00:03:14.970> sample<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:16.170> is<00:03:16.409> one<00:03:16.590> I<00:03:16.620> did

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
last little sample this is one I did

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.280 
last little sample this is one I did
with<00:03:17.129> prismacolor<00:03:17.610> using<00:03:18.150> gamsol<00:03:18.720> on<00:03:18.989> some

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
with prismacolor using gamsol on some

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.070 
with prismacolor using gamsol on some
super<00:03:19.590> smooth<00:03:19.800> cardstock<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.840> this<00:03:21.840> one<00:03:22.050> I

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
super smooth cardstock and this one I

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.720 
super smooth cardstock and this one I
did<00:03:22.379> with<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.650> cheapest<00:03:23.190> dollar<00:03:23.459> store

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
did with the cheapest dollar store

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.320 
did with the cheapest dollar store
pencils<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.150> could<00:03:24.300> find<00:03:24.599> a<00:03:24.959> q-tip<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.190> some

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
pencils I could find a q-tip and some

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.110 
pencils I could find a q-tip and some
baby<00:03:27.330> oil<00:03:27.440> so<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:29.159> know<00:03:29.340> we<00:03:29.879> might<00:03:30.090> have

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
baby oil so you know we might have

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.780 
baby oil so you know we might have
comments<00:03:31.019> about<00:03:31.230> maybe<00:03:31.709> one<00:03:32.040> pencil<00:03:32.310> is<00:03:32.760> a

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
comments about maybe one pencil is a

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.130 
comments about maybe one pencil is a
little<00:03:33.060> better<00:03:33.150> than<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.450> other<00:03:33.569> pencil<00:03:33.989> but

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
little better than the other pencil but

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.740 
little better than the other pencil but
as<00:03:34.230> far<00:03:34.409> as<00:03:34.440> blending<00:03:34.920> goes<00:03:35.129> I<00:03:35.519> think<00:03:36.390> that<00:03:36.659> you

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
as far as blending goes I think that you

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.339 
as far as blending goes I think that you
can<00:03:36.900> get<00:03:37.080> away<00:03:37.319> with<00:03:37.950> using<00:03:37.980> your<00:03:38.400> baby<00:03:38.610> oil<00:03:38.909> if

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
can get away with using your baby oil if

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.690 
can get away with using your baby oil if
this<00:03:40.349> is<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> new<00:03:40.739> technique<00:03:41.159> for<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:41.640> you

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
this is a new technique for you and you

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.030 
this is a new technique for you and you
don't<00:03:41.879> invest<00:03:42.360> either<00:03:42.870> in<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.409> money<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.980> the

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
don't invest either in the money of the

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.520 
don't invest either in the money of the
mineral<00:03:44.459> spirits<00:03:44.700> or<00:03:45.030> be<00:03:45.750> you're<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.260> little

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
mineral spirits or be you're a little
