00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
too because after this war there are

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.180

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
everything because that is how they were

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.130 
everything because that is how they were
treated<00:00:54.550> as<00:00:54.700> toys<00:00:55.740> it's<00:00:56.740> all<00:00:56.980> they<00:00:57.160> know

gone<00:01:11.950> but<00:01:12.520> we<00:01:12.730> do<00:01:13.090> know<00:01:13.360> that<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.720> planet

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
gone but we do know that the planet

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.580 
gone but we do know that the planet
still<00:01:14.260> has<00:01:14.380> many<00:01:14.590> human<00:01:14.980> influences<00:01:15.640> left

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590

some<00:01:17.590> have<00:01:17.710> noted<00:01:18.130> that<00:01:18.160> the<00:01:18.310> world<00:01:18.580> of<00:01:18.700> cars

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
some have noted that the world of cars

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.660 
some have noted that the world of cars
can't<00:01:19.600> be<00:01:19.870> after<00:01:20.140> humans<00:01:20.830> left<00:01:21.070> because

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
can't be after humans left because

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.640 
can't be after humans left because
there's<00:01:21.940> no<00:01:22.240> pollution<00:01:22.750> shown<00:01:23.200> in<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.380> movies

there's no pollution shown in the movies
if<00:01:24.370> you<00:01:24.520> look<00:01:24.640> carefully<00:01:24.850> at<00:01:25.150> wall-e<00:01:25.330> however

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
if you look carefully at wall-e however

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.980 
if you look carefully at wall-e however
the<00:01:26.290> world<00:01:26.470> has<00:01:26.680> never<00:01:26.890> shown<00:01:27.840> during<00:01:28.840> this

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
the world has never shown during this

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.620 
the world has never shown during this
time<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:30.310> we<00:01:30.400> don't<00:01:30.580> really<00:01:30.850> know<00:01:31.180> how<00:01:31.360> badly

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
time so we don't really know how badly

time so we don't really know how badly
the<00:01:31.900> earth<00:01:31.990> was<00:01:32.320> polluted<00:01:32.860> it's<00:01:33.580> possible

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
the earth was polluted it's possible

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.090 
the earth was polluted it's possible
that<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.570> machines<00:01:34.930> sent<00:01:35.409> humans<00:01:35.830> away<00:01:35.950> to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
that the machines sent humans away to

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.210 
that the machines sent humans away to
curb<00:01:36.730> overpopulation<00:01:37.659> and<00:01:37.840> fix<00:01:38.530> the

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
machines populating the earth that would

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.190 
machines populating the earth that would
explain<00:01:45.970> why<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.270> machines<00:01:46.630> abandoned<00:01:47.080> earth

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
explain why the machines abandoned earth

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.490 
explain why the machines abandoned earth
entirely<00:01:47.820> leaving<00:01:48.820> only<00:01:48.940> wall-e<00:01:49.390> behind<00:01:50.140> in

entirely leaving only wall-e behind in
cars<00:01:50.979> -<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.640> cars<00:01:51.880> go<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.060> Europe<00:01:52.390> and<00:01:52.540> Japan

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630

cars - the cars go to Europe and Japan
making<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.409> plain<00:01:53.680> that<00:01:53.710> this<00:01:54.070> is<00:01:54.250> all<00:01:54.430> taking

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
making it plain that this is all taking

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.880 
making it plain that this is all taking
place<00:01:54.790> on<00:01:55.120> earth<00:01:55.360> as<00:01:55.600> we<00:01:55.840> know<00:01:55.870> it<00:01:56.140> so<00:01:56.710> what

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
place on earth as we know it so what

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.890 
place on earth as we know it so what
happened<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.520> cars<00:01:57.850> we've<00:01:58.540> learned<00:01:58.780> by

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
happened to the cars we've learned by
