00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 some others arising we are in 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:07.259
 minecraft 1.7 points let's see a way 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.440
 with the sheep a mod that is super 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.550
 cool pimp a lot of guy but 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.049
 Now let's go see how little by little 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.849
 because there are some little things to look at 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.190
 well we are adding as you are seeing 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.970
 here some little things I think I do not know 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.869
 add magnetite 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.000
 graphite grafite you follow graphite 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:29.029
 aluminum and copper and we will find 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.250
 for the world the issue here against 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.449
 today or something that lost the cave because it 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.449
 I stop moving everywhere 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.480
 where directly there was not here is 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:43.659
 all and magnetite and also as you are 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.659
 seeing 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.110
 we're supposed to try it we 're going to 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.890
 try it even though I think I 'm going to die 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.890
 but good 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:59.270
 here here here and here I say that 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.400
 I will die, I'm not sure 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.660
 Well, we're going to find this one 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.040
 mountain of mini - vehicles because I was going to 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.620
 say mini tanks but there are also 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.340
 helicopters and such but good we're going to 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.340
 get like that 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.040
 young man hits us 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:25.719
 but the noise it makes is or the noise that 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.600
 It makes your work here is appalling 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:30.740
 directly in 4 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.740
 to see there's another one out there 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.250
 the question is that this tank in 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.400
 concrete I do not see it on the web then 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.840
 I do not know exactly what he does is that the voice 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.610
 does not know any tank like that with spikes 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.710
 above but good the little angel that 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.030
 You see, it hits us excellent but it's worth 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.580
 several little things when chopping for example the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.710
 magnetite and graphite give us rocks of 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.490
 Magnetite not know how to say it 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.630
 magnetite and graphite of this one and with 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.510
 this is going to be able to do some little things 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.680
 for example if we put a stone of 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.440
 graphite I will get to the graphite but not 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.260
 I know if you're fine and iron we do this 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.929
 grafite iron with this but let's go 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.590
 we make steel there is something like 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.140
 this is a mine a pencil that is with 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.640
 six of wood and three of graphite and what 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.160
 only one that serves to make a book of 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.470
 these is a mine because you can already 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.240
 do so but we can do it well 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.030
 this here that serves to stay 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.310
 some of the helicopter tanks that 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.950
 let's see what is needed is good 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.250
 let's go in parts the cable that is 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:39.510
 does against this copper and six wool 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.910
 16 cable and aluminum that are accessible 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.100
 of burning the aluminum and with this it 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.710
 suppose we can stay or do 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.750
 our this is the opposite of some 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.040
 bugs and let's go see now but 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.840
 good some are the files like the one 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.530
 we have seen there this is another hostile the 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.130
 aggressive mini helicopter 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.280
 but what good 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.490
 the aggressive super bonus but the super 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.490
 monkey 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.150
 here 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.010
 I thought he would come for my house 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.450
 hello because it hits you like it's 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.880
 is the best attack for having had 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.650
 helicopter of course because it's like 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.650
 if we were not no 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.680
 as if he were bombing us 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.820
 not the problem is that we do not see is not seen 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.750
 here 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.940
 yes so cool 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.380
 to you that we can jump ingots 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.820
 of aluminum there is another helicopter that 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.320
 can we do that is with a 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.710
 aluminum block that is made with 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.960
 all aluminum we put there an engine 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.400
 blog that will be the engine I do not suppose it is 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.910
 all aluminum and in the middle you have to put 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.550
 this or all copper the engine that is made 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.040
 to see with three cable that we have already 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.820
 seen how it makes four aluminum and 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.360
 two of this 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.910
 magnet that is made with three magnetite 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.020
 we should move it over and then over 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.650
 of all this we have to put the blades 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:18.160
 which is made with four aluminum 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:21.650
 there lies spam this little bug that with this 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:25.370
 it is supposed to be there and now it is our 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.620
 they follow me with the command this is what 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.840
 that you can make some of these 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.750
 Bugs are our 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.750
 but if superbowl let's try 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:45.180
 that only attacks is killed on the way to the tasting 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:53.509
 that without my permission 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:53.509
 let's see let's go to zombie zombie biggest here 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.120
 value 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:05.289
 we take public barrdeando 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.869
 we can not kill him 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.879
 to the army by sack has released us not 

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:12.029
 we have the aggressive mini tank is 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:12.029
 here 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.430
 is that it gave a lot of bombarding market 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.430
 the milk 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.300
 do not 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.760
 and then we can have our 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.680
 own tank that to spur is it 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.360
 with a steel block of this steel 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.630
 and we have seen how it is done by burning the 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.160
 graphite and iron and with canon is the 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.040
 said this is done with a block of 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.490
 textile and two bars and we have to 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.230
 put the block here and the bug on top 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.810
 the last one we do not give him with the command and it's 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:50.160
 our 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.870
 you come to think that there is no 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.430
 to prove it is very cool as an attacker 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.430
 or from his time one 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:03.350
 Spanish Spanish voucher 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:06.790
 cool a lot day then we have a 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.790
 kaka bug that is the mini bomber 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.570
 yes 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.130
 it does not cool it does not cool much 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.610
 the bug what it does is come explode 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.610
 you are running 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.120
 is that he is running 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.970
 when you approach de exploita good I stay 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.969
 wrong but that has a bang 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:30.719
 and the bug is running 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:34.099
 and no no no no let me leave me let's go 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:34.099
 kill another who is wrong 

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:40.290
 told 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.480
 that by the way the aggressive helicopter 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.600
 who can attack us can let go 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:49.440
 these two little things mini one knows mime 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.530
 mini rifle body or something like that the truth that 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.480
 with that we can graph the minivan is 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.080
 a gun lie more and in fact if 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.080
 keep right click 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.979
 but for that we need the bullets that 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.870
 they are created by putting the iron like this in this 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:07.620
 so rare position and in the middle of gunpowder 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.620
 we say 8 bullets 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:15.419
 It's the bullet 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:18.230
 and then we have this here which is what 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:20.630
 we have seen before and they attack us 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:23.330
 but the problem is that at least in the 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:26.490
 web does not do anything about this saying and 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:29.250
 there is a friendly one 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:33.030
 the circle that can be our sitting 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:34.680
 it is not one that can be ours and the 

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.750
 issue is that it does not put anything on how it's done 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.740
 or anything which is a little bit more for 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.370
 one hundred if we give right click when 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.370
 he does that 

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:45.779
 and it's a shame because I do not know how to get 

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:48.809
 this guy long stomach but good 

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:50.999
 this is the monster is very cool these 

00:07:48.809 --> 00:07:53.719
 little bugs molar a lot I get to 

00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:53.719
 work polish 

00:07:53.849 --> 00:08:00.089
 Take a bet or gas but good you have 

00:07:56.699 --> 00:08:01.800
 the inscriptions for the 1.7 points if 

00:08:00.089 --> 00:08:04.789
 will be with forge and so on 

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.789
 I hope you liked it 

00:08:06.679 --> 00:08:09.679
 bye
