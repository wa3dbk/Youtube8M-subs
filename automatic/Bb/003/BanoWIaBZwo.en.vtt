movement<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.930> takes<00:01:40.170> literally<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:41.159> fraction

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
movement it takes literally a fraction

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.609 
movement it takes literally a fraction
of<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.880> second<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.600> flip<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.990> little<00:01:43.320> that

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
of a second to flip that little that

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.050 
of a second to flip that little that
little<00:01:43.680> arm<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.430> side<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.640> your<00:01:44.790> steering

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
little arm on the side of your steering

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.179 
little arm on the side of your steering
wheel<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.540> turn<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.810> blinker<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.140> that's<00:01:47.040> all

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
wheel to turn the blinker on that's all

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.480 
wheel to turn the blinker on that's all
it<00:01:47.310> takes<00:01:47.490> that's<00:01:48.470> literally<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.799> takes<00:01:50.250> a

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
it takes that's literally it takes a

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.870 
it takes that's literally it takes a
fraction<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.240> second<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.409> if<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.680> don't<00:01:52.950> use

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
fraction of a second so if you don't use

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.780 
fraction of a second so if you don't use
your<00:01:53.909> blinker<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:55.380> are<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> jerk<00:01:55.860> I'm<00:01:56.070> putting
