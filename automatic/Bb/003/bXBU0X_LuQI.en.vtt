I<00:00:02.639> think<00:00:03.449> I<00:00:03.570> think<00:00:03.810> that<00:00:03.989> I'm<00:00:04.230> interested<00:00:04.890> in

00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:04.979 
I think I think that I'm interested in

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:07.580 
I think I think that I'm interested in
monsters<00:00:06.050> not<00:00:07.050> because<00:00:07.290> they<00:00:07.410> have<00:00:07.559> a

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:07.590 
monsters not because they have a

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.799 
monsters not because they have a
specific<00:00:08.220> value<00:00:08.400> you<00:00:08.940> know<00:00:09.030> I<00:00:09.300> actually<00:00:09.450> think

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
specific value you know I actually think

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.710 
specific value you know I actually think
they<00:00:09.990> are<00:00:10.550> they<00:00:11.550> have<00:00:11.790> multiple<00:00:12.030> values

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:12.720 
they are they have multiple values

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.310 
they are they have multiple values
depending<00:00:13.170> on<00:00:13.290> how<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.470> use<00:00:13.769> them<00:00:13.980> they<00:00:14.730> are

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
depending on how you use them they are

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.970 
depending on how you use them they are
symbols<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.740> great<00:00:17.640> power<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.630> think<00:00:19.079> that<00:00:19.380> at

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
symbols of great power I think that at

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.519 
symbols of great power I think that at
some<00:00:20.220> point<00:00:20.519> when<00:00:21.329> we<00:00:21.509> became<00:00:21.900> thinking

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
some point when we became thinking

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.669 
some point when we became thinking
creatures<00:00:23.519> we<00:00:23.960> decided<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.109> interpret<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:25.679 
creatures we decided to interpret the

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.359 
creatures we decided to interpret the
world<00:00:26.480> by<00:00:27.480> creating<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.989> mythology<00:00:28.319> of<00:00:28.589> gods

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
world by creating a mythology of gods

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.229 
world by creating a mythology of gods
and<00:00:29.550> monsters

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:30.239 
and monsters

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.780 
and monsters
you<00:00:30.569> know<00:00:30.749> we<00:00:30.929> created<00:00:31.250> angels<00:00:32.250> we<00:00:32.369> created

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
you know we created angels we created

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.709 
you know we created angels we created
demons<00:00:33.210> we<00:00:33.840> created<00:00:35.030> serpents<00:00:36.030> devouring<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
demons we created serpents devouring the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.680 
demons we created serpents devouring the
moon<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.530> created<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.430> mythology<00:00:38.789> to<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.480> make

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
moon we created a mythology to to make

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.180 
moon we created a mythology to to make
sense<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.289> world<00:00:40.410> around<00:00:40.649> us<00:00:41.039> and

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
sense of the world around us and

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.549 
sense of the world around us and
monsters<00:00:42.090> were<00:00:42.269> born<00:00:42.600> at<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> same<00:00:43.109> time<00:00:43.379> than

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
monsters were born at the same time than

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.450 
monsters were born at the same time than
angels<00:00:44.010> or<00:00:44.340> any<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.179> beatific<00:00:46.460> creatures

angels or any of the beatific creatures

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.939 
angels or any of the beatific creatures
and<00:00:47.699> characters<00:00:48.000> were<00:00:48.390> created<00:00:48.449> so<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.320> don't

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
and characters were created so I don't

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.090 
and characters were created so I don't
assign<00:00:50.250> them<00:00:50.429> a<00:00:50.550> specific<00:00:51.000> value<00:00:51.440> but<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.469> do

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
assign them a specific value but I do

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.239 
assign them a specific value but I do
I<00:00:53.129> am<00:00:53.640> very<00:00:53.850> mindful<00:00:54.269> of<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.780> way<00:00:54.929> I<00:00:55.039> deal<00:00:56.039> with

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:56.249 
I am very mindful of the way I deal with

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:58.639 
I am very mindful of the way I deal with
them<00:00:56.429> in<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.579> movies<00:00:56.999> and<00:00:57.749> in<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.260> books

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
them in the movies and in the books

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.840 
them in the movies and in the books
because<00:00:59.160> I<00:01:00.170> assigned<00:01:01.170> them<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.850> specific

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
because I assigned them a specific

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.230 
because I assigned them a specific
function<00:01:03.269> and<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.510> tried<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.379> take<00:01:05.309> them<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:06.120> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
function and I tried to take them to the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.150 
function and I tried to take them to the
extreme<00:01:06.690> with<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.620> know<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.770> make<00:01:07.980> them

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
extreme with that you know I make them

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.550 
extreme with that you know I make them
victims<00:01:08.640> or<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.880> make<00:01:09.120> them<00:01:09.330> sympathetic<00:01:10.320> or<00:01:10.470> I

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
victims or I make them sympathetic or I

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.490 
victims or I make them sympathetic or I
make<00:01:10.800> them<00:01:10.980> brutal<00:01:11.340> parasites<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.500> they

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
make them brutal parasites and they

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.110 
make them brutal parasites and they
become<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.830> metaphor<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.490> something<00:01:14.670> else

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
become a metaphor for something else

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.370 
become a metaphor for something else
obviously<00:01:15.960> monsters<00:01:16.440> are<00:01:16.730> living<00:01:17.730> breathing

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
obviously monsters are living breathing

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.130 
obviously monsters are living breathing
metaphors<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.440> for<00:01:19.830> me<00:01:20.510> half<00:01:21.510> of<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> fun<00:01:21.990> is

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
metaphors that for me half of the fun is

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.930 
metaphors that for me half of the fun is
explaining<00:01:22.740> them<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.460> socially<00:01:24.620> biologically

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
explaining them so socially biologically

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.330 
explaining them so socially biologically
mythologically<00:01:26.940> and<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.360> forth

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.099 

I<00:01:30.429> think<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.359> moment<00:01:31.570> we<00:01:33.240> made<00:01:34.240> our

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
I think the moment we made our

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:37.529 
I think the moment we made our
interpretation<00:01:35.829> of<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.070> world<00:01:36.280> as<00:01:36.579> a<00:01:37.090> sort<00:01:37.479> of

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
interpretation of the world as a sort of

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.919 
interpretation of the world as a sort of
binary<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:39.549> know<00:01:39.670> type<00:01:40.450> of<00:01:40.479> interpretation

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
binary you know type of interpretation

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.190 
binary you know type of interpretation
night<00:01:41.469> and<00:01:41.859> day<00:01:42.399> became<00:01:43.270> separate<00:01:43.719> entities

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
night and day became separate entities

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.850 
night and day became separate entities
light<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.619> dark<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:49.000> we<00:01:49.209> went<00:01:49.709> through<00:01:50.709> the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
light and dark and we went through the

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.179 
light and dark and we went through the
process<00:01:51.700> of<00:01:51.759> creating<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.270> world<00:01:52.299> by<00:01:53.189> an

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
process of creating the world by an

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:55.980 
process of creating the world by an
understanding<00:01:54.939> of<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.149> world<00:01:55.359> through

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
understanding of the world through

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.580 
understanding of the world through
opposites<00:01:57.359> we<00:01:58.359> needed<00:01:58.659> to<00:01:58.750> mythologize<00:01:59.289> and<00:01:59.530> I

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
opposites we needed to mythologize and I

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.760 
opposites we needed to mythologize and I
think<00:01:59.829> what<00:02:00.520> it<00:02:00.640> tells<00:02:00.850> you<00:02:01.060> is<00:02:01.240> that<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:02.619> know

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
think what it tells you is that you know

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.550 
think what it tells you is that you know
we<00:02:03.009> is<00:02:03.520> mostly<00:02:03.970> Western<00:02:04.599> with<00:02:05.020> Western

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
we is mostly Western with Western

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.609 
we is mostly Western with Western
culture<00:02:05.590> thinking<00:02:06.899> there's<00:02:07.899> a<00:02:07.989> Eastern

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
culture thinking there's a Eastern

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.759 
culture thinking there's a Eastern
philosophies<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.269> accept<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:11.440> good<00:02:11.620> and

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
philosophies that accept the good and

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.770 
philosophies that accept the good and
the<00:02:11.890> bad<00:02:12.010> quote<00:02:12.400> unquote<00:02:12.549> as<00:02:12.970> parts<00:02:13.599> of<00:02:13.720> the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
the bad quote unquote as parts of the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.559 
the bad quote unquote as parts of the

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
whole and that thing that the good flows

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.750 
whole and that thing that the good flows
with<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.930> bad<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.379> bad<00:02:17.590> flows<00:02:18.400> right

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
with the bad and the bad flows right

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.479 
with the bad and the bad flows right
back<00:02:19.000> into<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.450> good<00:02:19.629> and<00:02:19.959> that<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:21.280> is<00:02:21.459> a

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
back into the good and that that is a

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.160 
back into the good and that that is a
beautiful<00:02:22.060> way<00:02:22.209> of<00:02:22.239> understanding<00:02:22.629> the<00:02:22.989> world

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
beautiful way of understanding the world

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.740 
beautiful way of understanding the world
in<00:02:23.379> the<00:02:23.440> universe<00:02:23.650> but<00:02:24.310> Western<00:02:24.730> culture<00:02:25.180> it

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.740 
essentially that whenever we consider
something<00:02:38.590> good<00:02:38.950> at<00:02:39.579> the<00:02:40.150> same<00:02:40.359> time<00:02:40.540> we<00:02:40.720> are

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
something good at the same time we are

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.500 
something good at the same time we are
dealing<00:02:41.230> something<00:02:41.889> bad<00:02:42.130> when<00:02:42.970> we<00:02:43.120> consider

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
dealing something bad when we consider

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.809 
dealing something bad when we consider
something<00:02:44.019> light<00:02:44.739> is<00:02:45.340> because<00:02:45.670> we're

something light is because we're

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.640 
something light is because we're
considering<00:02:46.180> something<00:02:46.569> dark<00:02:47.019> and<00:02:47.260> it's

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
considering something dark and it's

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.339 
considering something dark and it's
better<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.220> just<00:02:48.480> understand<00:02:49.480> everything<00:02:50.049> as

the<00:02:50.500> everything<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.220> abandoned<00:02:52.209> ourselves

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
the everything and abandoned ourselves

the everything and abandoned ourselves
to<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.079> and<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:53.410> forth<00:02:53.680> but<00:02:53.859> but<00:02:54.609> I<00:02:54.639> I<00:02:54.730> think

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
to it and so forth but but I I think

to it and so forth but but I I think
that's<00:02:55.420> what<00:02:55.660> it<00:02:55.780> tells<00:02:55.930> you
