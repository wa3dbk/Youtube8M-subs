I'm<00:00:01.860> Brazilian<00:00:02.100> but<00:00:02.700> I<00:00:02.730> live<00:00:02.970> in<00:00:03.090> London<00:00:03.240> and

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:04.040 
I'm Brazilian but I live in London and

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.380 
I'm Brazilian but I live in London and
coming<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.130> London<00:00:05.490> being<00:00:05.850> in<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.089> middle<00:00:06.299> of

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
coming to London being in the middle of

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.570 
coming to London being in the middle of
so<00:00:06.569> many<00:00:06.720> different<00:00:07.290> cultures<00:00:07.770> encouraged<00:00:08.400> me

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
so many different cultures encouraged me

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:20.840 
so many different cultures encouraged me
to<00:00:08.790> look<00:00:08.910> back<00:00:09.179> at<00:00:09.330> my<00:00:09.360> own<00:00:09.690> culture

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.520 

each<00:00:21.850> stone<00:00:22.240> has<00:00:22.540> a<00:00:22.570> slightly<00:00:22.960> different

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:23.530 
each stone has a slightly different

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.580 
each stone has a slightly different
texture<00:00:24.100> and<00:00:24.460> when<00:00:25.390> they<00:00:25.510> are<00:00:25.660> polished<00:00:26.290> and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
texture and when they are polished and

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.280 
texture and when they are polished and
rounded<00:00:27.070> it<00:00:27.490> becomes<00:00:27.820> more<00:00:27.970> evident<00:00:28.290> so

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
rounded it becomes more evident so

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.800 
rounded it becomes more evident so
whenever<00:00:29.830> possible<00:00:30.160> I<00:00:30.820> like<00:00:31.029> to<00:00:31.420> have<00:00:31.600> them

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
whenever possible I like to have them

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.400 
whenever possible I like to have them
against<00:00:32.320> the<00:00:32.410> skin<00:00:36.930> I've<00:00:37.930> always<00:00:38.260> thought

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
against the skin I've always thought

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.920 
against the skin I've always thought
that<00:00:38.470> the<00:00:38.710> snake<00:00:38.949> chain<00:00:39.190> is<00:00:39.340> fascinating<00:00:40.059> it's

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
that the snake chain is fascinating it's

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.630 
that the snake chain is fascinating it's
this<00:00:41.230> line<00:00:41.530> of<00:00:41.710> gold<00:00:41.920> there<00:00:42.460> has<00:00:42.610> a

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
this line of gold there has a

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.920 
this line of gold there has a
combination<00:00:43.239> of<00:00:43.530> flexibility<00:00:44.530> and<00:00:44.920> tension

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
combination of flexibility and tension

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.810 
combination of flexibility and tension
so<00:00:46.930> I've<00:00:47.350> been<00:00:47.620> really<00:00:47.860> exploring<00:00:48.400> it<00:00:48.640> and

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
so I've been really exploring it and

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.000 
so I've been really exploring it and
using<00:00:49.510> it<00:00:49.629> to<00:00:49.750> give<00:00:49.960> a<00:00:49.989> unique<00:00:50.379> movement<00:00:50.650> to<00:00:50.890> my

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
using it to give a unique movement to my

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.799 
using it to give a unique movement to my
pieces<00:00:51.250> because<00:00:53.729> I<00:00:54.729> use<00:00:54.970> this<00:00:55.150> neck<00:00:55.390> chain<00:00:55.629> as

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
pieces because I use this neck chain as

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.530 
pieces because I use this neck chain as
the<00:00:55.989> structure<00:00:56.500> in<00:00:56.650> some<00:00:56.860> of<00:00:56.979> my<00:00:57.100> pieces<00:00:57.540> this

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
the structure in some of my pieces this

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.410 
the structure in some of my pieces this
allows<00:00:58.900> them<00:00:59.110> to<00:00:59.170> be<00:00:59.650> transformed<00:01:00.370> and<00:01:00.699> become

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
allows them to be transformed and become

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.920 
allows them to be transformed and become
completely<00:01:01.989> different<00:01:02.199> with<00:01:02.650> the<00:01:02.799> movement

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.940 

attraction<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.080> desire<00:01:09.110> are<00:01:09.620> really

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
attraction and desire are really

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.940 
attraction and desire are really
important<00:01:10.700> in<00:01:10.790> my<00:01:10.910> work<00:01:11.120> because<00:01:12.020> to<00:01:12.260> me<00:01:12.650> they

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
important in my work because to me they

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.340 
important in my work because to me they
are<00:01:12.980> the<00:01:13.130> initial<00:01:14.000> spark<00:01:14.330> in<00:01:14.660> this<00:01:14.930> connection

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
are the initial spark in this connection

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.390 
are the initial spark in this connection
between<00:01:16.180> people<00:01:17.180> in<00:01:17.300> jewelry<00:01:17.690> and<00:01:18.400> precious

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
between people in jewelry and precious

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.820 
between people in jewelry and precious
materials<00:01:20.090> already<00:01:20.240> carried<00:01:20.840> that<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:21.470> I<00:01:21.500> try

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
materials already carried that so I try

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.990 
materials already carried that so I try
to<00:01:21.860> enhance<00:01:22.670> this<00:01:22.940> with<00:01:23.390> shapes<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.350> finishes

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
to enhance this with shapes and finishes

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:38.200 
to enhance this with shapes and finishes
through<00:01:26.000> design

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.109

from things I've seen women have met

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.969 
from things I've seen women have met
but<00:01:54.700> most<00:01:54.909> importantly<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:55.930> comes<00:01:56.290> from<00:01:56.560> the

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
but most importantly it comes from the

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.850 
but most importantly it comes from the
materials<00:01:57.490> I<00:01:57.580> work<00:01:57.790> with<00:01:58.060> gold<00:01:58.560> stones<00:01:59.560> and
