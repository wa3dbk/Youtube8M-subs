it's<00:01:46.450> too<00:01:46.630> long<00:01:46.780> for<00:01:46.840> me<00:01:47.109> to<00:01:47.140> play<00:01:47.380> it's<00:01:47.560> too

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
it's too long for me to play it's too

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:49.649 
it's too long for me to play it's too
long<00:01:47.799> for<00:01:47.859> most<00:01:48.219> people<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:48.490> play<00:01:48.670> twenty<00:01:49.509> five

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
long for most people to play twenty five

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.709 
long for most people to play twenty five
and<00:01:49.869> a<00:01:49.929> half<00:01:49.960> is<00:01:50.969> everybody's<00:01:51.969> used<00:01:52.179> to<00:01:52.359> it<00:01:52.479> but

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
and a half is everybody's used to it but

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:53.999 
and a half is everybody's used to it but
I<00:01:52.749> felt<00:01:53.049> like<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.259> was<00:01:53.350> leaving<00:01:53.619> something<00:01:53.829> on

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
I felt like it was leaving something on

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.230 
I felt like it was leaving something on
the<00:01:54.100> table<00:01:54.249> and<00:01:54.429> twenty<00:01:54.700> six<00:01:54.909> and<00:01:55.060> a<00:01:55.090> quarter

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
the table and twenty six and a quarter

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.609 
the table and twenty six and a quarter
which<00:01:55.780> sounds<00:01:56.079> like<00:01:56.140> we<00:01:56.259> just<00:01:56.289> split<00:01:56.530> the

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
which sounds like we just split the

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.050 
which sounds like we just split the
difference<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:57.189> really<00:01:57.310> we<00:01:57.609> kind<00:01:57.729> of<00:01:57.850> worked

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
difference it really we kind of worked

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.700 
difference it really we kind of worked
up<00:01:58.359> to<00:01:58.509> that<00:01:58.659> number<00:02:01.049> totally<00:02:02.049> but<00:02:02.289> it's

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
up to that number totally but it's

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.889 
up to that number totally but it's
really<00:02:02.829> comfortable<00:02:03.310> is<00:02:03.549> the<00:02:03.939> main<00:02:04.210> goal<00:02:04.630> with

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
really comfortable is the main goal with

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.890 
really comfortable is the main goal with
the<00:02:05.020> extended<00:02:05.560> range

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
the extended range

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.499 
the extended range
a<00:02:06.930> string<00:02:07.770> tension<00:02:08.220> or<00:02:08.640> not<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.090> much<00:02:09.149> tension

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
a string tension or not so much tension

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.120 
a string tension or not so much tension
we<00:02:09.899> don't<00:02:10.110> most<00:02:10.410> people<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.800> pick<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.040> and

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
we don't most people that pick it up and

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.230 
we don't most people that pick it up and
play<00:02:11.280> don't<00:02:11.490> even<00:02:11.700> really<00:02:11.850> know<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
play don't even really know the

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.940 
play don't even really know the
difference<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.690> just<00:02:12.990> brings<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.470> clarity

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
difference it just brings the clarity

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.940 
difference it just brings the clarity
out<00:02:14.070> so<00:02:14.640> especially<00:02:14.850> with<00:02:15.240> that<00:02:15.270> bridge<00:02:15.690> that

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
out so especially with that bridge that

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.740 
out so especially with that bridge that
the<00:02:16.950> isolation<00:02:17.610> between<00:02:17.670> each<00:02:17.970> string<00:02:18.390> each

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
the isolation between each string each

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.020 
the isolation between each string each
string<00:02:19.110> rings<00:02:19.380> out<00:02:19.560> nice<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:19.800> clean<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.610> into

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
string rings out nice and clean it into

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.730 
string rings out nice and clean it into
nates<00:02:21.240> beautifully<00:02:21.780> because<00:02:21.960> of<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.410> it's

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
nates beautifully because of it it's

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.400 
nates beautifully because of it it's
really<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.100> really<00:02:23.730> nice<00:02:24.120> design<00:02:24.540> alright<00:02:25.200> so

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
really a really nice design alright so

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.440 
really a really nice design alright so
the<00:02:25.770> pickups<00:02:26.160> again<00:02:26.460> what<00:02:26.700> are<00:02:26.730> they<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.300> these

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
bridge I mean the next position earlier

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.830 
bridge I mean the next position earlier
right<00:02:41.280> yeah<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.150> other<00:02:42.300> thing<00:02:42.420> we<00:02:42.510> do<00:02:42.630> we

right yeah and the other thing we do we
do<00:02:42.959> one<00:02:43.200> other<00:02:43.290> things<00:02:43.590> stand<00:02:43.800> on<00:02:43.980> the

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
do one other things stand on the

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.530 
do one other things stand on the
akkadian<00:02:44.400> it's<00:02:44.580> actually<00:02:44.850> got<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:44.970> split<00:02:45.300> tone

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
akkadian it's actually got a split tone

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.480 
akkadian it's actually got a split tone
and<00:02:45.870> it's<00:02:46.350> not<00:02:46.500> really<00:02:46.890> meant<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.190> be<00:02:47.310> like<00:02:47.459> a

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
and it's not really meant to be like a

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.120 
and it's not really meant to be like a
single<00:02:47.910> coil<00:02:48.150> tone<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.750> almost<00:02:49.410> just<00:02:49.770> flips

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
single coil tone it almost just flips

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.040 
single coil tone it almost just flips
the<00:02:50.340> mids<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.940> sounds<00:02:51.390> almost<00:02:51.570> pseudo

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
the mids and it sounds almost pseudo

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.110 
the mids and it sounds almost pseudo
acoustically<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.709> really<00:02:53.070> like<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.459> that's

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
acoustically I really like it that's

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.699 
acoustically I really like it that's
more<00:02:54.300> of<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.420> tone<00:02:54.660> control<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.380> it<00:02:55.470> can<00:02:55.560> be

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
more of a tone control and it can be

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.480 
more of a tone control and it can be
applied<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.130> any<00:02:56.310> setting<00:02:56.700> yeah<00:02:57.000> exactly<00:02:58.490> okay

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
applied to any setting yeah exactly okay

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.800 
applied to any setting yeah exactly okay
so<00:02:59.550> Mason<00:03:00.030> now<00:03:00.150> you're<00:03:00.300> gonna<00:03:00.390> let<00:03:00.600> us<00:03:00.690> hear

years they've got power scaling and

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.720 
years they've got power scaling and
master<00:03:33.840> volume<00:03:34.050> and<00:03:34.380> I<00:03:34.500> see<00:03:35.069> the<00:03:35.250> polite<00:03:35.520> guy

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
I think we're playing it like 12 watts

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.340 
I think we're playing it like 12 watts
with<00:03:41.850> it<00:03:41.940> actually<00:03:42.090> set<00:03:42.510> pretty<00:03:42.720> hot<00:03:42.959> and

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
with it actually set pretty hot and

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.340 
with it actually set pretty hot and
still<00:03:43.770> nice<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:43.980> clean<00:03:44.310> sounding<00:03:44.700> 6v6<00:03:45.350> yep

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
still nice and clean sounding 6v6 yep

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.410 
still nice and clean sounding 6v6 yep
then<00:03:46.739> we've<00:03:46.860> also<00:03:46.980> got<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.400> satellite<00:03:47.760> reverb

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
then we've also got a satellite reverb

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.750 
then we've also got a satellite reverb
unit<00:03:48.510> in<00:03:48.959> there<00:03:49.230> yep<00:03:49.560> yeah<00:03:49.860> that's<00:03:50.099> new

unit in there yep yeah that's new

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.040 
unit in there yep yeah that's new
satellite<00:03:51.120> reverb<00:03:51.360> I<00:03:51.420> think<00:03:51.600> Adams<00:03:51.840> going<00:03:51.959> to

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
satellite reverb I think Adams going to

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.540 
satellite reverb I think Adams going to
talk<00:03:52.170> about<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.440> yeah<00:03:52.920> look<00:03:53.130> for<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.430> other

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
clarity and all that and applied it to a

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.900 
clarity and all that and applied it to a
solid<00:04:26.570> body<00:04:26.780> as<00:04:27.110> a<00:04:27.139> drop<00:04:27.560> tuning<00:04:27.950> guitar<00:04:28.250> which

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
solid body as a drop tuning guitar which

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.640 
solid body as a drop tuning guitar which
really<00:04:29.300> worked<00:04:29.600> out<00:04:29.780> great<00:04:29.960> and<00:04:30.290> then<00:04:30.410> I<00:04:30.500> got

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
to make it a southern why not go the

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.060 
to make it a southern why not go the
full<00:04:39.139> tilt<00:04:39.440> and<00:04:39.680> do<00:04:39.800> it<00:04:39.919> as<00:04:40.040> a<00:04:40.070> multiscale

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
full tilt and do it as a multiscale

full tilt and do it as a multiscale
which<00:04:43.070> I<00:04:43.340> won't<00:04:43.580> make<00:04:43.669> Basin<00:04:44.030> play<00:04:44.180> because

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330

you<00:04:44.389> guys<00:04:44.510> are<00:04:44.660> busy<00:04:44.780> but<00:04:45.020> basically<00:04:45.860> it's<00:04:46.520> the

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
you guys are busy but basically it's the

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.090 
you guys are busy but basically it's the

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
same concept but as a 7th string it's 26

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.610 
same concept but as a 7th string it's 26
and<00:04:49.370> a<00:04:49.400> quarter<00:04:49.700> to<00:04:49.820> 27<00:04:50.540> so<00:04:51.169> it's<00:04:51.320> not<00:04:51.440> a<00:04:51.500> huge

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
and a quarter to 27 so it's not a huge

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.310 
and a quarter to 27 so it's not a huge
fan<00:04:52.130> it's<00:04:52.340> really<00:04:52.580> comfortable<00:04:53.139> doesn't<00:04:54.139> have
