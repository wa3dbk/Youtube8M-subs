00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.940
 hello people and now we will show how 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.540
 assemble gaming bye from the motherboard 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.540
 and mass 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.550
 This board I mass and dj 65 gaming 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.100
 so our first step is 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.540
 processor installation 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.730
 lift the lever on the side of the socket and 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.440
 lift the lid 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.010
 very carefully place the processor 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.530
 socket 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.010
 and close the holding frame finally 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.580
 remove the protective cover and ready let's 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.979
 install memory lower latches with 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.020
 both sides of the connector, insert the memory 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.540
 into the connectors and push the top while 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.850
 the latches do not lock make sure that 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.880
 latch holds memory with memory 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.880
 all now we need a gaming case 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.869
 insert the I / O connector panel 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.220
 press this body panel while it 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.800
 don't stick with a distinctive click 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.960
 take the motherboard and insert it 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.970
 in the case make sure the ports are on the back 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.920
 parts of the board converge with the installed 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.140
 the panel here is a 9 hole for mounting 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.000
 these them from the motherboard 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.520
 use screwdriver bolts to 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.810
 fasten all those bolts in the box with 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.150
 accessory housing 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.020
 do not tighten them too much because 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.049
 that the motherboard can be damaged now 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.840
 install the power supply firmly 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.710
 hold him he's heavy enough 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.049
 install the power supply in 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.299
 corresponding place of the body and pushing 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.310
 attach it in the back of the case 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.070
 four bolted and ready now 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.530
 connect the cable and power 8 pin 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.019
 process connector and 24 pin for 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.000
 motherboard 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.040
 Now we install the liquid system 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.170
 cooling all-in-one plug 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.970
 water system fan connector 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.690
 cooling to fan connector 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.580
 processor 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.910
 lower the water unit with the thermostat on 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.850
 cpu and screw it around 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.230
 socket 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.490
 make sure all screws are tight 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.050
 reliably enough 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.580
 to achieve maximum 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.650
 cooling efficiency 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.110
 install radiator with fan on 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.690
 back of the case so that the tubes 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.110
 cooling nothing touched attach 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.860
 radiator casing four bolts we all 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.490
 completed the installation of the cooling system 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.340
 now turn 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.440
 ssd drive and secure ssd to 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.360
 retainer connect esata 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.580
 cable and push the entire bay 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.920
 connect the power cable and turn 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.050
 to the next step we install 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.180
 video card 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.680
 squeeze the video card cautious and even 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.800
 write the first big plug 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.750
 express x16 make sure the video card 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.610
 the computer has fallen into place 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.740
 will start if the video card is not entered 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.630
 fully slot after close the case and 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.650
 connect all necessary cables to 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:29.680
 back panel bye 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:31.540
 and we all collected gaming bye for sure 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.240
 we also need gaming weapons 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.800
 eg keyboard mouse and headset 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.590
 now you can install the operating 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.590
 system and finally just play
