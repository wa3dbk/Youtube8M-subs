00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
think that they just a couple of

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.320 
think that they just a couple of
mistakes<00:01:16.280> very<00:01:17.280> unfortunate<00:01:18.000> about<00:01:18.180> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
mistakes very unfortunate about the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.600 
mistakes very unfortunate about the
penalty<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.840> sending-off<00:01:19.430> apart<00:01:20.430> from

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
penalty in the sending-off apart from

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.700 
penalty in the sending-off apart from
that<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:21.090> was<00:01:21.630> very<00:01:21.780> encouraged<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.380> other<00:01:22.530> ways

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
that I was very encouraged in other ways

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.020 
that I was very encouraged in other ways
simply<00:01:23.189> you've<00:01:23.280> learned<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.549> lot<00:01:23.670> against

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
Barcelona and I think they'll take that

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.609
