00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.780
In the southeast forest of Mexico, inhabit
the saraguatos monkeys, known also as black howler monkeys.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.210
It is an arboreal primate, less than the size
of a child of one age.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.220
With the help of their flexible tail, they
move easily through the canopy.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:37.700
The alpha male take care of the family, better known as troops, the females take care of the infants until one year old when they can leave by their own.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:48.200
The males defend their home ranges from other groups with howls that could be heard for more than 4 km of distance.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Sadly, the roads at the southeast of Mexico
have badly impacted the saraguato's habitat,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.300
Additional with the deforestation caused by
the farming and cattle activity.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.800
Causing the isolation of the monkeys.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:18.360
This entire situation has caused changes in the natural behavior of the species, locating them in higher risk of extinction.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:29.300
Examples of this impact are the roads of Villahermosa-Escarcega, at Tabasco and Chiapas.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.800
Where the road killing of saraguato's monkeys have been the worse impact registered during the creation of the road.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.000
More than 21 monkeys have been road killed
alongside the 9 km of the road.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:56.000
For many persons this could be irrelevant, but if we sum the mortality of the entire web of roads crossing the southeast of Mexico,
we surely are sending this species directly to the extinction.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.500
However, this is not all lost, the survivorship
of this species is in our hands.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We could built in a economically way, walking corridors up to the top of the trees, facilitating the flow of the arboreal fauna in a save way,connecting the tree top that are separated by the road.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.500
Roadsigns to recall the presence of the animals

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Other option could be to set corridors under
roads for other animals that are impacted.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.200
as well, signals and locate speed bump.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Please support the conservation of these primates when driving alongside the roads, specifically those near to the southeast of Mexico, reduce the speed and avoid killing the crossing animals.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Because this problem is our responsability!
