00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.220
Chapter 6: Maintain the underside of the ski or snowboard edge "Fallen from the edge"

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:11.560
To take care of the base edge is to keep it as smooth as possible.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.680
Damage such as rust, abrasions, scratches caused by stones

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.360
will greatly affect the maneuverability and precision of driving skis and snowboards.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.400
To avoid this, we propose sets called bevel Tuning set, composed of a double diamond file:

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.640
fine on one side for polishing and rough on the other side for grinding, and a bevel file guide

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.780
The guide allows for a small edge bevel angle (angle with respect to the ski base)

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.439
To polish the edge by keeping it flush with the ski base.

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:47.839
The universal bevel file guide angle is 1°

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.520
The angle is given by the thickness of the guide which leans against the ski base.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.360
Important, hold the guide perpendicular to the edge.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.940
A rotation of 25 ° is acceptable,

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.280
if more, the angle of bevel becomes larger than that indicated on the guide.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.240
Go back and forth movements.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.980
Regularly slide the file into the guide to prevent it from being worn in the same place.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.820
Once the damage has been cleaned, turn the file on the finishing side

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.800
and do another 5 to 6 back and forth movements to get a smoother edge.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:41.039
When the damage to the edge is greater, start with the diamond 120 for a quick grinding.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.280
If the edge protrudes a little from the ski base or is set back from the ski base,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.319
the diamond files will have trouble doing this job quickly enough

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:57.600
For this we have a file named extra hard Bevel file Race, inserted perpendicularly in a bar.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.340
This file is also used in the guide.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:15.039
File by pulling against yourself , with the Tooltonic sticker readable normally (not upside down).

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:23.220
On a scratched edge, avoid filing without pre sanding using the 120 or 200 diamond file.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.420
After filing polishing with diamonds 200 then 400 and possibly 800 diamonds

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.840
will increase the glide and handling of the skis and snowboard.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:42.760
File sliding from the back to the front of the ski or snowboard ! Contrary to what one could imagine, it results in a better glide on the snow.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.720
If there is a lot of damage to the edges or the base of the ski,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.740
the action of hand tools being limited,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:07.600
give your ski or snowboard to your sports store for a service in the robot machine.
