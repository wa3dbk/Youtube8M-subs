 let me live here because I asked 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.009
 it would not be good to behave peacefully 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.489
 'This house was from my late brother 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.729
 he built it to open a new york school and my family has received pos 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.729
 from one of the oldest traditional dance schools in Japan 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.750

 west of japan and his family and mine 

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:41.970
 we have kept our eyes for a long time 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.040
 but a few days after the wedding 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.640
 my brother had a car accident 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.560

 It will give me everything about the kitchen 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.680
 I lost my mother when I was only 11 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.770
 but I still remember the taste of his colleagues was a very good cook 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.630
 that's why after his death I decided to prepare all the food myself 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.410
