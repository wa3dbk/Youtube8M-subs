the next twenty fifty or even three

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.139 
the next twenty fifty or even three
hundred<00:00:48.170> years<00:00:48.469> it's<00:00:49.219> always<00:00:49.399> difficult<00:00:49.730> and

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
hundred years it's always difficult and

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.389 
hundred years it's always difficult and
someone<00:00:50.660> dangerous<00:00:50.840> to<00:00:51.559> predict<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.219> future

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
someone dangerous to predict the future

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.360 
someone dangerous to predict the future
but<00:00:52.850> I'm<00:00:53.690> reasonably<00:00:54.140> sure<00:00:54.230> then<00:00:55.070> in<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:55.250> next

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
but I'm reasonably sure then in the next

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.069 
but I'm reasonably sure then in the next
50<00:00:55.760> years<00:00:55.879> we're<00:00:56.149> going<00:00:56.300> to<00:00:56.390> go<00:00:56.539> back<00:00:56.750> to<00:00:56.989> the

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
50 years we're going to go back to the

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.619 
50 years we're going to go back to the
moon<00:00:57.289> we're<00:00:58.100> going<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:58.340> build<00:00:58.550> a<00:00:58.789> gigantic

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
moon we're going to build a gigantic

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.810 
moon we're going to build a gigantic
elevator<00:01:00.320> that<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:00.739> stretch<00:01:01.070> off<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:01.640> moon

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
elevator that the stretch off the moon

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.450 
elevator that the stretch off the moon
out<00:01:02.120> into<00:01:02.510> space<00:01:02.629> back<00:01:03.079> towards<00:01:03.500> Earth<00:01:03.679> that

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
out into space back towards Earth that

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.180 
out into space back towards Earth that
will<00:01:04.640> enable<00:01:04.850> us<00:01:05.150> to<00:01:05.230> travel<00:01:06.230> to<00:01:06.620> and<00:01:06.800> from<00:01:07.010> the

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
will enable us to travel to and from the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.010 
will enable us to travel to and from the
moon<00:01:07.370> or<00:01:07.550> most<00:01:07.730> of<00:01:07.910> the<00:01:08.000> way<00:01:08.120> there<00:01:08.150> without

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
moon or most of the way there without

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.050 
moon or most of the way there without
rockets<00:01:09.530> I<00:01:09.800> think<00:01:10.580> we're<00:01:10.700> going<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.880> build

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
rockets I think we're going to build

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.180 
rockets I think we're going to build
gigantic<00:01:11.720> telescopes<00:01:12.380> on<00:01:12.620> the<00:01:12.650> surface<00:01:13.100> of

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
gigantic telescopes on the surface of

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.670 
gigantic telescopes on the surface of
the<00:01:13.280> Moon<00:01:13.460> little<00:01:13.730> dwarf<00:01:14.210> inning<00:01:14.630> on<00:01:14.810> earth<00:01:15.410> or

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
the Moon little dwarf inning on earth or

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.860 
the Moon little dwarf inning on earth or
in<00:01:15.740> orbit<00:01:16.280> around<00:01:16.370> the<00:01:16.640> earth<00:01:16.820> that<00:01:17.060> let<00:01:17.780> us

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
in orbit around the earth that let us

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.050 
in orbit around the earth that let us
peer<00:01:18.290> back<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:19.130> right<00:01:19.400> after<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:19.850> Big<00:01:20.000> Bang

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
peer back to right after the Big Bang

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.080 
peer back to right after the Big Bang
and<00:01:20.660> I<00:01:21.530> think<00:01:21.770> we're<00:01:21.920> going<00:01:22.040> to<00:01:22.190> go<00:01:22.700> to<00:01:22.730> Mars

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
and I think we're going to go to Mars

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.470 
and I think we're going to go to Mars
and<00:01:23.480> face<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.560> very<00:01:24.950> difficult<00:01:25.460> question<00:01:25.490> do

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
and face the very difficult question do

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.350 
and face the very difficult question do
we<00:01:26.540> want<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.140> change<00:01:27.470> that<00:01:27.710> world<00:01:28.220> from<00:01:29.000> a<00:01:29.120> very

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
we want to change that world from a very

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.870 
we want to change that world from a very
barren<00:01:29.900> dry<00:01:30.230> desert-like<00:01:30.830> world<00:01:31.400> into<00:01:31.670> one

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
barren dry desert-like world into one

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.960 
barren dry desert-like world into one
where<00:01:32.540> human<00:01:32.840> beings<00:01:32.870> can<00:01:33.470> live<00:01:33.680> do<00:01:34.610> we<00:01:34.760> want

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
where human beings can live do we want

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.450 
where human beings can live do we want
to<00:01:35.030> terraform<00:01:35.750> Mars<00:01:36.100> but<00:01:37.100> that's<00:01:37.250> what<00:01:37.430> I

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
to terraform Mars but that's what I

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.310 
to terraform Mars but that's what I
think<00:01:37.820> is<00:01:37.910> going<00:01:38.090> to<00:01:38.180> happen<00:01:38.210> I<00:01:38.690> want<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.260> know
