something because I know yuyu hakusho

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.709 
something because I know yuyu hakusho
his<00:00:35.040> previous<00:00:35.489> work<00:00:35.670> had<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.270> same<00:00:36.480> opening

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
his previous work had the same opening

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.410 
his previous work had the same opening
song<00:00:37.500> for<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> entire<00:00:38.520> series<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.180> believe

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
song for the entire series but I believe

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.990 
song for the entire series but I believe
it<00:00:39.540> had<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> second<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.260> visual<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.430> maybe<00:00:41.760> that

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
it had a second of visual so maybe that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.430 
it had a second of visual so maybe that
could<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.420> reason<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.780> Yoshi<00:00:43.050> heroes

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
could be the reason you Yoshi heroes

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.470 
could be the reason you Yoshi heroes
behind<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.129> don't<00:00:44.460> exactly<00:00:44.700> know<00:00:45.030> but<00:00:45.059> um
