that's<00:02:47.639> pretty<00:02:47.790> incredible<00:02:49.730> this<00:02:50.730> thing's

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
that's pretty incredible this thing's

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.720 
that's pretty incredible this thing's
have<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.209> use<00:02:51.389> I<00:02:51.950> mean<00:02:52.950> if<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.159> wanted<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.579> for

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
have you use I mean if you wanted it for

that<00:02:53.909> now<00:02:54.569> Warren<00:02:54.959> Thomas<00:02:55.409> he<00:02:55.530> designs<00:02:57.290> edged

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
that now Warren Thomas he designs edged

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.520 
that now Warren Thomas he designs edged
weapons<00:02:59.329> and<00:03:00.329> there's<00:03:00.480> no<00:03:00.599> sugar<00:03:00.840> coating<00:03:01.319> of

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
weapons and there's no sugar coating of

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.149 
weapons and there's no sugar coating of
that<00:03:02.099> so<00:03:02.790> these<00:03:02.939> are<00:03:03.120> great<00:03:03.359> for<00:03:04.319> cutting<00:03:04.590> any

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419 
of damage to flesh so let's move on here

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.030 
of damage to flesh so let's move on here
we've<00:03:15.930> got<00:03:15.989> a<00:03:16.049> thumb<00:03:16.319> ramp<00:03:16.590> here<00:03:16.829> that<00:03:16.980> you

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
we've got a thumb ramp here that you

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.520 
we've got a thumb ramp here that you
could<00:03:17.159> use<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.340> open<00:03:17.699> it<00:03:17.790> with<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.530> that'll

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
could use to open it with and that'll

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.680 
could use to open it with and that'll
work<00:03:19.560> with<00:03:19.829> gloved<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.940> know<00:03:21.060> hands<00:03:21.540> there's

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
work with gloved you know hands there's

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.449 
work with gloved you know hands there's
no<00:03:21.810> problem<00:03:22.229> you<00:03:22.349> get<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.500> little<00:03:22.709> thumb<00:03:22.979> oval

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459

no problem you get a little thumb oval
here<00:03:23.639> works<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.150> same<00:03:24.329> way<00:03:24.569> so<00:03:24.889> either<00:03:25.889> method

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
here works the same way so either method

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.309 
here works the same way so either method
is<00:03:26.370> good<00:03:26.519> for<00:03:26.699> opening<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.090> slowly<00:03:27.299> let<00:03:28.290> the

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
is good for opening and slowly let the

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.990 
is good for opening and slowly let the
whole<00:03:28.650> bowl<00:03:28.799> you<00:03:28.979> could<00:03:29.129> use<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.609> open<00:03:29.790> it
