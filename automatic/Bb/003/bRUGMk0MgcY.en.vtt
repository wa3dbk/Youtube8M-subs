00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.429
I'm Linsday Bjerregaard I'm Stephen Markley

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:06.980
and what is wrong with you you look like
hell

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.000
Lindsay I was  busting my ass all week covering the LA Auto Show

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.370
no you weren't you didn't go to LA you were in
the office all week playing snude on your

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.110
computer

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.410
hero no I'm not a hero I'm just a 
hardworking journalist doing my job

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.410
so sit back and buckly up you're watching
cars cast weekly

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.700
we can't cover every car that was out in
LA for that check out our coverage it

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.399
kicking tires and cars that come

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.989
but we can give you a peek at some of
our favorites first up the mazda3

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.870
a compact car has proven to be monsters
most popular vehicle worldwide

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.300
the redesign 2009 model ups for this
power and fuel economy

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.210
no easy feat why should maintain
supremacy over competitors like a Toyota

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.790
Corolla

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.909
when it comes to fun economy cars the
mother is mild still comes in five to

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:04.390
six miles per gallon less

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.890
the question is how much will this
matter to potential buyers

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.520
well for may be in trouble during this
economic downturn they certainly haven't

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.310
backed down in LA with the 2010 Ford
Fusion

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.770
the only fusion only got a makeover but
improve fuel economy

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.470
potentially ran to 34 miles per gallon
on the highway what should I do both

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.390
Toyota Camry and Honda Accord

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.409
inside a new blind spot detection system
will alert drivers on the highway and

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.170
look back at apartment spots

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.479
well and every mention there's also a
hybrid version finally what about the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.110
ridiculous the poorly designed to:
thought-out

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.140
like that then your face that some might
call facial hair

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.250
actually when the I was praying to the
Honda FC sport concept the hydrogen fuel

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.090
cell vehicle

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.770
the SE Sport reminds the low to the
ground design a sports car with the

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.710
cockpit they can only see three people

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.600
add to that a rear and protrusion
reminiscent of a balanced posterior

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.689
yeah designed to make my facial hair
look well developed in here

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:03.689
speaking a bad jokes here's healthy take
on the Kia Soul and I could've the week

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.270

your soul for love

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.660

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.630
