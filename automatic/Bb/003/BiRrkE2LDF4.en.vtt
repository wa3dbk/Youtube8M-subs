00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.160 
myself but I'm pretty excited so we're
just<00:00:20.609> spawn<00:00:20.910> some<00:00:21.090> bodyguards<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.779> then

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
just spawn some bodyguards and then

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.200 
just spawn some bodyguards and then
shoot<00:00:22.740> some<00:00:22.890> people<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.430> then<00:00:23.910> see<00:00:24.119> if

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
can't confirm that you can't spawn more

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:50.340 
can't confirm that you can't spawn more
than<00:01:47.289> one<00:01:47.619> group<00:01:47.950> but<00:01:48.819> if<00:01:49.270> one<00:01:49.569> were<00:01:49.719> to<00:01:49.780> die<00:01:50.079> if

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
than one group but if one were to die if

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.230 
than one group but if one were to die if
I<00:01:50.439> hit<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.679> spawn<00:01:51.009> he<00:01:51.310> it'll<00:01:51.549> it'll<00:01:51.850> replace

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.559 
on so this is pretty neat now I did hear
it's<00:01:57.399> pretty<00:01:57.459> buggy<00:01:57.819> and<00:01:58.030> it<00:01:58.149> could<00:01:58.270> crash

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
it's pretty buggy and it could crash
