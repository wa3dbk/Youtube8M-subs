mahal calm and now let's simplify our

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.450 
mahal calm and now let's simplify our
motherboard<00:00:07.259> but<00:00:07.379> talking<00:00:07.620> about<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:07.980> PCI

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
motherboard but talking about the PCI

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.060 
motherboard but talking about the PCI
expansion<00:00:08.849> slots<00:00:09.300> we<00:00:09.420> have<00:00:09.599> now<00:00:09.929> those<00:00:10.830> are

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
expansion slots we have now those are

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.520 
expansion slots we have now those are
right<00:00:11.490> here<00:00:11.700> on<00:00:11.820> our<00:00:11.910> motherboard<00:00:12.330> we<00:00:13.320> have

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
right here on our motherboard we have

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.599 
right here on our motherboard we have
PCI<00:00:14.070> PCI<00:00:14.460> PCI<00:00:15.389> e<00:00:16.230> 16<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.430> PCI<00:00:17.940> Express<00:00:18.740> now<00:00:19.740> how

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
PCI PCI PCI e 16 and PCI Express now how

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.040 
PCI PCI PCI e 16 and PCI Express now how
I<00:00:20.640> can<00:00:20.730> tell<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.330> simply<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.660> written

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
I can tell that is simply the written

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.410 
I can tell that is simply the written
right<00:00:22.170> here<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> motherboard<00:00:22.920> now<00:00:23.420> what

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
right here on the motherboard now what

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.500 
right here on the motherboard now what
this<00:00:24.570> means<00:00:24.630> with<00:00:25.170> one<00:00:25.830> PCI<00:00:26.250> 16<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.000> not

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
this means with one PCI 16 and not

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.509 
this means with one PCI 16 and not
another<00:00:27.810> one<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.800> can<00:00:29.099> only<00:00:29.189> run<00:00:29.460> one

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
another one is that can only run one

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.160 
another one is that can only run one
video<00:00:30.269> card<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.570> can't<00:00:30.779> run<00:00:30.929> two

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
video card I can't run two

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.340 
video card I can't run two
simultaneously<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.870> why<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.899> would<00:00:34.170> need<00:00:34.320> a

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
simultaneously and why I would need a

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.760 
simultaneously and why I would need a
PCI<00:00:34.800> 16<00:00:35.399> 4<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.730> because<00:00:36.260> what<00:00:37.260> we<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.530> is

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
PCI 16 4 that is because what we have is

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.100 
PCI 16 4 that is because what we have is
our<00:00:38.040> fastest<00:00:38.790> slot<00:00:39.120> for<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> card

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
our fastest slot for a card

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.000 
our fastest slot for a card
the<00:00:40.500> pci-e<00:00:41.250> 16<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.719> second<00:00:43.079> fastest<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.620> PCIe

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
the pci-e 16 the second fastest the PCIe

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.970 
the pci-e 16 the second fastest the PCIe
and<00:00:44.340> then<00:00:44.700> our<00:00:44.940> standard<00:00:45.180> PCI<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.829> might

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
and then our standard PCI so you might

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.740 
and then our standard PCI so you might
plug<00:00:47.219> something<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.640> like<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.820> modem<00:00:48.329> right

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
plug something in like a modem right

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.630 
plug something in like a modem right
here<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.200> then<00:00:49.410> maybe<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.920> sound<00:00:50.250> card<00:00:50.399> right

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
here and then maybe a sound card right

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.430 
here and then maybe a sound card right
here<00:00:50.910> but<00:00:51.210> you'd<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.539> video<00:00:51.930> card<00:00:52.170> here

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
here but you'd have a video card here

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.889 
here but you'd have a video card here
maybe<00:00:53.190> another<00:00:53.550> component<00:00:54.059> right<00:00:54.149> here<00:00:54.210> let's

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
maybe another component right here let's

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.959 
maybe another component right here let's
say<00:00:55.170> I'll<00:00:55.890> show<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.250> how<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.399> plug<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:56.730> stuff

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
say I'll show you how to plug this stuff

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.040 
say I'll show you how to plug this stuff
in<00:00:57.620> now<00:00:58.670> for<00:00:59.670> your<00:00:59.760> PCI<00:01:00.090> you'll<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> card

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
in now for your PCI you'll have a card

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.429 
in now for your PCI you'll have a card
will<00:01:01.350> look<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:02.480> simply<00:01:03.480> grooves<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.350> it

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
will look like this simply grooves in it

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.740 
will look like this simply grooves in it
and<00:01:05.369> then<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.820> plug<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.299> guy<00:01:06.510> in

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.850 

just<00:01:09.380> rest<00:01:09.800> right<00:01:10.130> on<00:01:10.280> there<00:01:11.470> now<00:01:12.470> wiggle<00:01:12.770> it

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
just rest right on there now wiggle it

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.520 
just rest right on there now wiggle it
down<00:01:13.450> being<00:01:14.450> this<00:01:14.630> guy<00:01:14.840> being<00:01:15.230> this<00:01:15.410> is<00:01:15.500> a

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
down being this guy being this is a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.710 
down being this guy being this is a
video<00:01:15.830> card<00:01:16.040> they'll<00:01:16.820> actually<00:01:17.000> lock<00:01:17.390> in<00:01:17.570> with

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
video card they'll actually lock in with

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.469 
video card they'll actually lock in with
his<00:01:17.840> tab<00:01:18.050> in<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.260> back<00:01:18.410> and<00:01:19.300> that's<00:01:20.300> how<00:01:20.390> you

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
his tab in the back and that's how you

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.380 
his tab in the back and that's how you
install<00:01:20.750> something<00:01:21.020> with<00:01:21.290> a<00:01:21.320> PCI<00:01:21.770> slot<00:01:22.390> there

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
install something with a PCI slot there

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.940 
install something with a PCI slot there
you<00:01:23.479> go<00:01:23.600> guys<00:01:23.750> that's<00:01:23.810> all<00:01:24.260> these<00:01:24.530> things<00:01:24.770> are

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
you go guys that's all these things are

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.950 
you go guys that's all these things are
and<00:01:25.100> you're<00:01:25.190> on<00:01:25.490> your<00:01:25.520> motherboard<00:01:25.880> PCI<00:01:26.600> slots

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
and you're on your motherboard PCI slots

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.050 
and you're on your motherboard PCI slots
and<00:01:27.229> sometimes<00:01:28.160> older<00:01:28.520> motherboards<00:01:28.820> you

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
and sometimes older motherboards you

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.820 
and sometimes older motherboards you
might<00:01:29.210> see<00:01:29.360> things<00:01:29.570> like<00:01:29.660> AGP<00:01:30.410> which<00:01:30.650> will

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
might see things like AGP which will

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.790 
might see things like AGP which will
look<00:01:30.979> very<00:01:31.010> similar<00:01:31.430> to<00:01:31.880> that<00:01:31.970> pcie<00:01:32.570> express

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
look very similar to that pcie express

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.870 
look very similar to that pcie express
16<00:01:33.800> and<00:01:34.630> maybe<00:01:35.630> is<00:01:36.500> a<00:01:36.710> if<00:01:37.010> you<00:01:37.100> see<00:01:37.280> an<00:01:37.340> ISA

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
16 and maybe is a if you see an ISA

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.370 
16 and maybe is a if you see an ISA
