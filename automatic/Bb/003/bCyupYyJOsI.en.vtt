00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
that's 1/2 the spider what's the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.610 
that's 1/2 the spider what's the
fraction<00:02:06.340> 1/4<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:07.670> mean<00:02:08.119> 4<00:02:08.649> 4<00:02:09.649> 8<00:02:09.770> is<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.340> same<00:02:10.789> as

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
fraction 1/4 I mean 4 4 8 is the same as

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:27.640 
fraction 1/4 I mean 4 4 8 is the same as
1/2<00:02:12.620> good<00:02:13.130> all<00:02:13.700> right<00:02:13.970> try<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.300> clock<00:02:14.600> now

okay so that's one paw right show me the
legs<00:02:59.989> of<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.260> ant<00:03:00.500> now<00:03:07.180> you're<00:03:08.180> ready<00:03:08.420> you

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
legs of the ant now you're ready you

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.900 
legs of the ant now you're ready you
can't<00:03:08.900> do<00:03:09.110> it<00:03:09.290> you<00:03:09.620> can't<00:03:09.650> have<00:03:10.069> 1/4<00:03:10.459> of<00:03:10.700> an<00:03:10.790> e

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
can't do it you can't have 1/4 of an e

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.500 
can't do it you can't have 1/4 of an e
okay<00:03:11.810> let's<00:03:12.769> try<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.099> spider<00:03:13.549> can<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:14.269> shade

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
okay let's try the spider can you shade

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.120 
okay let's try the spider can you shade
if<00:03:14.690> 1/4<00:03:15.349> of<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.680> spider

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
if 1/4 of the spider

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:24.699 
if 1/4 of the spider
yes<00:03:22.180> how<00:03:23.180> many<00:03:23.330> legs<00:03:23.569> did<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:24.049> shade<00:03:24.380> of<00:03:24.590> the

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.479 
spider two eighths that's the same as
nice<00:03:35.209> job<00:03:35.540> how<00:03:36.140> about<00:03:36.320> the<00:03:36.530> clock<00:03:36.799> can<00:03:37.340> you

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
nice job how about the clock can you

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:47.160 
nice job how about the clock can you
shade<00:03:38.500> 1/4<00:03:39.500> or<00:03:39.859> 1/4<00:03:40.579> of<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.850> clock<00:03:41.260> yes

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:04:03.940

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
what's 1/4 of the clock 3:12 nice job ok

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.920 
what's 1/4 of the clock 3:12 nice job ok
Doug<00:04:04.160> let's<00:04:04.730> find<00:04:05.030> some<00:04:05.269> equivalent

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.610 
other fraction 1/6 how many legs are
shaded<00:06:22.640> 1/6<00:06:23.640> okay<00:06:24.420> that<00:06:24.930> didn't<00:06:25.230> even<00:06:25.350> need<00:06:25.560> to

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
shaded 1/6 okay that didn't even need to

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.460 
shaded 1/6 okay that didn't even need to
be<00:06:25.770> renamed<00:06:26.250> but<00:06:26.580> we'll<00:06:26.700> keep<00:06:26.880> it<00:06:27.060> as<00:06:27.270> 1/6<00:06:28.200> to

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
be renamed but we'll keep it as 1/6 to

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.830 
be renamed but we'll keep it as 1/6 to
represent<00:06:28.980> one<00:06:29.190> leg<00:06:31.520> ok<00:06:32.520> can<00:06:32.850> you<00:06:32.880> add<00:06:33.270> those

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
represent one leg ok can you add those

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:40.910 
represent one leg ok can you add those
two<00:06:34.110> fractions<00:06:34.350> now<00:06:35.600> yes<00:06:37.010> for<00:06:38.210> 6<00:06:39.380> ok<00:06:40.380> so<00:06:40.710> that's

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920 
two fractions now yes for 6 ok so that's

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.580

so<00:07:26.550> pick<00:07:26.790> out<00:07:26.910> the<00:07:27.090> two<00:07:27.270> cards<00:07:27.540> you<00:07:27.720> need<00:07:27.900> 1/2

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380 
so pick out the two cards you need 1/2

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.640 
so pick out the two cards you need 1/2
and<00:07:28.710> 1/3

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:32.650 

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.400 

okay<00:07:33.610> now<00:07:34.030> over<00:07:34.270> let's<00:07:34.660> rename<00:07:35.080> those

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:35.410 
okay now over let's rename those

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.740 
okay now over let's rename those
fractions<00:07:36.040> let's<00:07:36.550> do<00:07:36.790> the<00:07:36.910> math<00:07:37.090> part

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:37.750 
fractions let's do the math part

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.370 
fractions let's do the math part
so<00:07:38.440> let's<00:07:38.710> rename<00:07:39.160> one<00:07:39.220> half<00:07:39.729> in<00:07:40.030> terms<00:07:40.419> of<00:07:40.690> ant

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:41.380 
so let's rename one half in terms of ant

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:49.050 
so let's rename one half in terms of ant
legs<00:07:42.150> three<00:07:44.010> sixths<00:07:47.760> okay<00:07:48.760> and<00:07:48.880> what<00:07:49.030> about

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:49.060 
legs three sixths okay and what about

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:59.520 
legs three sixths okay and what about
1/3<00:07:51.540> 2/6<00:07:52.540> okay<00:07:57.479> can<00:07:58.479> you<00:07:58.570> add<00:07:58.780> those<00:07:59.320> two

00:07:59.520 --> 00:07:59.530 
1/3 2/6 okay can you add those two

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.650 
1/3 2/6 okay can you add those two
fractions<00:07:59.770> now<00:08:00.250> and<00:08:00.550> tell<00:08:00.970> me<00:08:01.120> how<00:08:01.240> many<00:08:01.300> legs

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:01.660 
fractions now and tell me how many legs

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.390 
fractions now and tell me how many legs
you'll<00:08:01.870> have<00:08:02.080> yes

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400 

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:10.590 

five<00:08:06.479> six<00:08:07.590> good
