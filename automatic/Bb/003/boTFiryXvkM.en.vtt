00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
now this to me barely crosses that line

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
now this to me barely crosses that line
between<00:00:50.110> like<00:00:50.530> a<00:00:50.559> bright<00:00:51.100> vivid<00:00:51.670> medium<00:00:52.539> blue

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
between like a bright vivid medium blue

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.619 
between like a bright vivid medium blue
based<00:00:53.379> pink<00:00:53.860> and<00:00:54.129> fuchsia<00:00:54.760> and<00:00:55.030> kind<00:00:55.300> of<00:00:55.390> where

based pink and fuchsia and kind of where

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.470 
based pink and fuchsia and kind of where
that<00:00:55.780> line<00:00:56.079> goes<00:00:56.469> is<00:00:56.980> you<00:00:57.820> know<00:00:57.910> exactly<00:00:58.329> how

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
that line goes is you know exactly how

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.110 
that line goes is you know exactly how
purple<00:00:58.930> it<00:00:59.079> is<00:00:59.170> versus<00:00:59.770> a<00:01:00.039> blue<00:01:00.399> undertone<00:01:00.460> and

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
purple it is versus a blue undertone and

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.910 
purple it is versus a blue undertone and
I<00:01:01.570> don't<00:01:01.750> know<00:01:01.809> fully<00:01:02.020> how<00:01:02.230> to<00:01:02.289> describe<00:01:02.649> a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
I don't know fully how to describe a

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.130 
I don't know fully how to describe a
blue<00:01:03.100> undertone<00:01:03.360> versus<00:01:04.360> a<00:01:04.390> purple<00:01:04.750> undertone

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
blue undertone versus a purple undertone

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.990 
blue undertone versus a purple undertone
because<00:01:05.440> you<00:01:05.530> get<00:01:05.619> it<00:01:05.800> in<00:01:05.979> reds<00:01:06.460> and<00:01:06.670> pinks

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
because you get it in reds and pinks

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.450 
because you get it in reds and pinks
both<00:01:07.210> but<00:01:08.080> I<00:01:08.110> kind<00:01:08.439> of<00:01:08.500> know<00:01:08.740> it<00:01:08.890> when<00:01:09.040> I<00:01:09.070> see<00:01:09.159> it

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
both but I kind of know it when I see it

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.280 
both but I kind of know it when I see it
if<00:01:09.640> that<00:01:09.760> makes<00:01:09.820> any<00:01:10.060> sense<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:13.140> part<00:01:14.140> of<00:01:14.170> the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
if that makes any sense and part of the

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.940 
if that makes any sense and part of the
reason<00:01:14.320> why<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:14.650> had<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:14.979> have<00:01:15.280> it<00:01:15.310> is<00:01:16.710> they<00:01:17.710> have

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
reason why I had to have it is they have

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
reason why I had to have it is they have
just<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.820> cutest<00:01:19.150> package<00:01:19.689> and<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:21.640> spent

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
just the cutest package and this spent

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.870 
just the cutest package and this spent
such<00:01:22.240> a<00:01:22.360> trend<00:01:22.659> this<00:01:22.900> year<00:01:23.369> maybe<00:01:24.369> last<00:01:24.610> year

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
such a trend this year maybe last year

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.700 
such a trend this year maybe last year
too<00:01:25.030> but<00:01:25.270> I<00:01:25.299> feel<00:01:25.540> like<00:01:25.570> it's<00:01:25.810> intensifying

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
too but I feel like it's intensifying

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.770 
too but I feel like it's intensifying
every<00:01:27.159> month<00:01:27.400> where<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.150> packaging<00:01:28.630> they're

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
every month where the packaging they're

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.340 
every month where the packaging they're
just<00:01:28.960> upping<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.500> ante<00:01:29.890> like<00:01:31.079> constantly<00:01:32.079> so

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
just upping the ante like constantly so

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.999 
if you're into the really gorgeous
packaging<00:01:33.790> it's<00:01:34.240> getting<00:01:34.479> harder<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:34.840> harder

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
packaging it's getting harder and harder

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.270 
packaging it's getting harder and harder
to<00:01:36.009> say<00:01:36.220> no<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.540> ridiculously<00:01:37.540> expensive<00:01:38.280> so

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
absolutely have to have right so this is

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.410 
absolutely have to have right so this is
the<00:01:44.950> case<00:01:45.310> when<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:45.520> open<00:01:45.759> houses<00:01:46.030> you<00:01:46.270> want

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
the case when you open houses you want

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.539 
the case when you open houses you want
you<00:01:46.570> written<00:01:46.780> there<00:01:46.930> and<00:01:47.259> then<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.159> lipstick

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
you written there and then the lipstick

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.280 
you written there and then the lipstick
twists<00:01:48.970> up<00:01:49.090> like<00:01:49.329> the<00:01:49.450> normal<00:01:49.630> so<00:01:50.110> this<00:01:50.259> is

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
twists up like the normal so this is

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.719

really don't smell there's like maybe a

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.499 
really don't smell there's like maybe a
tiny<00:01:56.500> tiny<00:01:56.890> sent<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:57.520> it<00:01:57.640> but<00:01:57.850> not<00:01:58.060> much<00:01:58.600> and

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
tiny tiny sent to it but not much and

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.450 
tiny tiny sent to it but not much and
this<00:02:01.509> is<00:02:01.630> what<00:02:01.750> it<00:02:01.840> looks<00:02:01.990> like<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:03.189> the<00:02:03.310> other

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
this is what it looks like so the other

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.359 
this is what it looks like so the other
reason<00:02:03.700> why<00:02:03.790> I<00:02:03.820> had<00:02:03.969> to<00:02:04.060> have<00:02:04.180> it<00:02:04.210> besides

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
reason why I had to have it besides

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.639
