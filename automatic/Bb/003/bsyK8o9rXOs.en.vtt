00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.680
 two army on the right pressed 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.870
 and the device goes up here is the 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.500
 all already here, the full name, we 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.820
 here have an outdoor device dustproof 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.560
 waterproof 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.279
 maybe a competition of the new one 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.230
 sony devices sony follows sony sony set 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.730
 you have probably already seen in 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.890
 some tests if you are with the 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.619
 you gets set apart, too 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.050
 this water and dustproof but not 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.339
 like this one has in other tests here 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.470
 I also saw that with the whole 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:41.080
 dust macho was further thrown 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.900
 or was poured and there is nothing 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.120
 happens once to the display we have 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.699
 four inches in the diagonal are the 10th 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.070
 16 centimeters we have only one here 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.530
 800 x 480 pixel resolution 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.080
 that's not the best now 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.500
 we have android jelly bean and a 1 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:02.790
 gigahertz dualcore processor cortex a9 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.350
 is that and you have a gigabyte 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.540
 Memory as the whole is one 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.299
 Looks like we're looking at it all the time 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.469
 You can unlock the test once 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:16.829
 so just make and unlock over 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:20.890
 delete the screen and you are 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:23.979
 on the homescreen it looks like this 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.149
 3d animated at the beginning of the group notes 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.560
 you 're just reloading everything 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.119
 later not all company realizes and 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.719
 slight jerking is present 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.969

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.799
 Phone keypad protocols avoided 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:53.200
 you have contact here 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.630
 then you have contacts 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.009
 Here you can see one 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.390
 possibility we with the contacts 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.990
 can bypass to the right 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.210

 can shift so long on it 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.269
 pressed and then you move that 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.939
 her back and forth 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.560
 but what you can see is the menu 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:32.450
 right there that could not move 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.819
 what does it somehow know that yes 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.420
 from the middle of other devices 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.269
 every case 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.409
 So we have such apps on it 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:43.549
 Cardio trainers are already pre-installed 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:47.359

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.669

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.019
 then we have these three here 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:47.000
 I already have physical buttons 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.560

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.760

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.190
 we on the homescreen then you can 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.169
 the homescreen work longer on it 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.000

 location your emails you scanned 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.000
 So everything has become possible 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:04.310

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:11.120
 you come back to your homescreen 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.310
 fixed homescreen how did you do that 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.799
 set here with the blue house per 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.340
 pinch to zoom so once moved up 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.720
 let's go there 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.150
 long pressed on it and you are at 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.050
 Taskmanager you can between yer 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.330
 jump open an app respectively 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.370
 wipe them off so fast 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.380
 does that say again pressed on it 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.130
 then you and humans can come here 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:37.430
 you too accurate and here to an active one 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.750
 Applications for this relapse brings you 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.610
 always back where you are 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.810
 then we have a notification bar of 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.780
 pulled down here 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.780
 notifications 6 update possible like that 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.430
 and you have more short cuts too 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.930
 I do not need to go any further 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.930
 have received it almost meanwhile 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.760
 So actually every android gets so 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.919
 What else is striking when we are here 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.490
 in apps are and on the home button 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.800
 to press 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.990
 Do you see that his little delays 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.350
 it takes a whole bit to complete 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.690
 I press on it now only pack like that 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.520
 I press it and now that's it 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.530
 I think it's a bit slow 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.449
 you know faster from other devices 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.280
 even if we do a gigahertz here 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.169
 have co I expect actually that the 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.729
 a bit faster so there must be 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.950
 maybe you cut that down a bit 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.870
 make how fast the device is at all 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.630
 you can tell that already here 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.440
 not quite like that anymore 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.090
 hesitant here while wiping 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.669
 You see, I already said nice 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.380
 3d animated so we write my 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.660
 message look like the keyboard is 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.889
 pressed on it to add receiver 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.419
 then write the message 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:44.750
 hello as I am behind the 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:47.180
 camera and actually deepen me 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.190
 How are you ? 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.169
 Of course, that makes me wrong 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.240
 works well here autocorrect 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.110
 add attachments 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.500
 then you have the opportunity 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:00.410
 add special characters to language 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.270
 change qwerty keyboard in the extend 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.849
 landscape mode has the size buttons 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.380
 Of course, it's easier to go here 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.880
 pressed on it and then you have here 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.420
 the possibility of different input 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:14.440
 format to select Hello 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:19.500
 what are you doing today? 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:24.960
 later that would be very nice 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:29.650
 So I have you already this input 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:34.390
 shown more often and she works great 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:36.280
 I think so pressed 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.560
 So it's good to write 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.320
 works great does not find the 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.770
 keyboard is very sensitive and very responsive 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.390
 good no delay and you have to 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.310
 do not pay attention where you go 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:50.830
 typed the languages ​​were natural 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.450
 always totally great make time short 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.800
 a call was here on favorites 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.590
 not what you like the track to that 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:59.290

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:01.290
 and how are seen in the on mode as roses 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:04.930
 the speaker on 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:07.510
 then you have to add hannover here 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.410
 keyboard view when storm headset 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.870
 turn on 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:13.300
 that's how it looks like you can of course 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.160
 continue to telephone and you in the menu 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.220
 move around let's go briefly 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.780
