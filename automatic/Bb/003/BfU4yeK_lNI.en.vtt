 hello yourself top gear magazine 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.630
 Russian edition on the back of the car 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:13.280
 Formula 1 team lotus wine and we are with you 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.280
 on the flight program 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.360
 the most interesting thing is that in my place on 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.550
 the place of the person who is now sitting in 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.670
 this car and the project two laps on traffic 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.410
 ring hangar 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.340
 a full day of training may be 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:34.420
 every one of you in the morning stood out 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:38.790
 Bodrum but I understood immediately 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.790
 came at servo thorium or still good 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.280
 so that I fully feel myself in 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.290
 Vitaly Petrov's shoes 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.150
 at first they made me dance to 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.170
 a bank and then this caring woman 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.170
 tried to tear the bliss 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.160
 constantly scarecrow near future 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.590
 this cute woman told me a lot 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.140
 new my old sores 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.939
 had a wonderful time however came 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.710
 time to do more serious 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.200
 workouts more like 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:33.119
 car for five minutes we were taught 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:35.250
 manage the formula and be by that moment 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.500
 we already knew enough to go on 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.939
 Start Grand Prix Formula 1 for all the same 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.149
 gave a little practice behind the wheel 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.939
 two-liter children's formulas under their feet 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.310
 size forty-five having problems in 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.110
 close cockpit but faster than this 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.420
 little cuttlefish with wings and 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.219
 sequential gearbox I do not see 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.780
 cornering never program clients 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.439
 only show how it works 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.049
 telemetry 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.379
 but the walkie-talkies explain that with all this 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.360
 do and each of us can see 

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:08.879
 own mistakes in comparison 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.590
 his circle with the pilot test circle 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.230
 Formula 1 of the town of Gorodan 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.520
 here is my real telemetry after the race 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.370
 on the two-liter renova formula 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.060
 blue graph of the speed of the novel 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.490
 my red however that you do not get up 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.180
 driving a two-liter car formula 1 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.120
 absolutely every pilot will be planted 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.610
 these are genuine cars up to 10 years they 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.470
 already under the order were spread however it 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:44.740
 present formula 1 with present in 10 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:47.140
 goodness of course 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.900
 700 horsepower there is not left but how 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.730
 showed telemetry after the races our 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.920
 the cut-off was at eleven thousand 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.320
 rpm 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.510
 but believe it is done for your 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.490
 same good for a man without real 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.070
 professional racing experience is 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.530
 higher the higher the roof and judging by the sounds 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.600
 who spread over the circuit from 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.170
 Very few customers even reached 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.030
 our 11 thousandth cut-off procedure 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.710
 start quite complex we rehearsed 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.660
 and separately and even for our convenience 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.820
 the clutch pedal was made exactly in 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.900
 pedal in the cockpit to move 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.900
 the whole thing 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.010
 all that you do when you start to go 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.360
 on formula 1 in the air race program you 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.460
 doing focusing on this 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.470
 uncle who shows you such 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.110
 keep the pace that deal with the pedal 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.320
 clutch and when you can add 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.320
 gas 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.670
 and 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.200
 just two circles two circles of happiness for 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.540
 driving a bolida of formula 1 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.340
 of course the very first turn I 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.620
 tried to attack as much as I can 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.079
 you feel this car very accurately 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.970
 practically with your fingertips and go out to 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.980
 limit actually for prepared 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.360
 even the body pilot turned 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.550
 not difficult at all 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.159
 at each new turn you pass with 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.960
 a big buzz with more confidence you 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:33.689
 feel the tires start to work and 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.110
 you get used to the behavior you're big 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:38.420
 formula with motor v10 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.270
 indescribable feeling 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.980
 at that moment when I was preparing to break free 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.690
 directly start-finish and dial your 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.040
 maximum on this machine 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.040
 I was driven for some reason 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.800
 dmitry 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:04.129
 when you drive and not in real time 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.129
 watching our telemetry 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.120
 arabella 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:26.270
 the horse has 1 limit to 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:26.270
 the goal you escaped the true auto 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.660
 and pounded me to make sure 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.580
 what am i in my mind 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.940
 just none of the customers so fast 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.070
 repairing where they can be understood right under us 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.910
 1 cars badly broken 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.729
 she now I went 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.440
 as fast as I can 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.620
 and especially I tried 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.970
 ahead blind left over the hill 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.570
 the only interesting twist on 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.570
 Hungaroring track 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.040
 now you can rate with which 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.110
 speed need to respond if you 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.540
 suffered driving a car of formula 1 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.280
 image is now slowed down more than 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.960
 10 times 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.030
 if the driver laughed behind the wheel 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.680
 Formula 1 at least a few hundredths 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.680
 seconds will catch anything 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.260
 however, so we finally met 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.260
 with car 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:25.009
 impossible to put into words crazy here 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:28.789
 the buzz that a person experiences 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:31.759
 is driving a car of formula 1 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:33.349
 inside the carbon monocoque is one of 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.690
 the fastest cars in the world 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:38.419
 when the real one pushes him in the back 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:42.169
 racing engine new 10 perfect 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:44.690
 I don't know if I'm crazy 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:48.139
 still sometime behind the wheel but i 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:51.819
 I know for sure that this sound I will not forget 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:51.819
 never before the end of my days 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.250
 they 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:07.480
 so a farce or conservatory and even 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.480
 other 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.400
 yes you can just have fun 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:14.650
 sit behind the wheel of formula 1 if you 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.300
 I can afford such a trip 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:20.120
 but here you can get those 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.260
 unforgettable feelings from those that you 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.229
 given to experience 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.820
 for all your car life because 

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:28.570
 if for a professional pilot 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.960
 winning in formula 1 is the limit of desires 

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.930
 then for 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.949
 amateur pilot to be behind the wheel 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.449
 Formula 1 car 

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:37.449
 pleasure limit
