00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.450
 they love shooting games and in 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.390
 how much do they tell me about one of those 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.130
 immediately another thing catches my attention 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.530
 is that I do not notice the graphics 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.860
 but in the history and gameplay of 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.740
 she that foot foot game your favorite 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.050
 and it's not worth saying that it's virtual sex 2 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.400
 because we all like that game 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.310
 hahaha XD 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.070
 it is not clear that it is not the game it came played 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.050
 but then it is not so much a videogame 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.350
 favorite of feet and is resistant 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.900
 retribution a great game of 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.890
 shots without paranormal beings as well as 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.730
 of alien monsters so what's 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.670
 try the game 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.590
 I say explain a little about your 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.650
 story that you think we are 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.840
 soothsayers to know what it is about 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.450
 this game does not come out we put ourselves in the 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.700
 skin of the grayson soldier recognized by 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.340
 fidelity to a country and to principles 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.080
 military once this one meets with 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.450
 his dying brother who is about to 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.370
 become a chimera and has no 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.590
 another remedy more than to shoot with 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.900
 all the bald condolences that entails 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.090

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.940
 military rules imposed and you can 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.459
