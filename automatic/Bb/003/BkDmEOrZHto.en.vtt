00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
hey folks will bring here WWE bring some

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.980 
hey folks will bring here WWE bring some
calm<00:00:11.350> and<00:00:11.770> today<00:00:12.490> I<00:00:12.520> want<00:00:12.790> to<00:00:12.850> cover<00:00:13.000> soy

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
calm and today I want to cover soy

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.950 
calm and today I want to cover soy
protein<00:00:14.850> covered<00:00:15.850> soy<00:00:16.029> and<00:00:16.360> a<00:00:16.420> pretty<00:00:16.689> lengthy

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
protein covered soy and a pretty lengthy

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.190 
protein covered soy and a pretty lengthy
article<00:00:17.500> on<00:00:17.650> the<00:00:17.740> brake<00:00:17.920> zone<00:00:18.060> but<00:00:19.060> it's<00:00:19.630> older

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200 
article on the brake zone but it's older

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.630 
article on the brake zone but it's older
now<00:00:20.380> so<00:00:20.710> I<00:00:20.740> guess<00:00:21.010> it<00:00:21.220> might<00:00:21.340> be<00:00:21.490> a<00:00:21.520> little

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
now so I guess it might be a little

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.290 
now so I guess it might be a little
outdated

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
outdated

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.359 
outdated
though<00:00:22.960> I<00:00:22.990> have<00:00:23.200> to<00:00:23.320> say<00:00:23.470> my<00:00:23.650> my<00:00:24.040> general

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
though I have to say my my general

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.120 
though I have to say my my general
conclusions<00:00:24.820> haven't<00:00:25.090> changed<00:00:25.360> that<00:00:25.480> much

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
conclusions haven't changed that much

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.890 
conclusions haven't changed that much
the<00:00:27.130> issue<00:00:27.220> with<00:00:27.579> soy<00:00:27.759> is<00:00:28.150> actually<00:00:28.660> fairly

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
the issue with soy is actually fairly

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.409 
the issue with soy is actually fairly
complicated<00:00:29.230> so<00:00:30.160> if<00:00:30.610> you<00:00:30.820> think<00:00:31.090> there<00:00:31.270> is<00:00:31.390> a

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
complicated so if you think there is a

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.950 
complicated so if you think there is a
definitive<00:00:32.079> position<00:00:32.890> on<00:00:33.310> soy<00:00:33.579> soy<00:00:34.390> is<00:00:34.630> bad

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
definitive position on soy soy is bad

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.620 
definitive position on soy soy is bad
for<00:00:35.230> men<00:00:35.440> so<00:00:35.470> is<00:00:35.800> good<00:00:36.100> for<00:00:36.399> men<00:00:36.579> what<00:00:37.329> have<00:00:37.480> you

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
for men so is good for men what have you

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.200 
for men so is good for men what have you
you<00:00:37.870> don't<00:00:38.140> know<00:00:38.290> soy<00:00:38.530> because<00:00:39.190> there<00:00:39.430> are<00:00:39.699> a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
you don't know soy because there are a

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.049 
you don't know soy because there are a
number<00:00:40.660> of<00:00:41.039> conflicting<00:00:42.039> studies<00:00:42.250> and

number of conflicting studies and

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.430 
number of conflicting studies and
they're<00:00:43.239> conflicting<00:00:43.690> because<00:00:43.809> the<00:00:44.140> human

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
they're conflicting because the human

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.470 
they're conflicting because the human
body<00:00:44.620> and<00:00:44.949> male<00:00:45.460> human<00:00:45.820> physiology<00:00:46.090> is

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
body and male human physiology is

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.529 
body and male human physiology is
complicated<00:00:47.109> that's<00:00:47.710> not<00:00:47.920> a<00:00:47.949> matter<00:00:48.219> of<00:00:48.539> take

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
complicated that's not a matter of take

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.900 
complicated that's not a matter of take
soy<00:00:49.840> find<00:00:50.260> this<00:00:50.440> exact<00:00:50.890> effect<00:00:51.280> every<00:00:51.579> single

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
soy find this exact effect every single

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.349 
soy find this exact effect every single
time<00:00:52.140> some<00:00:53.140> studies<00:00:53.500> find<00:00:54.359> association

between soil or testosterone levels some
don't<00:00:57.879> I<00:00:58.690> think<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.530> general<00:00:59.800> take-home<00:01:00.339> if

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
don't I think the general take-home if

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.610 
don't I think the general take-home if
you<00:01:00.699> look<00:01:00.940> at<00:01:01.030> what<00:01:01.329> is<00:01:01.420> known<00:01:01.660> as<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.929> bulk<00:01:02.350> of

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
you look at what is known as the bulk of

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.649 
you look at what is known as the bulk of
the<00:01:02.739> data<00:01:02.920> that<00:01:03.280> is<00:01:03.460> most<00:01:03.850> studies<00:01:04.210> most<00:01:04.480> of

the data that is most studies most of

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.200 
the data that is most studies most of
the<00:01:04.750> time<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.740> general<00:01:05.980> conclusion<00:01:06.700> for<00:01:07.060> soy

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
the time the general conclusion for soy

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.830 
the time the general conclusion for soy
for<00:01:07.600> men<00:01:07.780> is<00:01:08.430> some<00:01:09.430> soy<00:01:09.670> in<00:01:10.090> moderation<00:01:10.720> is

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
for men is some soy in moderation is

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.140 
for men is some soy in moderation is
perfectly<00:01:11.230> fine<00:01:11.530> at<00:01:12.490> the<00:01:12.700> same<00:01:12.910> time<00:01:13.120> I

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
perfectly fine at the same time I

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.000 
perfectly fine at the same time I
wouldn't<00:01:13.570> recommend<00:01:14.110> that<00:01:14.320> a<00:01:14.410> man<00:01:14.620> make<00:01:14.860> it

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
wouldn't recommend that a man make it

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.250 
wouldn't recommend that a man make it
his<00:01:15.130> sole<00:01:15.370> source<00:01:15.670> of<00:01:15.820> protein<00:01:16.240> or<00:01:16.450> a<00:01:16.480> a<00:01:16.720> large
