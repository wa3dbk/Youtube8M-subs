00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
of the horizontal shot it will nicely

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:15.589 
of the horizontal shot it will nicely
lead<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.850> eyes<00:02:05.970> through<00:02:06.660> the<00:02:06.840> filter

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.039 
surface is nice and way to here I think
we<00:02:49.379> might<00:02:49.590> try<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.150> low-salt<00:02:51.150> here<00:02:51.599> and<00:02:51.780> capture

shots<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:46.400> Sun<00:04:46.639> is<00:04:46.820> already<00:04:47.030> low<00:04:47.509> so<00:04:47.870> I'll

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
shots the Sun is already low so I'll

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.260 
shots the Sun is already low so I'll
take<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:48.919> tripod<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.550> achieve<00:04:49.940> the<00:04:50.090> right

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
take the tripod to achieve the right

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.290 
take the tripod to achieve the right
depth<00:04:50.630> of<00:04:50.810> field<00:04:51.139> and<00:04:51.289> I'll<00:04:51.889> use<00:04:52.130> aperture<00:04:52.490> 11

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
depth of field and I'll use aperture 11

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.350 
depth of field and I'll use aperture 11
or<00:04:53.479> even<00:04:53.840> 16<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:55.310> shutter<00:04:55.550> speed<00:04:55.910> should<00:04:55.940> be

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
or even 16 the shutter speed should be

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:16.420 
or even 16 the shutter speed should be
pretty<00:04:56.599> slow<00:04:56.840> now<00:04:57.820> let's<00:04:58.820> begin<00:05:14.919> now<00:05:15.919> I<00:05:15.949> have

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
pretty slow now let's begin now I have

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.610 
pretty slow now let's begin now I have
achieved<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:17.000> maximum<00:05:17.570> focal<00:05:18.020> length<00:05:18.349> of<00:05:18.470> the

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
achieved the maximum focal length of the

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.060 
achieved the maximum focal length of the
scanned<00:05:18.919> at<00:05:19.070> 55<00:05:19.639> millimeter<00:05:20.120> zoom<00:05:20.740> so<00:05:21.740> I'll

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
scanned at 55 millimeter zoom so I'll

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.850 
scanned at 55 millimeter zoom so I'll
switch<00:05:22.460> to<00:05:22.490> the<00:05:22.729> 55<00:05:23.389> to<00:05:23.419> 200<00:05:24.380> millimeter<00:05:24.830> lens

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
switch to the 55 to 200 millimeter lens

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.210 
switch to the 55 to 200 millimeter lens
and<00:05:25.449> then<00:05:26.449> I<00:05:26.690> will<00:05:26.960> be<00:05:27.080> able<00:05:27.440> to<00:05:27.560> take<00:05:27.830> the<00:05:28.010> last

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
and then I will be able to take the last

photo at a hundred millimetres the 100

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.850 
photo at a hundred millimetres the 100
focal<00:05:38.090> length<00:05:38.389> is<00:05:38.630> already<00:05:38.990> pretty<00:05:39.260> long<00:05:39.560> so

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
focal length is already pretty long so

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:51.620 
focal length is already pretty long so
I'll<00:05:40.789> have<00:05:41.090> to<00:05:41.240> move<00:05:41.389> away<00:05:41.539> from<00:05:41.720> the<00:05:42.080> bridge

worth<00:06:13.000> remembering<00:06:13.360> about<00:06:13.960> the<00:06:14.110> few<00:06:14.410> things

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
worth remembering about the few things

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.100 
worth remembering about the few things
I've<00:06:14.980> mentioned<00:06:15.520> but<00:06:16.060> most<00:06:16.360> of<00:06:16.450> all<00:06:16.600> about

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
I've mentioned but most of all about

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.770 
I've mentioned but most of all about
direction<00:06:17.620> of<00:06:17.920> the<00:06:18.010> light<00:06:18.570> let's<00:06:19.570> pay

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:19.780 
direction of the light let's pay

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.510 
direction of the light let's pay
attention<00:06:19.810> to<00:06:20.320> the<00:06:20.440> Sun<00:06:20.650> position<00:06:20.860> and<00:06:21.280> see

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
attention to the Sun position and see

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.250 
attention to the Sun position and see
whether<00:06:21.700> the<00:06:21.850> landscape<00:06:22.390> or<00:06:22.570> other<00:06:22.750> subject

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
whether the landscape or other subject

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.550 
whether the landscape or other subject
will<00:06:23.410> look<00:06:23.590> better<00:06:23.860> in<00:06:24.100> front<00:06:24.460> or<00:06:24.610> back<00:06:24.820> light

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
will look better in front or back light

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.980 
will look better in front or back light
we<00:06:26.560> also<00:06:26.890> need<00:06:27.220> to<00:06:27.370> frame<00:06:27.640> carefully<00:06:28.270> and<00:06:28.720> make

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
we also need to frame carefully and make

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.460 
we also need to frame carefully and make
sure<00:06:29.100> that<00:06:30.100> what<00:06:30.460> we<00:06:30.610> see<00:06:30.910> in<00:06:31.060> the<00:06:31.180> viewfinder

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
sure that what we see in the viewfinder

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:36.120 
sure that what we see in the viewfinder
makes<00:06:32.470> the<00:06:32.860> final<00:06:33.340> shot<00:06:34.830> you<00:06:35.830> should<00:06:35.980> also

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130 
makes the final shot you should also

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.980 
makes the final shot you should also
observe<00:06:36.370> the<00:06:36.670> perspective<00:06:37.420> which<00:06:37.840> is

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
observe the perspective which is

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.550 
observe the perspective which is
affected<00:06:38.470> by<00:06:38.650> lens<00:06:39.160> focal<00:06:39.790> length<00:06:40.530> we<00:06:41.530> can

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 
affected by lens focal length we can

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.650 
affected by lens focal length we can
change<00:06:41.950> the<00:06:42.160> lens<00:06:42.400> and<00:06:42.700> look<00:06:43.210> for<00:06:43.420> the<00:06:43.480> best

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 
change the lens and look for the best

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.130 
change the lens and look for the best
perspective<00:06:45.000> but<00:06:46.000> most<00:06:46.390> of<00:06:46.510> all<00:06:46.690> we<00:06:46.960> should

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:47.140 
perspective but most of all we should

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.130 
perspective but most of all we should
keep<00:06:47.550> experimenting<00:06:48.550> and<00:06:49.150> looking<00:06:49.810> for<00:06:50.020> our

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:50.140 
keep experimenting and looking for our

keep experimenting and looking for our
