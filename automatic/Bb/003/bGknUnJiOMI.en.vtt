00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.880 
to hit the Autobahn and so that's where
we<00:02:12.400> had<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:16.330> Autobahn<00:02:16.840> actually<00:02:17.470> just<00:02:17.680> means

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
we had the Autobahn actually just means

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.250 
we had the Autobahn actually just means
freeway<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:18.489> if<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:18.819> ever<00:02:18.910> come<00:02:19.030> here<00:02:19.480> you

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
freeway so if you ever come here you

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.289 
freeway so if you ever come here you
can't<00:02:20.590> go<00:02:20.830> flat<00:02:21.310> out<00:02:21.340> everywhere<00:02:21.910> you've<00:02:22.120> got

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
can't go flat out everywhere you've got

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.150 
can't go flat out everywhere you've got
to<00:02:22.390> find<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.660> unrestricted<00:02:23.349> parts<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.069> the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
to find the unrestricted parts of the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.830 
to find the unrestricted parts of the
Autobahn<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.940> autobahn<00:02:25.330> system<00:02:25.750> is

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
Autobahn the autobahn system is

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.390 
Autobahn the autobahn system is
basically<00:02:25.989> a<00:02:26.140> highway<00:02:26.470> system<00:02:26.530> is<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.069> fourth

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
basically a highway system is the fourth

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.120 
basically a highway system is the fourth
largest<00:02:28.019> system<00:02:29.019> of<00:02:29.170> expressways<00:02:29.769> in<00:02:29.799> the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
largest system of expressways in the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.729 
largest system of expressways in the
world<00:02:30.430> plus<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.360> think<00:02:31.510> eight<00:02:31.840> thousand<00:02:32.530> miles

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
world plus I think eight thousand miles

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.140 
world plus I think eight thousand miles
of<00:02:33.250> expressways<00:02:33.970> oh<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:36.370> know<00:02:36.519> what<00:02:36.700> let's<00:02:36.910> go

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
of expressways oh you know what let's go

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.310 
of expressways oh you know what let's go
there's<00:02:37.630> an<00:02:37.750> Audi<00:02:37.900> let's<00:02:38.410> do<00:02:38.620> it

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.980 

now<00:02:43.320> we're<00:02:43.590> back<00:02:43.980> into<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.370> restricted<00:02:45.090> hundred

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
now we're back into a restricted hundred

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.540 
now we're back into a restricted hundred
zone<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.740> interesting<00:02:47.130> thing<00:02:47.250> about<00:02:47.340> the

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
zone the interesting thing about the

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.000 
zone the interesting thing about the
Autobahn<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.180> it's<00:02:48.720> largely<00:02:49.200> self<00:02:49.620> policing

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
Autobahn is it's largely self policing

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.890 
Autobahn is it's largely self policing
you've<00:02:50.580> got<00:02:50.790> these<00:02:50.940> unrestricted<00:02:51.630> areas

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
you've got these unrestricted areas

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.940 
you've got these unrestricted areas
where<00:02:52.050> people<00:02:52.350> go<00:02:52.940> 250<00:02:54.020> sometimes<00:02:55.020> even<00:02:55.290> 300k

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
where people go 250 sometimes even 300k

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.090 
where people go 250 sometimes even 300k
it's<00:02:56.160> unlimited<00:02:56.640> but<00:02:57.600> when<00:02:57.720> it's<00:02:57.870> 100k<00:02:58.680> they

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
it's unlimited but when it's 100k they

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.660 
it's unlimited but when it's 100k they
go<00:02:59.280> 100k<00:03:00.180> when<00:03:00.630> it's<00:03:00.780> 80k<00:03:01.140> they<00:03:01.350> go<00:03:01.470> 80k<00:03:02.010> in<00:03:02.550> the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
go 100k when it's 80k they go 80k in the

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.270 
go 100k when it's 80k they go 80k in the
stage<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:03.090> always<00:03:03.300> say<00:03:03.450> Oh<00:03:03.480> 60<00:03:04.200> I'll<00:03:04.350> go<00:03:04.500> 66
