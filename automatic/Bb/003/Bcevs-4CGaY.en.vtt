 hello youtube people today I will teach you 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.900
 how to download geometries without downloading 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.480
 a good emulator the first thing is that it 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.099
 go to the description link here 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.470
 they have to click on the button 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.630
 load that is in green I do not download it 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.000
 because I already have it 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.189
 but it weighs almost nothing so it's the 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.869
 will discharge fast good after they go to the 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.189
 file that were downloaded click 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.189
 left and extract here 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.700
 once the installation is finished 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.009
 leave us a folder with the same name 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.080
 and there the game will come, we just send a 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.159
 direct access to the desktop and ready 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.159
 we will have installed 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.650
 well now a game show 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.780
 so I see them there we are already in the 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.670
 game as you can observe is complete 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.450
 I will play a level to see that if 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.450

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.500

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.329
 the most levels apart the function of 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.980

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.350

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.660
 We can also customize our 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.370
 square and all its accessories from 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.370

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.870
