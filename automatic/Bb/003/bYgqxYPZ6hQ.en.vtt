00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.530 

okay<00:00:01.380> so<00:00:01.439> we've<00:00:01.709> got<00:00:01.740> the<00:00:01.949> wheel<00:00:02.129> eight<00:00:02.310> now

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:02.540 
okay so we've got the wheel eight now

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.059 
okay so we've got the wheel eight now
the<00:00:03.540> first<00:00:03.780> thing<00:00:03.929> we<00:00:04.049> need<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.230> do<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.859> to

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
the first thing we need to do is to

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.800 
the first thing we need to do is to
remember<00:00:05.430> that<00:00:05.520> when<00:00:05.730> you've<00:00:05.910> got<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:06.089> puncture

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
remember that when you've got a puncture

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.570 
remember that when you've got a puncture
you<00:00:07.170> haven't<00:00:07.410> got<00:00:07.529> rid<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.799> all<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.280> air<00:00:08.400> in

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
you haven't got rid of all of the air in

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.150 
you haven't got rid of all of the air in
the<00:00:08.610> tire<00:00:08.960> so<00:00:09.960> basically<00:00:10.410> we<00:00:10.620> need<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.830> get<00:00:11.040> as

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
the tire so basically we need to get as

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.280 
the tire so basically we need to get as
much<00:00:11.309> air<00:00:11.490> as<00:00:11.519> we<00:00:11.730> can<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.719> make<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.049> tire

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
much air as we can to make the tire

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.180 
much air as we can to make the tire
removal<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:14.099> lot<00:00:14.610> easier<00:00:15.000> take<00:00:15.690> off<00:00:15.870> your<00:00:16.190> -

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
removal a lot easier take off your -

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.910 
removal a lot easier take off your -
about<00:00:17.369> Kathy<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.029> cap<00:00:18.410> and<00:00:19.410> then<00:00:19.560> all<00:00:19.830> you

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
about Kathy this cap and then all you

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.130 
about Kathy this cap and then all you
need<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.100> do<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:21.300> just<00:00:21.600> push<00:00:21.810> something

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
need to do is is just push something

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.009 
need to do is is just push something
small<00:00:22.439> into<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.250> bottom<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.609> valve<00:00:24.019> so

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
small into the bottom of the valve so

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.900 
small into the bottom of the valve so
you<00:00:25.109> can<00:00:25.260> just<00:00:25.859> get<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.340> last<00:00:26.460> bit<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.730> air<00:00:26.880> a

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
you can just get the last bit of air a

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.450 
you can just get the last bit of air a
and<00:00:27.240> then<00:00:27.359> just<00:00:27.510> squash<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.900> wheel<00:00:28.050> up<00:00:31.460> like

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
and then just squash the wheel up like

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.319 
and then just squash the wheel up like
so<00:00:34.250> there's<00:00:35.250> different<00:00:35.399> types<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:36.059> valves

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
so there's different types of valves

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.549 
so there's different types of valves
that<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:36.540> need<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.809> point<00:00:37.050> out<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.469> just

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
that we need to point out to you just

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.180 
that we need to point out to you just
now

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
now

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.130 
now
a<00:00:40.190> high<00:00:41.190> pressure<00:00:41.430> valve<00:00:41.820> also<00:00:42.629> known<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
a high pressure valve also known as a

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.340 
a high pressure valve also known as a
Presta<00:00:43.590> valve<00:00:44.180> to<00:00:45.180> release<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.660> air<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.170> take

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
Presta valve to release the air you take

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.410 
Presta valve to release the air you take
the<00:00:46.469> disc<00:00:46.680> cap<00:00:46.860> off<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.370> then<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.969> undo<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the disc cap off and then you undo the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.439 
the disc cap off and then you undo the
milled<00:00:48.629> nut<00:00:48.899> nut<00:00:49.760> about<00:00:50.760> three<00:00:51.000> or<00:00:51.090> four<00:00:51.239> turns

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
milled nut nut about three or four turns

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.920 
milled nut nut about three or four turns
and<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:52.140> press<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:54.180> now<00:00:54.360> release<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
and then press it in and now release the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.920 
and then press it in and now release the
tire<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:56.100> area<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> tire

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.530 

if<00:01:02.710> you've<00:01:03.070> got<00:01:03.280> a<00:01:03.310> press<00:01:03.580> the<00:01:03.730> valve<00:01:03.880> you<00:01:04.210> need

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
if you've got a press the valve you need

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.310 
if you've got a press the valve you need
to<00:01:04.690> undo<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.710> secure<00:01:06.130> enough<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:07.540> allow<00:01:08.260> the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
to undo the secure enough to allow the

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.710 
to undo the secure enough to allow the
tube<00:01:09.100> to<00:01:09.340> be<00:01:09.460> taken<00:01:09.760> out<00:01:09.880> of<00:01:09.910> the<00:01:10.090> rim<00:01:10.270> so<00:01:10.570> that

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
tube to be taken out of the rim so that

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.010 
tube to be taken out of the rim so that
would<00:01:10.870> screw<00:01:11.110> right<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.500> way<00:01:11.590> off<00:01:15.870> so<00:01:16.870> with

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
would screw right the way off so with

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.280 
would screw right the way off so with
your<00:01:17.140> function<00:01:17.530> tire<00:01:18.150> then<00:01:19.150> you<00:01:19.990> put<00:01:20.170> your

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
your function tire then you put your

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.670 
your function tire then you put your
valve<00:01:20.860> at<00:01:21.460> about<00:01:21.760> three<00:01:22.060> o'clock<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.560> then

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
valve at about three o'clock and then

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.860 
valve at about three o'clock and then
starting<00:01:24.160> with<00:01:24.190> your<00:01:24.370> tire<00:01:24.580> Linga<00:01:24.970> just<00:01:25.720> took

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
starting with your tire Linga just took

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.530 
starting with your tire Linga just took
your<00:01:26.050> tire<00:01:26.320> lever<00:01:26.560> in<00:01:26.800> gently<00:01:27.190> just<00:01:28.150> catch<00:01:28.390> him

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
your tire lever in gently just catch him

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.410 
your tire lever in gently just catch him
behind<00:01:28.870> the<00:01:28.990> rim<00:01:29.200> of<00:01:29.230> the<00:01:29.440> tire<00:01:30.060> now<00:01:31.060> it's<00:01:31.270> got

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
behind the rim of the tire now it's got

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.180 
behind the rim of the tire now it's got
a<00:01:31.450> wired<00:01:31.750> supported<00:01:32.740> beam

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
a wired supported beam

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.770 
a wired supported beam
so<00:01:33.400> you<00:01:33.460> just<00:01:33.700> hook<00:01:33.850> in<00:01:34.000> that<00:01:34.030> and<00:01:34.360> try<00:01:34.570> not<00:01:34.720> to

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
so you just hook in that and try not to

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.650 
so you just hook in that and try not to
pinch<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.260> inner<00:01:35.530> tube<00:01:35.770> which<00:01:35.950> is<00:01:36.100> in<00:01:36.250> there

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
pinch the inner tube which is in there

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.900 
pinch the inner tube which is in there
so<00:01:37.660> within<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.930> hook<00:01:38.050> it<00:01:38.170> round<00:01:38.410> and<00:01:38.910> then

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
so within the hook it round and then

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.900 
so within the hook it round and then
round<00:01:40.330> it<00:01:40.479> goes<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:42.310> as<00:01:42.490> simple<00:01:42.640> as<00:01:42.850> that

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
round it goes it's as simple as that

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.859 
round it goes it's as simple as that
sometimes<00:01:43.750> that<00:01:44.260> are<00:01:44.290> tight<00:01:45.300> what<00:01:46.300> you<00:01:46.420> do<00:01:46.600> is

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
sometimes that are tight what you do is

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.410 
sometimes that are tight what you do is
you<00:01:47.140> use<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.920> tire<00:01:48.160> leave<00:01:48.369> it<00:01:48.550> like<00:01:48.850> so<00:01:49.180> and

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
you use the tire leave it like so and

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.810 
you use the tire leave it like so and
then<00:01:49.990> at<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.500> end<00:01:50.530> it's<00:01:51.190> got<00:01:51.340> a<00:01:51.400> little<00:01:51.580> hook

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
then at the end it's got a little hook

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.640 
then at the end it's got a little hook
which<00:01:52.030> hooks<00:01:52.270> on<00:01:52.570> to<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.880> spoke<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:56.440> hook

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
which hooks on to the spoke so you hook

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.740 
which hooks on to the spoke so you hook
that<00:01:56.680> on<00:01:56.950> there<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:58.270> then<00:01:58.330> you<00:01:58.510> take<00:01:58.720> your

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
that on there and then you take your

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.120 
that on there and then you take your
next<00:01:58.990> one<00:01:59.550> and<00:02:00.550> work<00:02:00.820> your<00:02:01.000> way<00:02:01.150> around<00:02:01.920> bit<00:02:02.920> by

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
next one and work your way around bit by

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.359 
next one and work your way around bit by
bit

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
bit

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.830 
bit
doing<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:04.509> one<00:02:04.660> off<00:02:04.780> taking<00:02:05.290> that<00:02:05.410> one<00:02:05.530> eight

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
doing that one off taking that one eight

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.350 
doing that one off taking that one eight
and<00:02:08.220> then<00:02:09.220> working<00:02:09.429> around<00:02:09.730> to<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:09.910> next<00:02:10.119> part

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
and then working around to the next part

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.240 
and then working around to the next part
this<00:02:10.780> is<00:02:10.840> an<00:02:11.110> easy<00:02:11.200> one<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.560> remove<00:02:11.920> so<00:02:12.130> we

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
this is an easy one to remove so we

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.590 
this is an easy one to remove so we
don't<00:02:12.459> need<00:02:12.580> them<00:02:12.760> even<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:13.030> use<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.390> tie

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
don't need them even to use to tie

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.259 
don't need them even to use to tie
leaders<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:15.489> when<00:02:15.670> your<00:02:15.790> tire<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.239> completely

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
leaders so when your tire is completely

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.680

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
cover squirt - there and just so much

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:21.600 
cover squirt - there and just so much
oxygen

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.930 

but<00:03:22.210> so

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.790 

not<00:03:25.570> too<00:03:25.810> much<00:03:25.990> otherwise<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.500> won't<00:03:26.620> be<00:03:26.740> able

not too much otherwise you won't be able
to<00:03:26.950> get<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.130> tube<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.760> tire<00:03:27.940> back

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
to get the tube and the tire back

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.720 
to get the tube and the tire back
together<00:03:30.480> they're<00:03:31.480> taking<00:03:31.840> you<00:03:31.930> new<00:03:32.080> tube

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
together they're taking you new tube

insert<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.910> valve<00:03:34.240> in<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.130> hole<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:37.510> then

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
insert the valve in to the hole and then

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.290 
insert the valve in to the hole and then
is<00:03:38.440> probably<00:03:38.800> to<00:03:38.980> fire<00:03:39.310> over<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.700> top<00:03:39.910> and

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
is probably to fire over the top and

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.930 
is probably to fire over the top and
just<00:03:40.930> like<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.260> tube<00:03:41.470> into<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.860> into<00:03:42.820> the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
just like the tube into the into the

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.770 
just like the tube into the into the
inside<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.810> toilet<00:03:43.990> and<00:03:45.420> now<00:03:46.420> this<00:03:46.600> is<00:03:46.750> a

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
inside of the toilet and now this is a

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.920 
inside of the toilet and now this is a
matter<00:03:47.020> of<00:03:47.110> strong<00:03:47.830> thumbs<00:03:48.160> and<00:03:48.700> fingers<00:03:48.940> put

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
matter of strong thumbs and fingers put

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.160 
matter of strong thumbs and fingers put
in<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.170> valve<00:03:50.590> again<00:03:50.950> at<00:03:51.100> 3<00:03:51.310> o'clock<00:03:52.170> starting

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
in the valve again at 3 o'clock starting

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.530 
in the valve again at 3 o'clock starting
there<00:03:53.710> and<00:03:54.010> then<00:03:54.160> just<00:03:54.370> slowly<00:03:54.610> work<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.270> tire

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
there and then just slowly work the tire

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.580 
there and then just slowly work the tire
into<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.740> recess<00:03:58.140> open<00:03:59.140> it<00:03:59.230> back<00:03:59.350> into

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
into the recess open it back into

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.340 
into the recess open it back into
position

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.470 

this<00:04:05.350> one's<00:04:05.560> fallen<00:04:05.950> off<00:04:06.070> but<00:04:06.340> quite<00:04:07.270> often

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
this one's fallen off but quite often

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.010 
this one's fallen off but quite often
you'll<00:04:07.840> mean<00:04:08.110> especially<00:04:09.100> on<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.220> road<00:04:09.490> bike<00:04:10.020> to

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
you'll mean especially on a road bike to

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.950 
you'll mean especially on a road bike to
leave<00:04:11.230> at<00:04:11.380> a<00:04:11.470> tire<00:04:11.680> back<00:04:11.890> on<00:04:12.330> when<00:04:13.330> you<00:04:13.480> do<00:04:13.690> do

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
leave at a tire back on when you do do

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.710 
leave at a tire back on when you do do
that<00:04:14.170> just<00:04:14.680> be<00:04:14.830> careful<00:04:15.280> not<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.580> catch<00:04:15.760> the

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
that just be careful not to catch the

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.750 
that just be careful not to catch the
tube<00:04:17.020> on<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.650> inside<00:04:17.950> of<00:04:17.980> the<00:04:18.130> rim<00:04:18.310> because

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
tube on the inside of the rim because

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.640 
tube on the inside of the rim because
then<00:04:18.910> you<00:04:19.030> can<00:04:19.209> pinch<00:04:19.450> it<00:04:19.660> and<00:04:19.930> puncture<00:04:20.560> the

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
then you can pinch it and puncture the

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.030 
then you can pinch it and puncture the
new<00:04:20.770> tube<00:04:21.040> so<00:04:21.670> then<00:04:22.060> all<00:04:22.330> you<00:04:22.510> do<00:04:22.720> is<00:04:22.750> that<00:04:23.050> just

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
new tube so then all you do is that just

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:31.480 
new tube so then all you do is that just
a<00:04:24.130> pop<00:04:24.310> it<00:04:24.430> back<00:04:24.460> very<00:04:25.980> carefully

it's<00:04:34.950> centralized<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:36.060> then<00:04:36.180> what<00:04:36.330> you<00:04:36.420> can

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
it's centralized and then what you can

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.940 
it's centralized and then what you can
do<00:04:36.630> is<00:04:36.750> put<00:04:36.930> your<00:04:37.020> thumb<00:04:37.080> down<00:04:37.440> I've<00:04:37.650> got<00:04:37.770> to

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
do is put your thumb down I've got to

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:38.930 
do is put your thumb down I've got to
hold<00:04:38.070> it<00:04:38.280> in<00:04:38.370> place

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
hold it in place

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.710 
hold it in place
so<00:04:39.270> you<00:04:39.330> can<00:04:39.480> get<00:04:39.630> your<00:04:39.750> pump<00:04:40.020> on<00:04:41.600> if<00:04:42.600> you

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
so you can get your pump on if you

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.170 
so you can get your pump on if you
fumble<00:04:42.930> about<00:04:43.430> like<00:04:44.430> so<00:04:46.160> and<00:04:47.160> then<00:04:47.400> we're<00:04:48.150> just

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
fumble about like so and then we're just

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.550 
fumble about like so and then we're just
going<00:04:48.450> to<00:04:48.510> put<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.720> little<00:04:48.930> bit<00:04:49.050> of<00:04:49.260> air<00:04:49.350> in

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
going to put a little bit of air in

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.010 
going to put a little bit of air in
there<00:04:49.740> just<00:04:50.610> to<00:04:50.820> push<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.150> tirade<00:04:51.630> so<00:04:51.930> it

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
there just to push the tirade so it

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.920 
there just to push the tirade so it
touches<00:04:52.200> the<00:04:52.560> rim<00:04:53.510> and<00:04:54.510> we're<00:04:54.660> going<00:04:54.780> to<00:04:54.810> make

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
touches the rim and we're going to make

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.510 
touches the rim and we're going to make
sure<00:04:55.140> Center<00:04:55.620> live<00:04:55.740> so<00:04:55.950> I'm<00:04:56.070> lifting<00:04:56.250> the

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
sure Center live so I'm lifting the

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.610 
sure Center live so I'm lifting the
wheel<00:04:56.700> off<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:56.910> brain<00:04:57.270> here<00:04:57.540> so<00:04:58.260> the<00:04:58.380> tire

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
wheel off the brain here so the tire

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.590 
wheel off the brain here so the tire
thing<00:04:58.950> find<00:04:59.340> its<00:04:59.580> own<00:04:59.730> central<00:05:00.330> position<00:05:02.600> so

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
thing find its own central position so

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.130 
thing find its own central position so
about<00:05:03.840> 5<00:05:04.560> or<00:05:04.770> 10<00:05:04.830> psi<00:05:05.490> is<00:05:05.550> plenty<00:05:06.090> we're<00:05:06.990> going

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
about 5 or 10 psi is plenty we're going

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.350 
about 5 or 10 psi is plenty we're going
to<00:05:07.200> stop<00:05:07.380> at<00:05:07.530> that<00:05:07.560> now<00:05:07.890> and<00:05:08.190> we've<00:05:08.970> got<00:05:09.090> a<00:05:09.180> roof

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
to stop at that now and we've got a roof

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.320 
to stop at that now and we've got a roof
Rand<00:05:09.960> and<00:05:10.260> check<00:05:10.560> that<00:05:10.830> the<00:05:10.950> tire<00:05:11.190> is<00:05:11.820> central

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
Rand and check that the tire is central

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.530 
Rand and check that the tire is central
on<00:05:12.480> the<00:05:12.600> rim<00:05:13.040> most<00:05:14.040> tires<00:05:14.370> have<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.150> small

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
on the rim most tires have a small

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.410 
on the rim most tires have a small
marking<00:05:16.440> or<00:05:16.650> a<00:05:16.680> beef<00:05:16.980> or<00:05:17.340> a<00:05:17.670> mold<00:05:18.000> in<00:05:18.150> that<00:05:18.330> you

marking or a beef or a mold in that you

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.630 
marking or a beef or a mold in that you
can<00:05:18.600> follow<00:05:18.810> all<00:05:19.200> the<00:05:19.320> way<00:05:19.350> around<00:05:19.680> to<00:05:20.490> make

can follow all the way around to make

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.050 
can follow all the way around to make
sure<00:05:20.940> that<00:05:21.390> the<00:05:21.540> tire<00:05:21.750> is<00:05:21.870> centralised<00:05:23.060> once

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
sure that the tire is centralised once

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.240 
sure that the tire is centralised once
you<00:05:24.210> see<00:05:24.270> all<00:05:24.419> the<00:05:24.660> tire<00:05:24.870> centralize<00:05:25.500> which<00:05:26.070> at

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
you see all the tire centralize which at

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.130 
you see all the tire centralize which at
the<00:05:26.370> both<00:05:26.580> sides<00:05:26.880> they<00:05:27.600> leave<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:27.930> relative

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
the both sides they leave the relative

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.100 
the both sides they leave the relative
expression

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
expression

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.510 
expression
99%<00:05:31.110> of<00:05:31.410> tires<00:05:31.650> have<00:05:32.010> their<00:05:32.190> pressure

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
99% of tires have their pressure

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.550 
99% of tires have their pressure
everything<00:05:32.970> on<00:05:33.150> the<00:05:33.240> time

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.370 

and<00:05:40.560> this<00:05:40.710> one<00:05:40.890> is<00:05:41.040> 30<00:05:41.400> to<00:05:41.790> 60<00:05:42.180> psi<00:05:42.390> so<00:05:43.200> we'll

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
and this one is 30 to 60 psi so we'll

00:05:43.380 --> 00:06:01.040 
and this one is 30 to 60 psi so we'll
take<00:05:43.560> the<00:05:43.950> movie<00:05:58.910> when<00:05:59.910> you're<00:06:00.030> done<00:06:00.180> we<00:06:00.930> just

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
take the movie when you're done we just

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.240 
take the movie when you're done we just
cut<00:06:01.410> back<00:06:01.590> on

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.490 

I'm<00:06:05.250> already<00:06:05.460> put<00:06:05.850> the<00:06:05.910> wheel<00:06:06.090> back<00:06:06.120> in<00:06:06.500> I'll

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
I'm already put the wheel back in I'll

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.530 
I'm already put the wheel back in I'll
be<00:06:07.560> able<00:06:07.650> to<00:06:07.770> show<00:06:08.040> you<00:06:08.100> these<00:06:08.540> high-pressure

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
be able to show you these high-pressure

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.460 
be able to show you these high-pressure
parts<00:06:09.990> again<00:06:11.720> the<00:06:12.720> extra<00:06:13.020> thing<00:06:13.200> you've<00:06:13.320> got

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
parts again the extra thing you've got

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.170 
parts again the extra thing you've got
to<00:06:13.500> remember<00:06:13.620> is<00:06:14.160> the<00:06:14.310> nut<00:06:14.490> that<00:06:14.610> locates<00:06:15.000> the

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
to remember is the nut that locates the

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.270 
to remember is the nut that locates the
valve<00:06:15.360> so<00:06:16.080> you'll<00:06:16.230> just<00:06:16.260> screw<00:06:16.500> that<00:06:16.650> down

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
valve so you'll just screw that down

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.930 
valve so you'll just screw that down
once<00:06:18.240> the<00:06:18.390> tires<00:06:18.630> inflated<00:06:19.580> and<00:06:20.580> then<00:06:20.790> you

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
once the tires inflated and then you

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.190 
once the tires inflated and then you
screw<00:06:21.180> you<00:06:21.360> milled<00:06:22.020> nut<00:06:22.290> back<00:06:22.470> together<00:06:24.200> and

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
screw you milled nut back together and

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.040 
screw you milled nut back together and
then<00:06:25.320> put<00:06:25.470> you<00:06:25.530> just<00:06:25.710> cap<00:06:25.860> on
