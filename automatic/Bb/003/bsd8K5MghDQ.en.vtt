the front loop only

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.530 
the front loop only
before<00:00:38.400> we<00:00:38.489> begin<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:38.970> first<00:00:39.269> have<00:00:39.510> to

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
before we begin we first have to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.350 
before we begin we first have to
understand<00:00:40.110> what<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.710> front<00:00:40.949> loop<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.360> when

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
understand what the front loop is when

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.660 
understand what the front loop is when
looking<00:00:42.899> at<00:00:43.110> your<00:00:43.350> project<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.010> always<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:44.489> to

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
looking at your project I always like to

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.700 
looking at your project I always like to
turn<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.120> on<00:00:45.269> its<00:00:45.479> side<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.750> look<00:00:46.170> at<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.470> V's

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
turn it on its side and look at the V's

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.569 
turn it on its side and look at the V's
my<00:00:47.250> stacked<00:00:47.579> bees<00:00:48.000> which<00:00:48.210> earth<00:00:48.420> represent

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
my stacked bees which earth represent

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.929 
my stacked bees which earth represent
one<00:00:50.579> stitch<00:00:50.970> each<00:00:51.799> each<00:00:52.799> V<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.250> also<00:00:53.460> made<00:00:53.790> of

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:53.939 
one stitch each each V is also made of

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:57.350 
one stitch each each V is also made of
two<00:00:54.239> loops<00:00:55.100> normally<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.400> a<00:00:56.519> single<00:00:56.879> crochet

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
two loops normally in a single crochet

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.270 
two loops normally in a single crochet
you're<00:00:58.110> going<00:00:58.259> to<00:00:58.320> insert<00:00:58.559> your<00:00:58.619> hook<00:00:58.799> under

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
you're going to insert your hook under

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.850 
you're going to insert your hook under
both<00:00:59.309> loops<00:01:00.080> when<00:01:01.080> you're<00:01:01.229> working<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.559> front

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
both loops when you're working the front

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.549 
both loops when you're working the front
loop<00:01:02.100> only<00:01:02.360> you<00:01:03.360> are<00:01:03.540> only<00:01:03.720> inserting<00:01:04.439> your

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
loop only you are only inserting your

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.530 
loop only you are only inserting your
hook<00:01:04.619> under<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.369> loop<00:01:05.460> that's<00:01:05.820> closest<00:01:06.450> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
hook under the loop that's closest to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.560 
hook under the loop that's closest to
you<00:01:06.689> which<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.229> your<00:01:07.409> front<00:01:07.770> loop<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:09.390> one

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
you which is your front loop the one

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.890 
you which is your front loop the one
further<00:01:09.930> away<00:01:10.079> from<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.799> your<00:01:10.979> back<00:01:11.130> loop

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
further away from you is your back loop

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.350 
further away from you is your back loop
so<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.960> begin<00:01:13.170> your<00:01:13.619> row<00:01:13.860> you're<00:01:14.850> always<00:01:15.000> going

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
so to begin your row you're always going

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.330 
so to begin your row you're always going
to<00:01:15.479> chain<00:01:15.750> one<00:01:16.020> for<00:01:16.049> height<00:01:17.600> then<00:01:18.600> if<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.380> are

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
to chain one for height then if you are

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.419 
to chain one for height then if you are
beginner<00:01:20.939> it's<00:01:21.390> always<00:01:21.659> good<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.079> turn<00:01:22.429> your

just<00:01:32.130> through<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:32.999> first<00:01:33.420> loop<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.499> front

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:34.889 
just through that first loop that front

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:38.499 
just through that first loop that front
loop<00:01:35.069> only<00:01:35.899> only<00:01:36.899> one<00:01:37.289> loop<00:01:37.530> should<00:01:37.740> be<00:01:37.979> there

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
loop only only one loop should be there

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.440 
loop only only one loop should be there
yarn<00:01:39.509> over<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:39.899> pull<00:01:40.170> up<00:01:40.380> your<00:01:40.649> loop<00:01:40.829> and

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
you get used to working it you're gonna

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.559 
you get used to working it you're gonna
see<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.340> there's<00:01:50.520> kind<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.819> a<00:01:50.939> little<00:01:51.179> space

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
see that there's kind of a little space

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.270 
see that there's kind of a little space
right<00:01:51.719> here<00:01:52.139> and<00:01:52.409> that's<00:01:52.649> where<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.130> can

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
right here and that's where you can

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.550 
right here and that's where you can
place<00:01:53.639> your<00:01:53.850> hook<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.359> kind<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.719> just<00:01:54.959> push<00:01:55.289> up

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
place your hook and kind of just push up

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.209 
place your hook and kind of just push up
to<00:01:55.859> catch<00:01:56.609> your<00:01:56.880> front<00:01:57.209> loop<00:01:57.420> only<00:01:58.039> it<00:01:59.039> makes

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
to catch your front loop only it makes

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.219 
to catch your front loop only it makes
it<00:01:59.399> very<00:01:59.609> easy<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.539> work<00:02:01.439> just<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:02.009> loop<00:02:02.279> so

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
it very easy to work just this loop so

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.949 
it very easy to work just this loop so
again<00:02:04.229> we're<00:02:04.409> gonna<00:02:04.499> look<00:02:04.859> at<00:02:05.039> our<00:02:05.069> B's<00:02:05.959> if

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
again we're gonna look at our B's if

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.190 
again we're gonna look at our B's if
it's<00:02:07.170> difficult<00:02:07.439> for<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.039> see<00:02:08.959> find<00:02:09.959> that

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
it's difficult for you to see find that

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.780 
it's difficult for you to see find that
front<00:02:10.560> loop<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.880> place<00:02:12.240> our<00:02:12.569> hook<00:02:12.720> under<00:02:13.050> it

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
front loop and place our hook under it

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.960 
front loop and place our hook under it
yarn<00:02:14.790> over<00:02:15.120> pull<00:02:15.720> up<00:02:15.870> our<00:02:16.050> loop<00:02:16.790> yarn<00:02:17.790> over

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
yarn over pull up our loop yarn over

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.010 
yarn over pull up our loop yarn over
again<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.990> finish<00:02:19.410> our<00:02:19.560> single<00:02:19.890> crochet<00:02:21.020> once

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
again and finish our single crochet once

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.930 
again and finish our single crochet once
you<00:02:22.170> get<00:02:22.319> used<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.920> finding<00:02:23.310> your<00:02:23.459> front<00:02:23.730> loop

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
you get used to finding your front loop

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.610 
you get used to finding your front loop
you're<00:02:24.599> gonna<00:02:24.720> see<00:02:24.990> there's<00:02:25.200> even<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.500> little

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
you're gonna see there's even a little

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.920 
you're gonna see there's even a little
hole<00:02:25.950> there<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.400> can<00:02:26.520> kind<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.760> see<00:02:26.970> now<00:02:27.870> you

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
hole there you can kind of see now you

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.830 
hole there you can kind of see now you
just<00:02:28.170> place<00:02:28.380> right<00:02:28.830> there<00:02:29.150> push<00:02:30.150> right<00:02:30.390> up<00:02:30.450> and

it a crisp nice clean edge then you'll

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.820 
it a crisp nice clean edge then you'll
also<00:04:54.900> see<00:04:55.229> that<00:04:55.379> there's<00:04:55.650> a<00:04:55.770> little<00:04:56.250> bit<00:04:56.430> of<00:04:56.669> a

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
also see that there's a little bit of a

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.999 
also see that there's a little bit of a
horizontal<00:04:58.830> line<00:04:59.310> from<00:04:59.729> the<00:04:59.909> back<00:05:00.090> loops

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
horizontal line from the back loops

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.999 
horizontal line from the back loops
unlike<00:05:02.030> the<00:05:03.030> back<00:05:03.479> loop<00:05:03.780> only<00:05:04.050> single<00:05:04.590> crochet

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:05.009 
unlike the back loop only single crochet

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:10.839 
unlike the back loop only single crochet
this<00:05:05.789> doesn't<00:05:06.270> create<00:05:06.629> a<00:05:09.229> stretchy<00:05:10.229> fabric

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849 
this doesn't create a stretchy fabric

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.510 
this doesn't create a stretchy fabric
quite<00:05:11.849> as<00:05:12.389> much<00:05:12.690> as<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:13.020> back<00:05:13.169> loop<00:05:13.409> only<00:05:13.560> but

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
quite as much as the back loop only but

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.520 
quite as much as the back loop only but
it<00:05:14.610> still<00:05:14.909> gives<00:05:15.180> you<00:05:15.449> a<00:05:15.479> loop<00:05:15.840> that<00:05:16.080> you<00:05:16.229> could

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
it still gives you a loop that you could

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.559 
it still gives you a loop that you could
crochet<00:05:17.009> into<00:05:17.220> to<00:05:17.789> make<00:05:17.940> a<00:05:17.970> different<00:05:18.360> kind<00:05:18.389> of

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
crochet into to make a different kind of

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:20.719 
crochet into to make a different kind of
project<00:05:18.990> but<00:05:19.800> it<00:05:19.919> also<00:05:20.039> gives<00:05:20.280> it<00:05:20.430> kind<00:05:20.610> of

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
project but it also gives it kind of

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.960 
project but it also gives it kind of
just<00:05:21.000> a<00:05:21.090> nice<00:05:21.270> little<00:05:21.539> textural<00:05:22.349> element<00:05:22.979> so

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
just a nice little textural element so

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.460 
just a nice little textural element so
that<00:05:24.090> is<00:05:24.210> single<00:05:24.539> crochet<00:05:24.690> in<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.080> front<00:05:25.319> loop

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
that is single crochet in the front loop
