so<00:00:10.769> what<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.160> session<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.059> going<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.300> be

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
so what this session is going to be

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.289 
so what this session is going to be
about<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.900> tips<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.590> tricks<00:00:13.830> with<00:00:14.580> max<00:00:14.969> some

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
about is tips and tricks with max some

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.670 
about is tips and tricks with max some
of<00:00:15.389> them<00:00:15.509> will<00:00:15.599> be<00:00:15.690> technique<00:00:16.139> some<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
of them will be technique some of the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.900 
of them will be technique some of the
features<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.310> might<00:00:17.490> not<00:00:17.580> know<00:00:17.760> about

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
features that you might not know about

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.050 
features that you might not know about
will<00:00:18.240> get<00:00:18.359> in<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.630> little<00:00:18.810> bit<00:00:19.020> into<00:00:19.320> some<00:00:20.100> some

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
will get in a little bit into some some

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.480 
will get in a little bit into some some
shortcuts<00:00:21.570> for<00:00:21.660> scripting<00:00:22.250> so<00:00:23.250> let's<00:00:23.400> go

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
shortcuts for scripting so let's go

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:31.250 
shortcuts for scripting so let's go
ahead<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.670> get<00:00:23.820> started<00:00:26.779> and<00:00:28.310> this<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:30.260> this

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
ahead and get started and this is a this

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.700 
ahead and get started and this is a this
is<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.439> file<00:00:31.710> here<00:00:31.949> by<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> c2<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.780> military

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
is a file here by a c2 for a military

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.220 
is a file here by a c2 for a military
simulation<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.760> I've<00:00:36.660> got<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> couple<00:00:37.079> of

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
simulation and I've got a couple of

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.869 
simulation and I've got a couple of
Tanks<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.770> scene<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.040> actually<00:00:38.700> what

lot of people don't know about and it's
a<00:00:45.270> mac<00:00:45.960> script<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:47.039> examples<00:00:47.640> folder

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
a mac script in the examples folder

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.610 
a mac script in the examples folder
called<00:00:48.750> LOD<00:00:49.320> tester<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.930> what<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.289> if<00:00:52.530> I

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
called LOD tester and what this is if I

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.229 
called LOD tester and what this is if I
come<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:52.949> select<00:00:53.280> all<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.640> tanks<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
come and select all of the tanks in the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.029 
come and select all of the tanks in the
scene<00:00:54.480> there's<00:00:55.260> several<00:00:55.590> different<00:00:55.710> versions

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
scene there's several different versions

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.479 
scene there's several different versions

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
of leds for this object and if i add all

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.939 
of leds for this object and if i add all
these<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> list<00:01:00.210> i<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:01.410> come<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.829> say

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
these to the list i can come in and say

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.310 
these to the list i can come in and say
display<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.460> current<00:01:02.640> lod<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.420> i<00:01:03.750> can<00:01:03.960> cycle

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
display the current lod and i can cycle

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.810 
display the current lod and i can cycle
through<00:01:04.350> all<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.769> these<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.250> i<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.460> see<00:01:05.670> them

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
through all of these and i can see them

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.030 
through all of these and i can see them
all<00:01:05.909> at<00:01:06.090> once<00:01:06.320> this<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.470> something<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.860> you

all at once this is something that you
already<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.580> installed<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:09.119> max<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:09.510> you're

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
already have installed in max if you're

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.010 
already have installed in max if you're
if<00:01:09.930> you're<00:01:10.140> using<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.830> then<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.689> just<00:01:12.869> run

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
if you're using it and then so just run

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.210 
if you're using it and then so just run
the<00:01:13.110> description<00:01:13.500> you'll<00:01:13.590> be<00:01:13.680> able<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.920> see<00:01:14.100> it

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
the description you'll be able to see it

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.429 
the description you'll be able to see it
another<00:01:14.760> thing<00:01:15.000> cool<00:01:15.150> thing<00:01:15.299> about<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.930> you

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
another thing cool thing about it is you

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.010 
another thing cool thing about it is you
know<00:01:16.619> works<00:01:16.890> between<00:01:17.540> testing<00:01:18.540> like<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> high

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
know works between testing like a high

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.929 
know works between testing like a high
res<00:01:19.229> model<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.040> normal<00:01:20.460> map<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.759> version

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
res model and it's normal map to version

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.340 
res model and it's normal map to version
you<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.330> kind<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.600> pop<00:01:21.780> back<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.110> forth

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
you can kind of pop back and forth

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.320 
you can kind of pop back and forth
between<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.770> two<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.280> see<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.700> how

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
between the two and you can see just how

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.690 
between the two and you can see just how
different<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.840> looking<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.250> also<00:01:26.400> hook

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
different is looking you can also hook

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.950 
different is looking you can also hook
up<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.939> camera<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.970> put<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.119> my<00:01:30.509> maximum

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
up a camera to it and put on my maximum

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.090 
up a camera to it and put on my maximum
camera<00:01:31.320> distance<00:01:31.680> here<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:33.560> now<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:34.890> move

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
camera distance here and now I can move

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.920 
camera distance here and now I can move
my<00:01:35.610> camera<00:01:36.000> back<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.600> see<00:01:36.780> it's

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
my camera back and I can see it's

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.080 
my camera back and I can see it's
switching<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.560> different<00:01:37.829> distances<00:01:38.400> so

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
switching it it's different distances so

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.090 
switching it it's different distances so
if<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.689> come<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:39.900> here<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.259> rotate<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.710> camera

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
if I come in here and rotate this camera

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.499 
if I come in here and rotate this camera
a<00:01:41.130> little<00:01:41.189> bit<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.790> see<00:01:41.850> there's<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.270> gun

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
a little bit you can see there's a gun

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.310 
a little bit you can see there's a gun
on<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.780> end<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:44.030> tank<00:01:45.170> you<00:01:46.170> can

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
on the end of that of that tank you can

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
on the end of that of that tank you can
see<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.649> go<00:01:46.860> away<00:01:47.899> it<00:01:48.899> goes<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.500> it's

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
see it go away it goes and it's

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.380 
see it go away it goes and it's
switching<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.790> can<00:01:50.909> see<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.180> switching

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
switching you can see it's switching

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.149 
switching you can see it's switching
right<00:01:51.689> here<00:01:52.369> through<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> list<00:01:54.890> so<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.040> is

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
right here through the list so this is

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.649 
right here through the list so this is
actually<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.490> really<00:01:56.670> really<00:01:56.880> cool<00:01:57.000> tool<00:01:57.390> and

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
actually a really really cool tool and

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.929 
actually a really really cool tool and
it's<00:01:57.750> really<00:01:57.869> easy<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.229> use<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.829> many<00:01:59.790> people

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
it's really easy to use and many people

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.760 
it's really easy to use and many people
don't<00:02:00.149> know<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.659> exists<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.350> works<00:02:01.530> for<00:02:01.740> a

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
don't know that it exists it works for a

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.649 
don't know that it exists it works for a
lot<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.219> things<00:02:02.340> not<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.700> LEDs<00:02:03.299> which<00:02:03.540> is

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
lot of things not just LEDs which is

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.639 
lot of things not just LEDs which is
being<00:02:03.840> able<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.110> switch<00:02:04.320> back<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.500> forth

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
being able to switch back and forth

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.969 
being able to switch back and forth
between<00:02:04.950> your<00:02:05.219> models<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:06.990> let's<00:02:07.590> go<00:02:07.710> look<00:02:07.860> at

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
between your models so let's go look at

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.580 
between your models so let's go look at
another<00:02:08.190> one

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.710 

this<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:13.800> file<00:02:14.130> here<00:02:14.490> this<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> character

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
this is a file here this is a character

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.560 
this is a file here this is a character
from<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.200> piece<00:02:16.590> off<00:02:16.740> 13<00:02:17.220> we<00:02:17.970> appreciate<00:02:18.180> them

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
from a piece off 13 we appreciate them

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.350 
from a piece off 13 we appreciate them
letting<00:02:18.840> us<00:02:19.050> use<00:02:19.080> some<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.950> their<00:02:20.040> content<00:02:20.490> um

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
letting us use some of their content um

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.600 
letting us use some of their content um
and<00:02:22.110> what<00:02:22.770> I'm<00:02:22.890> going<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.040> show<00:02:23.100> with<00:02:23.310> this<00:02:23.340> is

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
and what I'm going to show with this is

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.070 
and what I'm going to show with this is
a<00:02:23.640> couple<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.090> different<00:02:24.720> modeling

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
a couple of different modeling

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.070 
a couple of different modeling
techniques<00:02:25.950> one<00:02:26.670> thing<00:02:26.850> that's<00:02:27.000> going<00:02:27.990> on

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
techniques one thing that's going on

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.780 
techniques one thing that's going on
here<00:02:28.320> in<00:02:28.410> this<00:02:28.530> scene<00:02:28.770> is<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:29.040> have<00:02:29.370> an<00:02:29.520> editable

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
here in this scene is I have an editable

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.970 
here in this scene is I have an editable
mesh<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.560> have<00:02:31.710> an<00:02:31.830> editable<00:02:32.100> poly<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:33.980> I'm

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
mesh and I have an editable poly and I'm

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.350 
mesh and I have an editable poly and I'm
going<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.250> explain<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.640> little<00:02:35.850> bit<00:02:36.030> about<00:02:36.210> the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
going to explain a little bit about the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.660 
going to explain a little bit about the
differences<00:02:36.750> between<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.170> two<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.670> we're

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
differences between the two and we're

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.000 
differences between the two and we're
going<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:38.880> look<00:02:39.120> at<00:02:39.240> some<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:40.620> Edit

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
going to look at some of the the Edit

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.600 
going to look at some of the the Edit
poly<00:02:41.100> modeling<00:02:41.820> techniques<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:43.400> some<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.520> the

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
poly modeling techniques and some of the

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.130 
poly modeling techniques and some of the
tools<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:44.940> are<00:02:45.060> in<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.450> in<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.930> feature

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
tools that are in the in that feature

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.760 
tools that are in the in that feature
that<00:02:47.210> that<00:02:48.210> a<00:02:48.240> lot<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.480> people<00:02:48.709> don't<00:02:49.709> realize

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
that that a lot of people don't realize

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.100 
that that a lot of people don't realize
so<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.270> first<00:02:51.480> let's<00:02:51.660> talk<00:02:51.750> about<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
so so first let's talk about the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.810 
so so first let's talk about the
differences<00:02:52.470> between<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:53.070> dimension<00:02:53.610> edit

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
differences between a dimension edit

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.190 
differences between a dimension edit
poly<00:02:54.590> one<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.770> big<00:02:55.920> things<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.690> is<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:58.050> way

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
poly one of the big things is is the way

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.080 
poly one of the big things is is the way
that<00:02:58.350> they<00:02:58.500> deal<00:02:58.770> with<00:02:58.830> textures<00:02:59.400> so<00:02:59.910> for

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
that they deal with textures so for

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.400 
that they deal with textures so for
instance<00:03:00.180> if<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.540> come<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.050> grab<00:03:01.140> this

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
instance if I come in and grab this

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.090 
instance if I come in and grab this
editable<00:03:02.160> mesh<00:03:02.190> here<00:03:02.690> we'll<00:03:03.690> be<00:03:03.810> able<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.110> to

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
editable mesh here we'll be able to to

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.390 
editable mesh here we'll be able to to
go<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.400> make<00:03:05.490> some<00:03:05.520> changes<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:07.250> let's<00:03:08.250> go

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
go and make some changes so let's go

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.330 
go and make some changes so let's go
ahead<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.640> go<00:03:08.850> into<00:03:09.030> vertex<00:03:09.840> mode<00:03:09.990> here<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.590> i

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
ahead and go into vertex mode here and i

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.110 
ahead and go into vertex mode here and i
have<00:03:11.370> on<00:03:11.760> my<00:03:11.790> large<00:03:12.570> verts<00:03:12.930> in<00:03:13.230> my<00:03:13.830> scene<00:03:14.130> and

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
have on my large verts in my scene and

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.520 
have on my large verts in my scene and
enlarge<00:03:15.480> them<00:03:15.720> just<00:03:15.959> so<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.050> you<00:03:16.200> can<00:03:16.320> see

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
enlarge them just so that you can see

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.900 
enlarge them just so that you can see
them<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.709> little<00:03:16.860> bit<00:03:17.010> better<00:03:17.190> but<00:03:17.670> i'm<00:03:17.790> just

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
them a little bit better but i'm just

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:18.949 
them a little bit better but i'm just
going<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.060> go<00:03:18.209> somewhere<00:03:18.480> where<00:03:18.630> there's<00:03:18.780> some

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
going to go somewhere where there's some

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.229 
going to go somewhere where there's some
texture<00:03:19.410> this<00:03:19.620> guy<00:03:19.739> has<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:19.950> has<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.459> shader<00:03:21.000> on

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
texture this guy has a has a shader on

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.420 
texture this guy has a has a shader on
him<00:03:21.420> actually<00:03:21.570> if<00:03:21.989> we<00:03:22.080> come<00:03:22.260> in<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.530> scroll

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
him actually if we come in and scroll

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
him actually if we come in and scroll
around<00:03:23.550> you<00:03:23.940> can<00:03:24.090> see<00:03:24.120> his<00:03:24.989> chin<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:27.300> the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
around you can see his chin the the

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.110 
around you can see his chin the the
outline<00:03:27.750> goes<00:03:27.989> away<00:03:28.170> comes<00:03:29.070> back<00:03:29.340> goes<00:03:29.940> away

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
outline goes away comes back goes away

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.060 
outline goes away comes back goes away
this<00:03:30.540> is<00:03:30.720> just<00:03:30.870> an<00:03:31.019> effects<00:03:31.320> file<00:03:31.560> loaded<00:03:31.920> into

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
this is just an effects file loaded into

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.259 
this is just an effects file loaded into
max<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:33.680> mmm<00:03:34.680> his<00:03:35.220> texture<00:03:35.640> also<00:03:35.940> makes<00:03:36.150> them

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
max so mmm his texture also makes them

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.840 
max so mmm his texture also makes them
look<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:36.570> bookshelf<00:03:37.140> shaded<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:37.680> if<00:03:38.580> we<00:03:38.670> come

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
look a bookshelf shaded and if we come

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.880 
look a bookshelf shaded and if we come
in<00:03:38.970> here<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.300> just<00:03:39.390> go<00:03:39.600> in<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:39.959> do<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.170> collapse

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
in here and just go in and do a collapse

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.810 
in here and just go in and do a collapse
on<00:03:41.480> this<00:03:42.890> you<00:03:43.890> can<00:03:44.010> see<00:03:44.190> what's<00:03:44.400> going<00:03:44.640> on<00:03:44.760> with

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
on this you can see what's going on with

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.310 
on this you can see what's going on with
the<00:03:45.000> texture<00:03:45.300> there<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.930> that's<00:03:46.110> what

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
the texture there and that's what

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.500 
the texture there and that's what
happens<00:03:46.650> when<00:03:46.830> you're<00:03:47.070> with<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.790> edible

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
happens when you're with the edible

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.810 
happens when you're with the edible
meshes<00:03:48.870> now<00:03:49.530> if<00:03:49.860> we<00:03:49.980> go<00:03:50.130> in<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.400> see<00:03:50.580> if<00:03:50.610> I<00:03:50.700> can

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
meshes now if we go in and see if I can

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.500 
meshes now if we go in and see if I can
grab<00:03:51.030> this<00:03:51.180> here<00:03:51.530> pull<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:52.650> back<00:03:52.890> and<00:03:53.280> go<00:03:53.510> to

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
grab this here pull this back and go to

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.509 
grab this here pull this back and go to
the<00:03:54.690> same<00:03:54.900> model<00:03:55.110> here<00:03:55.500> in<00:03:55.790> editable<00:03:56.790> poly

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
the same model here in editable poly

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.960 
the same model here in editable poly
grab<00:03:59.519> these<00:03:59.700> two<00:03:59.940> points<00:04:01.610> where<00:04:02.610> we've<00:04:02.760> got

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
grab these two points where we've got

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.280 
grab these two points where we've got
some<00:04:03.180> texture<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:03.660> i'm<00:04:03.989> just<00:04:04.080> going<00:04:04.260> to

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
some texture and i'm just going to

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.600 
some texture and i'm just going to
collapse<00:04:04.620> these<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.190> you<00:04:05.250> can<00:04:05.370> see<00:04:05.519> the

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
collapse these and you can see the

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:06.560 
collapse these and you can see the
difference<00:04:05.910> that<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:06.180> makes<00:04:06.360> on<00:04:06.480> the

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
difference that that makes on the

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.270 
difference that that makes on the
texture<00:04:06.959> there<00:04:07.080> so<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.799> see<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.070> shoulders

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
texture there so you see the shoulders

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.420 
texture there so you see the shoulders
here<00:04:09.410> editable<00:04:10.410> poly<00:04:10.620> deals<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.040> lot<00:04:11.070> better

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
here editable poly deals a lot better

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.820 
here editable poly deals a lot better
with<00:04:11.610> texture<00:04:12.030> coordinates<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:12.590> it<00:04:13.590> also

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
with texture coordinates and it also

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.710 
with texture coordinates and it also
gives<00:04:13.920> you<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.250> couple<00:04:14.820> of<00:04:14.880> extra<00:04:15.180> little

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
gives you a couple of extra little

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.140 
gives you a couple of extra little
shortcuts<00:04:16.459> now<00:04:17.459> some<00:04:17.669> of<00:04:17.700> you<00:04:17.850> might<00:04:17.940> say<00:04:18.120> well

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
shortcuts now some of you might say well

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.060 
shortcuts now some of you might say well

modeling and all that kind of stuff and
a<00:04:25.410> good<00:04:25.560> way<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.740> do<00:04:25.920> that<00:04:26.070> is<00:04:26.130> just<00:04:26.280> come<00:04:26.639> in

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
a good way to do that is just come in

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.940 
a good way to do that is just come in
and<00:04:26.760> put<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.180> turn<00:04:27.389> to<00:04:27.540> mesh<00:04:27.720> on<00:04:27.930> top<00:04:28.139> of<00:04:28.320> your<00:04:28.470> on

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
and put a turn to mesh on top of your on

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.970 
and put a turn to mesh on top of your on
top<00:04:29.130> of<00:04:29.250> your<00:04:29.370> model<00:04:29.670> so<00:04:30.389> when<00:04:30.800> let's<00:04:31.800> actually

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
top of your model so when let's actually

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.250 
top of your model so when let's actually
do<00:04:32.310> that<00:04:32.430> before<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:32.850> do<00:04:32.970> I'm<00:04:33.720> going<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:33.930> come<00:04:34.139> in

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
do that before I do I'm going to come in

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.430 
do that before I do I'm going to come in
here<00:04:34.500> and<00:04:34.560> I'm<00:04:35.190> going<00:04:35.280> to<00:04:35.370> grab<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.580> selection

selection then i'm going to copy it and
just<00:04:50.580> add<00:04:50.790> a<00:04:50.820> new<00:04:51.030> map<00:04:51.270> channel<00:04:51.540> in<00:04:51.810> here<00:04:52.050> and

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
just add a new map channel in here and

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.650 
just add a new map channel in here and
i'm<00:04:53.520> going<00:04:53.610> to<00:04:53.669> paste<00:04:53.880> this<00:04:54.090> into<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.480> map

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
i'm going to paste this into the map

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.040 
i'm going to paste this into the map
channel<00:04:54.960> and<00:04:56.090> this<00:04:57.090> is<00:04:57.240> just<00:04:57.419> my<00:04:57.540> selection

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050

channel and this is just my selection
i'm<00:04:58.110> just<00:04:58.290> going<00:04:58.410> to<00:04:58.470> call<00:04:58.650> this<00:04:58.680> arm<00:04:59.600> shoulder

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
i'm just going to call this arm shoulder

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.460 
i'm just going to call this arm shoulder
and<00:05:02.840> i'm<00:05:03.840> just<00:05:03.930> going<00:05:04.110> to<00:05:04.140> store<00:05:04.440> that

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
and i'm just going to store that

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.170 
and i'm just going to store that
selection<00:05:04.919> in<00:05:05.160> there<00:05:05.280> temporarily<00:05:05.610> so<00:05:06.030> that<00:05:06.060> i

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
selection in there temporarily so that i

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.170 
selection in there temporarily so that i
can<00:05:06.270> get<00:05:06.419> back<00:05:06.540> to<00:05:06.720> that<00:05:06.750> one<00:05:06.990> finish<00:05:07.430> so<00:05:08.430> so

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
can get back to that one finish so so

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.430 
can get back to that one finish so so
let's<00:05:09.360> go<00:05:09.510> in<00:05:09.630> here<00:05:09.660> now<00:05:09.990> you<00:05:10.050> can<00:05:10.200> see<00:05:10.350> I've

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
and just go back to an editable poly for

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.320 
and just go back to an editable poly for
for<00:05:19.140> now<00:05:19.229> and<00:05:19.740> then<00:05:19.800> we'll<00:05:20.610> put<00:05:20.760> the<00:05:20.970> turn<00:05:21.150> to

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
for now and then we'll put the turn to

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.990 
for now and then we'll put the turn to
mesh<00:05:21.479> and<00:05:23.180> let's<00:05:24.180> go<00:05:24.330> around<00:05:24.630> here<00:05:24.810> and<00:05:24.900> get<00:05:25.020> it

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
mesh and let's go around here and get it

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.660 
mesh and let's go around here and get it
now<00:05:27.000> turn<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:27.300> manage
