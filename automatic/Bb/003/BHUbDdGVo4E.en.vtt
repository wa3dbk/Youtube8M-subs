00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160 

I<00:00:01.790> used<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.909> produce<00:00:03.060> blocks<00:00:03.540> for<00:00:03.870> various

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
I used to produce blocks for various

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.170 
I used to produce blocks for various
elevation<00:00:04.799> windows<00:00:05.190> that<00:00:05.460> I<00:00:05.549> needed<00:00:05.759> but<00:00:06.029> it

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
elevation windows that I needed but it

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.909 
elevation windows that I needed but it
seemed<00:00:06.450> that<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:06.720> never<00:00:06.960> had<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.440> right<00:00:07.649> one

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
seemed that I never had the right one

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.830 
seemed that I never had the right one
and<00:00:08.250> had<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.519> produce<00:00:08.670> from<00:00:09.120> scratch<00:00:09.480> or

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
and had to produce from scratch or

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.930 
and had to produce from scratch or
explode<00:00:10.380> or<00:00:10.590> wind<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.920> block<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.429> edit<00:00:11.759> it

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
explode or wind the block and edit it

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.970 
explode or wind the block and edit it
that's<00:00:12.660> why<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:12.960> wrote<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.380> AutoCAD

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
that's why I wrote this AutoCAD

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.730 
that's why I wrote this AutoCAD
application<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.030> call<00:00:15.330> wind<00:00:15.660> create<00:00:16.049> with

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
application that I call wind create with

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.439 
application that I call wind create with
this<00:00:16.890> simple<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.369> use<00:00:17.550> program<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:18.270> can

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
this simple to use program you can

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.540 
this simple to use program you can
easily<00:00:18.779> create<00:00:19.140> literally<00:00:19.650> thousands<00:00:20.460> of

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
easily create literally thousands of

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.480 
easily create literally thousands of
windows<00:00:21.000> let's<00:00:21.779> fire<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.320> up<00:00:22.470> for<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.769> brief

opens<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:30.300> first<00:00:30.570> thing<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.840> want<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.019> do

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
opens and the first thing you want to do

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.020 
opens and the first thing you want to do
and<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.349> only<00:00:31.529> have<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.949> do<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.250> once<00:00:32.669> for

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
and you only have to do this once for

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.410 
and you only have to do this once for
each<00:00:33.090> drawing<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:34.130> set<00:00:35.130> your<00:00:35.340> layers<00:00:35.579> up<00:00:36.059> so

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
each drawing is set your layers up so

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.119 
each drawing is set your layers up so
what<00:00:36.630> portions<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.410> wind<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.800> going<00:00:38.010> to

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
what portions of the wind is going to

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.270 
what portions of the wind is going to
draw<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.399> what<00:00:39.239> layers<00:00:40.040> everything<00:00:41.040> has<00:00:41.250> a

draw on what layers everything has a

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.920 
draw on what layers everything has a
Help<00:00:41.640> key<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.360> have<00:00:42.510> very<00:00:42.719> little

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
Help key so you have very little

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.950 
Help key so you have very little
learning<00:00:43.379> curve<00:00:43.649> here<00:00:43.879> you<00:00:44.879> can<00:00:45.090> see<00:00:45.570> which

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
learning curve here you can see which

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.619 
learning curve here you can see which

going<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.960> define<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.010> window<00:00:50.370> itself

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
going to define the window itself

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.959 
going to define the window itself
moderate<00:00:52.289> weight<00:00:52.500> windows<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.129> find<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.610> trim

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
moderate weight windows to find the trim

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.080
