stops and all of those different kind of
solo<00:04:14.750> techniques<00:04:15.320> so<00:04:15.560> that's<00:04:15.770> going<00:04:15.890> to<00:04:15.950> be

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
solo techniques so that's going to be

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.659 
solo techniques so that's going to be
further<00:04:16.250> on<00:04:16.459> down<00:04:16.489> the<00:04:16.700> road<00:04:17.030> as<00:04:17.299> we<00:04:17.540> explore

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
further on down the road as we explore

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.659 
further on down the road as we explore
in<00:04:19.669> a<00:04:19.850> median<00:04:20.209> even<00:04:20.480> up<00:04:20.600> to<00:04:20.720> advanced<00:04:21.020> playing

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
in a median even up to advanced playing

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.340 
in a median even up to advanced playing
there's<00:04:22.669> just<00:04:22.820> a<00:04:22.970> ton<00:04:23.390> of<00:04:23.450> information<00:04:23.930> we're

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
there's just a ton of information we're

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.310 
there's just a ton of information we're
going<00:04:24.470> to<00:04:24.530> cover<00:04:24.740> in<00:04:24.979> all<00:04:25.100> of<00:04:25.250> this<00:04:25.400> and

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
going to cover in all of this and

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.270 
going to cover in all of this and
these<00:04:26.410> different<00:04:26.740> lessons<00:04:26.980> are<00:04:27.040> going<00:04:27.070> to<00:04:27.220> be

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
these different lessons are going to be

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.750 
these different lessons are going to be
published<00:04:27.760> one<00:04:28.420> after<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.020> other<00:04:29.110> in<00:04:29.770> the

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
published one after the other in the

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.520 
published one after the other in the
right<00:04:31.030> order<00:04:31.360> so<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:31.960> don't<00:04:32.170> get<00:04:32.290> confused

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
right order so you don't get confused

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.170 
right order so you don't get confused
because<00:04:33.400> I<00:04:33.550> think<00:04:33.610> that's<00:04:33.880> one<00:04:34.030> of<00:04:34.060> the

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
because I think that's one of the

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.150 
because I think that's one of the
sources<00:04:34.510> of<00:04:34.690> people's<00:04:35.170> number<00:04:35.980> one

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
sources of people's number one

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.210 
sources of people's number one
frustration<00:04:37.030> is<00:04:37.270> that<00:04:38.110> they<00:04:38.350> get<00:04:38.530> bits<00:04:38.920> and

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
frustration is that they get bits and

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.250 
frustration is that they get bits and
pieces<00:04:39.820> of<00:04:39.850> information<00:04:40.210> but<00:04:40.990> they<00:04:41.020> can't

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
pieces of information but they can't

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.620 
pieces of information but they can't
really<00:04:41.470> put<00:04:41.680> it<00:04:41.800> all<00:04:42.010> together<00:04:42.390> right<00:04:43.390> so

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
really put it all together right so

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.600 
really put it all together right so
that's<00:04:43.870> really<00:04:44.410> been<00:04:44.560> my<00:04:44.710> main<00:04:45.040> goal<00:04:45.340> in

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
that's really been my main goal in

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.730 
that's really been my main goal in
creating<00:04:45.760> this<00:04:46.180> course<00:04:46.510> is<00:04:46.750> to<00:04:47.290> take<00:04:47.500> you

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
creating this course is to take you

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.970 
creating this course is to take you
step-by-step<00:04:48.700> and<00:04:49.540> build<00:04:49.810> each<00:04:50.020> lesson<00:04:50.620> on
