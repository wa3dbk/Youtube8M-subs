00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.889 

this<00:00:00.240> is<00:00:00.359> a<00:00:00.680> touch<00:00:01.680> table<00:00:02.100> that<00:00:02.220> you<00:00:02.280> built<00:00:02.899> can

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
this is a touch table that you built can

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.499 
this is a touch table that you built can
detect<00:00:04.319> any<00:00:04.500> number<00:00:04.740> of<00:00:04.859> touches<00:00:05.040> and<00:00:06.000> it

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
detect any number of touches and it

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.100 
detect any number of touches and it
works<00:00:07.099> by<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.130> total<00:00:09.090> of<00:00:09.300> twelve<00:00:09.570> inflection

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
works by a total of twelve inflection

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.100 
works by a total of twelve inflection
annoyed<00:00:10.519> so<00:00:11.519> it's<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.300> basically<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.840> vision

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
annoyed so it's a basically a vision

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.350 
annoyed so it's a basically a vision
based<00:00:13.259> system<00:00:13.799> there's<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.070> camera<00:00:14.610> underneath

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
based system there's a camera underneath

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.439 
based system there's a camera underneath
the<00:00:15.450> table<00:00:17.660> display<00:00:18.660> surface<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:20.449> it's

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
the table display surface and it's

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.700 
the table display surface and it's
looking<00:00:21.720> infrared<00:00:22.220> part<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.369> spectrum

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
interiors of the display surface this

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.500 
interiors of the display surface this
piece<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.640> acrylic<00:00:35.870> with<00:00:36.950> infrared<00:00:37.950> light<00:00:38.510> my

piece of acrylic with infrared light my
total<00:00:39.809> internal<00:00:40.140> reflection<00:00:40.760> very<00:00:41.760> little<00:00:42.059> of

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
total internal reflection very little of

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.959 
total internal reflection very little of
light<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.780> getting<00:00:43.079> back<00:00:43.590> back<00:00:44.460> scatter<00:00:44.789> to

light it's getting back back scatter to

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.900 
light it's getting back back scatter to
the<00:00:45.059> camera<00:00:45.539> until<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.379> touch<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.670> when<00:00:47.789> you

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
the camera until you touch and when you

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.520 
the camera until you touch and when you
touch<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.510> breaks<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.989> total<00:00:49.289> internal

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
touch that breaks the total internal

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.500 
touch that breaks the total internal
reflection<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:50.460> get<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> bright<00:00:50.879> infra<00:00:51.420> red

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
reflection you get a bright infra red

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.350 
reflection you get a bright infra red
spot<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.829> heads<00:00:53.010> back<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.610> back<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
spot that heads back to the back to the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.099 
spot that heads back to the back to the
camera<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.440> if<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:55.850> change<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.090> little<00:00:57.360> touch

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
camera so if we change this little touch

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.920 
camera so if we change this little touch
detector<00:00:58.649> here<00:00:59.420> what<00:01:00.420> we're<00:01:00.570> seeing<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
detector here what we're seeing in the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.900 
detector here what we're seeing in the
window<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.320> touch<00:01:01.530> detector<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
window of the touch detector is just the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.000 
window of the touch detector is just the
raw<00:01:03.090> image<00:01:03.420> right<00:01:03.600> out<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> camera<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.979> you

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
raw image right out of the camera so you

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.770 
raw image right out of the camera so you
can<00:01:05.129> see<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> touches<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.750> my

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
can see that the that the touches of my

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.899 
can see that the that the touches of my
fingers<00:01:07.260> appear<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> camera<00:01:08.369> images

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
fingers appear in the camera images

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.330 
fingers appear in the camera images
little<00:01:09.210> fuzzy<00:01:09.540> blobs<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.979> then<00:01:11.159> with<00:01:11.280> a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
little fuzzy blobs and then with a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.080 
little fuzzy blobs and then with a
little<00:01:11.430> bit<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.670> simple<00:01:12.630> image<00:01:12.810> processing

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
little bit of simple image processing

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.580 
little bit of simple image processing
that<00:01:15.090> gets<00:01:15.299> turned<00:01:15.540> into<00:01:15.720> touch<00:01:15.960> descriptions

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
that gets turned into touch descriptions

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.429 
that gets turned into touch descriptions
you're<00:01:17.340> their<00:01:17.490> number<00:01:17.820> contract<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.720> then

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
you're their number contract and then

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.980 
you're their number contract and then
those<00:01:19.590> touch<00:01:19.799> descriptions<00:01:20.369> are<00:01:20.990> made

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
those touch descriptions are made

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.340 
those touch descriptions are made
available<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> socket<00:01:23.040> for<00:01:23.549> any

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
available on a socket for any

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.700 
available on a socket for any
application<00:01:25.850> so<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> sequence<00:01:28.320> Iraq

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
application so this is a sequence Iraq

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.929 
application so this is a sequence Iraq
where<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:31.229> time<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.070> one<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.729> kind<00:01:32.850> of

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
where the time is one you can kind of

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.940 
where the time is one you can kind of
see<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.210> play<00:01:33.450> have<00:01:33.689> moved<00:01:33.990> there<00:01:34.259> 16<00:01:34.650> bars

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
see that play have moved there 16 bars

00:01:34.950 --> 00:02:16.520 
see that play have moved there 16 bars
and<00:01:35.329> each<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:37.079> rows<00:01:37.530> here

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.180 

so<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:18.100> is<00:02:18.250> another<00:02:19.320> we<00:02:20.320> actually<00:02:20.590> borrowed

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
so this is another we actually borrowed

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.220 
so this is another we actually borrowed
this<00:02:21.340> little<00:02:21.400> physics<00:02:22.060> simulation<00:02:22.630> from<00:02:22.900> some

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
this little physics simulation from some

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.550 
this little physics simulation from some
open<00:02:23.560> source<00:02:23.770> thing<00:02:23.920> we<00:02:24.010> found<00:02:24.160> on<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.430> web

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
open source thing we found on the web

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.810 
open source thing we found on the web
wired<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.710> up<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.190> multi-touch<00:02:27.610> surface

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
wired it up to the multi-touch surface

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.020 
wired it up to the multi-touch surface
so<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.860> can<00:02:30.070> grab<00:02:30.310> something<00:02:30.610> out<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.760> your

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
so you can grab something out of your

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.290 
so you can grab something out of your
finger<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:33.000> around

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
finger and around

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.300 
finger and around
something<00:02:36.230> in<00:02:36.350> two<00:02:36.470> places<00:02:38.410> around<00:02:39.410> and

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
something in two places around and

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.700 
something in two places around and
because<00:02:40.820> it's<00:02:41.000> all<00:02:41.290> live<00:02:42.290> and

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
because it's all live and

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.110 
because it's all live and
feels<00:02:45.710> somewhat<00:02:46.710> intuitive<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.430> move

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
feels somewhat intuitive to move

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.650 
feels somewhat intuitive to move
objects<00:02:48.659> around

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.970 

it<00:02:53.780> was<00:02:53.900> on<00:02:54.020> here

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.090 

it's<00:02:57.400> kind<00:02:57.760> of<00:02:57.790> fun<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:57.970> play<00:02:58.030> with

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.320 

sounds<00:03:03.100> a<00:03:03.160> few<00:03:03.340> bucks

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
sounds a few bucks

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.000 
sounds a few bucks
there<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:04.870> go<00:03:06.240> so<00:03:07.240> this<00:03:08.110> is<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.290> physics

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
there you go so this is a physics

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.300 
there you go so this is a physics
simulation<00:03:10.410> that's<00:03:11.410> a<00:03:11.590> difficulty<00:03:12.160> touch

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
simulation that's a difficulty touch

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.820 
simulation that's a difficulty touch
table<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:13.030> we<00:03:13.270> put<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.840> few<00:03:14.470> very<00:03:14.710> simple

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
table and we put a few very simple
