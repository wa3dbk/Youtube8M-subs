problems people have when they're trying

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.509 
problems people have when they're trying
to<00:00:06.420> mount<00:00:06.720> their<00:00:07.170> certain<00:00:07.950> boards<00:00:08.309> with

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
to mount their certain boards with

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.669 
to mount their certain boards with
either<00:00:08.700> an<00:00:08.970> old<00:00:09.150> binding<00:00:09.780> or<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:09.990> new<00:00:10.260> binding

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
either an old binding or a new binding

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.030 
either an old binding or a new binding
to<00:00:10.830> an<00:00:10.920> old<00:00:11.099> board<00:00:11.370> or<00:00:11.730> an<00:00:12.570> old<00:00:13.170> board<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> new

to an old board or an old board to a new
binding<00:00:14.460> it's<00:00:15.360> not<00:00:15.509> as<00:00:15.630> complicated<00:00:15.929> as<00:00:16.410> it

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
binding it's not as complicated as it

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.010 
binding it's not as complicated as it
sounds<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.220> we<00:00:17.430> have<00:00:17.609> all<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.020> different

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
sounds and we have all the different

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.650 
sounds and we have all the different
parts<00:00:19.320> here<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.619> make<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.890> work<00:00:20.359> first<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.570> all

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
parts here to make it work first of all

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.900 
parts here to make it work first of all
you<00:00:21.779> have<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:21.960> come<00:00:22.199> into<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.500> store<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.910> get

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
you have to come into the store and get

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.830 
you have to come into the store and get
the<00:00:24.300> Burton<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.470> sixth<00:00:25.920> transition<00:00:26.519> kit

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
the Burton and sixth transition kit

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.230 
the Burton and sixth transition kit
within<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.109> transition<00:00:28.740> kit<00:00:28.980> comes<00:00:29.519> extra

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
within the transition kit comes extra

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.430 
within the transition kit comes extra
disks<00:00:30.689> like<00:00:31.070> these<00:00:32.210> these<00:00:33.210> are<00:00:33.420> disks<00:00:33.870> because

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
disks like these these are disks because

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.590 
disks like these these are disks because
you<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:34.980> an<00:00:35.219> old<00:00:35.579> traditional<00:00:36.270> Burton

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
you have an old traditional Burton

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.510 
you have an old traditional Burton
bindings<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.320> if<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.500> have<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.680> binding<00:00:38.100> that's

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
bindings so if you have a binding that's

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.860 
bindings so if you have a binding that's
not<00:00:38.820> est<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.920> it's<00:00:40.920> not<00:00:41.219> reflex<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.750> a

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
not est and it's not reflex and it's a

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.229 
not est and it's not reflex and it's a
binding<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.800> could<00:00:43.950> be<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> cartel<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> mission

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
binding it could be a cartel a mission

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.330 
binding it could be a cartel a mission
or<00:00:45.360> whatever<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.809> doesn't<00:00:45.840> matter<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.950> disc

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
or whatever it doesn't matter this disc

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.790 
or whatever it doesn't matter this disc
will<00:00:47.640> fit<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.140> now<00:00:49.140> if<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.320> have<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> old

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
will fit in it now if you have the old

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.290 
will fit in it now if you have the old
binding<00:00:50.250> will<00:00:50.399> give<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> disc<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.239> you

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
binding will give you the disc and you

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.970 
binding will give you the disc and you
use<00:00:51.480> your<00:00:51.660> existing<00:00:51.930> hardware<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.620> mount<00:00:52.770> it

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
use your existing hardware to mount it

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.279 
use your existing hardware to mount it
but<00:00:53.280> another<00:00:53.699> question<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.420> if<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:56.100> a

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
but another question is if you have a

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.420 
but another question is if you have a
old<00:00:59.750> est<00:01:00.750> binding<00:01:00.960> with<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> old<00:01:01.980> mounting

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
old est binding with the old mounting

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.490 
old est binding with the old mounting
hardware<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.149> you're<00:01:03.629> trying<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.080> make<00:01:04.379> it

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
hardware and you're trying to make it

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.469 
hardware and you're trying to make it
work<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.949> newer<00:01:05.280> est<00:01:05.850> board<00:01:06.119> you're<00:01:06.299> gonna

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
work on a newer est board you're gonna

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.700 
work on a newer est board you're gonna
find<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.140> doesn't<00:01:07.350> fit<00:01:07.770> once<00:01:08.640> again<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
find that it doesn't fit once again the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.800 
find that it doesn't fit once again the
n6<00:01:10.710> transition<00:01:11.310> kit<00:01:11.549> comes<00:01:12.360> with<00:01:12.450> more

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
n6 transition kit comes with more

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.440 
n6 transition kit comes with more
hardware<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.740> you'll<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:15.150> cut

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
hardware so you'll have this in this cut

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.700 
hardware so you'll have this in this cut
out<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.930> board<00:01:16.229> you'll<00:01:16.380> see<00:01:16.560> it's

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
out in this board you'll see it's

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.679 
out in this board you'll see it's
different<00:01:16.830> than<00:01:17.159> they<00:01:17.250> cut<00:01:17.460> out<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.360> older

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
different than they cut out on the older

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.890 
different than they cut out on the older
boards<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.710> new<00:01:19.950> hardware<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.580> get

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
boards so this new hardware that you get

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.450 
boards so this new hardware that you get
accommodates<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.439> cut<00:01:22.680> out<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.310> newer

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
accommodates the cut out on the newer

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.420 
accommodates the cut out on the newer
boards<00:01:24.320> also<00:01:25.320> comes<00:01:25.710> with<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> new<00:01:26.070> hardware

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
boards also comes with the new hardware

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.810 
boards also comes with the new hardware
now<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> newer<00:01:27.600> binding<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.740> don't<00:01:29.729> get

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
now this is a newer binding so don't get

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.280 
now this is a newer binding so don't get
it<00:01:29.939> confused<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:30.659> old<00:01:30.840> binding

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
it confused with your old binding

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.050 
it confused with your old binding
because<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.220> going<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.400> be<00:01:32.520> different<00:01:32.909> down

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
because it's going to be different down

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.780 
because it's going to be different down
here<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.540> part<00:01:33.840> right<00:01:34.020> here<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.680> goes<00:01:35.490> into

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
here this part right here that goes into

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.910 
here this part right here that goes into
the<00:01:35.880> channel<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.720> your<00:01:36.900> old<00:01:37.079> binding<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.770> it

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
the channel on your old binding is it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.130 
the channel on your old binding is it
wide<00:01:38.220> enough<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.210> put<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.570> little<00:01:39.750> shim

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
wide enough so you put this little shim

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.410 
wide enough so you put this little shim
on<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.530> comes<00:01:40.740> with<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.369> six<00:01:41.790> transition

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
on that comes with it and six transition

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.590 
on that comes with it and six transition
together<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.439> goes<00:01:43.710> right<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.189> here

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
together and it just goes right on here

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.539 
together and it just goes right on here
you're<00:01:45.600> finding<00:01:45.810> goes<00:01:46.079> on<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.439> board<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.430> you

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
you're finding goes on the board and you

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.340 
you're finding goes on the board and you
need<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.939> use<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.509> new<00:01:48.659> hardware<00:01:48.689> that's
