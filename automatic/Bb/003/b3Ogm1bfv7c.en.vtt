 cinema gustavo they had to expose the sequence 8 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.480
 the challenge of learning to live together they chose me because it is my family 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.250
 from outside and since when 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.250
 from firemen in suez it seems that they themselves 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.920
 the historical ones in the class that we saw about the challenge of learning to live in 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.480
 this sequence we learned to identify the network of relationships that are generated 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.379
 with other people can live totally alone and without requiring 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.230
 someone else who must also bear in mind that all human acts 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.460
 positively and negatively influences the lives of other people 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.040

 winds of different types of garbage as they are by basic and inorganic 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.840
 we Mexicans and we do nothing to separate the garbage in its rescue 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.130
 and that brings as a consequence 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.930
 pollution in the soil 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.990
 of air and water in certain parts 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.300
 planet Earth 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.670
 on this occasion to some day 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.480
 because the planetarium 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.560

 we humans build the challenge of learning to live together 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.810
 but like my father Alberto as a member of the network 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.280
 they are always fighting 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.390
 if instead of quarreling they would put on talking about respect and so on 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.760

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.780

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:06.169
 now nobody says anything bad to say of solidarity the same line because 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.809
 but the place one another no one would understand children because of the environment 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:14.039
 they could not talk to civilized people nor would they always have a 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:18.180
 a problem with everything by his way of being or speaking a minute would like 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:21.399

 comments cross purple fingers regime now they will always annoy you 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.759
 that's why they have to learn to live with it 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.289
 maybe solidarity 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:34.939
 for that reason his success and that he even talked about session 75 and 76 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.099
 we grant to others 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.749
 when people become aware that others are worthy and do not deserve the same 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:44.379
 respect or collaborate so that those who are in disadvantageous situations 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.359
 can move forward there a better life be sensitive those who 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.649

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:57.079
 control emotions being committed to others for 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.129
 provide them with critical support for the daily events that happens in the 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.349
 family school location in the country and around the world 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.759

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:13.649
 Charitable act is an effort of social cooperation and an initiative 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:16.649

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.480
