00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.890
 hello and welcome dear 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.050
 people and yes i want to join again 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.720
 a slightly different video after he yes 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.060
 already my church dmt a bit inex 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.620
 I want to have experienced you now 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.280
 Just explain how to do it at all 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:38.910
 such a burner starts here our 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.580
 my cherry dmt was suitable 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.290
 perfect 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.530
 yes, what do you need for such a car 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.710
 this time the model is the one to throw at 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.339
 Remote clear a glow candle so 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.920
 in glow plugs plug looks like this 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:58.589
 and of course the fuel and the tank 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.710
 Bottle meadow at the child as first 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:04.110
 even sprite in the tank people too 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.380
 do not even get this upset and 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.690
 clean the tank bottle and pump it 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.650
 means to press and then release 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:16.110
 points automatically then we would already have 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.270
 time the fuel in the tank bottle now 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.140
 Of course you have to sprit the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.880
 make motor 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.560
 But that means tank cap on thanks 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.120
 roger rows and suck clean 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.980
 I have a little rest now 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.980
 in it just to show 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.140
 of course we have to sprit from 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.740
 Of course, gas tank cover also in the engine 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.600
 or carburetor so that means we are 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.500
 take here once the breakout 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.520
 and pull two three times on the cable 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.900
 assuming you have no pump here 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.340
 There are also models that have one here 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.850
 You just have to pump it a few times 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.930
 points 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.170
 Unfortunately, that does not work for me automatically 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.440
 so 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.130
 then we would have the sprit in the engine or 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.890
 carburetor now we have to do that 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.500
 Check for functionality on the car 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.649
 means we switch first on the model 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.160
 the remote control and then at the 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.160
 reconciliation set 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:22.459
 Afterwards we check whether the gas and brake 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.459
 once the steering function works 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.810
 well that works so very well now 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.840
 if you start the car at the first start 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.370
 First of all , the state would be me 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.870
 Just recommend the car to 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.850
 score on such a stone or so 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.940
 must now but do not put make 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:46.700
 so then we can get the glow plugs 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:48.460
 plug in here on the motor and plug 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.960
 then we pull a few times vigorously 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:03:00.080
 Can sweat where to go someday 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:03:03.260
 That's how it looks like that model 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.790
 then go here and then pull hard 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.320
 then he would have to tackle if 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.830
 everything is set as far as at 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.830
 I look 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.490
 then it is also on 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.459
 May 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.260
 these
