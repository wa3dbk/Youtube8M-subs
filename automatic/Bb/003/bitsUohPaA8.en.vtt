00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.460
 we stand in at the town hall 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.730
 olde pants 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.309
 on the first Saturday of 2015 after that 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.230
 it has become known that this afternoon at three 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.869
 hours a tragic accident 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.199
 took place at the 14th classic car 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.150
 meeting in oosterwolde where a 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.670
 accident happened with a platform 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.220
 where 1 dead person can be regretted and 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.920
 several injured including unfortunately 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.390
 seven children the situation is critical 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.050
 we have heard 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.780
 you have been called from various media 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.690
 called called the place can gone 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.440
 give you a brief when found 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.300
 and what has happened as you say 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.890
 it is an event in oosterwolde 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.829
 is held every year 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.940
 a lot of good weather public there is the 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.000
 Platform 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.770
 who has also had such a thing in many years 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.210
 bin where people can then stand and 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.980
 then you go up and a nice overview 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.379
 view 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.080
 so that was now the case and in one 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.030
 in some other way is the aerial platform 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.619
 to free that not so that the bin to 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.180
 it has fallen down but that it is gone too 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.799
 in totality is therefore cut with the off 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.600
 to keep up 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.950
 So that is still not stable enough 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:24.000
 you could conclude that the bin is empty 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.229
 one on one man and encounter and that is 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.380
 died of it 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.619
 I understand that almost immediately 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.240
 deceased was killed instantly 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.670
 that study in that sense in the council and 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.009
 by regretting the victim and that is 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.299
 it is one of the van villages 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.329
 oosterwolde 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.490
 that is very slow my life went to the 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.380
 family also very emphatically from me 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.320
 I also spoke with Mrs. Hammond 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.780
 not contain children 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.050
 that is actually the summary of 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.680
 the feeling that I also have in oosterwolde 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.820
 have experienced it and in addition that 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.040
 injured 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.940
 we out of seven children are three 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.940
 adults 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.490
 Most of them come out in detail 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.990
 such as tool or environment research and that 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.260
 have been brought to a hospital in 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.720
 swollen or had work and some 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.350
 its number is also called 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.140
 seriously 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.660
 the people that I know is not that sense 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.920
 also exciting of how are you now 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.150
 continue with a 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.640
 the people who are seriously injured how 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.640
 that expires so the tension is palpable 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.140
 it's just a drama and drama in one 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.650
 act has also responded via the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.670
 press 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.670
 please specify drift face 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.970
 well i heard its a oostwold 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.400
 is a close-knit community that is what 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.980
 often comes together and then 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.490
 from theo all this time this this 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.010
 to happen 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.750
 that chops enormously and at the same time feel 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.920
 you too 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.270
 that we have feelings and this cannot be true 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.220
 There is something that we must do ourselves 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.130
 realize the white tooth log 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.110
 we did it so we have to 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.600
 realized coming days it goes like 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.250
 with deep penetration and then it is good 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.350
 it is a community that is going to 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.940
 see each other because people have it 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.380
 there is no serious need either 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.660
 victim support is also involved 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.570
 but it it it is just especially together 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.090
 to grasp the word and sad the 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.980
 and remains a day for them to think about it 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.600
 Also on May 4 comes natural remembering 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.670
 will be May 5 is still in it than the 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.010
 celebrated in the municipality are still there 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.100
 consequences for 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.900
 i look i just talked in anyway 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.010
 the hall like that the church where people then 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.010
 now we are taken care of 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.360
 and I've also had conversations with 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.340
 with family and people involved it is above all 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.400
 also to themselves and to determine how they 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.630
 want to process it together 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.660
 I agreed that I am in consultation 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:00.410
 with him freely viewing that 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.600
 experience it all together or know it 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.210
 there is something to do together let me 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.640
 know what your wishes of indian is 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.560
 For pity's still a bit 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.910
 of course labor inspection does so 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.270
 this moment I still think research 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.210
 it is now about six o'clock from that 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.239
 natural result 

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:23.030
 what is done with it's talk of 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.229
 research indeed that must be done 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.880
 so about standard but that must also be 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:31.070
 certainly happen and the leading in it is there 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.110
 it is also my ministry intentions s 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.289

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.050
 that something did not go wrong once 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.820
 but it must be figured out how 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.200
