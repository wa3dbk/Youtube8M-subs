now<00:03:51.650> you<00:03:51.709> know<00:03:51.890> why<00:03:52.040> clear<00:03:52.340> that<00:03:52.489> stair<00:03:52.790> step

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
now you know why clear that stair step

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.559 
now you know why clear that stair step
earlier<00:03:53.950> that<00:03:54.950> is<00:03:55.099> one<00:03:55.489> nasty<00:03:55.909> ambushed

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
earlier that is one nasty ambushed

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
attempt and now with a skull key we can

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.800 
attempt and now with a skull key we can
proceed<00:04:03.860> to<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.250> actual<00:04:04.700> lumper<00:04:05.090> processing

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
proceed to the actual lumper processing

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:27.230 
proceed to the actual lumper processing
area<00:04:06.110> right

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.590
