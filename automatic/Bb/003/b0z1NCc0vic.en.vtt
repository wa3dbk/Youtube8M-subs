00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
it's during this gameplay it did use

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.560 
it's during this gameplay it did use
pretty<00:01:08.280> much<00:01:08.369> almost<00:01:08.760> exactly<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> same

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
pretty much almost exactly the same

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.250 
pretty much almost exactly the same
method<00:01:09.810> as<00:01:10.170> Benny<00:01:10.979> used<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.430> his<00:01:11.990> 316<00:01:12.990> 2<00:01:13.140> a1

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
method as Benny used in his 316 2 a1

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.770 
method as Benny used in his 316 2 a1
gameplay<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.000> course<00:01:15.210> he<00:01:15.330> swapped<00:01:15.600> out

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
gameplay but of course he swapped out

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.020 
gameplay but of course he swapped out
the<00:01:15.810> swarm<00:01:16.320> for<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> dogs<00:01:16.860> that's<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.640> me<00:01:17.759> kind

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the swarm for the dogs that's to me kind

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.789 
the swarm for the dogs that's to me kind
of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> know<00:01:18.810> seems<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.409> thing<00:01:19.439> that

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
of the know seems like the thing that

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.460 
of the know seems like the thing that
costing<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> 300<00:01:21.060> plus<00:01:21.150> game<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.259> did

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
costing the 300 plus game but it did

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.690 
costing the 300 plus game but it did
indeed<00:01:22.830> keep<00:01:23.009> them<00:01:23.130> kind<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.400> more<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
indeed keep them kind of more on the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.940 
indeed keep them kind of more on the
safe<00:01:23.939> side<00:01:24.030> because<00:01:24.330> swarms<00:01:24.869> are<00:01:25.049> notorious

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
safe side because swarms are notorious

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.160 
safe side because swarms are notorious
for<00:01:25.979> killing<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:27.450> team<00:01:27.689> killing<00:01:27.990> you

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.710 
up for 8 p.m. GMT instead of 6 Plaza we
realize<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.120> majority<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.600> our

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
realize that the majority of our

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.300 
realize that the majority of our
subscribes<00:02:37.200> on<00:02:37.380> this<00:02:37.500> channel<00:02:37.740> are<00:02:37.950> actually

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
subscribes on this channel are actually

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.280 
subscribes on this channel are actually
from<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.640> UK<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.630> didn't<00:02:39.900> really<00:02:39.930> make<00:02:40.230> too

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
from the UK so it didn't really make too

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.260 
from the UK so it didn't really make too
much<00:02:40.650> sense<00:02:40.710> to<00:02:41.040> use<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.340> UK<00:02:41.670> based<00:02:41.910> and

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
much sense to use the UK based and

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.260 
much sense to use the UK based and
upload<00:02:42.870> schedule<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.890> we<00:02:43.980> slightly<00:02:44.430> get<00:02:44.910> up<00:02:45.090> to

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
upload schedule so we slightly get up to

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.970 
upload schedule so we slightly get up to
it<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.390> bit<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.720> map<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:45.930> kind<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.710> make<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:46.890> more

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
it a bit to map to kind of make it more

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.800 
it a bit to map to kind of make it more
friendly<00:02:47.280> for<00:02:47.640> all<00:02:47.670> time<00:02:48.060> zones<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.510> bit<00:02:48.660> more

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810
