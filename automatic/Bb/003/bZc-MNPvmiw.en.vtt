00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.490
 and this despite all the sites 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.490
 and at least somehow in what form 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.889
 bought a house of culture 3 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.629
 because it is cheaper than 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.629
 commissions 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.579
 yes even the ruler 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.579
 type advice 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.520
 P 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.930
 from which number them 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.660
 there is still 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.770
 this feat for what 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.189
 process 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:35.369
 the main thing that was not 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:39.479
 chance 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.859
 total circulation of the show 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:52.059
 Let's be 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:56.899
 student wager bid 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:58.539
 stamp 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:00.129
 I knew how 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:01.619
 in the house accumulated 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:03.049
 V.i.t. 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.769
 a tube 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.769
 because clear pictures 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.749
 before 1 7 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:15.039
 booked 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:18.039
 and because he writes unn 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:21.669
 in order to shortened 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.109
 now 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:30.419
 scientists succeeded
