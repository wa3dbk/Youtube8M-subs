it would actually fit in the hole and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.650 
it would actually fit in the hole and
this<00:00:43.200> does<00:00:43.500> actually<00:00:43.770> fit<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.430> hole<00:00:44.660> we

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
you can see it's hooked right into the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.940 
you can see it's hooked right into the
plumbing<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:16.430> all<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.850> do<00:01:18.409> is<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.710> turn

it takes six minutes to fill that up
that's<00:01:31.900> not<00:01:32.140> bad<00:01:32.170> six<00:01:33.070> minutes<00:01:33.310> fill<00:01:34.090> that<00:01:34.210> up

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
was like 30 gallons 35 gallons and I can

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.970 
was like 30 gallons 35 gallons and I can
actually<00:01:41.560> get<00:01:41.800> almost<00:01:42.730> 30<00:01:43.060> gallons<00:01:43.510> in<00:01:43.630> this

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
but you see that that's going to work

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.370 
but you see that that's going to work
out<00:01:48.850> pretty<00:01:49.030> good<00:01:49.270> now<00:01:49.780> I<00:01:49.810> didn't<00:01:50.140> have<00:01:50.260> to

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
out pretty good now I didn't have to

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.540 
out pretty good now I didn't have to
drill<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.710> holes<00:01:50.920> here<00:01:53.040> turn<00:01:54.040> that<00:01:54.190> off<00:01:54.250> some

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
drill the holes here turn that off some

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.310 
drill the holes here turn that off some
little<00:01:54.850> quieter<00:01:55.270> I<00:01:55.450> didn't<00:01:55.930> have<00:01:56.020> to<00:01:56.110> drill

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
little quieter I didn't have to drill

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.470 
little quieter I didn't have to drill
the<00:01:56.410> holes<00:01:56.620> that<00:01:57.340> one<00:01:57.520> right<00:01:57.670> there<00:01:57.940> that's

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
the holes that one right there that's

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.240 
the holes that one right there that's
for<00:01:58.780> my<00:01:58.870> draw<00:01:59.080> tube<00:01:59.380> that<00:01:59.770> goes<00:01:59.830> all<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.160> way

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
for my draw tube that goes all the way

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.430 
for my draw tube that goes all the way
down<00:02:00.280> into<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.790> sump<00:02:01.030> in<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.300> bottom<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.260> of

down into the sump in the bottom and of

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.700 
down into the sump in the bottom and of
course<00:02:02.650> that's<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.040> stem<00:02:03.880> that<00:02:04.500> fills<00:02:05.500> that

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
course that's the stem that fills that

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.460 
course that's the stem that fills that
fills<00:02:05.980> it<00:02:06.130> up<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:07.330> all<00:02:07.480> that<00:02:07.660> is<00:02:07.840> is<00:02:08.050> half<00:02:08.230> inch

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
fills it up and all that is is half inch

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.440 
fills it up and all that is is half inch
pipe<00:02:08.710> fitting<00:02:09.070> you<00:02:09.640> use<00:02:09.820> a<00:02:09.850> three-quarter

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
pipe fitting you use a three-quarter

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.560 
pipe fitting you use a three-quarter
inch<00:02:10.600> bit<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.220> plastic<00:02:12.730> is<00:02:13.090> soft<00:02:13.420> enough

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
inch bit and the plastic is soft enough

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.080 
inch bit and the plastic is soft enough
that<00:02:14.020> that<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:15.100> will<00:02:15.220> take<00:02:15.400> its<00:02:15.580> own<00:02:15.730> thread<00:02:16.000> of

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
that that it will take its own thread of

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.460 
that that it will take its own thread of
course<00:02:16.300> you<00:02:16.390> want<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.600> put<00:02:16.720> pipe<00:02:16.900> thread<00:02:17.170> on<00:02:17.350> it

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
course you want to put pipe thread on it

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.590 
course you want to put pipe thread on it
and<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.100> put<00:02:18.310> these<00:02:18.430> little<00:02:18.670> rubber<00:02:18.880> seals<00:02:19.330> in

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
and I put these little rubber seals in

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.870 
and I put these little rubber seals in
here<00:02:19.630> around<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.230> bottom<00:02:20.590> just<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.760> ensure

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
here around the bottom just to ensure

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.090 
here around the bottom just to ensure
that<00:02:22.300> when<00:02:22.810> they're<00:02:22.960> tightened<00:02:23.290> up<00:02:23.380> that<00:02:23.650> you

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
that when they're tightened up that you

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.130 
that when they're tightened up that you
know<00:02:24.220> it<00:02:24.340> don't<00:02:24.460> leak<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.630> like<00:02:25.780> said<00:02:26.050> it

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
know it don't leak and like said it

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.600 
know it don't leak and like said it
takes<00:02:26.260> about<00:02:26.410> six<00:02:26.770> minutes<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.190> fill<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.490> up

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
takes about six minutes to fill it up

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.100 
takes about six minutes to fill it up
actually<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.150> takes<00:02:28.300> about<00:02:28.480> six<00:02:28.750> minutes<00:02:28.960> to

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
actually it takes about six minutes to

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
used in making this quilt and it is

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.950 
used in making this quilt and it is
beautiful<00:06:09.729> once<00:06:10.180> I<00:06:10.270> get<00:06:10.449> my<00:06:10.479> full<00:06:10.750> size

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
beautiful once I get my full size

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:13.149 
mattress back in there or in there then

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:15.300 
mattress back in there or in there then
you<00:06:13.360> can<00:06:13.539> you<00:06:13.930> I'll<00:06:14.289> take<00:06:14.500> a<00:06:14.529> videos<00:06:14.919> you<00:06:15.219> can

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
you can you I'll take a videos you can

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.389 
you can you I'll take a videos you can
see<00:06:15.460> what<00:06:15.610> it<00:06:15.699> all<00:06:15.789> looks<00:06:15.819> like<00:06:16.089> together<00:06:16.539> but

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:17.399 
see what it all looks like together but

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:19.709 
see what it all looks like together but
this<00:06:18.399> will<00:06:18.580> probably<00:06:18.759> be<00:06:18.939> about<00:06:19.180> it<00:06:19.240> for<00:06:19.629> the

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:19.719 
this will probably be about it for the

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:22.439 
this will probably be about it for the
year<00:06:19.960> working<00:06:20.560> on<00:06:20.649> the<00:06:20.770> motor<00:06:20.919> home<00:06:21.419> like<00:06:22.419> I

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449 
year working on the motor home like I

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.439 
year working on the motor home like I
said<00:06:22.659> this<00:06:22.810> is<00:06:23.110> what<00:06:23.649> I've<00:06:23.770> been<00:06:23.800> working<00:06:24.219> on

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449 
said this is what I've been working on

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:28.769 
said this is what I've been working on
because<00:06:26.580> it's<00:06:27.580> coming<00:06:28.000> up<00:06:28.120> on<00:06:28.270> winter<00:06:28.569> time

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:28.779 
because it's coming up on winter time

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:33.209

and I have to winterize the motor home
unfortunately<00:06:34.120> it's<00:06:34.270> time<00:06:34.779> to<00:06:34.930> put<00:06:35.080> it<00:06:35.169> up<00:06:35.319> I

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
put it up but it's that time and what I

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.219 
put it up but it's that time and what I
do<00:06:41.889> when<00:06:42.189> I<00:06:42.250> waiter<00:06:42.580> eyes<00:06:42.819> them<00:06:43.029> I<00:06:43.210> just<00:06:43.810> dumped

do when I waiter eyes them I just dumped
10<00:06:44.469> gallons<00:06:44.889> of<00:06:45.069> antifreeze<00:06:46.029> in<00:06:46.419> the<00:06:46.509> tank

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
10 gallons of antifreeze in the tank

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.709 
10 gallons of antifreeze in the tank
turned<00:06:47.800> a<00:06:47.919> little<00:06:48.039> pump<00:06:48.370> on<00:06:48.580> there<00:06:48.819> and<00:06:49.000> flood

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:49.719 
turned a little pump on there and flood

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:51.010 
turned a little pump on there and flood
the<00:06:49.750> entire<00:06:49.959> system

with antifreeze including the water
heater<00:06:52.940> that's<00:06:53.930> probably<00:06:54.319> not<00:06:54.830> the<00:06:54.889> right<00:06:55.340> way

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:55.669 
heater that's probably not the right way

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.629 
heater that's probably not the right way
to<00:06:55.729> do<00:06:56.000> it<00:06:56.120> but<00:06:56.300> I<00:06:56.419> know<00:06:56.919> that<00:06:57.919> everything<00:06:58.310> will

00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 
to do it but I know that everything will

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:00.219 
to do it but I know that everything will
have<00:06:58.879> antifreeze<00:06:59.180> in<00:06:59.569> it<00:06:59.659> all<00:06:59.840> the<00:06:59.870> fittings

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:00.229 
have antifreeze in it all the fittings

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:03.010 
have antifreeze in it all the fittings
all<00:07:00.740> the<00:07:01.000> nozzles<00:07:02.000> all<00:07:02.240> the<00:07:02.509> although

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020 
all the nozzles all the although

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.040 
all the nozzles all the although
everything<00:07:03.409> so<00:07:04.539> anyway<00:07:05.539> i'll<00:07:05.690> probably<00:07:05.870> be

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050 
everything so anyway i'll probably be

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.029 
everything so anyway i'll probably be
doing<00:07:06.199> that<00:07:07.210> here<00:07:08.210> in<00:07:08.300> a<00:07:08.360> week<00:07:08.479> or<00:07:08.659> two<00:07:08.810> but<00:07:09.590> for

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 
doing that here in a week or two but for

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:12.219 
doing that here in a week or two but for
now<00:07:10.509> like<00:07:11.509> said<00:07:11.750> this<00:07:11.930> would<00:07:12.110> have<00:07:12.199> been

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:12.229 
now like said this would have been

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:15.100 
now like said this would have been
working<00:07:12.590> on<00:07:12.710> all<00:07:13.280> i<00:07:13.400> got<00:07:13.580> to<00:07:13.610> do<00:07:13.960> turn<00:07:14.960> that
