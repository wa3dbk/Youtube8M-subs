00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.310

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.720
 nickel 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.330
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.099
 new video on gta 5 online and like 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.810
 you can see the dco 10 is 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.939
 now available online 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.830
 thanks to a new import glitch 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.029
 which is pretty simple so what am I going 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.890
 present you in a few hours 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.690
 there I am on the mount trying to you 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.460
 make a video we see the point of view 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.100
 of the two people for this to be the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.449
 simpler for you so wait 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.050
 still a little glitch will be soon 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:41.280
 available 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.960
 and I hope it will make you happy 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.430
 so frankly this vehicle is 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.140
 really beautiful look there we are 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.700
 several to have in the session on 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.039
 was having fun all night we could see 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.590
 that that armored vehicle and still 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.640
 more resistant than kourouma it is 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.320
 destroyed only I believe after the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.600
 third rocket launcher 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.100
 which is still really huge 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.270
 can we frankly customize it 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.379
 put any color you can 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.460
 a little team and frankly that's 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.809
 really beautiful 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.949
 I took out a video ago 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.960
 some time for you so ask 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.880
 if you wanted this vehicle in 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.399
 online we tried to ask 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.020
 rockstar we will say eh ben 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.490
 rockstar did not answer a sudden 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.750
 new glitch is available for 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.299
 to have it and frankly as I say 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.439
 the glitch is really simple the only 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.090
 little negative point is that it takes 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.310
 have unlocked trevor in the mode 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.290
 story so for people who have 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.240
 restarted an account or something like that 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.200
 be careful try to move fast 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.390
 in the story mode or so of 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.650
 find someone who through a 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.450
 story mode to be able then 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.460
 duplicate this vehicle that he they 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.750
 would have imported and so that's me 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.310
 will leave you on this gameplay or in 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.360
 helping each other bet an ambulance like 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.189
 I told him we really enjoyed ourselves 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.840
 the whole tribute evening that had not 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.759
 the rule of the voices otherwise we would have even 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.009
 could you do a little a little episode 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.479
 finished and so here at just now for 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.920
