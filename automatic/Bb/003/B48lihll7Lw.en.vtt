00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.160
 Hi guys, this video is showing 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.020
 how to make fip replacement 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.099
 modernize ikea models that need it 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.869
 making the exchange, huh? 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.320
 Then there is some problem of not 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.779
 recognize the teacher update 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.160
 or even who the chip needs to replace 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.349
 huh 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.149
 Here's the chip model I'm going to show here. 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.239
 the first or rechargeable cartridge 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:34.640
 of booking than in the case of 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.440
 transparent it already comes with a chip 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.350
 with a double-sided glue né 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.370
 tone with stylus you come here by 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.190
 to draw out or out 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.190
 and there is the neighbor chip there you do 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.570
 replacement and back to work already has 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.670
 some models you do not accept 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.359
 so you have to be using the chip 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.219
 so this will get you a 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.280
 Left, I always do with a torch. 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.589
 neocom thermal blower 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.140
 binds to and is here and only one 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:09.500
 bit on the chip check back 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.090
 he has the plastic piece and he got 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.680
 kind of soft huh 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:19.369
 so you come here neither for the front and 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:25.040
 can remove the chip showing that with 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:26.630
 also left the efacec with left already 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.509
 begins to see a little, right? 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:36.280
 that there is no road and go up with 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.280
 careful you can not break the chip 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.590
 the blower there depending on the 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:07.290
 region and a farm and can already be 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:07.290
 Calm down then so it came out xii 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.600
 showing improvement 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.660
 if you check it came right 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.660
 little black head did not break 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.230
 O 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.960
 It's just a hint that there is right and that 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:34.860
 glue that goes is causing it to loose 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:38.800
 né glue of the medium is that the chip intact né 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.040
 here if you check the two 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.040
 extremities 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:50.740
 he has an easy double glue a ball 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:53.130
 Black you come here in the right position will 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.130
 put on 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.420
 it has to come forward we will 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.909
 stay like an original cartridge 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.459
 he does not stay here 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:13.590
 The distance, right, it was right. 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.959
 only he might fall, right? 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.640
 He takes very little then you 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:29.010
 take the little hot ball that puts 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:32.250
 here is little thing the fixed 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:36.569
 this one will recognize if you have 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:40.139
 that taking great care will 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:43.560
 show a chip because it can not 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:54.000
 Break anything can be in a play here 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:57.780
 in the case where it is not certain that it will 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.129
 acknowledge showing 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.799
 here again 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.090
 the position is it has to be the same 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.819
 original style 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:10.470
 You can not put it behind you. 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:12.180
 see the chip that comes there speaks because the other 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.810
 publication is not original 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.099
 he is bigger then the contacts in stay 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.810
 in front of you 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:21.269
 so this is it people will have it 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.610
 understood the procedure I already do here 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.620
 technical assistance often does not 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.750
 it works 100% right? 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.940
 some machines that finishes 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.199
 damaging guy is going to be like that says 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.110
 who smokes but ends up not working 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:39.330
 I do not opt to ever original and that 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.340
 It works 100% right and the times 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.229
 install on the cartridge they do not you have 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.599
 that he is acquiring a product has 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.909
 some doubt a week and a half to support 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:50.430
 stealing while committing and voting to assist 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:52.289

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:57.470
