00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
and he somehow gets it and passes across

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.580 
and he somehow gets it and passes across
I<00:00:56.670> don't<00:00:56.879> know<00:00:56.940> what<00:00:57.120> went<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.420> good<00:00:57.570> was<00:00:58.230> doing

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
I don't know what went on good was doing

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.130 
I don't know what went on good was doing
there<00:00:58.770> but<00:00:59.059> either<00:01:00.059> way<00:01:00.270> yes<00:01:00.449> his<00:01:00.600> formation<00:01:00.840> I

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
there but either way yes his formation I

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.869 
there but either way yes his formation I
just<00:01:01.320> hate<00:01:01.649> ya<00:01:01.829> know<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.160> decided<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.550> change<00:01:02.730> do

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
just hate ya know I decided to change do

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.420 
just hate ya know I decided to change do
it<00:01:02.969> here<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.359> kind<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.600> counteract<00:01:03.930> it

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
it here just to kind of counteract it

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.260 
it here just to kind of counteract it
the<00:01:05.430> reason<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:05.729> good<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.909> because<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.180> you

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
the reason it's good is because if you

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.730 
the reason it's good is because if you
can<00:01:06.540> go<00:01:06.630> out<00:01:06.780> for<00:01:06.810> attacking<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.590> set

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
can go out for attacking and you can set

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.440 
can go out for attacking and you can set
