July 29, 2009 Sadaharu Tanikawa Interview 2 of 7

00:00:05.708 --> 00:00:10.133
T: We want more than just preliminaries at high-school gyms,

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:15.279
we want K-1 clubs in schools.

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.410
Actually we have several schools asking about creating K-1 clubs.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.115
A: That's amazing!

00:00:21.115 --> 00:00:29.486
T: So we won't have just the Koshien event,

00:00:29.486 --> 00:00:35.407
but actually have kids in high school who can aim for

00:00:35.407 --> 00:00:45.080
regional and national tournaments just like with soccer and baseball.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:57.749
This could tie up to the possible 2016 Tokyo Olympics.

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:06.613
That is one possibility.

00:01:06.613 --> 00:01:13.311
We want K-1 in the Olympics.

00:01:13.311 --> 00:01:15.853
A: It could be difficult.

00:01:15.853 --> 00:01:22.959
T: Judo became an olympic event in 1964 at the previous Tokyo Olympics.

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:31.782
If Tokyo gets chosen then Japan, the host country, may be able to choose which events will be part of it.

00:01:31.782 --> 00:01:40.377
To choose something that fits that country.

00:01:40.377 --> 00:01:52.457
For example, boxing is part of the Olympics, but in Japan, Karate might be more suitable.

00:01:52.457 --> 00:02:04.853
Actually I think Karate is quite difficult as a sport, though. Extremely difficult.

00:02:04.853 --> 00:02:15.501
But, since Taekwondo joined the Olympics during the Seoul Olympics and Chinese-style fighting demonstrations were used in the Beijing Olympics, Karate has a chance.

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:20.837
Now we have Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling.

00:02:20.837 --> 00:02:38.302
In Karate why not have full-contact rules, no-contact rules, and K-1 rules where fighters wear gloves.

00:02:38.302 --> 00:02:41.403
A: So all three as part of Karate.

00:02:41.403 --> 00:02:45.490
T: Or as part of boxing, except you can use your feet.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:58.736
If the Olympics came to Tokyo, there is a big chance that K-1 will be a part of it.

00:02:58.736 --> 00:03:08.313
I'm sure MMA fighters are hoping for a similar chance.

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:16.055
What we need first is a foundation.

00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:23.193
We can say that there are this many people using K-1 rules.

00:03:23.193 --> 00:03:30.778
So we'll soon have high school and college K-1 Clubs in addition to K-1 Koshien.

00:03:30.778 --> 00:03:39.313
That's not all. All over the world there are many amateurs who are using K-1 rules.

00:03:39.313 --> 00:03:47.234
We want to build a support structure for these fighters.

00:03:47.234 --> 00:04:04.936
We want to show that we can do that, and get politicians, the Education Ministry, and educators to support us. We want to build and expand the amateur class.

00:04:04.936 --> 00:04:10.709
So the goal for amateurs should be the 2016 Olympics.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:17.018
We want to build the support for that dream.

00:04:17.018 --> 00:04:18.949
A: What are the chances of K-1 clubs appearing?

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:28.661
T: We're already in talks. Things will start next year.

00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:42.113
So with more fighters we can have regional, national and international tournaments.

00:04:42.113 --> 00:04:49.551
Like they have for colleges, we can have for high-schoolers.

00:04:49.551 --> 00:04:59.561
This will also affect the Pro league.

00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:07.717
The amateurs will aim for the pro league next, of course. 

00:05:07.717 --> 00:05:10.809
What will happen is...
