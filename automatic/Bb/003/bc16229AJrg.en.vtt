00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
had a Hawaiian accent and it was really

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.050

extremely<00:04:18.889> well-adapted<00:04:19.889> to<00:04:20.430> Hawaii<00:04:21.019> and<00:04:22.019> I

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
extremely well-adapted to Hawaii and I

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.340 
extremely well-adapted to Hawaii and I
thought<00:04:22.680> that<00:04:22.860> was<00:04:22.980> so<00:04:23.160> cool<00:04:23.460> to<00:04:23.520> watch<00:04:24.350> and

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
thought that was so cool to watch and

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.280 
thought that was so cool to watch and
and<00:04:26.190> because<00:04:26.610> of<00:04:26.639> that<00:04:26.850> i<00:04:26.970> began<00:04:27.419> to<00:04:27.750> just

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
and because of that i began to just

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.210 
and because of that i began to just
absolutely<00:04:28.740> love<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.160> island

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
absolutely love the island

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.770 
absolutely love the island
and<00:04:31.760> then<00:04:31.970> about<00:04:32.390> 9<00:04:32.690> months<00:04:33.140> ago<00:04:33.500> I<00:04:34.420> got<00:04:35.420> orders

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
and then about 9 months ago I got orders

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.460 
and then about 9 months ago I got orders
back<00:04:35.960> to<00:04:36.200> Nebraska<00:04:37.010> and<00:04:37.940> then<00:04:38.900> I<00:04:38.930> has<00:04:39.170> now<00:04:39.440> a

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
back to Nebraska and then I has now a

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.200 
back to Nebraska and then I has now a
tangible<00:04:40.280> day<00:04:41.800> tangible<00:04:42.820> day<00:04:43.820> that<00:04:44.120> I<00:04:44.150> was

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
tangible day tangible day that I was

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.000 
tangible day tangible day that I was
going<00:04:44.510> to<00:04:44.630> leave<00:04:44.750> the<00:04:44.900> island<00:04:44.930> I<00:04:45.350> my<00:04:45.680> days<00:04:45.830> were

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
going to leave the island I my days were

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.370 
going to leave the island I my days were
numbered<00:04:46.040> there<00:04:46.550> and<00:04:46.790> I<00:04:47.450> really<00:04:47.930> started<00:04:48.260> to

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
numbered there and I really started to

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.070 
numbered there and I really started to
realize<00:04:48.680> how<00:04:48.830> much<00:04:48.980> i<00:04:49.160> was<00:04:49.280> going<00:04:49.490> to<00:04:49.520> miss<00:04:49.730> it

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
realize how much i was going to miss it

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.960 
realize how much i was going to miss it
and<00:04:51.080> so<00:04:51.590> I<00:04:51.620> spent<00:04:52.160> my<00:04:52.280> last<00:04:52.460> six<00:04:52.820> months

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
and so I spent my last six months

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.850 
and so I spent my last six months
they're<00:04:53.300> doing<00:04:53.630> all<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:54.110> things<00:04:54.410> that<00:04:54.830> I

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
they're doing all the things that I

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.950 
they're doing all the things that I
wanted<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.370> do<00:04:55.640> it<00:04:55.820> like<00:04:56.120> a<00:04:56.150> checklist<00:04:56.480> of<00:04:56.840> all

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960
