00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.750
 the world of video games today has 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.270
 raised with a news that has 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.150
 exalted a lot of people so much 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.080
 positive as negatively and this 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.279
 because apparently according to sources a 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.169
 both curious strangers so much of a 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.730
 person who says work on wall street 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.409
 well, it's only very clear to me if it's 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.769
 a person who work on wall street 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:28.169
 or that has something to do with itself says that 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.319
 apparently nintendo and netflix are 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:36.030
 negotiating or are already working on what 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:37.860
 that would be an exclusive series of the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.790
 legend of zelda a series of live action 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.420
 I want to corroborate I do not know the evasion 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.560
 animal 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:50.130
 live action and it is said according to these 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.290
 Rumors specifies that they want to make 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.780
 something like a light version of game 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.500
 of thrones are a familiar version 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.090
 any of you that I have seen 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.110
 well the thrones well he knows he is 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:05.000
 everything but family does not 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:08.690
 and then you could comment on this 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.750
 I actually have 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:15.030
 enough doubts about whether this is 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.190
 true no no I'm not one of those people who 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.110
 already got on the air train by 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:24.180
 moment I keep very cautious that 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.270
 this is simply a farce that this 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.770
 be a rumor of someone who is 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.960
 I did not know how to have a little fun or create 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.320
 some controversy create certain 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:42.210
 Expectation with x motive I do not know x nor 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:45.990
 active then to be true this first 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.110
 place would be happy for me since 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.420
 netflix is known for its series 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.890
 original and in fact for having good 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.950
 material for having very good material 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.060
 regarding these ones that has 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.960
 worked together with certain companies of 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.780
 series and television in all this 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.319
 what I do not fit or what I can not 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:13.819
 to believe is how the world would adapt to 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:16.310
 a series on the one hand is fine because 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.410
 it's not a movie in such and that 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.100
 obviously the series have a huge 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.540
 enormous advantage with respect to how they should 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.090
 tell the stories since they are not 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.640
 limited to two or three hours when 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.930
 much on screen but they can 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.580
 address a lot of issues are not being 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.100
 hurried there may be a good 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.590
 character development may have 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.989
 many stories that intertwine can 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.910
 there are many things that is a great 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.190
 advantage that is a series that is 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.850
 planning as a series as such 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.430
 however on the other hand we have what 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.830
 economic or production since the 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.130
 series obviously do not have the value or 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.080
 the level of a film good clear who 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.110
 he knows depending on how much money he gets 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.610
 go to put there are series that are 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.370
 magnificent and back to game of thrones 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.490
 which has a huge production value 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.640
 we have already seen other series also with 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:16.210
 a lot of money invested and the fact 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.280
 that nintendo as he is in charge has in 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.640
 certain way guarantee that they will be 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.600
 very attentive to take care of every aspect every 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.300
 detail since they have had very bad 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.640
 bad experiences in the past doing 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.010
 this kind of experiments and that's what 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.720
 much has led to this very 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.720
 company is somewhat closed with its 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.730
 properties 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.140
 how could the legend of 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.840
 Zelda 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.370
 a series I say could make a 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.709
 very long story could make a 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.780
 very short story there are those who say of 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.819
 made that where there is a cell serves us 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.180
 for a series since it's too much 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.160
 simple thing that I am totally in 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.080
 disagreement or how can you say that 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.780
 the legend of zelda is simple maybe 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.180
 as the concept maybe the bases maybe 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.560
 yes but if something has shown the legend 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.320
 of zelda is that it has a quantity 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.260
 huge story that can be 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.900
 exploited only be set not to notice 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.989
 Popular games like karina of time 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.320
 peace breath fix a little more a 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.870
 little beyond the panorama let's say 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.990
 the casual or the panorama 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.930
 commercial something deeper can 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.620
 see us and stories like link's awakening 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.030
 that has a whole huge background this 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.700
 game 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.380
 they have the amazing pieces that what 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.390
 they make up in history that what 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.730
 do the characters 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.740
 for example the wind waker is also 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.430
 something that could be very exploited although 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.710
 obviously we know what 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.110
 by doing a series of what they are going to 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.880
 think in the end will be but greater is 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.980
 more are going to try to do it more 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.720
 commercial , however, they can take 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.310
 elements that is something that was just 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.180
 that you can take elements from each 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:05.330
 saga and on the other hand they can do something 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.220
 totally new that I actually think that 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.930
 is what they're going to go to because obviously 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:14.150
 they're not going to criticize maybe stain the 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.130
 name of one of your previous 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:20.000
 titles already established and will treat 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:22.520
 to do something new and not to leave 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.280
 well known because you can have hundreds 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.530
 of stories that are not related to 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.450
 nothing more than just in the name and that's 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.060
 something very good about the moment of 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.980
 write stories because it can be no 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.070
 necessarily an adaptation but something 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.290
 totally original that bears the name 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.969
 as long as they maintain the bases or 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.429
 the concept of such 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:46.889
 and that is precisely what gives us the 

00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:49.729
 freedom to be able to do something complex 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:52.469
 to develop secondary characters 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:55.469
 new there can be many characters 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:57.029
 new ones that explore their history 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:59.669
 that there is a very good relationship between 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:02.729
 the characters that we have a bow 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.740
 argument very nourished that is 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.319
 the possibilities are endless for the 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:11.159
 moment and then nothing more to wait 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:14.340
 to see if nintendo and netflix decide to give 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:17.940
 face and say something in some 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:20.070
 official message or just go out 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.830
 least to reveal that this is a 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:26.400
 lie a farce and that was simply 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:30.700
 a rumor that your voice to the world head 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:33.430
 for a few hours or a few days 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:36.550
 and hopefully and everything goes well hopefully 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.200
 give us something fast I think in this 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.520
 moment in internet netflix should be 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.620
 so gold 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.729
 what is happening what is what is 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.210
 happening on the network is because they are 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:48.889
 talking about this or just finish 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.870
 lose your head because you leaked the 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:52.699
 information and they wanted to keep it as 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.259
 something hidden that would actually have 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:56.319
 quite meaningful considering the 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:58.669
 secrecy with which they are driving 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:01.310
 several of its properties lately 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:04.159
 to keep players up to date 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.180
 as that expectation that such 

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:08.100
 excuse forgives 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.479
 and well this is my opinion of all this 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.610
 chaos I hope the video you liked 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:14.490
