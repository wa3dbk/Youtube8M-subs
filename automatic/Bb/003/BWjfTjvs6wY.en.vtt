00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 today to call our schedule 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.140
 with a new heading titled not a 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.450
 DIY case 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.750
 in short, this is the period in which it is 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.549
 think of the bags of the sea to the clothes of 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.020
 sea â€‹â€‹to all the objects there 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.080
 accompany in the holidays 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.289
 you know how much they really cost 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.410
 but I am sure we are sure you can 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.820
 do at home thanks to the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.820
 pina teachings have them 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.940
 today we will make a nice summer bag 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.930
 you like this to accomplish this 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.660
 bag it takes 5 rectangles this the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.780
 first of these rectangles ne 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.230
 it will take three one for the base and two 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.210
 for the side panels 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.859
 first we choose the fabrics I in 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.960
 this case I used a silk 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:03.649
 on orange and on the other side a 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.649
 cotton 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.100
 let's start first 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.070
 enough adhesive canvas is needed 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.190
 sturdy to stiffen the fabric here 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.450
 let's put our model on 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.190
 adhesive canvas and with a chalk on it 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.710
 let's make 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.810
 we take the measures so leaving 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.400
 however about a centimeter a 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.400
 centimeter and a half on each side 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.170
 this is the first rectangle 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.729
 let's cut it 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:00.329
 always leaving an inch beyond 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.329
 sign 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.709
 we made three rectangles two 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.989
 of the larger sizes and one of the 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:17.420
 smaller size the rectangle more 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:23.209
 large and 42 centimeters by 30 the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:27.110
 second one is a 30 x 30 cm square 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:29.239
 now we're going to support this 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.239
 these rectangles on the fabric that 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.239
 we have chosen at this point we support 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:38.840
 our visual pattern sheet on the fabric 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:44.380
 we pin with pins and cut out 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.380
 an absolutely identical square 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.530
 it is not important if it remains a while 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.610
 frayed because the seams will remain 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:07.080
 inside after cutting the five 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.540
 rectangles we must attack the direct 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.120
 to the fabric we have chosen and this 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.940
 it is done with a very hot iron 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.760
 because the direct from one side to one 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.760
 glue that sticks to the fabric 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.680
 well done also this operation 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.019
 let's start assembling the bag 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.120
 one of the largest rectangles will be the 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:43.230
 base the other will be one of the side 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:47.890
 so we're going to fix that way to the sides 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:50.500
 always with pins if necessary 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.409
 be a beginner 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.269
 you will want to do an investiture on 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.269
 strip left by the chalk 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:14.060
 I advise you at least to start sewing 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.060
 one side at a time 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:27.110
 we have fixed the two rectangles 1 and the 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.110
 base and the other is one of the side 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:38.990
 the result will be this I recommend you 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.990
 machine stitch one piece at a time 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.490
 let's move on to the second side which is the 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:52.610
 nearest square with the same 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.610
 system we do not fix or we are not enough 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:03.090
 exited by machine 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:06.600
 the result is this we proceed as follows 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.340
 gradually for the other two sides once 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.470
 assembled all five pieces 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.440
 around the base we must proceed 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:19.970
 to the side seams and we do it in 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.970
 this way we join the laterals 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:26.669
 let's proceed as usual with pins or 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.669
 with basting 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.350
 and you see that the bag begins to 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:42.630
 take its shape and proceed in 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.630
 this way joining the other sides 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.940
 now let's move on to the other fabric on 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.670
 procedure is exactly the same 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.110
 let's go to create again that of 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.320
 same measure 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:01.270
 the five rectangles 3 I repeat of 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:05.400
 42 centimeters for 30 and 230 x 30 will come 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.400
 assembled in the same way 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:15.680
 at this point we have realized from 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:19.370
 two bags we're going to get a fabric 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.500
 and admit it inside 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.139
 we must remember that the seams 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.360
 they must remain on both sides 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:33.560
 inside the bag 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:36.919
 in this way we must at this point a 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.199
 make handles handles like that 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:41.779
 we have said before can be more 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:46.219
 long and shorter for this will suffice 

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:49.159
 two strips make two rectangles of the 

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:54.439
 a measure that we like the most or the most there is 

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:59.569
 well wear them sew between them e 

00:06:54.439 --> 00:07:03.319
 fix them to the exchange and in conclusion 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:05.599
 we will make a wail so that all the 

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:09.430
 seams are not visible from any 

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:12.289
 part and sewing it we can also 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.599
 customize as you like 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:17.469
 us or as I did with delle 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:20.479
 roses in the same silk fabric 

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:22.759
 or with flower trimmings 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:25.789
 or other things you can find haberdashery 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:27.740
 already realized and at this point the bag 

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:31.819
 fake 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:34.099
 changing tissues and or shortening i 

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:37.660
 handles according to your tastes you can 

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:41.840
 I like this model 

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:45.199
 this model and keep in mind that I am 

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:51.819
 reversible and therefore with a bag 

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:51.819
 you can use two to show the other one 

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.770
 and here is the second bag
