are safe in their own home and that

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.100 
are safe in their own home and that
their<00:01:50.549> parents<00:01:51.090> are<00:01:51.180> there<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.509> protect<00:01:51.689> them

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
their parents are there to protect them

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.080
