00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:09.440
 I love Sanuki Udon 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:14.019
 Kagawa Prefecture is just a matter of graffiti 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.019
 But it does not just it 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.970
 For example, there are few disasters 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:25.930
 Japan's top-ranked job posting rate 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:30.010
 About 90% of prefectural people are satisfied with the ease of living 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:35.850
 And this is also 22 years nationwide 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:38.910
 The Kagawa Prefecture whether'm also a popular recent 20 destinations 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.760
 Why is that ? 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.760
 Let's find out the reason 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:53.390
 Kagawa living six reasons 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.390
 There is one urban convenience 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.020
 Even if you walk in the center town 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:10.110
 Because there are many in the range that you can go right away 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:10.110
 If you want to go by bicycle, you can use the train now. 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:19.260
 I came to feel free to go out 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:25.970
 I also thought that it was urban and convenient for a long time 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.970
 Po shopping is convenient and the restaurant is also very fulfilling. 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.900
 There are a lot of houses in it and there are few disasters 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.840
 Tokyo key is good dk 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:48.000
 It was about room so now it's already 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:53.790
 City Gouka has spacious rooms that have a room and a fairly comfortable living 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Sometimes my husband will come to Shikoku here since 6 Takamatsu 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:03.520
 I often came to Naoshima to play 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.030
 Sometimes I liked art 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.280
 Like the sea De 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.929
 Scenic places 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.000
 Anno 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:18.280
 I like it 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.810
 Kagawa Prefecture has less natural disasters inside Seto 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.090
 Inhale time was living room 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.090
 Oh, I also showed off the fair 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:38.849
 3 Easy to parenting and rich in art and culture 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:45.110
 The class elementary school also has a small number of classes and the teacher looks after it so much 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:45.110
 It is such an environment that you watch over and have you make a digest 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.230
 There are no waiting children 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.560
 Hey, because it is very 's city 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.560
 Academic ability also exceeds the national average 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.880
 It is easy to raise children 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:07.930
 The 4 things to eat are fresh cheap and delicious 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.020
 Especially in the Seto Inland Sea 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.090
 Is it taken in front of you? 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:16.319
 The sacredness is Yap different 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.319
 I felt especially 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:27.240
 Oh yeah, Kagawa is not only udon but also vegetables and fruit and seafood fresh and delicious 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.690
 really 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:34.500
 You can use it with confidence and you can take it nearby and it 's delicious. 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.500
 It is Chi_sen 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:44.819
 Food that has received the blessings of nature from nearby seas and fields supports Kagawa living 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.819
 is not it 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.180
 me 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.460
 It is easy to find work after that 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.680
 Initially 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.880
 As I was looking for something other than Kagawa, I mainly used Rikunabi-san doing in the country 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:05.000
 but 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:07.540
 After deciding to go back to Kagawa , let me use it with Job Navi Kagawa, who specializes in Kagawa 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.540
 Received 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:15.010
 There are a lot of job postings so amazing 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:20.609
 It's really difficult to work 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.609
 In addition, it is safe because medical care and welfare are substantial 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.800
 Part 6 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:32.210
 Convenient at the base of transportation 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.800
 I think you and the movement of the car 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.360
 Run the same distance 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.020
 that 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:46.000
 A 29 but running what screaming minute 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:49.500
 Also Toko time-consuming time at all is that it is high if price movements also perceived 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.500
 After all 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.820
 It is you who is far 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.820
 Because Touma runs from Switzerland 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.480
 The road is wide and convenient in Kagawa 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:11.170
 Sanukiheiya around the Takamatsu has led here and there spread out in a fan shape 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:25.610
 Kagawa Prefecture has always welcomed many people from outside the prefecture as a gateway to Shikoku 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:33.619
 Mairi Konpira for a long time Oh Shikoku eighty-eight places tour 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:36.309
 In recent years, Sanuki Udon boom and Setouchi International Art Festival such as not only domestic attention but also from overseas 

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:36.309
 Collecting 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:45.330
 How was it 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:46.650
 Not it was deemed hey say I unexpectedly Kagawa look at this also those who did not propose you I Kagawa 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.620
 Is it 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.800
 so 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:56.260
 There are many things that I do not understand unless I live 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:06:01.900
 A feature of Kagawa living that daily life is felt richly 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:05.640
 Oh, so long as Sam gold is thick and life never gets tired 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.640
 Do you not want to do here or face 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:12.849
 Hmm
