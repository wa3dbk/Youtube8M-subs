00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:15.480
 certain 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:17.160
 I hope you enjoy this is a preserve 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.189
 different line 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.580
 the chic name of conserve is caponata 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.430
 You'll fiddle with two raw vegetables. 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.010
 here it's good it's all raw 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.359
 and a wealth of flavors is 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.020
 impressive 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.750
 zucchini zucchini is good 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.969
 was very thin and thin looks just 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.920
 delicious 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:45.440
 another thing is oh without much flavor 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:50.239
 it's good too, champion champion chopped 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.239
 very coarse on no whim 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:58.230
 caper oilca parra that seed that 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:05.600
 It's super salty, she's going to give it a taste. 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:08.010
 here it was more or less a good spoon 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.729
 You'll find your point there. 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:20.820
 adding a tablespoon of garlic 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:22.920
 will make salt salt and olive oil 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.170
 to set the flavor to make you 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:31.939
 feel the taste of all these things 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.939
 here is how to mix 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:40.090
 that the ideal is for you to make a 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:44.140
 or two days before eating 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:47.049
 It is even raw with garlic the salt that 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.990
 here it is very well preserved if 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.280
 it is in a well-cleaned glass 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.140
 clean 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.020
 So you need to do even 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.200
 more days in advance better 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.049
 garlic salt caper olive oil 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:07.209
 highlight each time she will be more 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:11.650
 tasty what you see is hard not 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:13.090
 very difficult and hence O already straight to 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.569
 platter that will serve 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:22.000
 this is great here for the snack is great 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:25.569
 for you to do at a party next to the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.549
 pÃ¢tÃ©s that usually you use it here 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.030
 It's great with a late meal 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:35.140
 great tallest week to eat one 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:38.019
 great bun has only one tip if you 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.220
 want to give a color here because the two 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.350
 things 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.560
 it's two pretty bright things 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.540
 tasty 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.420
 but if you want to give a color you take 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.820
 a little cherry tomatoes look good 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.100
 little and play when it's time to serve 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.400
 leaves the tomato before the tomatoes loose water 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.660
 and going to mean your preserve looks like 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.579
 Delicious, this is a challenge for you. 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.459
 try it you will be surprised how 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:12.600
 two things so sonsin the pom give 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.600
 taste so rich for you you would eat 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.930
 O 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.820
 it's custom with me 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.830
 the goal 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.200
 the goal 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.200
 get used cob
