00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.890
 ah 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.619
 hello welcome to a new tutorial in 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.239
 this case I will teach to make some 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.890
 mini albums with a single sheet are worth 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.860
 mini album that we could call of 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.800
 pocket or can even be cards 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.370
 to give to someone and put some 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.730
 photos then well I will teach two 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.910
 examples this says this Christmas in 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.780
 Christmas as a Christmas mode here 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.780
 with a card 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.559
 here goes another card 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.219
 here goes another card 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.190
 here goes another card 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.190
 Here goes another card 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.030
 and here goes another little card and I've stuck it 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.600
 with velcro 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.810
 and another model that I 'm going to teach you 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.390
 It would be this that I hit with Velcro 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.770
 so it's a tape 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.770
 with the paper itself 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.840
 and a little flower 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.579
 OK 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.579
 same here goes an afternoon 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.720
 here is another card, there are six cards 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:48.260
 in total another other 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.080
 here goes to others 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.690
 and here goes another good one is a mini album 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.850
 As you can see, it is very important to know that it is very 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.610
 Easy to do is done very quickly 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.640
 and it's very original and you only need one 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.940
 only sheet is worth then the process is 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.899
 very simple let's take a sheet of 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.630
 scrapbook and we're going to go around the 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.730
 Half the part that we want to be left 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.290
 on the outside if we want it to be 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.370
 out we're going to turn this 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.940
 side if we want it to be on the outside 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.860
 this we are going to bend inwards and if 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.390
 we want it to be left out 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.920
 to bend inward then as 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.830
 I want it to be left out this we're going to 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.830
 fold like that let's fold it in half 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.300
 make sure and checking well because then 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.280
 the folds are quite important 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.560
 it seems the new one we mark well 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.690
 and then it happens like with origami 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.540
 that explain it are important then 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.470
 it is important to mark well that you stay 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.910
 well marked the folds for then 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.850
 when we do the folding 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.580
 because you see here for example not what 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.830
 there was square well I'll square what 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.570
 come there 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:14.330
 very well once we have folded well 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.820
 and so this sense we're going to take one of 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.250
 the faces and we are going to turn towards the 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.319
 medium 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:25.900
 let's say that one of the parties 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.900
 is going to be divided into four vouchers 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:32.629
 and we go back to scrub in here 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:36.790
 very important in this step leave a 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.790
 little bit of slack here in the middle 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.780
 then we hit again 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.090
 1 2 3 4 and this in the middle you see that 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.219
 we have simple the parts these that 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.189
 we have folded inwards we are going to 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:56.750
 get a little corner and let's take it 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:04:00.860
 inward 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:05.360
 right on the line where it is marked 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.330
 OK, it's going to give you the limit where 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.490
 you have to make the triangle 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.320
 well you see I'm very facilitated 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.320
 it has no mystery 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.659
 and the last one 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.560
 OK 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.880
 you see 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.780
 once we have doubled we move towards 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.110
 in 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:45.130
 you see here in the middle 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:48.730
 there is a little bit of slackness worth how much 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.980
 Well, a little bit, I do not know, you do not have to 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.430
 it's too much simply that I'm not 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:56.820
 in a stuck the papers 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:05:00.690
 now we come to this point and we see here 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:03.660
 just where does this triangle go? 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.200
 from this angle here we would have 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.200
 to bend 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.289
 9 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:17.990
 we should talk there 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.990
 Ok we proceed to bend 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.940
 but to the other side 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.330
 you see right there 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.550
 that was double 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.180
 here it is very important if the paper is of 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.180
 a lot of grams 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.909
 keep hitting and stretching the paper it's worth 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:41.550
 because the paper is much thicker than 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:44.039
 others and if we do not go in every step 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.000
 stretching and folding the paper at the end 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:50.240
 we will not be able to do it 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.810
 they are not like the finite papers that 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:57.360
 right away you can adapt 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.529
 You see we have made this step and we have 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.749
 folded and now simply 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:06.180
 so that you see it or that you put the camera 

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:08.760
 it's the other part 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:12.100
 and put it in 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.740
 We are going putting it in 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.240
 Y 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:20.520
 we go back to what we always stretch 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.860
 we stretch stretch we stretch so that 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.599
 is well seated the paper this in 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:29.400
 concrete I'm using is pretty 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:31.289
 work then it's interesting to go 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.529
 hitting good for what you are seeing 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:39.919
 so that it stays perfectly smoothed 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:39.919
 agree and nothing now doubles well 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.200
 and I would be 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.200
 here would go a card 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.560
 a moment that does not find here a 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.220
 card 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:05.780
 I acquired another card 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:11.670
 Acquired another card acquired 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:13.500
 cards back and here another and the 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:16.080
 form of 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:19.880
 of what you want to close and is it is 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.880
 as I said with a strip of paper 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:27.960
 laporta is custom made 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:30.650
 or putting velcro here 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:33.080
 as is the case with this one 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.479
 that I have put balcony and have easy 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.430
 You buy this in the haberdashery that 

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:39.569
 comes already Alberto adhesive and cut 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.069
 bits 

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:43.259
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:44.849
 this tutorial we are going to make a 

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:47.309
 series of mini albums that are pretty 

00:07:44.849 --> 00:07:50.490
 simple I hope you follow me this is 

00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:52.349
 the first video of the series and I hope that 

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.860
 I liked a greeting and a kiss to 

00:07:52.349 --> 00:07:54.860
 all the world
