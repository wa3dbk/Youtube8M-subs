00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.769
 the children go to your home and neo the 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:12.389
 brigadier hello everyone we get 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.059
 found again for a video 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.550
 tutorial on installing a mode 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:23.340
 on minecraft 1.6.2 so this so 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.710
 this second video rather and writes a 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.410
 close to that of eurydice mini map 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.240
 simply because because a 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.560
 moderator asked me on the server 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.230
 to kraft and on which I am 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.010
 currently and have trouble rummaging around 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.559
 a little bit but I found 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.469
 I found his happiness and I will 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.000
 to share so then I you 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.260
 would come to download the water 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.219
 young people in the description of the video 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.230
 so for now we're going to do like 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.410
 so usually how to know how 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.870
 start run or centered percent 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.329
 appdata percentage lends you hockey 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.760
 is there we find the like 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.659
 usually our minecraft corner that we 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.159
 let's open up then go down on the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.570
 version folder and so there is 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.270
 the minimum rest that you could see 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.460
 in the oxidizing video and still 6.2 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.100
 and we will start again substantially 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.670
 the same manipulation ie copy the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.860
 folder I did with understand I know 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.909
 am a little faster and I stick it 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.970
 directly then this one we will be able 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.970
 the renamed 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.079
 we mean to water like these 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.500
 would then ask inside and 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:48.270
 you will rename both files 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.540
 the two extensions in point 6.2 and we 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.759
 will give back water we will do more 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.990
 simple 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.610
 that's what really helps 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.150
 different this year several modes 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.290
 you even one behind the other 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.360
 the cases we have good of 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.090
 the rest the tablecloths 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:14.240
 you will open the 1.6 water point 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:18.650
 is up and just as before so you 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:23.350
 go add water next to the 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:29.600
 version you close you register 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:31.310
 then you will go into this one 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.230
 you die the jars Point 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.590
 of oil and I lost my lead 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.450
 you're going so you're going to die on 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.310
 point bar we fell on 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.800
 So here you there as usual 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:51.950
 know the second nave medal and 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:56.360
 you delete it so this is at peace 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.880
 you then find your your 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.940
 minced or tied up of time yes so there 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.730
 there are five there are five French fishermen 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.170
 5 are not put in the same place 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.150
 no you are going to take the four the 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.390
 four shots from the bottom the points of 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.660
 class 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:16.790
 you will copy and paste them 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:24.110
 directly where you deleted the 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:32.140
 meta in you can close it and the 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:34.190
 shader him you're going to transpose it here 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.769
 directly in the point folder 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:42.290
 minecraft and here we go to see them all 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.970
 right away what does that then by 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.150
 against break destruction so I saw 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:51.110
 I also read that it took a lot 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:54.260
 more resources than some others 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.620
 modes so I hope you'll have a 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.840
 good processor and a lot of ram for 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:06.430
 to make all that happen 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.430
 we will be able to see what it looks like 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.400
 and you see the daub textures it's 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:19.750
 magnificent 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.750
 so we could this blue this blue bad 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:31.280
 it's super nice and then more 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.820
 allow us to see to see through 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.210
 we'll go and say a little bit 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.210
 further 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.050
 hop 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:50.240
 look good there there was there was 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:55.940
 the class nice enough it's convenient 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.860
 for it looks a lot more like a2 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.539
 julien at the texture level on the on the 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:05.450
 leaked and had happened a little bit through 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:09.050
 the flock what does it actually give a 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.770
 little of him good and so when we have them 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.300
 Cancellations 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:16.280
 peter i do not know waves yes 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:20.660
 our team bathing there reading 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:24.800
 even extremely well through but 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:28.370
 it gives if we dive a little con plonge 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.100
 it's still a little ugly 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.740
 but otherwise the level on the outside is 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.440
 it's great and nab 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:41.919
 we called to rowing will leave us there 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.919
 above for this little video 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:54.770
 I love this little buggy up the little 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:06:01.190
 novelty we are in the process of doing 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:05.810
 a little slavery we bob bob all the 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:07.010

 chief a little black I have in hand we have 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.780
 intruder so this character there blog 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.460
 quite often I am misnamed because 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.389
 that the sound of lendman is not 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.860
 necessarily what they wanted 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:30.820
 to hear that they're building you for 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:33.320
