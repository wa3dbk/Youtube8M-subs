00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.239

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.460
 I came home with these two here. 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.140

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.510
 that there is no very different risk 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.610

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.120
 It bought also called river takes 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.859
 He does not have a Portuguese version of it. 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.660
 it was sealed in the bookstore when it arrives 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.640
 at home and I need a book, I discovered 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.140
 which is actually a book of poems and I 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.880
 I was very surprised because I never saw 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.740
 no book of poems in English 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.360
 all I know is not the synopsis is that 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.950

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.530
 high school and everyone is in the same 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.360
 school but otherwise do not know much 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.799
 respect of this book I hope it is 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.229
 a different reading that takes advantage of 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.549
 quite and if I like it for sure I 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.439

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.659

 a lot of people talking this book well 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.890
 People say that this book is super 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.450
 funny and what I know about it is that

 he tells the story of the stump 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.380
 main character here and the book 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.149
 written in the form of a journal should 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.890
 that the adventures of the stump who studies in 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.110

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.070
 reading 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.930
 in another week when I attended a 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.340

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.790

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.410
 of the drafts that the angry used to 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.580
 write this book 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.770
 the only exception I had of who is 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.840

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.760
 It was his first decision and I read that
