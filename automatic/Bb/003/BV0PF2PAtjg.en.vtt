00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.470
 Nikolai Dolgachev and the situation in Donetsk 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.180
 areas 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.150
 this has actually changed significantly 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.910
 that night besieged Slavyansk is now in 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.740
 the hands of the national guard units 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.350
 Ukrainian army virtually all 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.380
 towel who were there 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:23.160
 gathered in a single fist and went 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.080
 from the environment failing to break his way on 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.890
 Kramatorsk and in this direction on 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.320
 southeast of 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.480
 Slavic casualties among the militias 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.500
 a little bit, that is, they actually saved 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.170
 its combat capability 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.390
 and quantitative and qualitative force 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.890
 Slavic had to leave because of that 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.790
 that the city was already full 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.440
 blocked supply was absolutely 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.600
 impossible not from Kramatorsk with any 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.910
 the other side after the spider 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.920
 Mykolaiv is a suburb 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.350
 Slavic who had a strategic 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.079
 defense importance 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.620
 this city the militia is now retreated 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.870
 part of the group went to Gorlovka and you 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.690

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.979
 you know what not to let back to the city 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.060
 there will be that city which has already been bombed 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.210
 no need to lower the roof for demolition 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:29.549
 all priests bombed 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:33.329

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.869
 Slavic 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:49.159
 semi developed infrastructure all broken 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.399
 I don't understand why I don't understand 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.200
 why war war was not supposed to be 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.140

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.950
 there are still a lot of peaceful 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.439
 there are no fewer residents 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.500
 thirty thousand apparently and 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.690
 Kramatorsk garrison will gradually 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.789
 depart from their current positions 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.769
 because the front line will change a lot 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.599
 of course but what will happen in 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.450
 most Slavic we will find out 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.890
 only not so large portions 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.060
 official information from the Ukrainian 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.799
 Slavic authorities here and very Slavic 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.930
 circling is now underway 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.940
 the destruction of gang formations which 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.890
 small groups hiding residential buildings 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.629
 where are the civilians task 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.640
 who put the president of Ukraine on 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.620
 ensuring the safety of civilians 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.440
 and performing a stripping operation 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.030
 cities are extremely complex and important 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.100
 the main task is the preservation of life 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.260
 local people we do not have accurate data 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.720
 about the number of locals she is on 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.049
 twitch fights and yesterday were already in the area 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.780
 Karlovka village is only about 15 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.790
 kilometers from the border of the city of Donetsk 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.190
 here begins and problems with 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.810
 humanitarian situation some more 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.209
 days ago were destroyed pumping 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.769
 stations that supplied Donetsk water 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.959
 and now these problems now 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.240
 aggravated in Slavic practically 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.790
 was sentenced to destruction ie his 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.280
 continuously bombarded with artillery and 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.980
 aviation 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.140
 heavy armored well that is to the city 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.020
 stupidly demolished from the face of the earth well plus 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.100
 definitely worth a million people 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.810
 lost water 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:30.709
 because the test that fed 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.910
 pumps on the channel it is crushed and 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.550
 crushing on critically that is 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.500
 it can not be restored and the intake itself 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.910
 again crushed there for 5 people 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.980
 dead and the water intake will be 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.050
 carried out from technical sources 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.510
 the militia are gathering strength to 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.800
 ensure the defense of the city ​​of Donetsk and 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.630
 surrounding communities 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.620
 Ukrainian army performs now 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.120
 their task to 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.390
 the actual surroundings of the territory 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.420
 New Russia and now the militia 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.850

 Vyacheslav Ponomarev 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.150
 and I remember in June he was imprisoned under 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.130
 the guard was accused of not being 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.019
 provided the city with water and electricity 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.150
 because of what the locals suffered 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:25.990
 Now Pan Marek declares that he is going to 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:28.960
