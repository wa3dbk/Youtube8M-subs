00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.289
 the channel today I'm going to do another unboxing 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.390
 after so much time not doing 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.400
 none will reach something almost two 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.470
 followed this he added that he will go after the 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.480
 sniper elite 3 video the mission of 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.160
 kill hitler but well I wanted to do 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.180
 this unboxing because good is one thing 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.420
 which is bigger than the video game of 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.780
 mp3 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.489
 costs more than the game that in 2013 and 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.949
 Well, it 's a hardware that had 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.320
 want to have already and let's move on to 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.210
 open it while I do I'm going to 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.030
 explain where you buy it 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.489
 I bought this in rakuten and you will see 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.130
 what that moment I do not say this what 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.140
 will be powerful is a page of 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.159
 commerce of electronic things from one of 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.680
 video games gadgets consoles 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.100
 etcetera etcetera and well then the cutí 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.100
 it is not a page 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.170
 like it looks a bit like March nothing 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.490
 more it does not look like what amazon apart 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.850
 to have your products in your stock 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.409
 it also puts you the price other stores 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.160
 well rakuten has a store 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.759
 affiliate from which more things to be 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.830
 is and I think it looks pretty good 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.560
 video k dotcom and well it is a 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.680
 single store is a page where 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.420
 they are pretty pretty good prices 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.610
 It's not about advertising or anything 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.470
 similar but good more or less I know 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.940
 I'm going to count now with gold to what 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.250
 I have and for the price that he has 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.710
 acquired and well you will see what is 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.300
 quite well also from rakuten that 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.640
 they leave a serial from time to time 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:06.910
 quite strong enough offers and they are 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.670

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:25.000
 name as amazon for example 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.500
 I say that a reliable ebay seller 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.230
 but hey it is a store that already 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.330
 I bought a video game for a friend who

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:01.410
 to the parrot and what about here around here 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.060
 it seems that it is stable is not right to 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.010
 backwards but hey, I'm really looking forward 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.010
 to open it so I do not care 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.600
 I am very crazy 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:18.410
 I do not get used to this from the unboxing 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.410
 of the camera and good that we have here 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.870
 tampon 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.330
 a dps man avoid slim with the game 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:33.170
 of war collection to be 1 and 2 and a 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:35.230
 8GB card to make it look good 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.269
 and more or less 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.780
 well then avoid slim this is supposed to be 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.940
 filling really nothing else goes of perfect 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.830
 positive 3 avoid lime they had money 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.280
 saved and I feel that I have a 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.620
 laptop of monkeys since it is going to me is 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.750
 a good complement to the ps4 true 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.599
 by the remote game game by game 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.690
 remote and more small things possible I decided 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:00.400
 buy it also with the plus of 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.690
 You know every month giving avoided games 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.510
 of pc 4 and 2 of ps3 and I already had several 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.640
 months down the ps vita games yet 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.200
 without having it so have a collection 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.000
 quite big of games like that 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.099

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.959
 those who wanted to return to comply 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.400
 and well, they're going to be like that 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.400
 to see what it is 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:30.630
 to the codes for the games and good 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.040
 Well, as I wanted to have it 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.160
 portable than the psp2 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.140
 to put emulators and roms is not 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.000
 for something else because or to have the 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.370
 new this is the ps vita slim the new 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.650
 model 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.600
 to see yes 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:49.080
 is a little more orderly 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:52.410
 I have seen better packaging than everything 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.370
 how little does it weigh or maingot if this does not 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:59.400
 nothing happens 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:02.680

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.880

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.880
 let's take it out 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.480
 Here you are 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.160
 it weighs very little 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.740
 but with very little I'm short 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.009
 see you soon will be full of 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.939
 fear of the screen 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:26.340
 Here you nice console 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:28.860

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:37.620
 the thumbs this did not have the console 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.150
 the camera here and the camera the camera 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.569

 giving in a waza very well and well then 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:52.350

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.780
 for the sd 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.190
