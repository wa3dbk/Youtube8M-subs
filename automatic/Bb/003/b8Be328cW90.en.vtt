00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
of this fall out and I think it's just

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.580 
of this fall out and I think it's just
going<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.610> bunch<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.000> nothing<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.810> you

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
going to be a bunch of nothing and you

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.429 
going to be a bunch of nothing and you
would<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.070> think<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.579> someone<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
would have to think that someone in the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.850 
would have to think that someone in the
North<00:01:35.189> Korean<00:01:35.670> military<00:01:36.049> higher-ups<00:01:37.049> has

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
North Korean military higher-ups has

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.670 
North Korean military higher-ups has
some<00:01:38.430> type<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.759> world<00:01:39.270> history<00:01:39.570> education<00:01:39.990> I

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
some type of world history education I

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.609 
some type of world history education I
mean<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.880> know<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.000> United<00:01:42.360> States<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.200> not<00:01:43.560> a

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
mean you know the United States is not a

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.050 
mean you know the United States is not a
stranger<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:45.659> atomic<00:01:46.140> bomb<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.909> think<00:01:47.909> we

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
stranger to the atomic bomb I think we

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.480 
stranger to the atomic bomb I think we
have<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.240> little<00:01:48.450> experience<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:49.500> using<00:01:50.100> this

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
have a little experience in using this

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.149 
have a little experience in using this
and<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.210> think<00:01:51.270> Japan<00:01:52.079> can<00:01:52.320> probably<00:01:52.740> back<00:01:52.950> us

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
and I think Japan can probably back us

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.050 
and I think Japan can probably back us
up<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.020> I<00:01:55.020> don't<00:01:55.619> think<00:01:55.979> we<00:01:56.610> want<00:01:56.880> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
up on that and I don't think we want to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.929 
up on that and I don't think we want to
see<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.680> unleashed<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.250> world<00:01:59.460> again

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
see this unleashed in the world again

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.170 
see this unleashed in the world again
and<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.689> really<00:02:01.290> don't<00:02:01.619> believe<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:02.430> North

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
and I really don't believe that North

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.380 
and I really don't believe that North
Korea<00:02:03.600> has<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:04.560> complete<00:02:05.149> capabilities<00:02:06.149> that

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
Korea has the complete capabilities that

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.229 
Korea has the complete capabilities that
they<00:02:06.509> claim<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:07.580> but<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.729> doesn't<00:02:08.879> mean

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
they claim to have but that doesn't mean

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.050 
they claim to have but that doesn't mean
they<00:02:09.420> can't<00:02:09.750> cause<00:02:10.020> some<00:02:10.289> trouble<00:02:10.819> mainly<00:02:11.819> I

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
they can't cause some trouble mainly I

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.790 
they can't cause some trouble mainly I
think<00:02:12.480> they<00:02:12.629> would<00:02:12.780> cause<00:02:12.989> trouble<00:02:13.470> with

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800

some reason you never played the

original black ops you need to play it

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.920 
original black ops you need to play it
just<00:04:49.920> to<00:04:49.980> play<00:04:50.100> firing<00:04:50.550> range<00:04:50.790> it's<00:04:51.090> a<00:04:51.240> blast<00:04:51.630> I

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
just to play firing range it's a blast I

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.620 
just to play firing range it's a blast I
remember<00:04:52.260> my<00:04:52.440> very<00:04:52.500> first<00:04:53.040> game<00:04:53.280> of<00:04:53.580> black<00:04:54.390> ops

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
remember my very first game of black ops

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.930 
remember my very first game of black ops
was<00:04:55.140> played<00:04:55.410> on<00:04:55.440> firing<00:04:55.950> range<00:04:56.340> and<00:04:56.700> I

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
was played on firing range and I

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.330 
was played on firing range and I
recorded<00:04:57.750> live<00:04:58.050> I<00:04:58.290> think<00:04:58.530> it's<00:04:58.680> on<00:04:58.860> it's<00:04:59.130> on<00:04:59.190> my

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340

pretty good the second time around the

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.100 
pretty good the second time around the
first<00:05:34.560> one<00:05:34.860> aside<00:05:35.760> from<00:05:35.970> grind<00:05:36.330> i<00:05:36.630> could<00:05:36.870> kind

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
first one aside from grind i could kind

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.470 
first one aside from grind i could kind
of<00:05:37.169> do<00:05:37.440> without<00:05:37.770> it<00:05:37.830> but<00:05:38.250> that's<00:05:39.060> going<00:05:39.270> to<00:05:39.360> do

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
of do without it but that's going to do

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.090 
of do without it but that's going to do
it<00:05:39.570> for<00:05:39.660> this<00:05:39.750> one<00:05:39.900> guys<00:05:40.080> double<00:05:40.590> swarm<00:05:40.890> on

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
it for this one guys double swarm on

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.590 
it for this one guys double swarm on
these<00:05:41.280> guys<00:05:41.460> on<00:05:41.760> the<00:05:41.850> carrier<00:05:42.210> i<00:05:42.240> think<00:05:42.540> we

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
these guys on the carrier i think we

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.780 
these guys on the carrier i think we
need<00:05:42.720> to<00:05:42.870> probably<00:05:43.470> get<00:05:43.830> a<00:05:43.890> swarm<00:05:44.310> ready<00:05:44.550> for

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
need to probably get a swarm ready for

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.700 
need to probably get a swarm ready for
north<00:05:45.000> korea<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:45.540> have<00:05:45.720> it<00:05:45.810> on<00:05:45.930> standby<00:05:46.470> i

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
north korea and have it on standby i
