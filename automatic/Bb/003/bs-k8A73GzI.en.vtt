coming off a tacky number-4 corner you
know<00:00:16.720> it's<00:00:16.930> going<00:00:17.080> to<00:00:17.200> work<00:00:17.350> what<00:00:17.590> we're

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
know it's going to work what we're

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.350 
know it's going to work what we're
looking<00:00:18.040> at<00:00:18.160> basically<00:00:18.640> is<00:00:18.850> the<00:00:18.940> tire<00:00:19.150> that

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
looking at basically is the tire that

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.540 
looking at basically is the tire that
started<00:00:19.690> life<00:00:19.840> as<00:00:19.990> a<00:00:20.230> drag<00:00:20.590> racing<00:00:21.039> tire<00:00:21.250> it

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
started life as a drag racing tire it

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.310 
started life as a drag racing tire it
was<00:00:21.760> cut<00:00:22.060> down<00:00:22.270> then<00:00:22.690> they<00:00:22.840> took<00:00:23.020> it<00:00:23.080> to<00:00:23.200> a

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
was cut down then they took it to a

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.050 
was cut down then they took it to a
vulcanizing<00:00:23.890> shop<00:00:24.250> where<00:00:24.430> they<00:00:24.490> vulcanized

these<00:00:25.270> paddles<00:00:25.750> on<00:00:25.900> the<00:00:25.930> tire<00:00:26.230> these<00:00:27.040> are

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
these paddles on the tire these are

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.130 
these paddles on the tire these are
called<00:00:27.670> scoops<00:00:28.090> or<00:00:28.300> pedals<00:00:28.690> and<00:00:28.840> they<00:00:28.960> can

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
called scoops or pedals and they can

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.960 
called scoops or pedals and they can
really<00:00:29.680> stick<00:00:29.920> the<00:00:30.070> horsepower<00:00:30.460> to<00:00:30.670> the<00:00:30.700> track

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
really stick the horsepower to the track

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.819 
really stick the horsepower to the track
and<00:00:31.120> as<00:00:31.210> you<00:00:31.360> know<00:00:31.510> gary<00:00:31.810> lee<00:00:31.960> no<00:00:32.469> matter<00:00:32.649> how

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
that's when the problems happened I saw

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.720 
that's when the problems happened I saw
the<00:06:42.900> steering<00:06:43.350> wheel<00:06:43.500> okay<00:06:44.070> now<00:06:44.250> it<00:06:44.310> starts<00:06:44.640> to

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:44.730 
the steering wheel okay now it starts to

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.210 
the steering wheel okay now it starts to
drift<00:06:44.970> a<00:06:45.120> little<00:06:45.150> bit<00:06:45.560> hooks<00:06:46.560> into<00:06:46.770> the<00:06:46.920> side

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 
drift a little bit hooks into the side

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.310 
drift a little bit hooks into the side
now<00:06:47.580> he's<00:06:47.790> working<00:06:48.060> but<00:06:48.630> the<00:06:48.750> nitrous<00:06:49.140> is

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
now he's working but the nitrous is

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.350 
now he's working but the nitrous is
still<00:06:49.560> on<00:06:49.740> at<00:06:49.890> this<00:06:50.070> point<00:06:50.370> see<00:06:50.640> watch<00:06:51.120> what

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
still on at this point see watch what

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.660 
still on at this point see watch what
happens<00:06:51.660> when<00:06:51.810> it<00:06:51.840> settles<00:06:52.170> back<00:06:52.290> down<00:06:52.670> boom

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:53.670 
happens when it settles back down boom

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:54.710 
happens when it settles back down boom
right<00:06:54.030> there

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 
right there

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.280 
right there
so<00:06:55.350> third<00:06:55.680> position<00:06:56.400> now<00:06:56.580> belongs<00:06:57.030> to<00:06:57.360> Mike

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:58.290 
so third position now belongs to Mike

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.110 
so third position now belongs to Mike
Thomas<00:06:58.710> but<00:06:59.160> it<00:06:59.280> could<00:06:59.460> be<00:06:59.580> an<00:06:59.670> expensive

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
Thomas but it could be an expensive
