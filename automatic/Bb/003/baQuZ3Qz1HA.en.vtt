00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.570 
today i'm going to show you the best way
to<00:00:10.380> cut<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.830> white<00:00:11.190> cabbage<00:00:11.670> now<00:00:13.400> cabbages<00:00:14.400> can

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
to cut a white cabbage now cabbages can

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.900 
to cut a white cabbage now cabbages can
be<00:00:14.700> pretty<00:00:15.240> big<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:16.020> when<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.830> cut<00:00:17.099> them<00:00:17.369> you

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
be pretty big so when you cut them you

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.749 
be pretty big so when you cut them you
want<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:19.019> break<00:00:19.589> them<00:00:19.800> down<00:00:19.829> into<00:00:20.009> smaller

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:20.759 
want to break them down into smaller

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.790 
want to break them down into smaller
pieces<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.980> that<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.189> can<00:00:23.999> just<00:00:24.900> cut<00:00:25.560> them<00:00:25.769> a

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
pieces so that you can just cut them a

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.210 
pieces so that you can just cut them a
little<00:00:25.980> more<00:00:26.070> gracefully<00:00:26.669> now<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:28.220> green

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
little more gracefully now a green

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.640 
little more gracefully now a green
cabbage<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.939> sometimes<00:00:30.569> referred<00:00:30.839> to<00:00:31.079> as<00:00:31.289> a

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
cabbage is sometimes referred to as a

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.520 
cabbage is sometimes referred to as a
white<00:00:32.250> cabbage<00:00:32.759> because<00:00:33.449> as<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.960> get<00:00:34.109> closer

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
white cabbage because as you get closer

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.819 
white cabbage because as you get closer
to<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.100> center<00:00:35.989> see<00:00:36.989> here's<00:00:37.199> the<00:00:37.320> green<00:00:37.530> outer

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
to the center see here's the green outer

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.029 
to the center see here's the green outer
leaves<00:00:38.160> they<00:00:38.489> get<00:00:38.609> whiter<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:40.039> they're

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.039 
leaves they get whiter and they're

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:47.419 
leaves they get whiter and they're
definitely<00:00:41.989> whiter<00:00:42.989> than<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.590> red<00:00:43.890> cabbage<00:00:46.429> so

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:47.429 
definitely whiter than a red cabbage so

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:49.490 
definitely whiter than a red cabbage so
the<00:00:47.670> best<00:00:47.850> way<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.030> cut<00:00:48.239> one<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.420> these<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.929> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
the best way to cut one of these is to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.819 
the best way to cut one of these is to
use<00:00:49.710> first<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.309> all<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.429> big<00:00:50.640> sharp<00:00:50.910> knife<00:00:50.969> and

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
use first of all a big sharp knife and

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.840 
use first of all a big sharp knife and
you<00:00:52.829> want<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:54.109> cut<00:00:55.109> it<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.379> half<00:00:55.620> first<00:00:56.010> if

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
you want to cut it in half first if

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.290 
you want to cut it in half first if
you're<00:00:57.480> using<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.809> really<00:00:58.199> big<00:00:58.769> cabbage<00:00:59.300> you'll

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
you're using a really big cabbage you'll

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.509 
you're using a really big cabbage you'll
probably<00:01:00.899> want<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> cut<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.679> halfway<00:01:02.010> around

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
probably want to cut it halfway around

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.660 
probably want to cut it halfway around
and<00:01:03.420> then<00:01:03.690> put<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.379> knife<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.829> and<00:01:05.280> work<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
and then put the knife in and work the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.270 
and then put the knife in and work the
other<00:01:05.790> way<00:01:06.060> as<00:01:06.299> well<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.170> one<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.979> nice

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
other way as well but this one is a nice

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.450 
other way as well but this one is a nice
size<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.790> work<00:01:08.970> with<00:01:09.180> there<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.590> core<00:01:11.070> inside

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
size to work with there is a core inside

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.160 
size to work with there is a core inside
sometimes<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.210> core<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.509> nice<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.869> small

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
sometimes the core is nice and small

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.660 
sometimes the core is nice and small
sometimes<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:13.890> big<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.310> goes<00:01:14.460> to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
sometimes it's really big it goes to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.060 
sometimes it's really big it goes to
almost<00:01:14.790> up<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.240> down<00:01:15.329> the<00:01:15.450> whole<00:01:15.540> cabbage<00:01:16.070> but

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
almost up and down the whole cabbage but

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.240 
almost up and down the whole cabbage but
then<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.030> want<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.799> cut<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.979> core<00:01:20.220> out

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
then you just want to cut the core out

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.330 
then you just want to cut the core out
cut<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> triangle<00:01:21.630> around<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:25.070> then<00:01:26.070> you

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
cut a triangle around it and then you

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.450 
cut a triangle around it and then you
break<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.939> down<00:01:27.210> into<00:01:27.869> workable<00:01:28.770> sized<00:01:29.100> pieces

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
break it down into workable sized pieces

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.940 
break it down into workable sized pieces
and<00:01:32.659> slice<00:01:33.659> them<00:01:33.899> together<00:01:34.110> at<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.590> point

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
and slice them together at this point

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.770 
and slice them together at this point
it's<00:01:35.340> gonna<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:37.399> little<00:01:38.399> hard<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.850> handle<00:01:39.420> so

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
it's gonna be a little hard to handle so

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.120 
it's gonna be a little hard to handle so
I<00:01:39.810> turn<00:01:40.079> around<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.469> work<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.740> from<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.979> other

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
I turn around and work it from the other

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.940 
I turn around and work it from the other
side<00:01:42.799> and<00:01:44.450> there<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.259> best<00:01:46.469> way<00:01:46.710> to

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
side and there you have the best way to

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.780 
side and there you have the best way to
cut<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> white<00:01:47.579> cabbage

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.850 

you
