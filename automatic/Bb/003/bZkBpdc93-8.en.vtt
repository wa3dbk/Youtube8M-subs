00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.249 
then I'll just quickly show you his
stand<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.170> battle<00:01:55.950> game<00:01:56.100> card<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.960> obviously

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
stand and battle game card and obviously

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.870 
stand and battle game card and obviously
like<00:02:01.469> with<00:02:01.619> all<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.920> other<00:02:01.950> climbers<00:02:02.490> figures

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
like with all the other climbers figures

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.240 
like with all the other climbers figures
it<00:02:03.030> comes<00:02:03.210> with<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.479> dice<00:02:03.659> as<00:02:03.899> well

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.360 

there<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.340> go<00:02:10.569> on<00:02:11.569> to<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.840> figure<00:02:12.110> as<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.040> said

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
there you go on to the figure as I said

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.240 
there you go on to the figure as I said
is<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.640> completely<00:02:14.360> new<00:02:14.510> sculpt<00:02:14.990> and<00:02:15.770> with<00:02:16.010> that

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
is a completely new sculpt and with that

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.970 
is a completely new sculpt and with that
in<00:02:16.370> mind<00:02:16.610> is<00:02:16.910> much<00:02:17.780> more<00:02:17.959> accurate<00:02:18.470> than<00:02:18.740> the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
in mind is much more accurate than the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.120 
in mind is much more accurate than the
previous<00:02:19.550> 2008<00:02:20.390> General<00:02:21.020> Grievous<00:02:21.200> is<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:21.860> lot

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
previous 2008 General Grievous is a lot

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.880 
previous 2008 General Grievous is a lot
more<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.459> scale<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.780> he's<00:02:23.990> a<00:02:24.020> lot<00:02:24.319> taller<00:02:24.620> than

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
more to scale so he's a lot taller than

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.690 
more to scale so he's a lot taller than
all<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.220> other<00:02:25.459> figures<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:28.100> also<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.489> head

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
all the other figures and also the head

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.170 
all the other figures and also the head
is<00:02:28.850> a<00:02:28.880> lot<00:02:29.120> more<00:02:29.270> accurate<00:02:29.780> than<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.620> original

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
is a lot more accurate than the original

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.130 
is a lot more accurate than the original
as<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:32.270> can<00:02:32.420> see<00:02:32.600> it<00:02:32.690> does<00:02:32.810> come<00:02:32.959> with<00:02:33.080> two

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
as you can see it does come with two

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.510 
as you can see it does come with two
lightsabers<00:02:33.739> one<00:02:34.130> green<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.520> one<00:02:34.580> blue<00:02:34.989> and

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
come with a four-armed variant so you

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.550 
come with a four-armed variant so you

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
know you can't swap out the arms and so

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.789
