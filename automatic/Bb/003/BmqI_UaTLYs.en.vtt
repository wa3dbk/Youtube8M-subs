00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.270
 what people also talk about 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.340
 like an old boy 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.260
 I'm with you here the guys for 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.160
 show a stop for you knew 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.340
 I had a face-to-face bi I believe that 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.270
 It's one thing that 's 86 and it works. 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.970
 enough 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.789
 I often see people winning boys 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.970
 winning weapon with 10 item ticketing 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.640
 rare to have to check in and really is from 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.009
 that works but the system it gives you 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.940
 an opportunity to increase their 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.739
 chances to win 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.550
 I'll show you now you go there and 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.219
 I watch it from here it's trophy goes there 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:48.860
 trophy 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:53.129
 then this system to get the ticket taker 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:56.449
 chances of winning and have argued in 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.420
 33 months in three more chances of 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:03.059
 to win there is an item air maraca every 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.060
 ticket you buy is a chance 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.700
 that a probability of you winning 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.380
 a rare weapon and buried increases the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.090
 each team so much that 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.210
 many times someone goes there and buys 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.060
 ten ticket first time and earn as 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.710
 It worked, man. I bought 10 tickets only. 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.520
 which unfortunately I won two leave 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.710
 stay 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.950
 I did not get to win the gun 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.810
 first strong try after 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.540
 winning and this also works the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.119
