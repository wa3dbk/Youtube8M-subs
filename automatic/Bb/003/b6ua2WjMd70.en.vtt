00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello my name is ulyana transfused and 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.390
 today finally in the right about those things 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.370
 which we bought with Masha during our 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.230
 Helsinki's recent trip 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.950
 relatively recent trip how many 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.900
 more than a week has already passed and 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.850
 Frankly speaking usually from Helsinki men 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.070
 with lots of clothes 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.380
 but this time everything went absolutely 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.060
 another scenario extremely unusual and for 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.580
 me and at the same time extremely familiar time 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.800
 I bought a lot of tea and then ours 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.750
 also included a kind of fanish 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.850
 mode but then me dream 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.380
 oppress or have eaten and she will also tell 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.180
 that chaplain well and let's 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.489
 let's start with the first one that bought it 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.110
 there was a lot of tea and all now when I see 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.579
 the tea that bought will tell the ulian cusp 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.950
 on the side too many such something 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.590
 I brought her brought her a lot 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.770
 persons on 8 many lenses wallpaper drops liter and 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.210
 honestly a lot of lipton 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.210
 and I do not know any crazy 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.079
 the tower and tea and let me not continue 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.840
 continue but what I bought is the first thing 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.239
 for which I was originally going about this 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.430
 lifting when they aren't such some 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.590
 spicy green tea do not really like 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.360

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.040

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.930

 he was happy at the cottage in Russian I 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.659

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.040

 ordinary tea to be brewed 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.790
 self not packaged tea 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.040

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.670
 I also bought tea in stockmanna sauce 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.980

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.260
 Moscow green tea there is an ordinary 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.900

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.690
 flavoring again and comment 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.140

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.180

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.569
 and can be a tea vlogger will 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.830
 talk about tea for hours and what else i bought 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:37.130
 also juice mania found ariel gray let's call 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.350
 this is also very tasty 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.420
 also court spicy did not try at all 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.019
 principle not in packaged version not 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.950
 in such 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:49.340
 but just before Rio 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:53.060
 drink tea and 2 more baku including which 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:57.019
 bought this organic tea and intensity from 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.150
 clips and another organism and current fusion 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.000
 here is creeps here is this thing to me very 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.550
 like the fact that inscribed soil cast 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.470
 on but she kabule spicy so bright 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.970
 pronounced taste cinnamon is not felt a 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.600
 This thing is just some kind of something. 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.430
 I know tea from, if at all possible 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.799
 you can drink this thing only 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.739
 small balls in my opinion because 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:22.570
 what's the licorice root here which 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.799
 use at all when all sorts of scan so 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.680
 ear and throat diseases that is 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.049
 When bronchitis and all do something 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.600
 expectorant here is licorice root and here 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.940
 its a lot judging by the smell and judging by 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.470
 taste and very strange to be honest 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.829
 taste small balls 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.250
 the window a whole cup I could have been able to eat 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.829
 so I will say this 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.430
 the experiment was conducted and ended and 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:48.320
 one more thing i bought it also 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.250
 from this company fliku 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.480
 but this time it is hot chocolate and 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.180
 of course despite the fact that they are so 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.290
 super duper paint what make us 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.069
 so what sense do 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.109
 incredibly tasty in fact shit from 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.890
 the phases I really like can't compare 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:11.629
 just not that well, most likely 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:14.219
 I will not buy this anymore and 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.709
 nutritious tea shopping is over and 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:18.660
 let's now 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:23.630
 although not able to do this day will appear 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.630

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:22.530
 send and buy and so on all this i 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:27.440

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.940
 hands I am now all this how much I right now 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.010

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.610
 later I scholknu fingers waving 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.390
 disappears and as I walked left 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.220
 very little 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.890
 following our purchases of currency these 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.570
 gum in h &amp; m david usually dinky for 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.770
 hair but not so ordinary gum 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.950
 rushed to it all got used 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.060
 and here such amusing lasting me half a year 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.910
 backwards 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.390
 Betani mota which some name is poppy 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.870
 Barbie 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:49.630
 but 7 what is and she loved these very much 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.300
 gum i think now because very 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.740
 convenient to use is a john 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.290
 frieda then in the morning you can wake up 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.960
 so behind water curls or waves 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:01.030
 very comfortable and they are on the hands of the calf 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.760
 just fine now big cow 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.860
 forever the house had three different 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.870
 options for gum such three sets were 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.910
 These different colors are not I 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.590
 like yellow very often and wear 

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.990
 generally quite interesting for years and 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.850
 colors were also like that in my opinion 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.440
 slightly more classic set with the usual 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.120
 black gum with such some 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.370
 eggplant which seems some 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.160
 red out two camouflage rubber bands 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.900
 one of which had just fallen and was 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.630
 also such a bit more festive 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.640
 set with such elastic bands with some 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:33.310
 glitter they are almost some velvet 

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.740
 black maroon and so rosy 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:37.630
 rose gold i sing even called and 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.070
