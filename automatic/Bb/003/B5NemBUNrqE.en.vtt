recommend<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:14.220> everyone<00:01:14.580> gets<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.150> even

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
recommend that everyone gets this even

DPS<00:01:16.070> it's<00:01:17.070> extremely<00:01:17.490> useful<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.830> it<00:01:19.830> doesn't

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
DPS it's extremely useful and it doesn't

DPS it's extremely useful and it doesn't
exactly<00:01:20.250> do<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.610> fight<00:01:20.790> for<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.210> but

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
exactly do the fight for you but

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.390 
exactly do the fight for you but
essentially<00:01:22.439> tells<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.890> what's<00:01:23.070> going<00:01:23.280> to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
essentially tells you what's going to

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.570 
essentially tells you what's going to
happen<00:01:23.670> for<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.030> that's<00:01:25.020> really<00:01:25.259> handy<00:01:25.590> so

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
happen for you that's really handy so

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.520 
happen for you that's really handy so
the<00:01:26.670> basic<00:01:26.909> idea<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> add-on<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.290> of

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the basic idea with the add-on is of

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.960 
the basic idea with the add-on is of
course<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.979> shows<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.430> four<00:01:29.640> train

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
course it shows you the four train

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.080 
course it shows you the four train
tracks<00:01:30.270> your<00:01:31.110> position<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.860> then<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.880> course

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
tracks your position and then of course

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.090 
tracks your position and then of course
the<00:01:33.299> position<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.200> next<00:01:34.590> trains<00:01:34.890> are

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
the position that the next trains are

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.210 
the position that the next trains are
going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.400> be<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.880> coming<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.860> also<00:01:37.860> what

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
going to be in coming and also what

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.819 
going to be in coming and also what
those<00:01:38.430> trains<00:01:38.759> will<00:01:39.090> entail<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.960> what<00:01:40.710> they're

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
those trains will entail so what they're

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.889 
those trains will entail so what they're
just<00:01:41.100> passing<00:01:41.490> through<00:01:41.729> or<00:01:42.090> dropping<00:01:42.570> off<00:01:42.659> ads

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
just passing through or dropping off ads

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
and what type of ads and all that good

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.999 
and what type of ads and all that good
stuff<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:45.290> highly<00:01:46.290> recommend<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.680> use<00:01:46.829> this

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
stuff so highly recommend you use this

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.270 
stuff so highly recommend you use this
you<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.460> also<00:01:47.579> go<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.000> configuration<00:01:48.540> and

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
you can also go to the configuration and

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.639 
you can also go to the configuration and
adjust<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:51.079> warning<00:01:52.079> time<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.500> before

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
adjust the warning time you have before

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.039 
adjust the warning time you have before
the<00:01:52.979> next<00:01:53.100> train<00:01:53.399> set<00:01:53.729> comes<00:01:53.939> out<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
the next train set comes out so the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.539 
the next train set comes out so the
higher<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.829> more<00:01:55.979> warning<00:01:56.399> time

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
higher this is the more warning time

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.469 
higher this is the more warning time
you'll<00:01:56.670> have<00:01:56.790> available<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:59.390> so<00:02:00.390> as

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
you'll have available to you so as

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.819 
you'll have available to you so as
mentioned<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:01.079> fight<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.439> mostly<00:02:01.740> about

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
mentioned this fight is mostly about

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.300 
mentioned this fight is mostly about
killing<00:02:02.310> ads<00:02:02.520> damage<00:02:03.509> on<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.689> boss<00:02:03.869> is

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
killing ads damage on the boss is

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.429 
killing ads damage on the boss is
generally<00:02:05.310> incidental<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.840> may<00:02:07.200> start

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
generally incidental so you may start

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.290 
generally incidental so you may start
off<00:02:07.619> using<00:02:08.069> bloodlust<00:02:08.729> at<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.000> beginning

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
off using bloodlust at the beginning

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.999 
off using bloodlust at the beginning
because<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:10.050> have<00:02:10.140> some<00:02:10.349> time<00:02:10.530> before<00:02:10.590> you

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
because you have some time before you

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.170 
because you have some time before you
actually<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.580> ads<00:02:11.879> but

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
actually get ads but

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.849 
actually get ads but
other<00:02:13.329> than<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:13.510> most<00:02:14.409> of<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:14.650> will<00:02:14.799> be

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:14.859 
other than that most of this will be

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.030 
other than that most of this will be
focusing<00:02:15.459> on<00:02:15.609> killing<00:02:16.120> off<00:02:16.209> ads<00:02:16.390> quickly

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
focusing on killing off ads quickly

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.229 
focusing on killing off ads quickly
because<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.129> longer<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.519> ads<00:02:18.730> are<00:02:18.849> active

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
because the longer the ads are active

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.539 
because the longer the ads are active
the<00:02:19.900> more<00:02:20.200> damage<00:02:20.409> they<00:02:20.950> do<00:02:21.010> in<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.400> more

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
the more damage they do in the more

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.089 
the more damage they do in the more
dangerous<00:02:21.849> they<00:02:22.030> become<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:23.560> you<00:02:23.620> can<00:02:23.739> see<00:02:23.859> the

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
dangerous they become so you can see the

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.800 
dangerous they become so you can see the
list<00:02:24.310> of<00:02:24.430> ads<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:24.790> you'll<00:02:25.000> see<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.599> top

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
list of ads that you'll see the top

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.369 
list of ads that you'll see the top
there<00:02:26.129> basically<00:02:27.129> what<00:02:27.459> they<00:02:27.790> will<00:02:27.939> use<00:02:28.379> so

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
there basically what they will use so

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.379 
there basically what they will use so
for<00:02:29.829> example<00:02:29.889> if<00:02:30.489> you<00:02:30.849> are<00:02:30.879> male<00:02:31.239> in

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:31.389 
for example if you are male in

for example if you are male in
particular<00:02:31.870> try<00:02:32.139> to<00:02:32.200> focus<00:02:32.439> and<00:02:32.799> interrupt

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
particular try to focus and interrupt

the firebenders range players should of

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.039 
the firebenders range players should of

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
seconds and these bombs you know

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.699 
seconds and these bombs you know
obviously<00:02:49.389> should<00:02:49.930> be<00:02:50.019> dropped<00:02:50.290> along<00:02:50.560> the

doors if possible but otherwise just not

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.280 
doors if possible but otherwise just not
in<00:02:55.090> your<00:02:55.209> melee<00:02:57.659> the<00:02:58.659> last<00:02:58.930> thing<00:02:59.109> to<00:02:59.230> mention

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
in your melee the last thing to mention

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.220 
in your melee the last thing to mention
is<00:02:59.739> that<00:03:00.359> while<00:03:01.359> the<00:03:01.510> raid<00:03:01.689> will<00:03:01.870> generally<00:03:02.169> be

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
is that while the raid will generally be

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.959 
is that while the raid will generally be
able<00:03:02.439> to<00:03:02.530> stay<00:03:02.980> together<00:03:03.250> throughout<00:03:03.819> the

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:03.969 
able to stay together throughout the

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.420 
able to stay together throughout the
fight<00:03:04.180> there<00:03:05.139> are<00:03:05.319> two<00:03:05.530> moments<00:03:05.799> where<00:03:06.250> the

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
fight there are two moments where the

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.670 
fight there are two moments where the
rate<00:03:06.549> has<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:06.879> be<00:03:07.000> split<00:03:07.299> up<00:03:07.329> so<00:03:08.319> generally

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
rate has to be split up so generally

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.159 
rate has to be split up so generally
your<00:03:08.859> raid<00:03:09.099> strategy<00:03:09.549> will<00:03:09.730> have<00:03:10.139> half<00:03:11.139> the

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:11.169 
your raid strategy will have half the

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.009 
your raid strategy will have half the
rate<00:03:11.439> assigned<00:03:11.769> to<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.879> northern<00:03:13.269> track<00:03:13.540> and

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
rate assigned to the northern track and

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.449 
rate assigned to the northern track and
half<00:03:14.349> the<00:03:14.379> rate<00:03:14.680> assigned<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.129> southern

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
half the rate assigned to the southern

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.849 
half the rate assigned to the southern
track<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.090> so<00:03:17.049> you<00:03:17.109> have<00:03:17.319> to<00:03:17.470> remember<00:03:17.680> of

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
track and so you have to remember of

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.289 
track and so you have to remember of
course<00:03:17.919> which<00:03:18.250> when<00:03:18.430> you're<00:03:18.519> assigned<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:18.909> and

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
course which when you're assigned to and

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.319 
course which when you're assigned to and
when<00:03:20.169> these<00:03:20.290> split<00:03:20.620> phases<00:03:21.010> occur<00:03:21.340> quickly<00:03:22.000> go

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
when these split phases occur quickly go

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.390 
when these split phases occur quickly go
there<00:03:22.540> because<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.319> two<00:03:23.680> central<00:03:24.069> tracks

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
there because the two central tracks

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.520 
there because the two central tracks
will<00:03:24.639> have<00:03:24.790> trains<00:03:25.120> on<00:03:25.389> them<00:03:26.169> that<00:03:26.379> will

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
will have trains on them that will

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.789 
will have trains on them that will
release<00:03:26.769> ads<00:03:27.069> from<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.549> outside<00:03:28.680> so<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:29.739> can

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
release ads from the outside so you can

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.349 
release ads from the outside so you can
see<00:03:30.010> there<00:03:30.159> are<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.340> three<00:03:30.489> then<00:03:30.939> our<00:03:31.150> group

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
see there are the three then our group

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.140 
see there are the three then our group
was<00:03:31.479> split<00:03:31.629> up<00:03:31.840> with<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.049> other<00:03:32.169> group<00:03:32.349> and

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
was split up with the other group and

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.159 
was split up with the other group and
otherwise<00:03:34.150> once<00:03:34.510> you're<00:03:34.629> in<00:03:34.720> your<00:03:34.810> position

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
otherwise once you're in your position

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:36.990 
otherwise once you're in your position
just<00:03:35.470> every<00:03:36.159> effect<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.489> ads<00:03:36.639> down<00:03:36.879> as

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
just every effect the ads down as

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.179 
just every effect the ads down as
quickly<00:03:37.180> as<00:03:37.359> possible<00:03:37.810> because<00:03:38.680> once<00:03:39.010> they're

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:39.189 
quickly as possible because once they're

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:41.999 
quickly as possible because once they're
dead<00:03:39.489> then<00:03:40.199> you're<00:03:41.199> free<00:03:41.379> to<00:03:41.650> move<00:03:41.799> back

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:42.009 
dead then you're free to move back

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:44.009 
dead then you're free to move back
towards<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.370> center<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:42.819> join<00:03:43.720> up<00:03:43.840> with<00:03:43.870> the

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
towards the center and join up with the

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.379 
towards the center and join up with the
rest<00:03:44.169> of<00:03:44.229> the<00:03:44.319> raid<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:48.280> that<00:03:49.000> covers<00:03:49.209> it

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
rest of the raid so that covers it

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.089 
rest of the raid so that covers it
really<00:03:49.720> like<00:03:50.259> i<00:03:50.290> said<00:03:50.470> its<00:03:50.590> overall<00:03:50.859> very

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
really like i said its overall very

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.219 
really like i said its overall very
simple<00:03:51.519> fight<00:03:51.759> it's<00:03:52.479> mostly<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.930> matter<00:03:53.049> of

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:53.229 
simple fight it's mostly a matter of

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:55.439 
simple fight it's mostly a matter of
getting<00:03:53.859> used<00:03:54.099> to<00:03:54.280> dodging<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.639> trains<00:03:54.939> which

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:55.449 
getting used to dodging the trains which

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.800 
getting used to dodging the trains which
the<00:03:55.840> add-on<00:03:56.109> will<00:03:56.319> help<00:03:56.530> with<00:03:56.650> immensely<00:03:57.189> and

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
the add-on will help with immensely and

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.089 
the add-on will help with immensely and
you<00:03:58.810> know<00:03:58.900> using<00:03:59.259> as<00:03:59.349> much<00:03:59.500> area<00:03:59.829> effect

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
you know using as much area effect

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.009 
you know using as much area effect
damage<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.729> burst<00:04:00.909> on<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.209> ads<00:04:01.359> as<00:04:01.509> possible

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
damage and burst on the ads as possible

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.860 
damage and burst on the ads as possible
so<00:04:02.620> that<00:04:02.650> you<00:04:02.829> get<00:04:02.919> them<00:04:03.099> down<00:04:03.250> quickly<00:04:03.870> the

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
so that you get them down quickly the

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.330 
so that you get them down quickly the
number<00:04:05.409> of<00:04:05.439> mechanics<00:04:05.949> you<00:04:06.040> have<00:04:06.129> to<00:04:06.250> avoid

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
number of mechanics you have to avoid

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.830 
number of mechanics you have to avoid
other<00:04:06.729> than<00:04:06.939> trains<00:04:07.209> is<00:04:07.419> not<00:04:07.629> that

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
other than trains is not that

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.869 
other than trains is not that
significant<00:04:08.470> and<00:04:08.650> or<00:04:09.519> are<00:04:09.639> they<00:04:09.759> that

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
significant and or are they that

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.030 
significant and or are they that
dangerous<00:04:10.419> so<00:04:11.259> if<00:04:11.409> you<00:04:11.500> avoid<00:04:11.680> trains

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
dangerous so if you avoid trains

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.009 
dangerous so if you avoid trains
throughout<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.459> fight<00:04:12.669> you'll<00:04:13.509> generally<00:04:13.810> be

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
throughout the fight you'll generally be

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.009 
throughout the fight you'll generally be
