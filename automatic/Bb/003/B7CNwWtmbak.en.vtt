00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:09.330
 I will show you how to do this video here. 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:14.099
 This type of compound is quality 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:18.000
 reliable and in principle can be done with 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.970
 fixed size that is without 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.310
 any errors and it will be convenient 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:30.300
 assembly here is the connection goes to shkant with 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.189
 drilling holes that is for 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.250
 I made this so small 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.210
 drilling machine which drills on 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.050
 horizontal plane I made it from 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.340
 12-volt car motor 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:50.930
 Here he works quietly quietly here 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.250
 worth Sanga bought on a Chinese site 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.620
 very cheap 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.770
 well if your co2 millimeter dowels 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.430
 it is we ordinary toothpick is here 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.920
 sawn into several parts 2 millimeters 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.520
 Respectively, as well as here's 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.030
 she sits down pretty tight that is 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.520
 in principle that is good for 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.549
 connection that is, it will not be 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.040
 hanging out here is the advantage of it 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.939
 stop what he drills on the plane 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.830
 we have no deviations by 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.159
 horizontals and vertically i.e. 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:34.070
 Now I'll show it to you. 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.070
 billet here usually 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.330
 that is, you can pre-do 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.090
 markup where to drill 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:47.350
 but I often do arbitrarily either 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:50.979
 place clamp with clamp 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.200
 either done already ie ready ready 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.330
 a template that will be here for me 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.270
 and now the video system everybody put under 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.940
 chic that is, under different heights well, if you 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.840
 working with a fixed size 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.930
 fixed and the thickness is possible 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.030
 make one template that you will have 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.979
 stand constantly and you will be on it 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.060
 beat that is without any markup 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.010
 needed 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:23.640
 typical drilling sizes as well as forehead 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:23.640
 taken part is drilled on the end 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.660
 You can also do it by the stop, that is 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:35.910
 put u porous with goes connection 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:40.360
 of this type i.e. primate is flush then 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:43.300
 one size will be i mean i solve everything 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.660
 first links with one size here 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:50.800
 this part then why the same size here 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:54.010
 this part you have no care of this 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:59.200
 size will not be exactly but if you will 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.180
 high quality drill like this 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.770
 machine tool 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.770
 We take the details well, respectively 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.770
 we collect 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.690
 such a plan, that is, so I collected as 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.440
 you see no deviation at all 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:30.070
 on the plane that is pretty accurate 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.700
 qualitatively there is a drop of glue there and she 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:39.090
 generally it will be very good to hold it 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:47.140
 the whole thing further, that is, you can already 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:53.790
 experiment with this whole thing yes 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:56.790
 I have another toothpick insert another 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.790
 the size 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:13.269
 already 2 items 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:19.609
 connected and we can still insert here 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:24.620
 also yes yes and insert this miracle that is 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:32.240
 here we will have accordingly 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:34.630
 it passed a little bit a toothpick 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.630
 a business 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:49.419
 the essence of the idea is this, respectively 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.419
 stanochke 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:02.000
 works as i said on volt 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:06.270
 the switch engine is worth to 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.380
 enable disable here I have 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:16.230
 power supply 5 amp put it 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:19.100
 fan that cools the unit 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:23.430
 food can be bought in a regular store 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:25.950
 planets are electrics or something like that 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.290
 have it designed for lighting for 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.680
 led strip which put on 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:34.700
 kitchen and furniture 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.700
 that's actually heating
