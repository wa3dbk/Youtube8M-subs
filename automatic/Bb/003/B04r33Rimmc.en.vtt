00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:49.849 
things like that and they found I didn't
know<00:00:48.269> their<00:00:48.420> proportion<00:00:48.870> right<00:00:49.050> nothing<00:00:49.739> I

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
know their proportion right nothing I

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:51.950 
know their proportion right nothing I
did<00:00:50.069> would<00:00:50.640> help<00:00:50.850> me<00:00:50.999> so<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.659> is<00:00:51.780> what<00:00:51.929> I

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
in simple shapes and determine all my

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.389 
in simple shapes and determine all my
proportion<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.899> gesture<00:00:58.679> the<00:00:58.949> first<00:00:59.190> few
