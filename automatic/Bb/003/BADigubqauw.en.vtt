00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello everyone I'm so glad 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.250
 find today to present a 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.379
 makeup that I find more suitable 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.179
 for the school where work is enough 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.710
 light at eye level and after a 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.019
 good student you can vary but 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.030
 it's pretty true I think adapted for this 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.609
 kind of structure in quotation marks so 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.470
 these I start of course 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.660
 by the base so I apply the country 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.550
 Mac's door is using is the basis of 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.990
 our choice it will ensure you a 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.890
 excellent throughout the day 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.890
 which is very important 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.100
 for makeup is what I'm going 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.080
 use the nike palette is basic to 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.690
 at home claimed using the by 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.480
 quests 2 which is a kind of top 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.040
 beige or really perfect for the hollow 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.090
 so that's how I 'm going to apply it 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.410
 in the hollow of the eyelid 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.360
 he brought a structure to the hangar 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.940
 to fade game even little foxy blush 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.250
 on my brush so that the beige matt 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.809
 beyond the pallet is actually going to me 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.360
 allow a better remain in page and 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:03.079
 especially to avoid having a demarcation 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.059
 too pronounced we go to the lighthouse of the 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.030
 mobile eyelid so I use the lighthouse 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.790
 walk of shame which is a kind of rose 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.140
 very pale which is almost white we are going 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.000
 say and I applied it on the set of 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.830
 the eyelid is here but the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.899
 to do after the hollow like that that and quickly 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.880
 is that they are not too much and that 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.440
 the colors mix 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.090
 you can just as well stop yourself 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.039
 where a little more work the hollow 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.170
 which is what I do I use the 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.450
 breeze block is always from the palette that 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.850
 is this time at a brown top at 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.920
 sequence very pigmented so that I 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.290
 will become place and whose corner 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.260
 external of my eye to bring a 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.119
 form a slightly more structured form 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.619
 forgiveness to the eye for the time without noise 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.420
 a little more the look but that 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.890
 it's not early worship onssa expenses 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.150
 went to school or work 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.640
 what you are looking for simply 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.900
 so I apply locally and in fact I 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.110
 come on is what do we do I come in 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.570
 add and so on 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.640
 for the light touch I apply in 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.200
 At first paroxysm often 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.910
 eyebrows as a whole 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.710
 and I add a little bit of makeup 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.060
 city ​​must also on my senses it 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.220
 may bring a touch canes 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.060
 of light since the whole 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.320
 shares and assibat and finally we finish 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.120
 with their help also inside where 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.800
 jacques and that their sentences which is so 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.630
 the French top of the palette that 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.100
 I was applying in my outer corner and 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.650
 I apply toulon de mourad and if at 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.450
 simply do it as a mode 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.790
 habit I apply a flesh color 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.250
 so this is the scandal eyes the nude of 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.840
 so cheery mixes in my life that drapes 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.970
 elsewhere and finally we did not finish with 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.280
 the headlights I apply the black makeup of the 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.440
 planet that is actually in the guise of 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.590
 liner so I find that for the school where 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.090
 first work a liner already that 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.459
 takes time and it's not necessarily 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.190
 all can not do it necessarily while 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.260
 than to pique a black spice also spicy 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.700
 that this one along the flush of the eyelashes 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.350
 it's very fast very simple that to 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.560
 range of all winds and at the same time 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.840
 it's not as sustained as kleiner 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.030
 liquid so here and at the same time 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.100
 still allows to emphasize nicely 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.140
 watch it all that's nice so 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.720
 I'm applying with a little god with a 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.000
 small beveled brush by applying 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.430
 really at the rat's port decides 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.780
 superior and I just drop 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.370
 slightly 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.500
 and so I end of course eyes 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.720
 with a good layer of mascara so 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.920
 so much the atmosphere of ruling the max love of 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.300
 at bourjois for the nice blush for 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.280
 a cream blush this time so this is 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.319
 the schist petunia he to whom so 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.459
 like just sumptuous cream the job 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.890
 very very little because you can 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.690
 see mega pigmented and made it 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.330
 will really give an effect totally 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.010
 goodville in the face the outfit is 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.709
 excellent and in addition to that that's it 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.910
 indeed gives super cool hyper pretty 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.590

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.870
 meaning really very very pretty and on a 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.370
 Neutral eye makeup as well 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.940
 complete rather well and it ends 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.830

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.920
 glo and that this makeup is the 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.420
 easier and good-looking effect possible 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.370
 it is decided to accommodate a very small 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.310
 little in the minor have classified the stick 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.380
 at elf that I apply on the frame 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.280
 to play a little bit on the bridge of the nose 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.530
 not to the end 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.569
