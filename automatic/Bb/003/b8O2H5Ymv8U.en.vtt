00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
and that's essentially what this is kind

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.520 
and that's essentially what this is kind
of<00:01:09.299> think<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:09.720> I'm<00:01:10.020> following<00:01:10.409> with

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
of think of it like I'm following with

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.620 
of think of it like I'm following with
the<00:01:10.619> GoPro<00:01:10.979> camera<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:12.420> don't

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the GoPro camera but I just don't

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.990 
the GoPro camera but I just don't
actually<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.350> one<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.799> we<00:01:14.400> hit<00:01:14.549> some<00:01:14.760> crazy

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
actually have one so we hit some crazy

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.670 
actually have one so we hit some crazy
jumps<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.110> want<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.439> kind<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
jumps on this and I want to kind of

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.280 
jumps on this and I want to kind of
expand<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.369> series<00:01:17.790> into<00:01:18.450> many<00:01:18.720> different

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
expand this series into many different
