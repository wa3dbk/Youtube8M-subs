Birmingham<00:00:25.050> but<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.590> live<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.039> London<00:00:26.130> at<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
Birmingham but I live in London at the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:36.709 
Birmingham but I live in London at the
moment<00:00:33.860> probably<00:00:34.860> say<00:00:35.010> hip<00:00:35.250> hop<00:00:35.460> music<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.149> like

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
moment probably say hip hop music I like

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.270 
moment probably say hip hop music I like
better<00:00:37.110> because<00:00:37.410> there's<00:00:37.739> more<00:00:37.829> lyrical

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
better because there's more lyrical

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.430 
better because there's more lyrical
content<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.120> know<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.140> be<00:00:40.260> educated

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
content and you know you can be educated

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.900 
content and you know you can be educated
from<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.430> hear

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
from what you hear

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.970 
from what you hear
whereas<00:00:42.300> house<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.870> more<00:00:43.200> musicality<00:00:43.680> and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
whereas house is more musicality and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.400 
whereas house is more musicality and
vocals<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.520> not<00:00:45.030> much<00:00:45.210> education<00:00:45.899> going<00:00:46.289> on

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
vocals and not much education going on

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.080 
vocals and not much education going on
whereas<00:00:46.620> hip<00:00:46.770> hop<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.039> about<00:00:47.250> raising<00:00:47.910> your

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
whereas hip hop is about raising your

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.020 
whereas hip hop is about raising your
consciousness<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.440> can't<00:00:50.280> say<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> dance<00:00:50.789> I

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
consciousness so I can't say the dance I

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:02.049 
consciousness so I can't say the dance I
prefer<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.690> prefer<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> music<00:00:52.440> over<00:00:52.920> the

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.149 

and<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.149> was<00:01:03.329> good<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.719> think<00:01:03.989> people<00:01:04.170> maybe

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
and it was good I think people maybe

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.850 
and it was good I think people maybe
when<00:01:05.460> ready<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.270> what<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.420> was<00:01:06.659> giving<00:01:07.170> but

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
when ready for what I was giving but

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.429 
when ready for what I was giving but
that's<00:01:08.400> almost<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.330> better<00:01:09.600> part<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.350> a

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
that's almost the better part of a

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.020 
that's almost the better part of a
workshop<00:01:10.830> because<00:01:11.010> if<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.250> expect<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.880> you

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
workshop because if you expect it you

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.039 
workshop because if you expect it you
already<00:01:12.240> know<00:01:12.330> what's<00:01:12.510> gonna<00:01:12.600> happen<00:01:12.750> but

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
already know what's gonna happen but

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.810 
already know what's gonna happen but
when<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.229> don't<00:01:13.380> expect<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.890> you're<00:01:14.490> gonna<00:01:14.640> be

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
when you don't expect it you're gonna be

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.399 
when you don't expect it you're gonna be
thinking<00:01:14.970> new<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.630> different<00:01:15.780> things<00:01:16.110> which

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
thinking new and different things which

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.929 
thinking new and different things which
is<00:01:16.560> what<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.740> wanted<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.340> wanted<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.729> shock

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
is what I wanted to do I wanted to shock

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.179 
is what I wanted to do I wanted to shock
people<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.810> show<00:01:18.960> them<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.710> basics

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
people to show them that the basics

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.320 
people to show them that the basics
aren't<00:01:21.000> easy

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
aren't easy

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.719 
aren't easy
that<00:01:22.229> they're<00:01:22.710> basic<00:01:23.100> but<00:01:23.610> they're

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
that they're basic but they're

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.340 
that they're basic but they're
complicated<00:01:24.299> at<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.540> same<00:01:24.689> time<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.290> I

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
complicated at the same time so I

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.170 
complicated at the same time so I
wouldn't<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.650> get<00:01:25.770> your<00:01:25.890> basics<00:01:26.280> anything<00:01:27.060> is

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
wouldn't you get your basics anything is

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.649 
wouldn't you get your basics anything is
possible

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
possible

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:37.270 
possible
so<00:01:28.110> that's<00:01:28.290> kind<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.560> what<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.740> wanted<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.070> show

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.880 

beginners<00:01:38.280> I'd<00:01:39.030> probably<00:01:39.390> give<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:40.710> same

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
beginners I'd probably give the same

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.890 
beginners I'd probably give the same
advice<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.460> did<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.119> myself<00:01:42.240> when<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.750> was

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
advice that I did for myself when I was

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.429 
advice that I did for myself when I was
beginning<00:01:43.080> I<00:01:43.380> did<00:01:43.530> everything<00:01:43.940> every<00:01:44.940> battle

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
beginning I did everything every battle

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.200 
beginning I did everything every battle
any<00:01:46.439> workshop<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.070> was<00:01:47.190> available<00:01:47.490> I

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
any workshop that was available I

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.660 
any workshop that was available I
traveled<00:01:49.200> when<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.470> could<00:01:49.740> whether<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.610> a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
traveled when I could whether it be to a

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.190 
traveled when I could whether it be to a
different<00:01:51.000> city<00:01:51.240> or<00:01:51.539> to<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.720> different<00:01:52.049> country

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
different city or to a different country

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.990 
different city or to a different country
because<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> more<00:01:53.310> experience<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.789> gain

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
because the more experience you gain

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.880 
because the more experience you gain
quicker<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.810> better<00:01:54.840> you'll<00:01:55.259> develop<00:01:55.560> when

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
quicker the better you'll develop when

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:05.210

you're older keep prospering try and

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.590 
you're older keep prospering try and
bring<00:02:05.399> more<00:02:05.580> people<00:02:05.819> into<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.270> studio

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
bring more people into the studio

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.809

educate them the right way so they know
where<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.030> go<00:02:09.300> rather<00:02:10.259> than<00:02:11.030> be<00:02:12.030> as<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.420> studio

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
where to go rather than be as a studio

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.290 
where to go rather than be as a studio
where<00:02:13.080> people<00:02:13.410> just<00:02:13.560> take<00:02:14.220> information<00:02:15.030> but

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
where people just take information but

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
you learn because questioning is how you
