wreck boot now this is a great
application<00:00:11.780> and<00:00:12.650> I<00:00:13.190> basically<00:00:13.700> use<00:00:14.030> it<00:00:14.240> when

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
application and I basically use it when

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.720 
application and I basically use it when
I'm<00:00:14.660> downgrading<00:00:15.559> because<00:00:16.250> when<00:00:16.609> you

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
I'm downgrading because when you

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.499 
I'm downgrading because when you
downgrade<00:00:17.300> you<00:00:17.689> will<00:00:17.839> almost<00:00:18.050> always<00:00:18.439> get<00:00:19.160> a

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:19.509 
downgrade you will almost always get a

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.849 
downgrade you will almost always get a
10-15<00:00:20.509> or<00:00:20.779> a<00:00:21.339> 1004<00:00:22.339> error<00:00:22.669> in<00:00:22.970> iTunes<00:00:23.599> and<00:00:23.869> that

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
10-15 or a 1004 error in iTunes and that

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.279 
10-15 or a 1004 error in iTunes and that
actually<00:00:25.550> is<00:00:25.730> just<00:00:25.759> iTunes<00:00:26.480> trying<00:00:26.839> to<00:00:26.989> stop

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
actually is just iTunes trying to stop

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.659 
actually is just iTunes trying to stop
you<00:00:27.470> from<00:00:27.589> downgrading<00:00:28.220> and<00:00:28.339> trying<00:00:28.550> to

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:28.669 
you from downgrading and trying to

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.359 
you from downgrading and trying to
prevent<00:00:29.029> you<00:00:29.300> from<00:00:29.470> downgrading<00:00:30.470> but<00:00:31.069> it

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
prevent you from downgrading but it

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.700 
prevent you from downgrading but it
actually<00:00:31.579> finished<00:00:32.329> the<00:00:32.540> restore<00:00:33.020> and<00:00:33.230> all
