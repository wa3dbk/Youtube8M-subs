 erika decided to make fig coffee if 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.320
 as he heard coffee I say I made a 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:32.340
 I experienced something different then 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.820

 so that makes this drink more 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.540
 healthy and natural the production process 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.640

 first harvest is washed and 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.810
 subsequently the elected moment is such 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.550
 that if it costs a little more
