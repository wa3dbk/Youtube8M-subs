from<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.370> kitchen<00:00:08.790> sinks<00:00:09.500> was<00:00:10.500> leaking<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.130> we

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
from the kitchen sinks was leaking so we

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.580 
from the kitchen sinks was leaking so we
decided<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.509> do<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.660> slightly<00:00:12.990> different<00:00:13.230> type

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
decided to do a slightly different type

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
it already we're not going to do a

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.450 
it already we're not going to do a

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
how we fixed it in more of a vlog type

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.269 
how we fixed it in more of a vlog type
video<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.830> we'll<00:00:28.830> also<00:00:28.920> give<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.250> some

video and we'll also give you some
insight<00:00:29.760> as<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.330> how<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:31.910> plumbing<00:00:32.910> connects

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
insight as to how the plumbing connects

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.799 
insight as to how the plumbing connects
from<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.170> slide<00:00:34.469> out<00:00:34.680> into<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.250> RV<00:00:35.489> itself<00:00:36.059> so

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
from the slide out into the RV itself so

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.229 
from the slide out into the RV itself so
this<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.320> what<00:00:37.500> was<00:00:37.620> wrong<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.309> drain<00:00:38.969> pipe

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
this is what was wrong this drain pipe

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.260 
this is what was wrong this drain pipe
that<00:00:39.450> comes<00:00:39.629> from<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.899> sinks<00:00:40.200> was<00:00:41.270> flexing

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
that comes from the sinks was flexing

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.910 
that comes from the sinks was flexing
over<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.629> over<00:00:42.809> again<00:00:42.930> every<00:00:43.170> time<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.649> slide

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
over and over again every time the slide

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.000 
over and over again every time the slide
goes<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.430> out<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:45.719> cracked<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.620> seal

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
goes in and out and it cracked the seal

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.790 
goes in and out and it cracked the seal
at<00:00:47.250> one<00:00:47.460> end<00:00:47.960> so<00:00:48.960> I'm<00:00:49.050> going<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.260> run<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> slide

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
at one end so I'm going to run the slide

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.700 
at one end so I'm going to run the slide
in<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.579> then<00:00:51.270> back<00:00:51.480> out<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.379> give<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.649> an

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
in and then back out just to give you an

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.860 
in and then back out just to give you an
idea<00:00:53.270> how<00:00:54.270> new<00:00:54.510> more<00:00:55.309> connects<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:57.210> kitchen

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
idea how new more connects the kitchen

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.930 
idea how new more connects the kitchen
slide<00:00:58.199> out<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.469> RV<00:01:01.649> you're<00:01:02.609> going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.820> see

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
slide out to the RV you're going to see

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.550 
slide out to the RV you're going to see
how<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.149> works<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:08.540> now<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.600> access<00:01:10.110> panel

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
how this works here now the access panel

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.030 
how this works here now the access panel
is<00:01:10.790> off<00:01:11.790> right<00:01:12.450> now<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.500> can<00:01:13.650> see<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
is off right now so we can see the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.600 
is off right now so we can see the
plumbing<00:01:14.369> exposed<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.740> as<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.979> slide<00:01:17.130> begins

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
plumbing exposed and as the slide begins

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.789 
plumbing exposed and as the slide begins
to<00:01:17.790> move<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:20.900> you're<00:01:21.900> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> see<00:01:22.350> how<00:01:22.560> that

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
to move in you're going to see how that

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.310 
to move in you're going to see how that
black<00:01:23.189> hose<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.540> hoses<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:24.960> are<00:01:25.020> zip

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
black hose and the hoses that are zip

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.740 
black hose and the hoses that are zip
tied<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.689> move<00:01:27.979> with<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> slide<00:01:29.460> out<00:01:29.750> coming

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
tied to it move with a slide out coming

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.370 
tied to it move with a slide out coming
in<00:01:32.210> part<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.360> plumbing<00:01:33.570> staying<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.350> a

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
in part of the plumbing staying with a

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.920 
in part of the plumbing staying with a
slide<00:01:34.740> out<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.100> part<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> plumbing

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
slide out and part of the plumbing

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:45.840 
slide out and part of the plumbing
moving<00:01:36.930> with<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.380> RV<00:01:37.680> itself

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.460 

so<00:01:46.850> this<00:01:46.970> flexing<00:01:47.540> that<00:01:47.690> you're<00:01:47.840> seeing<00:01:48.170> in

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
so this flexing that you're seeing in

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.820 
so this flexing that you're seeing in
that<00:01:48.500> big<00:01:49.370> black<00:01:49.670> tube<00:01:50.110> is<00:01:51.110> what<00:01:51.380> caused<00:01:51.620> this

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
that big black tube is what caused this

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.040 
that big black tube is what caused this
problem<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.790> RV<00:01:53.150> is<00:01:53.300> about<00:01:53.570> six<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:53.900> a<00:01:53.990> half

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
problem the RV is about six and a half

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:02.760 
problem the RV is about six and a half
years<00:01:54.320> old<00:01:54.590> now<00:01:54.830> and<00:01:55.180> so<00:01:56.290> that<00:01:57.290> pipe<00:01:58.040> is<00:01:58.250> flexed

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.940 

that's<00:02:03.770> what<00:02:04.010> old<00:02:04.190> slide<00:02:04.520> out<00:02:04.670> sound<00:02:04.940> like<00:02:05.090> too

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.260 

okay<00:02:08.950> so<00:02:09.010> you<00:02:09.130> can<00:02:09.220> see<00:02:09.340> how<00:02:09.430> that<00:02:09.520> pipe<00:02:09.760> flexed

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
okay so you can see how that pipe flexed

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.010 
okay so you can see how that pipe flexed
in<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.510> out<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:12.520> accommodate<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.630> kitchen

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
in and out to accommodate the kitchen

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.900 
in and out to accommodate the kitchen
being<00:02:14.230> in<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.500> slide-out<00:02:14.800> we<00:02:15.460> never<00:02:15.700> knew

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
being in the slide-out we never knew

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.750 
being in the slide-out we never knew
that<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.330> what<00:02:16.990> happened<00:02:17.290> was<00:02:17.400> we<00:02:18.400> came<00:02:18.580> home

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
that and what happened was we came home

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.050 
that and what happened was we came home
to<00:02:18.940> find<00:02:19.150> water<00:02:19.720> dripping<00:02:20.080> from<00:02:20.950> this<00:02:21.760> old

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
to find water dripping from this old

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.600 
to find water dripping from this old
pipe<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:23.650> joint<00:02:24.010> right<00:02:24.160> here<00:02:24.220> from

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
pipe and the joint right here from

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.350 
pipe and the joint right here from
flexing<00:02:25.500> finally<00:02:26.500> gave<00:02:26.710> out<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.190> all<00:02:28.030> this

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
flexing finally gave out and all this

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.660 
flexing finally gave out and all this
new<00:02:29.110> sealant<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:29.650> you're<00:02:29.830> seeing<00:02:30.100> on<00:02:30.280> here

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
new sealant that you're seeing on here

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.570 
new sealant that you're seeing on here
we<00:02:31.270> just<00:02:31.420> put<00:02:31.660> on<00:02:31.780> yesterday<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.620> practicing

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
we just put on yesterday and practicing

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.820 
we just put on yesterday and practicing
to<00:02:33.670> do<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.030> new<00:02:34.180> pipe<00:02:34.420> but<00:02:35.410> I'm<00:02:35.530> going<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.710> run

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
to do the new pipe but I'm going to run

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.740 
to do the new pipe but I'm going to run
that<00:02:35.950> back<00:02:36.190> out<00:02:36.370> again<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.270> can<00:02:37.360> see<00:02:37.420> the

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
that back out again so you can see the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:58.830 
that back out again so you can see the
slide<00:02:38.020> go<00:02:38.200> back<00:02:38.440> out<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:57.510> apologize<00:02:58.510> that<00:02:58.540> this

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
slide go back out I apologize that this

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.330 
slide go back out I apologize that this
video<00:02:59.110> is<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.260> little<00:02:59.380> shaky<00:02:59.710> I'm<00:02:59.980> doing<00:03:00.250> this

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
video is a little shaky I'm doing this

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.940 
video is a little shaky I'm doing this
on<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:00.610> iPhone<00:03:04.140> so<00:03:05.140> what's<00:03:05.380> strapped<00:03:05.710> on

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
on the iPhone so what's strapped on

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.850 
on the iPhone so what's strapped on
there<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.880> that<00:03:07.030> pipe<00:03:07.420> are<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.410> fresh<00:03:08.620> water

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
there to that pipe are the fresh water

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.810 
there to that pipe are the fresh water
lines<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.570> one<00:03:11.310> electrical<00:03:12.310> connection<00:03:12.730> that

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
lines and one electrical connection that

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.440 
lines and one electrical connection that
I<00:03:12.910> don't<00:03:13.150> know<00:03:13.270> what<00:03:13.450> it<00:03:13.540> is

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.100 

so<00:03:18.990> we<00:03:19.140> never<00:03:19.349> knew<00:03:20.270> how<00:03:21.270> it<00:03:21.480> was<00:03:21.660> that<00:03:21.690> the

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
so we never knew how it was that the

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.809 
so we never knew how it was that the
drain<00:03:22.800> line<00:03:23.069> from<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.489> sinks<00:03:25.280> connected<00:03:26.280> from

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
drain line from the sinks connected from

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:43.370 
drain line from the sinks connected from
the<00:03:26.880> slide<00:03:27.270> on<00:03:27.450> into<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.720> RV<00:03:29.300> now<00:03:30.300> we<00:03:30.360> know<00:03:42.380> so

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
the slide on into the RV now we know so

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.570 
the slide on into the RV now we know so
if<00:03:43.500> you<00:03:43.620> look<00:03:43.770> down<00:03:43.800> here<00:03:44.370> this<00:03:45.120> new<00:03:45.390> pipe<00:03:45.660> this

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
if you look down here this new pipe this

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.729 
if you look down here this new pipe this
big<00:03:47.580> black<00:03:47.880> pipe<00:03:48.180> here<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.599> the<00:03:49.170> new<00:03:49.349> one<00:03:49.530> and

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
big black pipe here is the new one and

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.009 
big black pipe here is the new one and
it<00:03:50.040> was<00:03:50.160> down<00:03:50.400> underneath<00:03:50.790> here<00:03:51.300> that<00:03:51.450> it

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
it was down underneath here that it

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.720 
it was down underneath here that it
cracked<00:03:52.410> from<00:03:52.620> going<00:03:53.010> in<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.280> out<00:03:53.340> all<00:03:53.519> these

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
cracked from going in and out all these

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.289 
cracked from going in and out all these
years<00:03:54.030> now<00:03:54.750> we<00:03:54.810> also<00:03:55.050> found<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:56.000> one<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.120> the

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
years now we also found that one of the

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.289 
years now we also found that one of the
water<00:03:57.780> lines<00:03:58.110> had<00:03:59.069> a<00:03:59.100> drip<00:03:59.730> to<00:03:59.910> it<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.239> we

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
water lines had a drip to it that we

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.350 
water lines had a drip to it that we
couldn't<00:04:00.600> stop<00:04:00.840> so<00:04:01.200> we<00:04:01.950> replaced<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:03.180> line

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
couldn't stop so we replaced the line

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.740 
couldn't stop so we replaced the line
with<00:04:03.600> this<00:04:03.720> braided<00:04:04.170> stainless<00:04:04.410> steel<00:04:04.860> cable

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
with this braided stainless steel cable

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.229 
with this braided stainless steel cable
stainless<00:04:06.750> steel<00:04:06.900> hose<00:04:07.760> so<00:04:08.760> we<00:04:08.880> did<00:04:09.000> all<00:04:09.120> that

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
stainless steel hose so we did all that

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.590 
stainless steel hose so we did all that
at<00:04:09.390> once<00:04:09.569> recipt<00:04:10.290> tied<00:04:10.500> it<00:04:10.650> all<00:04:10.769> in<00:04:10.980> and

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
at once recipt tied it all in and

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.690 
at once recipt tied it all in and
hopefully<00:04:12.600> we're<00:04:13.019> good<00:04:13.170> for<00:04:13.410> well<00:04:14.370> more<00:04:14.640> than

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
hopefully we're good for well more than

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.259 
hopefully we're good for well more than
another<00:04:15.030> six<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:15.390> a<00:04:15.450> half<00:04:15.569> years<00:04:16.940> but<00:04:17.940> that's

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
another six and a half years but that's

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.569 
another six and a half years but that's
just<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.510> give<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.750> little<00:04:18.900> insight<00:04:19.229> as<00:04:19.410> to

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
just to give you a little insight as to

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.300 
just to give you a little insight as to
one<00:04:20.579> mechanism<00:04:20.930> for<00:04:21.930> connecting<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.650> kitchen

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
one mechanism for connecting a kitchen

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.830 
one mechanism for connecting a kitchen
