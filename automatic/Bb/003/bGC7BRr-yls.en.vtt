as a moisturizer so I finished that up
it's<00:04:09.170> not<00:04:09.320> something<00:04:09.709> that<00:04:09.739> I<00:04:09.860> would<00:04:09.920> consider

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
it's not something that I would consider

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
it's not something that I would consider
but<00:04:10.790> it<00:04:11.000> was<00:04:11.120> interesting<00:04:11.330> to<00:04:11.750> use

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
bit on the sides left that I think I'll

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.800

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.480 
so technically it's not done but I
wanted<00:05:42.419> this<00:05:42.570> to<00:05:43.289> be<00:05:43.320> a<00:05:43.470> little<00:05:43.710> longer<00:05:43.979> sounds

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
wanted this to be a little longer sounds

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.400 
wanted this to be a little longer sounds
like<00:05:44.580> it's<00:05:44.820> so<00:05:45.000> empty<00:05:45.210> just<00:05:45.870> it<00:05:46.020> felt<00:05:46.139> weird

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
like it's so empty just it felt weird

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.550 
like it's so empty just it felt weird
not<00:05:46.650> to<00:05:46.860> have<00:05:46.919> like<00:05:47.130> 18<00:05:47.520> items<00:05:47.700> and<00:05:48.120> then<00:05:48.560> the

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
not to have like 18 items and then the

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.140 
not to have like 18 items and then the
last<00:05:49.710> thing<00:05:49.919> that's<00:05:50.250> also<00:05:50.610> technically

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
last thing that's also technically

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.210 
last thing that's also technically
almost<00:05:51.630> finished<00:05:52.020> probably<00:05:52.740> i'll<00:05:52.830> be<00:05:52.950> done<00:05:53.070> in

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
like the next two days I thought it

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.730
