00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.510 
tune it really high and it will be it
will<00:03:12.100> respond<00:03:12.490> really<00:03:12.760> crispy<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:15.160> can<00:03:15.310> take

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
will respond really crispy you can take

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.500 
will respond really crispy you can take
one<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.530> thinner<00:03:17.530> shelled<00:03:18.250> he's<00:03:19.030> got<00:03:19.210> I

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
one of the thinner shelled he's got I

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.300 
one of the thinner shelled he's got I
think<00:03:20.110> he<00:03:20.350> has<00:03:20.470> different<00:03:20.830> thicknesses<00:03:21.250> to

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
think he has different thicknesses to

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.430 
think he has different thicknesses to
the<00:03:21.580> metal<00:03:21.880> shells<00:03:22.120> but<00:03:22.450> with<00:03:22.960> thinner<00:03:23.230> cell

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
the metal shells but with thinner cell

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.110 
the metal shells but with thinner cell
shelled<00:03:23.830> kits<00:03:24.130> also<00:03:24.370> project<00:03:24.880> very<00:03:25.150> well

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
shelled kits also project very well

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.840 
shelled kits also project very well
variety<00:03:28.120> of<00:03:28.150> tunings<00:03:28.690> is<00:03:29.140> possible<00:03:29.890> variety

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
variety of tunings is possible variety

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.520 
variety of tunings is possible variety
of<00:03:30.880> applications<00:03:31.540> as<00:03:31.690> possible<00:03:32.080> so<00:03:32.200> I<00:03:32.230> like

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
of applications as possible so I like

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.960 
of applications as possible so I like
that<00:03:32.740> about<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.190> drones<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.580> can<00:03:33.700> use<00:03:33.820> them

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
that about the drones you can use them

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.860 
that about the drones you can use them
in<00:03:34.030> a<00:03:34.090> lot<00:03:34.480> of<00:03:34.510> different<00:03:34.690> situations

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.670 

both<00:03:39.870> live<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:40.350> studio<00:03:42.440> particularly<00:03:43.440> the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
both live and studio particularly the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.020 
both live and studio particularly the
snare<00:03:44.040> drums<00:03:44.340> in<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:45.330> studio<00:03:45.990> have<00:03:46.800> been<00:03:47.310> very

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
snare drums in the studio have been very

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.840 
snare drums in the studio have been very
useful<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.690> me<00:03:48.900> but<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.920> think<00:03:50.190> because<00:03:50.490> of<00:03:50.670> this

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
useful to me but I think because of this

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.170 
useful to me but I think because of this
flexibility<00:03:52.490> there<00:03:53.490> have<00:03:53.640> been<00:03:53.760> times<00:03:53.970> I've

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
flexibility there have been times I've

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.320 
flexibility there have been times I've
been<00:03:54.330> able<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.570> take<00:03:54.810> one<00:03:55.380> snare<00:03:55.920> drum<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:56.460> get

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
been able to take one snare drum and get

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.630 
been able to take one snare drum and get
you<00:03:58.170> know<00:03:58.290> four<00:03:58.620> or<00:03:58.710> five<00:03:58.860> different<00:03:59.070> sounds

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
you know four or five different sounds

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.340 
you know four or five different sounds
out<00:03:59.700> of<00:03:59.850> it<00:03:59.970> for<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.240> record<00:04:00.390> because<00:04:00.720> quite

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
out of it for the record because quite

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.680 
out of it for the record because quite
often<00:04:01.560> doing<00:04:02.340> that<00:04:02.610> during<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.300> course<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:03.600> a

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
often doing that during the course of a

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.840 
often doing that during the course of a
recording<00:04:04.200> I<00:04:04.380> like<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:05.070> change<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.610> sound

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
recording I like to change the sound

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.500 
recording I like to change the sound
depending<00:04:06.450> on<00:04:06.570> the<00:04:06.660> song<00:04:06.900> and<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:09.090> snares

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
depending on the song and the snares

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.470 
depending on the song and the snares
that<00:04:09.630> that<00:04:10.230> myself<00:04:11.190> is<00:04:11.370> making<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:11.820> find<00:04:12.330> are

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
that that myself is making I find are

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.570 
that that myself is making I find are
flexible<00:04:12.810> enough<00:04:12.930> word<00:04:13.320> I<00:04:13.530> can<00:04:13.680> I<00:04:13.890> can<00:04:14.100> bring

flexible enough word I can I can bring

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.799 
flexible enough word I can I can bring
one<00:04:14.820> snare<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.600> cover<00:04:15.930> most<00:04:16.200> of<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.380> basis
