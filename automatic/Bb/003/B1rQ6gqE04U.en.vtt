00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.230
 and if this is my high school it's not just 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:27.209
 a little more of this is a big tree of 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:31.140
 the entrance which I think is 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.140
 good we are entering 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.630
 but here are the roads and there are my 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.630
 companions 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.630
 that fact 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.700
 and well these thousand squares gentlemen like this 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.700
 that ours 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.769
 all right 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.670
 what 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.150
 gentlemen these are the players those are 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.430
 the personal shoes that arrive from 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.330
 students can be seen a lot in the 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.330
 children and it's pretty 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.930
 good lords, I take advantage of my 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.280
 mates came out in is empty well 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.920
 what can I take advantage of to start 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.930
 record the video and my students in the classroom 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.460
 this our classroom 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.960
 you will wonder why all the 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.200
 in street clothes in a report 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.830
 it's not my school 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.260
 the night schedule is from 5 to 9 the night 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.300
 so using a report is not necessary 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.110
 and for that reason they see me with street clothes 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.660
 and I do not get uniform because I go to 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.110
 night school and is for people 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.030
 who want to work more than everything and in 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.940
 my case is because well I also 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.910
 I want to work and because I think it's a 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.370
 most comfortable schedule 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.730
 since it is not necessary you already know 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.240
 get up and try to always get there 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.340
 punctual 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.480
 so I find it much more comfortable and 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.930
 this is my position 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.500
 my suitcase my things the post do not have 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:30.949
 nothing of our world is a common and 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:30.949
 current and the stick is not another thing 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:48.110
 Now beautiful in different rooms like this 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.110
 what 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.590
 I like it 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.000
 or 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.250
 Y
