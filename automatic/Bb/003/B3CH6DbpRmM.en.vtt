00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
like this one that we took out of a car

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.179 
like this one that we took out of a car
we<00:01:15.509> can<00:01:15.659> see<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.140> light<00:01:16.469> up<00:01:16.799> here<00:01:17.039> we

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
we can see with this light up here we

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.599 
we can see with this light up here we
move<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.820> down<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.810> light<00:01:19.049> actually

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:19.609 
move it down the light actually

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:22.580 
move it down the light actually
disappears<00:01:20.609> because<00:01:20.939> it's<00:01:21.689> clogged<00:01:22.200> with

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
disappears because it's clogged with

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.219 
disappears because it's clogged with
crud<00:01:23.070> from<00:01:23.399> the<00:01:23.609> road<00:01:23.789> well<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.899> can<00:01:25.079> be

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
crud from the road well that can be

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.289 
crud from the road well that can be
cleaned<00:01:25.560> with<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> garden<00:01:26.159> hose<00:01:26.429> and<00:01:26.729> some

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
cleaned with a garden hose and some

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.599 
cleaned with a garden hose and some
engine<00:01:27.719> cleaner<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.499> lots<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.100> times<00:01:29.340> that's

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
engine cleaner and lots of times that's

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:32.899 
engine cleaner and lots of times that's
all<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.060> needs<00:01:30.259> all<00:01:31.259> right<00:01:31.409> what's<00:01:31.829> next<00:01:32.340> well

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
all it needs all right what's next well

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.969 
all it needs all right what's next well
the<00:01:32.999> next<00:01:33.179> thing<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.749> moving<00:01:34.109> air<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.859> that

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
the next thing is moving air and that

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.999 
the next thing is moving air and that
means<00:01:35.249> you<00:01:35.490> need<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.880> look<00:01:36.060> at<00:01:36.359> the<00:01:37.109> cooling

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
means you need to look at the cooling

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.179 
means you need to look at the cooling
fan<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.909> car<00:01:39.509> most<00:01:40.109> cars<00:01:40.409> have<00:01:40.740> electric

fan on the car most cars have electric
cooling<00:01:41.609> fans<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.509> when<00:01:42.749> the<00:01:42.840> air

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
conditionings on the cooling fan should

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.709 
conditionings on the cooling fan should
be<00:01:45.509> running<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.920> isn't<00:01:47.340> well<00:01:47.969> you<00:01:48.359> need<00:01:48.569> to

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
be running if it isn't well you need to

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.679 
be running if it isn't well you need to
check<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.439> cooling<00:01:49.920> fan<00:01:50.219> relay<00:01:50.909> now<00:01:51.539> that's

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
check the cooling fan relay now that's

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.840 
check the cooling fan relay now that's
usually<00:01:52.139> mounted<00:01:52.289> someplace<00:01:52.979> very<00:01:53.310> near<00:01:53.639> the

and the fan that's attached to this

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.950 
and the fan that's attached to this
should<00:02:25.220> rev<00:02:25.520> with<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.300> engine<00:02:26.690> if<00:02:26.840> it

the belt if it isn't well you go over
here<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.310> you<00:02:49.490> locate<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.330> pressure<00:02:50.600> switch

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
here and you locate the pressure switch

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.320 
here and you locate the pressure switch
you<00:02:51.770> check<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.370> pressure<00:02:52.640> switch

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
you check the pressure switch

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.450 
you check the pressure switch
especially<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.380> connection<00:02:54.890> again<00:02:55.010> for

can<00:03:14.240> actually<00:03:14.660> damage<00:03:15.140> parts<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:16.210> one<00:03:17.210> thing

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
can actually damage parts and one thing

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.050 
can actually damage parts and one thing
is<00:03:17.600> for<00:03:17.810> sure<00:03:17.840> you<00:03:18.710> can't<00:03:19.070> diagnose<00:03:19.790> an

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
is for sure you can't diagnose an

it<00:03:22.400> takes<00:03:22.700> two<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.270> the<00:03:23.390> comparison<00:03:24.080> between

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
it takes two in the comparison between

it takes two in the comparison between
two<00:03:24.680> readings<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:25.820> better<00:03:26.780> off<00:03:26.870> to<00:03:27.200> leave<00:03:27.380> that

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
two readings so better off to leave that
