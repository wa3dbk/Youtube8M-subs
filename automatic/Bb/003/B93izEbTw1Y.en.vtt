00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.609
 Welcome from Munich with the 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.500
 brand new nokia asha 503 cell phone what here 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.990
 a 3 inch display has continued like that 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.370
 small asha phones with touch so far 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.590
 but it is very nice here that 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.470
 we are now 5 megapixel camera here 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.759
 Join in with a flashing light and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.470
 buy.com still does the backside 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.050
 swap under the battery 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.259
 by 20 days standby time and 3g now 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.640
 after all, less than 100 euros 300 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.740
 millimeter headphone jack migros 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.019
 zurich to charge here so that's her 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.940
 nothing changed micro usb resp 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.280
 my microphone down here and the on and off 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.690
 Turn off German team also sideways 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.000
 We can unfortunately see each other here 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.000
 Do not hijack the attachments or 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.050
 as it is at the cheaper times the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.060
 but case is here is also nice 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.730
 5 megapixels with it and as we said 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.770
 can get out of the cell phone, so to speak 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.350
 pushing is not easy but me 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.050
 try now just iff 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.970
 Of course, you see that too 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.010
 money here, so to speak, stays in here 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.570
 this same transparent housing is 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.670
 By the way, nice eyecatcher is also available 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.140
 in many other colors and the device 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.880
 then, of course, in a simple way 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.979
 Black still in here micro sd 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.560
 So we can do the same on the side 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.450
 Simply exchange also without us 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.770
 somehow the battery would have to take out 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.259
 under the battery, however, the sim 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.819
 card slot and otherwise located 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.549
 here they only really nothing 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:21.929
 if we have the sim card or the micro sd 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.259
 you want to swap this out 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:23.579
 to take 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.770
 Here you can see how they came 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.119
 the time still stands there disappears 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.429
 then of course right here if I have that 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.829
 gets into the hole or yourself 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.810
 Just in the home menu where I am in here 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.319
 have the many different maps on it 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.460
 and meanwhile also whatsapp 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:39.689
 it has not been announced yet 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.679
 but definitely installed whatsapp 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.920
 there is also here for the s40 bca 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.959
 surface 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.429
 if I go a second sideways here 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:49.229
 then you see what I made today as 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.229
 has been a few pictures plants vs 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.939
 played zombies or even facebook and 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.899
 twitter integration is dissolving 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.459
 can get connected 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.279
 I could stand that now too 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:01.069
 brings in itself, so to speak like htc 

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:03.990
 what happened the whole day or so 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.549
 I can really mean something here 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.229
 make apps accordingly and then 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.640
 see what I last used 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.050
 for example now 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.050
 I want to open the weather app for a moment 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.050
 and then I see me for a moment 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.510
 had a bet channel run too 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.220
 if I'm not completely gone in 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.450
 how big is the whole in comparison 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.900
 can for example be an iphone here 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.520
 you see 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.320
 three witness four inch iphone 5 and 5 it 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.030
 are the same size and in the thick something 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.510
 thicker but the battery also keeps forever 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.400
 although that can also be 3g and we have 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.010
 just a 540 megahertz processor in it 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.989
 and 512 mb ram I think even just 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.510
 injury even less but still 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.860
 it's super fast like you markets me 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.230
 can also briefly in the messaging app 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.480
 I can say okay I sit down 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.709
 Now here's the text message where 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.870
 I have the keyboard a bit already 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.730
 tried hello how it was wanted 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.930
 I type here and it works wonderfully 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.820
 although it is really only a relative one 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.890
 small display main 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.160
 I also like to hire topics 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.300
 We should also be able to speak several languages 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.500
 we can see we can do it 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.500
 from German to English twitter 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.129
 stereo and then you really see here 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.359
 above if he is still partially natural 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.590
 is suggested here 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.049
 now with my name it does 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.069
 Of course not much sense but otherwise 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.599
 really very practical and the 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.579
 Settings down here is by the way 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.709
 also maybe transfer highly critical 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.769
 special award rating settings as mentioned 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.389
 with more languages ​​or more keyboards 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.980
 I could use it here 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.450
 introduce here appropriately 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.760
 other Hungarian could also now 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.889
 what I speak myself still add 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.540
 and so on and so forth or and here 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:43.750
 By the way, it goes back again and again 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.889
 but a home taste does not exist, so to speak 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.340
 and here you also see right away I have 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.109
 now here 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.459
 earlier this message continued here 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.530
 and now I can do that too, me too 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.090
 delete or delete again 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.560
 those in the list are already in there 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.120
 markus this five megapixel camera 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.400
 you can really see them here 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.079
 okay it is open so far too 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.930
 liquid we have no frontal camera 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.159
 before less than 100 euros a cell phone is 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.450
 no wonder if we have the display 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.980
 it will probably touch already 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.870
 I shot for a quick left 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.040
 second and then here looks at the 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.030
 corresponding last pictures i 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.599
 We could do that as well 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.669
 a short hum and a little closer 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.900
 Do you notice that you are already here ? 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.760
 the processors have their limits 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.440
 a bit but with a little patience 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.389
 everything is not a problem 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.190
 and so are we from the app already 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.380
 out again and of course the other 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.389
 standard aps here especially 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.130
 a game in the course of money costs 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.870
 still yes by the same with on top 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.990
 probably already does that with the 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.880
 short first impression of nokia asha 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.039
 Cell phones until next time my name 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.880
 is pascal and do not forget of course 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.880
