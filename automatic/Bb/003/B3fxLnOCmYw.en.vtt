00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.509
 sonic runs towards his new adventure and 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.550
 this time he does it exclusively for the 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.289
 nintendo consoles the hedgehog has 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.590
 pierced a few bumps in his 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.360
 since 1991 but it seems that little 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.180
 little by little, picking up pace after delivery 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.860
 delivery song lost world is another attempt 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.050
 of the Japanese to recover the magic 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.970
 original of the license diluted with the 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.250
 over the years you will have gotten 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.210
 our swift heroes recover their wake 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.210
 we check it 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.190
 the adventure begins in a way that 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.630
 many can guess if the doctor ayman 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.610
 is doing again of his 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.130
 capturing harmless animals 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.020
 we should stop it but now 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.330
 the hexagon scenario of an adventure 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.520
 that crosses prairies icy landscapes 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.950
 or deserts all on a few levels that 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.330
 combine three-dimensional designs 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.100
 Inspired by spherical surfaces 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.900
 with other more traditional 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.790
 combining concepts within a game in 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.570
 who they are and have access to a large 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.570
 variety of movements 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.700
 to sprint jump to climb walls 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.710
 run through them until you have included a 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.210
 new attack with a good kick 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.580
 incorporation but of which has not 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.230
 known to get the most out of it and it's 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.090
 that one of the big flaws of 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.400
 title is that its control does not end 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.530
 convince the speed is not overflowing 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.720
 and it is appreciated but camera turns 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.790
 unwelcome and a series of problems of 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.100
 design make the experience not be 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.960
 the most satisfactory there are exceptions 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.000
 clear that yes as this level about 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.830
 rails but overall the fun does not 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.760
 is as full as the most recent 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.760
 hedgehog games 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.940
 that yes it can not be said that the 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.800
 video game lacks content apart 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.290
 of the phases we have meetings with 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.320
 final heads in some cases result 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.150
 imaginative in others uninspired the 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.250
 way against the clock is presented as a 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.470
 interesting way to compete to beat 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.690
 the times of other players while 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.580
 that the cooperative modality encourages us to 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.380
 share game with a second user 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.930
 in charge of driving a vehicle 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:24.520
 remote control and interesting but not 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.590
 too entertaining in practice and 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.390
 there is integration with my bears with the 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.550
 objective of sharing opinions with the 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.290
 community and we also have the option of 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.780
 send a series of objects to our 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.640
 friends but maybe the highlight is 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.950
 the integration with the gamepad that we 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.570
 allows to play without a television and we say 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.850
 this because the rest of the functions do not 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.560
 they are very well resolved in particular 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.480
 the powers of color try to 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.310
 take advantage of the new command but the idea 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.780
 does not finish curdling 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.780
 completely expendable 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.359
 this is an aspect that for example the 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.120
 version of nintendo 3ds solves better 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:01.310
 by more classical controls in fact 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.170
 sony close wall on this platform it 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.180
 becomes a better video game with a 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.370
 very similar and at the same time very 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.560
 different same history and scenarios 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.510
 but different gameplay with a handling 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.579
 more balanced is not so spectacular 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.439
 visually but your bet is very 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.829
 consistent with the possibilities of 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:17.829
 laptop 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.890
 and let's talk about one platform or another the 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.810
 colorful is an aspect in favor as well as 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.569
 the joy and originality of the levels 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.459
 especially in the case of will you a 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.260
 pity that the efforts made by 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.629
 the Japanese have not given for more 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.690
 because the approach was the right one 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:38.790
 the execution unfortunately not so much of 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.010
 all forms are still titles that 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.780
 should be taken into account both 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.120
 for the owners of these consoles 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.200
 as for the unconditional followers 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.200
 of the sonic wake
