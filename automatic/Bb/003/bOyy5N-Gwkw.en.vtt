Charlie we look back at all this Los
Angeles<00:00:15.839> traffic<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.440> if<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.560> look<00:00:16.710> closely

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
Angeles traffic and if you look closely

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.920 
Angeles traffic and if you look closely
you<00:00:17.130> can<00:00:17.190> actually<00:00:17.430> see<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.880> emissions<00:00:18.359> going

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
you can actually see the emissions going

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.019 
you can actually see the emissions going
into<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.170> atmosphere<00:00:19.350> it's<00:00:19.890> awful<00:00:20.340> but

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
into the atmosphere it's awful but

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.730 
into the atmosphere it's awful but
hopefully<00:00:21.630> all<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.020> will<00:00:22.080> change<00:00:22.410> someday

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
hopefully all this will change someday

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
green revolution we certainly are with a

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.820 
green revolution we certainly are with a
combination<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.140> emissions<00:00:28.529> we're<00:00:28.740> all

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
combination of the emissions we're all

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.439 
combination of the emissions we're all
talking<00:00:29.099> about<00:00:29.400> global<00:00:29.939> warming<00:00:29.970> out

talking about global warming out

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.910 
talking about global warming out
certainly<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.109> news<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.650> with<00:00:31.830> the

escalating prices at the gas pump people
are<00:00:34.590> asking<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.579> there<00:00:35.850> an<00:00:36.000> alternative<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
are asking is there an alternative and

minutes<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.830> recharge<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:15.030> what<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.270> want<00:01:15.539> to

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
minutes to recharge so what I want to

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.139 
minutes to recharge so what I want to
know<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.960> why<00:01:16.619> isn't<00:01:17.009> everyone<00:01:17.399> talking<00:01:17.789> about

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
know is why isn't everyone talking about

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.859 
know is why isn't everyone talking about
them<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.600> hear<00:01:19.200> over<00:01:19.649> and<00:01:19.770> over<00:01:20.100> again<00:01:20.869> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
them I hear over and over again the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.419 
them I hear over and over again the
reason<00:01:22.080> we<00:01:22.320> don't<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.560> electric<00:01:22.649> cars<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
reason we don't have electric cars the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.050 
battery technology doesn't exist you're
telling<00:01:28.560> me<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.860> battery<00:01:29.190> technology<00:01:29.640> exists

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
telling me the battery technology exists

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.210 
telling me the battery technology exists
here<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:30.960> right<00:01:30.990> there<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.590> exists<00:01:32.100> right

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
here it is right there it exists right

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.850 
here it is right there it exists right
now<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:32.490> new<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.810> does<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.200> exists<00:01:34.709> right

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
now it's new but it does it exists right

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.100
