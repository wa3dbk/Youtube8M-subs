00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
hey phone Dagsboro HD here and I thought

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.089 
hey phone Dagsboro HD here and I thought
it'd<00:00:06.210> be<00:00:06.240> kind<00:00:06.509> of<00:00:06.540> fun<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.810> test<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.319> ipx7

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
it'd be kind of fun to test the ipx7

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.580 
it'd be kind of fun to test the ipx7
water<00:00:08.670> resistance<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.660> Moto<00:00:09.870> G<00:00:10.170> third

now<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.849> ipx7<00:00:12.450> certification<00:00:13.380> translates<00:00:13.860> to

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
now the ipx7 certification translates to

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.129 
now the ipx7 certification translates to
a<00:00:14.160> water<00:00:14.519> resistance<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.299> up<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.660> one<00:00:15.900> meter

a water resistance of up to one meter
for<00:00:16.619> 30<00:00:16.980> minutes<00:00:17.400> it's<00:00:17.940> really<00:00:18.180> important

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
for 30 minutes it's really important

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.779 
for 30 minutes it's really important
though<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.810> have<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.350> back<00:00:19.740> cover<00:00:20.039> completely

just<00:00:37.530> go<00:00:37.770> ahead<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.070> go<00:00:38.340> outside<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.940> see<00:00:39.360> how

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
just go ahead and go outside and see how

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.660 
just go ahead and go outside and see how
it<00:00:39.690> does<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.469> first<00:00:40.710> test<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.430> see

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
it does the first test is just to see

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.150 
it does the first test is just to see
how<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.030> does<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.420> rain<00:00:42.690> or<00:00:42.960> simulated<00:00:43.890> rain

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
how it does in rain or simulated rain

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.580 
how it does in rain or simulated rain
since<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:45.030> summertime<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:46.230> are<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.500> a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
since it's summertime and we are in a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.500 
since it's summertime and we are in a
drought<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.700> used<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.000> hose<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.420> spray

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
drought I just used a hose to spray

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.600 
drought I just used a hose to spray
water<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.170> Moto<00:00:49.350> G<00:00:49.620> but<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:50.190> go<00:00:50.340> ahead

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
water on the Moto G but just go ahead

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.580 
water on the Moto G but just go ahead
and<00:00:50.730> pretend<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:51.210> rain<00:00:51.449> it'll<00:00:52.140> add<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
and pretend it's rain it'll add to the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.860 
and pretend it's rain it'll add to the
experience<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.789> said<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.239> Moto<00:00:54.420> G<00:00:54.660> did

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
experience with that said the Moto G did

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.810 
experience with that said the Moto G did
very<00:00:55.110> well<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.620> device<00:00:55.920> was<00:00:56.219> obviously<00:00:56.730> very

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
very well this device was obviously very

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.060 
very well this device was obviously very
wet<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.660> see<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.800> still

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
wet as you can see but it still

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.670 
wet as you can see but it still
functioned<00:00:59.670> flawlessly<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:01.020> second<00:01:01.350> test<00:01:01.530> I

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
functioned flawlessly the second test I

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.110 
functioned flawlessly the second test I
did<00:01:01.859> was<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.370> with<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> container<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.090> water

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
did was just with a container of water

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.000 
did was just with a container of water
in<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.690> test<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.170> decided<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.739> leave<00:01:04.860> it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
in this test I decided to leave it

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.859 
in this test I decided to leave it
submerged<00:01:05.489> under<00:01:05.790> water<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.119> 30<00:01:06.540> minutes

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
submerged under water for 30 minutes

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.140 
submerged under water for 30 minutes
once<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> 30<00:01:07.799> minutes<00:01:08.130> were<00:01:08.220> up<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.580> pulled<00:01:09.030> it

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
once the 30 minutes were up I pulled it

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.359 
once the 30 minutes were up I pulled it
out<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.540> water<00:01:09.810> gave<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.409> an<00:01:10.530> initial<00:01:10.770> test

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
out of the water gave it an initial test

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.429 
out of the water gave it an initial test
and<00:01:11.670> then<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.210> dried<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.479> off<00:01:12.689> tested<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
and then I dried it off tested the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.010 
and then I dried it off tested the
device<00:01:13.560> again<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:15.299> didn't<00:01:15.630> show<00:01:15.810> any

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
device again and it didn't show any

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.749 
device again and it didn't show any
signs<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.710> water<00:01:17.009> damage<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.580> worked

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
signs of water damage it worked

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.850 
signs of water damage it worked
perfectly<00:01:18.270> fine<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.840> did<00:01:19.290> pry<00:01:19.470> off<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> back

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
perfectly fine I did pry off the back

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.890 
perfectly fine I did pry off the back
cover<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.280> see<00:01:20.430> if<00:01:20.549> any<00:01:20.670> water<00:01:20.909> got<00:01:21.210> inside<00:01:21.570> and

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
cover to see if any water got inside and

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.710 
cover to see if any water got inside and
it<00:01:22.259> did<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> SIM<00:01:23.460> card<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> micro<00:01:24.420> SD

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
it did but the SIM card and the micro SD

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.749 
it did but the SIM card and the micro SD
card<00:01:24.960> slots<00:01:25.259> were<00:01:25.500> bone-dry<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.490> that's

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
card slots were bone-dry and that's

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.340 
card slots were bone-dry and that's
really<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.119> section<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.720> really<00:01:27.960> needs<00:01:28.229> to

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
really the section that really needs to

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.260 
really the section that really needs to
be<00:01:28.560> dry<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.460> know<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.610> still<00:01:30.030> wasn't

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
be dry but you know I still wasn't

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.179 
be dry but you know I still wasn't
satisfied<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.930> wanted<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.500> simulate<00:01:31.770> an

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
satisfied I wanted to simulate an

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.850 
satisfied I wanted to simulate an
accidental<00:01:32.880> drop<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.390> deeper<00:01:33.930> water<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.680> see

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
accidental drop in deeper water to see

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.770 
accidental drop in deeper water to see
if<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.189> would<00:01:35.310> survive<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:36.150> always<00:01:36.540> like<00:01:36.659> to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
if it would survive I always like to

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.149 
if it would survive I always like to
ramp<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.079> up<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.409> guys<00:01:37.500> remember<00:01:37.680> several

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
ramp it up if you guys remember several

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.350 
months ago I submerged a phone and water
and<00:01:40.140> froze<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.310> see<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.759> would<00:01:41.880> survive

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
and froze it to see if it would survive

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.060 
and froze it to see if it would survive

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
interested but I wanted to drop it in my

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.200 
interested but I wanted to drop it in my
hot<00:01:46.500> tub<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.009> section<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.549> between<00:01:47.909> two

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
hot tub in a section that is between two

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.060 
hot tub in a section that is between two
to<00:01:48.390> three<00:01:48.420> feet<00:01:48.869> deep<00:01:49.140> with<00:01:49.409> water<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.950> is

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
to three feet deep with water that is

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.660 
to three feet deep with water that is
not<00:01:50.490> only<00:01:50.759> around<00:01:51.140> 104<00:01:52.140> degrees<00:01:52.470> Fahrenheit

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
not only around 104 degrees Fahrenheit

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.580 
not only around 104 degrees Fahrenheit
but<00:01:53.670> also<00:01:54.240> filled<00:01:54.630> with<00:01:54.750> bromine<00:01:55.350> and

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
but also filled with bromine and

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.190 
but also filled with bromine and
minerals<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.909> dropped<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.719> did<00:01:57.960> some

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
minerals so I dropped it in it did some

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.959 
minerals so I dropped it in it did some
acrobatic<00:01:58.740> flips<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.340> then<00:01:59.549> after<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> few

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
acrobatic flips and then after a few

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.660 
acrobatic flips and then after a few
seconds<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.659> went<00:02:01.170> right<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.530> after<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:02.070> as<00:02:02.250> if

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
seconds I went right in after it as if

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.550 
seconds I went right in after it as if
this<00:02:02.820> whole<00:02:02.880> scenario<00:02:03.329> were<00:02:03.750> an<00:02:03.869> accident<00:02:04.380> and

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
this whole scenario were an accident and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.920 
this whole scenario were an accident and
to<00:02:05.070> my<00:02:05.189> surprise<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.820> still<00:02:06.119> worked<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.630> it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
to my surprise it still worked and it

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.900 
to my surprise it still worked and it
actually<00:02:07.259> works<00:02:07.439> just<00:02:07.560> as<00:02:08.039> well<00:02:08.399> as<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:08.759> it

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
actually works just as well as if it

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.790 
actually works just as well as if it
hadn't<00:02:09.360> been<00:02:09.569> dropped<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.140> hot<00:02:10.289> tub

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
hadn't been dropped in the hot tub

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.860 
hadn't been dropped in the hot tub
so<00:02:11.129> overall<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.730> Moto<00:02:11.910> G<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.330> apparently

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
so overall the Moto G is apparently

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.250 
so overall the Moto G is apparently
under

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
test to make sure it could live up to

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.660 
test to make sure it could live up to
Motorola's<00:02:18.930> claim<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.439> an<00:02:19.530> IP<00:02:19.680> x7<00:02:20.489> water
