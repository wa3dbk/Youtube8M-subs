00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
to tonight I would say it first because

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.720 
to tonight I would say it first because
we<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:40.110> talk<00:00:40.290> about<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.680> winds<00:00:40.829> fielder<00:00:41.190> in

we can talk about the winds fielder in

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.690 
we can talk about the winds fielder in
my<00:00:41.820> opinion<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:42.540> should<00:00:42.570> also<00:00:43.020> talk<00:00:43.440> about<00:00:43.700> how

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
my opinion we should also talk about how

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.479 
my opinion we should also talk about how
important<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.719> John<00:00:46.680> Terry<00:00:46.920> when<00:00:47.160> he's<00:00:47.280> in

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
important is a John Terry when he's in

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.400 
important is a John Terry when he's in
and<00:00:47.850> when<00:00:48.030> he's<00:00:48.149> out<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.780> i<00:00:48.840> think<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.230> also

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
and when he's out but i think is also

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.529 
and when he's out but i think is also
and<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.219> probably<00:00:50.460> will<00:00:50.760> bring<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> topic

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
and that probably will bring the topic

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.630 
and that probably will bring the topic
under<00:00:51.809> he<00:00:52.020> just<00:00:52.199> wash<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.890> problem<00:00:53.190> was<00:00:53.309> also

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
under he just wash the problem was also

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.880 
under he just wash the problem was also
in<00:00:53.820> mind<00:00:54.090> because<00:00:54.660> after<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.350> you've<00:00:55.680> been

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
in mind because after that you've been

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.430 
in mind because after that you've been
to<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.430> after<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> first<00:00:57.420> dog<00:00:57.690> okay<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
to one after the first dog okay the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.380 
to one after the first dog okay the
attitude<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.219> beginning<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.030> second

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
attitude that beginning of the second

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.660 
attitude that beginning of the second
half<00:01:00.570> was<00:01:00.840> good<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:01.649> what<00:01:01.949> was<00:01:02.280> not<00:01:02.489> good

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
half was good but what was not good

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.149 
half was good but what was not good
enough<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.300> not<00:01:03.840> only<00:01:03.989> just<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:04.890> needed

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
enough and not only just it just needed

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.550 
enough and not only just it just needed
to<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.729> know<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.880> hold<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:06.510> some<00:01:07.140> kind<00:01:07.470> of

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
to you know to hold on for some kind of

to you know to hold on for some kind of
20<00:01:07.979> minutes<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.520> then<00:01:08.909> everything<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.510> again

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
20 minutes and then everything was again

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.710
