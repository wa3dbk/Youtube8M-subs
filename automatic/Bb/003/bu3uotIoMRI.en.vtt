00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.490
 you see today how you 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.110
 combi microwave installation of the etna 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.089
 what do you need for that? 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.449
 screwdriver 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.710
 Stanley knife and robert before we go out 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:29.160
 partner, let's first see if the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:30.269
 mismatcher 'they check the sizes we have 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.320
 See if there is a power outlet in the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.320
 proximity to the comma 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.410
 it is recommended that the combi 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.410
 microwave connected to its own group 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.070
 use the user manual 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.790
 to determine where we are already heading that way 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.970
 fix bracket with supplied 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.130
 template can determine that 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.000
 is going to check my mal 's line 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.800
 my axis of the opportunity the 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.810
 right place 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.490
 With this we know exactly where we put the bracket 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.120
 must meet the latter 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.750
 we do this with the two supplied 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.750
 screws tightening 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.189
 the bracket is mounted we can 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.810
 allow places 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:43.970
 ensures that the cable is already heading towards it 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:45.560
 socket to do we can put 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.740
 the power to be fully attacked for in 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.740
 the niche 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.149
 be placed on the plug 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.880
 in situations raise the cable like this 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.220
 have not been the case use one 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.180
 bracket I assume a cable device 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.180
 again 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.270
 ensures it stays nicely aligned 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.170
 is fat mixer 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.400
 we can provide the means of the included 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.390
 Now screw the device in place 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.100
 center of the microwave 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.370
 its an opening to we can have this 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.370
 post here 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.260
 so already built again just a moment 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.260

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.650
 use 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.240
 so this was the installation and 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.340
