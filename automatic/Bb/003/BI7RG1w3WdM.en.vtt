00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:14.860
 Hi everyone this guitar course is a little more Ness also small part that has the pick 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:21.009
 I would like to talk about 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:25.860
 I mentioned earlier how to hold the pick of the race Index finger and ab 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:28.340
 Something like the first joint overlap each other say 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.559
 Or you have seen look or 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.690
 It feels like this when I pinch the pick 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:40.399
 This though why it comes 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:47.130
 So much it's there are individual differences in terms of coming out length depth 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:49.720
 Guess it received a fine Do not question I think you in with it and good to not have to think Gachigachi 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.960
 When the actual draw is with a pick 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.820
 Or it is open or closed 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.360
 It was a question, but from the conclusion of it, it's opportunistic 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.060
 Or that taste or yes 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.650
 In a 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:10.360
 Please try it 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:15.100
 The bridge mute Even if you are playing for example in while holding this usually because 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.110
 Well then in fact if I tried to I also various verification me what Darrow when the turn into the cutting and 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.240
 But 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:25.159
 It's a closed bridge , so it 's a big bridge eye, isn't it? 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:31.479
 So the bridge mute is a bit wide 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.479
 I say the bridge, so the side of this close 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:39.880
 f like a candidate 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:42.210
 Kedomo it says Yoshihiko and the bridge mute president is likely to do better to open it a little 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.210
 Right 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.960
 padi 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.200
 Hmm 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.060
 Feel 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.110
 I think bridgemates often correspond, but it is good too 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.000
 When you pull 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.950
 I will write a lot of that 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:23.710
 Make it easy to play by yourself 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:27.550
 In the direction of the easy play I said myself I as a concept of itself one of the sound 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:34.069
 I do not know how to put out one answer of the mind going to think 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:38.569
 Even in the instructional book, there are few things that even Ness is written to a fine point 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:41.299
 Body with a that now of the pick I also I mean the gel and whether broaden the situation 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:45.760
 Kana Yes knitted instruction book Te version 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:51.090
 I do not know that I have not seen my responsibility but 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.090
 I never had seen Okamikiba you have commentary to wo 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.590
 I think I may try to verify a few lines of it while listening to it that there is a page at the back 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.850
 Because there is also this day 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.660
 Hey yeah 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.660
 For example 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.780
 More 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.250
 Tteyuu I'm the better has been to the 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.250
 that 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.800
 We added in place but 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:25.980
 I think that there is such a thing and try various verifications 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:28.110
 I usually play unconsciously, but how can I get rid of it? 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.950
 It is the first time with animation that the guitar course 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.510
 There are many things to notice later, though 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.510
 Oh It was a way I'm doing 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.040
 Such part is corrected 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.159
 Also it has been or re-recording 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:48.909
 Please try various works 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:51.200
 Looking over the phone I doing various this information that say that failure to 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:56.730
 I think it will be gone but 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:04:00.640
 If you follow the information given without failing 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.180
 Something also later stumble raise it 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:08.230
 I Why not rough servants only to 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:12.040
 So I showed various verifications after seeing various information 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:16.269
 I think though no longer a little in the story also important or that say 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:19.379
 This was my first story about the stars 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.379
 Thank you for your viewing
