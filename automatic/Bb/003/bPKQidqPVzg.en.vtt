00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:07.689 
tray off it was pretty awesome

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.670 
tray off it was pretty awesome
yes<00:00:08.530> so<00:00:08.920> there<00:00:09.879> was<00:00:10.000> some<00:00:10.269> clay<00:00:10.599> in<00:00:10.990> my<00:00:11.289> front

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:11.680 
yes so there was some clay in my front

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.060 
yes so there was some clay in my front
wheel<00:00:11.889> on<00:00:12.190> the<00:00:12.549> Y<00:00:12.879> Z<00:00:13.209> and<00:00:13.420> so<00:00:14.410> ordered<00:00:14.889> myself

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
wheel on the Y Z and so ordered myself

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.359 
wheel on the Y Z and so ordered myself
some<00:00:15.699> some<00:00:16.480> bearings

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.700 

hopefully<00:00:21.369> they<00:00:21.869> hopefully<00:00:22.869> they<00:00:23.170> fit<00:00:23.500> their

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
hopefully they hopefully they fit their

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.880 
hopefully they hopefully they fit their
seals<00:00:24.070> I<00:00:24.460> got<00:00:24.610> some<00:00:24.820> seals<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:27.180> yes<00:00:28.180> so<00:00:28.570> I

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
seals I got some seals and yes so I

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.189 
seals I got some seals and yes so I
update<00:00:29.890> on<00:00:30.039> the<00:00:30.130> Y<00:00:30.279> Z<00:00:30.609> I'm<00:00:30.789> going<00:00:31.000> to<00:00:31.119> get<00:00:31.990> those

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.199 
update on the Y Z I'm going to get those

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:36.000 
update on the Y Z I'm going to get those
in<00:00:32.559> there<00:00:32.800> and<00:00:33.390> mostly<00:00:34.390> I<00:00:34.539> could<00:00:34.780> make<00:00:35.770> some

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
in there and mostly I could make some

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.899 
in there and mostly I could make some
videos<00:00:37.589> again<00:00:38.589> so<00:00:38.890> here's<00:00:39.429> a<00:00:39.519> little<00:00:39.670> update

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:39.909 
videos again so here's a little update

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:44.129 
videos again so here's a little update
of<00:00:40.359> where<00:00:41.199> I<00:00:41.260> am<00:00:41.559> with<00:00:41.940> both<00:00:42.940> now<00:00:43.659> with

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:44.139 
of where I am with both now with

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:45.000 
of where I am with both now with
bearings

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
bearings

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.719 
bearings
I<00:00:45.159> didn't<00:00:46.030> have<00:00:46.679> allen<00:00:47.679> key<00:00:48.039> dough<00:00:48.249> is<00:00:48.489> big

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:48.729 
I didn't have allen key dough is big

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:52.289 
I didn't have allen key dough is big
enough<00:00:48.999> so<00:00:49.870> I<00:00:50.309> made<00:00:51.309> this<00:00:51.489> little<00:00:51.729> thing<00:00:52.030> to

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:52.299 
enough so I made this little thing to

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:56.430 
enough so I made this little thing to
fit<00:00:52.600> in<00:00:52.809> there<00:00:53.049> and<00:00:54.010> then<00:00:54.190> that<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:55.629> do<00:00:55.870> so

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
fit in there and then that to do so

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.359 
fit in there and then that to do so
this<00:00:56.920> is<00:00:58.260> math<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.799> boats<00:01:00.069> out<00:01:00.339> so<00:01:00.760> now<00:01:01.120> I<00:01:01.149> just

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:02.369 
this is math the boats out so now I just

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:05.070 
this is math the boats out so now I just
have<00:01:03.369> to<00:01:03.459> push<00:01:03.760> that<00:01:03.969> out<00:01:04.030> and<00:01:04.360> then<00:01:04.510> the<00:01:04.690> wheel

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
have to push that out and then the wheel

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.560 
have to push that out and then the wheel
should<00:01:05.320> just<00:01:05.740> fall<00:01:06.070> off<00:01:06.280> so<00:01:06.690> that's<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:10.210> so

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
should just fall off so that's it so

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.550 
should just fall off so that's it so
here's<00:01:10.960> where<00:01:11.230> I<00:01:11.320> am

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
here's where I am

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.350 
here's where I am
I<00:01:11.860> got<00:01:12.400> the<00:01:12.700> wheel<00:01:13.150> off<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.710> I<00:01:14.740> got<00:01:15.430> that<00:01:15.640> axle

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
I got the wheel off so I got that axle

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:39.210 
I got the wheel off so I got that axle
and<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:24.700> some<00:01:25.000> we're<00:01:37.770> gonna<00:01:38.770> have<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.070> take

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
and have some we're gonna have to take

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:52.290 
and have some we're gonna have to take
this<00:01:39.370> and<00:01:41.010> yeah<00:01:42.010> it<00:01:42.220> should<00:01:42.580> be<00:01:44.190> both<00:01:51.120> have<00:01:52.120> all

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
this and yeah it should be both have all

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.170 
this and yeah it should be both have all
the<00:01:52.450> bearings<00:01:52.840> out<00:01:53.110> now<00:01:53.380> well<00:01:53.970> bearings<00:01:54.970> are

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
the bearings out now well bearings are

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:13.480 
the bearings out now well bearings are
nothing<00:01:55.840> in<00:01:55.990> there

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.850 

whose<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:14.880> I'm<00:02:15.630> really<00:02:15.930> really<00:02:16.200> happy<00:02:16.530> now

whose so I'm really really happy now
solving<00:02:17.430> my<00:02:17.580> problem<00:02:18.090> there's<00:02:18.840> no<00:02:19.260> play<00:02:19.770> at

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
solving my problem there's no play at

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.600 
solving my problem there's no play at
all<00:02:20.010> like<00:02:20.700> nothing<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.390> Berens<00:02:21.900> work

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
all like nothing to Berens work

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.010 
all like nothing to Berens work
perfectly<00:02:23.610> everything's<00:02:24.210> tight<00:02:24.600> in<00:02:24.780> there

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
perfectly everything's tight in there

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.130 
perfectly everything's tight in there
and<00:02:25.800> their<00:02:26.400> roles<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:27.060> lot<00:02:27.270> nicer<00:02:28.370> yep<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:29.910> I

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
and their roles a lot nicer yep so I

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.180 
and their roles a lot nicer yep so I
fixed<00:02:31.140> one<00:02:31.320> problem<00:02:31.940> no<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:32.970> just<00:02:33.150> gotta<00:02:34.190> get

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
fixed one problem no I just gotta get

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.520 
fixed one problem no I just gotta get
that<00:02:36.030> system<00:02:36.390> top<00:02:37.320> in<00:02:37.560> yep<00:02:38.460> so<00:02:39.320> that's<00:02:40.320> what's

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
that system top in yep so that's what's

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.520 
that system top in yep so that's what's
going<00:02:40.800> on<00:02:40.950> otherwise<00:02:41.160> you
