00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.549
 and very good to all the boys and girls 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.530
 ok minute90 and those in person 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.930
 this is a small video explaining the 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.430
 why of this new series you will already see 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.070
 the league of legends have a lot 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.930
 already live and with many 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.970
 competitions and that means that 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.180
 sooner or later the players come and 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.060
 I will take longer following the scene 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.610
 competitive about three years and I've already 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.340
 I saw many many players and I think that 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.680
 some of them deserve to be remembered 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.840
 more for love that I feel towards them 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.480
 and above all for the contribution they have made 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.980
 come to attract the whole community 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.440
 league of legends that I already believe that 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.480
 many of you do not know who 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.460
 they are because in the popularity of the game 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.230
 reached a peak at the end of the 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.210
 season 2 but I think that the most 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.829
 reached was season 3 however 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.570
 there are many players that between the 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.570
 season 1 season 2 to 3 already 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.280
 they withdrew and I think even some that 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.989
 they already arrived season 3 they did it 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.510
 in very bad conditions and it has not been not 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.460
 they have been very fair to them for it 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.740
 I want to make a series from here 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.330
 tribute to all that series of players already 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.940
 be from any region so much 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.800
 from america of europe or even from korea 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.180
 that came a little bit later the game 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.540
 but still there are already retired players 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.740
 that are worth being remembered and 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.620
 nothing else is like a tribute series 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.250
 towards them and I hope you like nothing 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.250

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.350
 known for being the creator and principal 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.640
 team captain now known as 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.640
 counter logic gaming 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.540
 this canadian player boarded the world 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.369
 the league of legends from well 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.140
 started the beta and managed to open a hole 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.420
 between professionals with champions 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.460
 as characteristic as a and give 8 gat 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.460
 something out of the ordinary back then 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.720
 Yes Yes 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.640
 followed by his combative instinct 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.649
 decided to set aside the studies to 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.970
 dedicate his passion in body and soul 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.860
 an early phase of the competitive world 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.450
 ce the axis led by hot shot managed 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.320
 rise champion of several tournaments like 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:23.750
 the wtf of 2010 will emerge law of 2011 and 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.750
 the and m6 of colony in 2011 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.140
 or 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.160
 God ruin 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.780
 however the team never managed 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.040
 achieve a necessary stability by 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.540
 what has always been considered the 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.130
 team terna mind second in staying 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.400
 behind the archenemy team alone 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.400
 same 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.400
 shades 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.400
 that 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.629
 and we are going to do 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.040
 with the passage of time the new blood 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.780
 has reached the league so george 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.580
 he had to reinvent himself playing a while 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.140
 in the jungle and finally ending up as 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.140
 top without getting to cooperate the level 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.440
 do not 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.409
 ah 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.469
 hewitt or damn 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.069
 outside of the competitive one, its 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.569
 media facet since it was the first 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.520
 professional player of eagle legends that 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.590
 popularized the streams on the platform 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.990
 and abandoned net tv where it came to 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.270
 reach 20,000 simultaneous beavers and 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.590
 leaving memories like a string where 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.080
 he fell asleep in the champions 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.890
 select or its very characteristic form of 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.890
 sit on the chair 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.590

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.880
 finally in May 2013 decided 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.590
 retire as a player to dedicate 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.210
 completely to his role as manager of the 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.650
 team and perform some good 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.660
 steps such as hiring 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.100
