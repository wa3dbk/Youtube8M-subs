00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
getting her but I don't know maybe just

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.850 
getting her but I don't know maybe just
maybe<00:04:08.970> if<00:04:09.239> I<00:04:09.630> start<00:04:09.900> seeing<00:04:10.079> her<00:04:10.230> in<00:04:10.380> catalogs

I really don't think so especially

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.110
