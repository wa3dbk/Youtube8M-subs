factor<00:02:08.099> for<00:02:08.129> form<00:02:08.489> factor<00:02:08.970> across<00:02:09.330> these

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
factor for form factor across these

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.600 
factor for form factor across these
other<00:02:09.780> similar<00:02:10.229> items<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.160> here<00:02:11.370> I'm<00:02:11.459> going<00:02:11.550> to

see<00:02:50.219> I'm<00:02:50.609> going<00:02:50.669> to<00:02:50.760> try<00:02:50.849> to<00:02:50.939> turn<00:02:51.090> them<00:02:51.239> around

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
see I'm going to try to turn them around

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.030 
see I'm going to try to turn them around
real<00:02:51.599> quick<00:02:51.629> for<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:51.959> folks<00:02:52.169> how<00:02:52.709> much<00:02:52.919> it

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
real quick for you folks how much it

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.280 
real quick for you folks how much it
takes<00:02:53.189> at<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.459> hand<00:02:53.669> space<00:02:53.939> to<00:02:54.120> hold<00:02:54.299> these<00:02:54.480> so

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
takes at the hand space to hold these so

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.990 
takes at the hand space to hold these so
obviously<00:02:55.739> we<00:02:55.980> can't<00:02:56.250> do<00:02:56.370> any<00:02:56.549> testing

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
obviously we can't do any testing

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.819 
obviously we can't do any testing
because<00:02:57.359> the<00:02:57.510> iPad<00:02:57.840> Mini<00:02:58.079> is<00:02:58.169> a<00:02:58.260> dummy<00:02:58.590> model

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
because the iPad Mini is a dummy model

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.339 
because the iPad Mini is a dummy model
but<00:02:59.370> just<00:02:59.579> as<00:02:59.669> far<00:02:59.909> as<00:03:00.150> sheer<00:03:00.449> comfort<00:03:00.930> goes<00:03:01.109> I

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
but just as far as sheer comfort goes I

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.080 
but just as far as sheer comfort goes I
got<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.769> give<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.159> to<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.370> Google<00:03:02.669> Nexus<00:03:02.879> 7

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
got to give that to the Google Nexus 7

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.849 
got to give that to the Google Nexus 7
because<00:03:03.659> it<00:03:03.689> just<00:03:03.989> feels<00:03:04.379> more<00:03:04.650> comfortable
