00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.430 

um<00:00:11.640> basically<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:12.570> tank<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.960> lot<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.200> people

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
um basically this tank a lot of people

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.590 
um basically this tank a lot of people
sit<00:00:13.650> back<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.370> play<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.850> little<00:00:15.210> bit<00:00:15.480> more

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600 
sit back in it I play a little bit more

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.320 
sit back in it I play a little bit more
aggressively<00:00:16.139> because<00:00:16.610> it<00:00:17.610> is<00:00:17.820> decently

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
aggressively because it is decently

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.980 
aggressively because it is decently
mobile<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:19.200> lot<00:00:19.439> more<00:00:19.650> than<00:00:19.800> t95<00:00:20.450> has<00:00:21.450> good<00:00:21.720> gun

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
mobile a lot more than t95 has good gun

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.970 
mobile a lot more than t95 has good gun
depression<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:24.020> basically<00:00:25.020> it's<00:00:25.290> a<00:00:25.410> very

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
depression and basically it's a very

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.550 
depression and basically it's a very
good<00:00:26.220> tank<00:00:26.430> leaving<00:00:26.940> or<00:00:27.240> leading<00:00:27.930> pushes

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
good tank leaving or leading pushes

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.359 
good tank leaving or leading pushes
since<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.070> frontal<00:00:29.400> armor<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.760> very<00:00:29.970> good

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
since the frontal armor is very good

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.049 
since the frontal armor is very good
anything<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.460> really<00:00:32.610> had<00:00:32.760> to<00:00:32.790> worry<00:00:33.000> about

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
anything you really had to worry about

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.860 
anything you really had to worry about
in<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.720> being<00:00:34.199> flanked<00:00:34.590> since<00:00:35.510> it<00:00:36.510> can<00:00:36.720> be

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
in this is being flanked since it can be

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.759 
in this is being flanked since it can be
frank<00:00:37.170> flank<00:00:37.710> pretty<00:00:38.129> easily<00:00:38.340> but<00:00:39.350> if<00:00:40.350> you

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
frank flank pretty easily but if you

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:42.410 
frank flank pretty easily but if you
stick<00:00:41.040> around<00:00:41.070> your<00:00:41.489> teammates<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.000> bit<00:00:42.150> and

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
stick around your teammates a bit and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.530 
stick around your teammates a bit and
help<00:00:42.840> them<00:00:43.079> out<00:00:43.230> most<00:00:44.130> likely<00:00:44.399> they<00:00:45.180> will<00:00:45.329> help

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
help them out most likely they will help

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.530 
help them out most likely they will help
you<00:00:45.630> out<00:00:45.719> as<00:00:45.989> well<00:00:46.640> although<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:48.149> do<00:00:48.300> run<00:00:48.510> a

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
you out as well although you do run a

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.100 
you out as well although you do run a
risk<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.930> being<00:00:49.110> flanked<00:00:49.559> which<00:00:49.739> happens

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
risk of being flanked which happens

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.889 
risk of being flanked which happens
occasionally<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:53.239> don't<00:00:54.239> let<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.540> get<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.870> you

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
occasionally but don't let it get to you

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.200 
occasionally but don't let it get to you
it's<00:00:55.620> something<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.430> sort<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:57.000> to

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
it's something that you sort of have to

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.810 
it's something that you sort of have to
deal<00:00:57.719> with<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.110> this<00:00:58.289> tank<00:00:58.530> or<00:00:58.860> any<00:00:59.129> other<00:00:59.399> TD

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
deal with in this tank or any other TD

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.310 
deal with in this tank or any other TD
without<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> turret<00:01:02.239> now<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.750> lot<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.199> people

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
without a turret now a lot of people

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.980 
without a turret now a lot of people
would<00:01:04.619> argue<00:01:04.770> going<00:01:05.399> the<00:01:06.149> valley<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.750> this

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
would argue going the valley in this

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.560 
would argue going the valley in this
would<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.800> smart<00:01:08.160> idea<00:01:08.340> which<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.330> don't

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
would be a smart idea which I don't

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.070 
would be a smart idea which I don't
really<00:01:09.720> agree<00:01:09.990> with<00:01:10.080> since<00:01:11.149> the<00:01:12.149> valley<00:01:12.390> is

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
really agree with since the valley is

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.870 
really agree with since the valley is
sort<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.350> limit<00:01:13.680> yourself<00:01:13.979> if<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.250> push<00:01:14.520> over

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
sort of limit yourself if you push over

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.179 
sort of limit yourself if you push over
the<00:01:14.970> hill<00:01:15.150> people<00:01:15.689> have<00:01:16.049> shots<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> bottom

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
the hill people have shots on the bottom

you<00:01:42.360> sorta<00:01:42.720> can

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
you sorta can

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.170 
you sorta can
push<00:01:44.120> across<00:01:44.270> a<00:01:44.560> town<00:01:45.820> also<00:01:46.820> you<00:01:46.880> have<00:01:47.090> the

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
push across a town also you have the

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.970 
push across a town also you have the
option<00:01:47.360> of<00:01:47.720> moving<00:01:48.110> back<00:01:48.500> if<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:48.860> need<00:01:49.040> to<00:01:50.980> and

option of moving back if you need to and

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.070 
option of moving back if you need to and
I<00:01:52.040> thought<00:01:52.400> I'd<00:01:52.580> have<00:01:52.790> a<00:01:52.820> shot<00:01:52.940> on<00:01:53.480> him<00:01:53.510> it

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
I thought I'd have a shot on him it

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.110 
I thought I'd have a shot on him it
doesn't<00:01:54.530> that<00:01:54.620> he's<00:01:55.310> leaving<00:01:55.550> right<00:01:55.820> in<00:01:56.030> my

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
doesn't that he's leaving right in my

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:08.800 
doesn't that he's leaving right in my
shot<00:01:56.360> I<00:01:59.380> don't<00:02:00.380> think<00:02:00.440> I<00:02:00.680> hit<00:02:00.830> him

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.660 

it<00:02:09.440> definitely<00:02:09.800> looks<00:02:10.099> like<00:02:10.190> we're<00:02:10.520> going<00:02:10.610> to

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670

huh<00:02:23.150> guess<00:02:23.569> I<00:02:23.720> didn't<00:02:23.959> hit<00:02:24.020> that<00:02:24.080> guy<00:02:24.410> will

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
huh guess I didn't hit that guy will

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:36.370 
huh guess I didn't hit that guy will
flee<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:25.880> low<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.390> t32<00:02:26.959> get<00:02:27.500> him

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.440 

it<00:02:36.950> does<00:02:37.400> not<00:02:37.610> look<00:02:37.790> like<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:38.120> low<00:02:38.240> did

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
it does not look like the low did

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:46.330 
it does not look like the low did
anything<00:02:38.720> at<00:02:38.930> all

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.820 

basically<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.239> truck<00:02:47.420> today<00:02:47.569> III<00:02:48.050> is<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.650> do

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
basically the truck today III is you do

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.059 
basically the truck today III is you do
have<00:02:49.010> weak<00:02:49.250> spots<00:02:49.610> on<00:02:49.879> your<00:02:49.910> lower<00:02:50.209> hole

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
have weak spots on your lower hole

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.640 
have weak spots on your lower hole
closest<00:02:52.069> to<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.310> tracks<00:02:52.580> your<00:02:52.819> weakest<00:02:53.150> armor

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
closest to the tracks your weakest armor

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.860 
closest to the tracks your weakest armor
however<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:54.830> can<00:02:55.150> somewhat<00:02:56.150> negate<00:02:56.450> that<00:02:56.510> by

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
however you can somewhat negate that by

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.440 
however you can somewhat negate that by
wiggling<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.700> basically<00:02:58.700> not<00:02:58.940> letting<00:02:59.330> them

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
wiggling and basically not letting them

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.650 
wiggling and basically not letting them
get<00:02:59.599> a<00:02:59.660> good<00:02:59.870> shot<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:01.550> commander<00:03:02.269> shots<00:03:02.510> on

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
get a good shot the commander shots on

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.880 
get a good shot the commander shots on
top<00:03:02.870> of<00:03:02.989> your<00:03:03.110> turret<00:03:03.440> is<00:03:03.590> very<00:03:04.040> strong<00:03:04.430> and

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
top of your turret is very strong and

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.949 
top of your turret is very strong and
basically<00:03:06.890> you<00:03:07.099> can<00:03:07.430> rely<00:03:07.849> on<00:03:08.000> that<00:03:08.180> not<00:03:08.720> being

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
basically you can rely on that not being

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.610 
basically you can rely on that not being

more weak spots on the lower hold on a
t95<00:06:34.310> it<00:06:35.810> really<00:06:36.810> is<00:06:36.930> important<00:06:37.470> that<00:06:37.680> this

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
t95 it really is important that this

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.340 
t95 it really is important that this
mobility<00:06:38.910> that<00:06:39.360> gets<00:06:39.690> that<00:06:39.960> you<00:06:40.110> take

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
mobility that gets that you take

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.010 
mobility that gets that you take
advantage<00:06:40.500> of<00:06:40.950> it<00:06:41.010> since<00:06:41.880> it's<00:06:42.300> able<00:06:42.930> to

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
advantage of it since it's able to

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.220 
advantage of it since it's able to
reposition<00:06:43.350> better<00:06:44.570> basically<00:06:45.570> help<00:06:45.840> falling

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.230 
reposition better basically help falling

reposition better basically help falling
flanks<00:06:46.710> return<00:06:47.040> to<00:06:47.160> base<00:06:47.340> like<00:06:47.610> this<00:06:47.910> so<00:06:48.750> it

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
flanks return to base like this so it

00:06:48.930 --> 00:07:16.820 
flanks return to base like this so it
really<00:06:48.960> becomes<00:06:49.770> a<00:06:50.040> lot<00:06:50.190> more<00:06:50.250> useful
