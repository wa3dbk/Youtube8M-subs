00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.069

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.830
 raised as always and I come to 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.460
 show you a mod 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.850
 it's better in camping 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.460
 what good as you will suppose it adds a better 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.349
 enchantment system 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.720
 of those that I have found that modify 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:26.180
 this fucking system language shit 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.950
 intergalactic and shits 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.740
 actually this is the one that has most 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.920
 liked of all if it is not to find one 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.500
 that serves multiplayer 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.600
 because this good now today I will explain 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.250
 adds a new interface but in 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.820
 multiplayer you give to find 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.739
 find find find in 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.750
 multiplayer you give to love and does not 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.510
 nothing is a shit 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.190
 now you will see it 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.190
 and good also happy 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.410
 I'm going to teach you right button like 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.170
 always here you had to put weapons and 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.630
 well these lines did not have them but 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.580
 they put their guns and they strain the language 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.460
 fucking interactive so here not here 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.980
 you put a gun to a tool yet what 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.990
 that you leave the inventory 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.270
 and this adds the enchantment that 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.350
 you want is telling you in the levels to 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:26.000
 see I have 32 levels and richard núñez 5 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.000
 we are going down to work with 21 with 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:34.750
 on the mouse wheel 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.750
 Dancing hello happened to me 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.950
 I'm going to take it 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.950
 and that a pare 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.799
 no man 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.450
 ok and after choosing all the 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:56.340
 enchantments that you want in we sing 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.340
 and we have our sword life 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.250
 these words god tonight 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.850
 they wanted that to be 10 minutes 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.770
 no bugs 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.120
 in the time 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.800
 it is not ready 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.690
 walking 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.939
 just listen to the birds and 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.349
 crickets and things like that 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.349
 at the time 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.769
 after destroying the sword the 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.769
 we can put here 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.769
 Y 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.610
 It puts prepare with nine levels 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.130
 tonight 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.130
 you will notice 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.330
 They do not seem to love it until they 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.810
 repair does not stop singing 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.810
 one 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.810
 do not 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.810
 we see here repair 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.340
 and now you see you no longer have nothing 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.250
 broken I love that that here only not 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.830
 can only be enchanted to do more 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.150
 things and tells you what you have and can 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.150
 keep disenchanting too 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Mix I put on it's harness powder appearance 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.050
 and breaking 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.500
 well I read is a parsley 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:04.660
 in breaking implies that for example you 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.660
 we take away the hunger jking this shit 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.659
 to the level 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.680
 Part by part 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.120
 disenchantment to take away any but 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.880
 let's remove one that is no longer 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.880
 level the cern is we are harness 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.560
 and we have the look of the game and the 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.520
 Author 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.710
 then we can make suites 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.210
 and suites what it does is add 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.690
 enchantments we add the 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.690
 same for example 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.760
 so it costs me a lower level to 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.430
 know that disenchanting gives you less levels 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.870
 of what is missing in the middle and now 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.140
 return to abstain what we have 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.140
 Market Stall 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:52.999
 it is very useful because at any time 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:55.610
 you can do all the levels outside and 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:59.389
 in each step behind magician something else 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.789
 other mature ones and I really like 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.830
 that's why you can choose enchantments 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:07.100
 as you like 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.590
 You can repair what is great if 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.040
 you have an enchanted diamond sword 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.040
 already the beast 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:19.940
 that you break that you die breaks you 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.940
 you die 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.260
 I also like that you can add 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.639
 is for example now you do not have levels 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.180
 for 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:32.960
 for example acs els harness 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:35.810
 and you do not have levels for the country 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.610
 barnes with the levels that I have left 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:42.550
 for 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.550
 do not look you have eleven levels left 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.280
 then it's great for that and posts 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.790
 to sing it at any time 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.340
 the bad is that 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.160
 that in the multiplayer does not work but 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.360
 is that what also does not work is that 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.289
 it stays like this you see this 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.499
 so 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:15.860
 but multiplayer like that you do like this and for 

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:18.110
 much you give in cast this does not catch 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.270
 enchantment do not put it here do not catch 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.729
 enchantment then not only is it not 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.199
 functions these types of cars you 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.550
 Fuck the enchantment system not 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:28.150
 You can love nothing until you get 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:32.280
 take away the world 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:35.560
 and good that until here the review I leave you 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:41.430
 the link to more below in the 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:41.430
 description and we'll see you bye
