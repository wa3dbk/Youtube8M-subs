00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.040 
just we'll hold our ground and we'll go
here<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:14.880> we'll<00:03:15.030> just<00:03:15.060> we<00:03:15.600> just<00:03:15.810> try<00:03:15.989> and

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
here and we'll just we just try and

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.570 
here and we'll just we just try and
basically<00:03:16.470> do<00:03:16.560> everything<00:03:16.890> because<00:03:17.010> after

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
basically do everything because after

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.990 
basically do everything because after
that<00:03:17.760> after<00:03:18.570> about<00:03:18.799> 20-30<00:03:19.799> minutes<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.610> really

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
that after about 20-30 minutes it really

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.030 
that after about 20-30 minutes it really
just<00:03:21.239> becomes<00:03:21.420> repetitive<00:03:21.989> for<00:03:22.440> us<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:22.890> we

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
just becomes repetitive for us so we

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.530 
just becomes repetitive for us so we
want<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.280> make<00:03:23.400> sure<00:03:23.519> that<00:03:23.670> we<00:03:23.790> maximize<00:03:24.030> our

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
want to make sure that we maximize our

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.570

I<00:03:30.030> don't<00:03:30.150> even<00:03:30.420> think<00:03:30.630> that<00:03:30.660> will<00:03:30.959> probably

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
I don't even think that will probably

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.020 
I don't even think that will probably
ever<00:03:31.410> go<00:03:31.620> for<00:03:31.830> high<00:03:31.980> round<00:03:32.250> stuff<00:03:32.519> I<00:03:32.700> don't

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
ever go for high round stuff I don't

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.670 
ever go for high round stuff I don't
think<00:03:33.330> any<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.600> us<00:03:33.720> are<00:03:33.900> really<00:03:33.959> interested

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680
