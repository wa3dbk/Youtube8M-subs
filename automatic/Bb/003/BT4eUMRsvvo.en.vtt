00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 there, French people show that the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:13.110
 lose electric 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.330
 this is the weight already on it will cause 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:21.810
 fine but we were only paid here it is 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:23.430
 better or worse than the floor is the floor 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.619
 works from the inside 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.740
 positive from negative 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:34.739
 then positive white gold brass by 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.630
 out is the negative ok I'm his in it already 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.430
 no jec and 10 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.140
 so here is the next tip is 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.930
 positive here negative 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.170
 Okay, all of our piece that I'm 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.910
 doing now that portela foam 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.579
 cube shape here is all using a 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.030
 3m double-sided tape that she is a little 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.910
 different from that of conventional tapes is 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.450
 you cut a piece of glue here and 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.200
 When you pull to take this part of the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.270
 paper 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.280
 the glue is where you added it 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.740
 so what I did like I did 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:23.250
 put our floor here 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:26.130
 that way then it should very well 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:39.600
 it works very well that our project 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:43.380
 Because to stay well, it's finished then. 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:59.640
 now I can, yes, our bar, she already 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:02:00.420
 is attached to the edge of the jet 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.920
 to run away 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.649
 it is you the skin to make it here already is 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:12.230
 passed in the middle here I did the same 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:16.430
 same thing or leya to accept 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.739
 zeni and now I'm going to take it and the glue 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.640
 piece 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:25.599
 hence we come here now and ball 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.599
 our weight 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.380
 ready floors we have here and centralized 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:54.810
 stuck here in the middle so it will stay 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:56.610
 so this part here asks me 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.070
 I stuck here right? 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:04.400
 I stuck in the place here, imagine where it would 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:09.120
 The better you put in that part and 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:17.060
 she here again giving the finishing of the 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:17.060
 ask the lady more here 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:29.820
 ok jec just waiting now the pds that goes 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.640
 get out there and promote that we will 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.620
 do the im sea 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.769
 and here our center of the building goes 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:43.500
 stay that way personally 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:44.519
 electronic drum machine is basically that 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.470
 on here 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.800
 however we with the different finish 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:54.930
 because the materials are different but the 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.700
 reading it is this one so now I'm going 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:02.300

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.300
