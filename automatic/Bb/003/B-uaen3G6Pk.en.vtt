00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.270
 so out of hand for beta testing 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.760
 hit modules smartphone master whale that 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.400
 yourself as it inserts a very modular 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.309
 device design costs from 6 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.310
 sleeping each other's modules block 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.640
 power supply part of the microcontroller 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:28.769
 bluetooth module and 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:30.900
 3 radio modules module is designed for 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.350
 electrical load control with 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.399
 any android device 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.059
 This module is controlled by 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.440
 with android devices via bluetooth 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.770
 actuator normal 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.300
 sockets are controlled by radio channels 400 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.950
 33 megahertz due to such a decision 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.350
 can achieve very low cost 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:58.020
 I think one problem of intelligence rubles 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.989
 200 should get the cost and also 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.550
 testing kids shared with me 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.550
 house for house 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.450
 this house 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:19.830
 several radio modules 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:23.850
 which controls the turning off of the light yet 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.189
 one module socket which includes 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:32.250
 desk lamp well itself 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:33.590
 the program is first played just 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.860
 turn on turn on and off 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.860
 various loads 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:47.550
 push the button the lights came on 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.550
 push the button yet 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.500
 the light turned off 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.350
 the inclusion of lighting in the street 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.000
 bye 7 desk lamp
