00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.869 
table design sort of it has a lip
although<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.230> chrome<00:02:26.769> is<00:02:26.950> still<00:02:27.160> showing<00:02:27.430> so

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
although the chrome is still showing so

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.050 
although the chrome is still showing so
it<00:02:28.330> I<00:02:28.840> think<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.739> would<00:02:29.830> be<00:02:29.860> okay<00:02:30.280> honestly<00:02:30.760> and

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
it I think it would be okay honestly and

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.320 
it I think it would be okay honestly and
also<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:32.140> am<00:02:32.440> not<00:02:32.860> afraid<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.310> drop<00:02:33.700> this<00:02:33.940> I<00:02:34.150> will

also I am not afraid to drop this I will

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.199 
also I am not afraid to drop this I will
drop<00:02:34.569> this<00:02:34.900> from<00:02:36.629> about<00:02:38.549> pretty<00:02:39.549> high<00:02:39.819> about

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
drop this from about pretty high about

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.449 
drop this from about pretty high about
arm's<00:02:40.599> length<00:02:40.660> I<00:02:41.079> into<00:02:41.349> that<00:02:43.829> no<00:02:44.829> damage<00:02:45.280> at

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459

all although this is on carpet so it it

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.039 
all although this is on carpet so it it
probably<00:02:51.489> won't<00:02:51.819> get<00:02:51.940> damaged<00:02:52.329> as<00:02:52.510> easily<00:02:52.720> up
