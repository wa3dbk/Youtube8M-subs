00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 me rural to tell you that the seprona 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.919
 has located five hunters without 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.360
 license they were committing 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.910
 infractions has occurred in the province 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.250
 de teruel the last ones in the area of 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.839
 maestrazgo and sierra de arcos los 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.180
 hunters not only lacked the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.760
 license but they did not use the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.980
 Mandatory seals in big game and 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.019
 they did not have the authorization of the preserve 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.230
 In addition, several weapons have been seized 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.480
 long telescopic sights seals and 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.790
 a mountain goat head that 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.160
 furtive people wanted to take it as a trophy 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.530
 last March the SEPRONA 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.719
 alcañiz learned that some 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.730
 hunters had hunted several 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.379
 of wild ibex without the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.660
 corresponding authorization 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.190
 supposed authors face a 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.640
 sanctioning procedure with fines 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.280
 from three thousand euros to sixty thousand 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.699
 euros including the prohibition to hunt 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.379
 from one to five years old and well you have to 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.989
 saying a good thing is a crime 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.030
 blatant fragrant more than ever is a 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.500
 protected area the only thing that said 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.940
 release and I do not say that such 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.860
 importance is that why 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:13.200
 there is a lot is a minor for example is not 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.570
 that is a plague but is frank in 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.280
 frank expansion of the ports area 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.220
 it manages to love me there in this area of 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.550
 l'esport there is a lot another thing is that 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.380
 Well, what is one is a very 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.320
 bound to burst the batidas therefore 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.210
 Well maybe if what happens is that 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.630
 there is a very strong population explosion 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.630
 there are years 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.070
 of this year and there is another thing that is that 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.440
 It's a piece that is raffled off because it's 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.340
 very colorful look what is the kill 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.600
 to take the head to then do not know 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.340
 as many people take advantage 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.620
 Antlers and drying are fine but 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.360
 danger in principle the good part of 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.950
 the only news is that it is not so 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.420
 journalistic as they build times 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.830
 it also has other ways than in these 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.770
 time 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.440
 the people the authorizations losses 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.320
 etcetera is released to a hunting thing 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:10.590
 furtive I did not think that back 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:12.690
 Well, I know but it is true that he said 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.590
 that there is a very famous furtive very famous 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.590
 well known in aragon 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.160
 of course there is an administrative infraction 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.350
 and in is a very serious serious infraction 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.850
 for the amount of sanctions that are 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.370
 face by the prohibitions that there are 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.080
 then with carrying with them and 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.910
 also because as noted, it is that 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.800
 final the damage is a serious injury 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.420
 in the following sense if you do not do 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.550
 control over this type of activities 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.010
 you can fall into risks from first of 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.600
 make exploitations first 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.370
 illicit economic activities from these 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.510
 seconds a business is generated but there 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.430
 an important business behind the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.530
 furtivismo is not growing 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.700
 it's just the subject that skips 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.740
 rules and will hunt for it with the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.690
 shotgun hitting shots you have to know what 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.459
 there are behind that people who are dedicated to 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.350
 the activity in a professional manner 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.760
 charges for it takes you to the 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.440
 certain places ie there are 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.950
 total for there is also a whole plot 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.629
 important 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.160
 there is an obvious risk of hunting in 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.160
 inadequate places at the time 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.580
 the factors only two factors that 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.410
 contribute to that first in the ports 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.060
 Aragón is general but the ports of 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.400
 times too much is being depopulated 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.349
 then there is less demographic pressure of 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.209
 hunting over security 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.849
 let's say the form of torture and second 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.470
 It is also true that every time there are 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.049
 disappearing many barracks of the 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.599
 civil guard that what he says to us 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.410
 several times that as how - it's a 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.819
 deterrent people because they just 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.930
 a winchester because this fits with 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.480
 a shotgun 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.910
 because on that detonates and put on notice 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.799
 in any case good and then what you say 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.890
 you the danger because the all over the 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.690
 neighbor for example now 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.280
 there are many people on the mountain to be 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.290
 actually monitor that localized area 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.489
 these do not follow us very well but that the 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.940
 added danger is that there are many people 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.940
 now
