00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello if alex of papy x.com and 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.819
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.649
 change the hard drive of your laptop 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.940
 with a new hard drive and intense 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.309
 you bought in store 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.750
 simply disassemble it then 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.000
 change hard drive with the one that 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.560
 was of dada origin of course not I 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.960
 does a video and parents on 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.029
 how to only unmount a hard drive 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.859
 of a laptop then normally if you 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.189
 have a pc like this by putting a 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.619
 pc toshiba hp is safe gateway and 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.660
 emachines hawaii new stuff there that 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.309
 is then a pc that is a real name 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.899
 expresses windows 7 systems by 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.180
 example or even windows 8 that's 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.760
 easily removable if you have by 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.800
 example a mac a macbook or macbook pro 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.480
 and no no it's a lot harder 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.510
 we must have diverted the specials 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.640
 then you have to be delicate so for 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.539
 this one is very simple it's just 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.719
 a 15 inches 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.070
 I feel where you have access to it so I have 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.930
 makes the video that is available in the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.699
 description of the video on as to 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.590
 to dismount a hard drive from a laptop that 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.809
 is sweeter a lot more detailed 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.649
 so I saw a little faster if 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.539
 you saw the video 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.020
 so I actually feel up to battery by 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.460
 afterwards we dismount the plate that 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.360
 contains the hard drive inside 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.720
 it's so I just want to remove it as 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.720
 this 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.360
 and that's when I take my life off what 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.799
 is the bone under the platelet era and 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.750
 we address that they are original 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.090
 so to remove it game it was pulling his 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.560
 little tongue and that's what you 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.799
 said weis you have to remove them 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.049
 as well 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.390
 so for this plate is there you 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.860
 should always kept on a laptop the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.270
 original wafer that just does that 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.189
 the cans put them that 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.110
 I look at our eyes our two disks 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.700
 hard I have the one on the left which is the one 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.560
 of the pop touch I have my new I see a 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.299
 plan as of date then you have to 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.960
 to know if you change hard drive from 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.790
 your laptop 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.979
 even if you have a toshiba a man who 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.670
 so gates or to the error anywhere 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.710
 what brand 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.240
 if you put another hard drive out of 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.860
 different brands it's too serious 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.509
 the toshiba and if you are as much 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.219
 compatible with the sig is the most 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.560
 important is if you have a 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.969
 sata connection so it does not look like 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.590
 bad it's in the person of connection 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.450
 sata all the laptops they come 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.770
 with satin nowadays then 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.719
 maybe in this stretch was a tool 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.069
 connection before it was leader but 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.170
 now it's satin gives 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.400
 stages is a hard drive like this 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.350
 is fine you are perfectly 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.900
 so that one 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.120
 defective for example I have to disassemble 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.290
 with the 80 on the sides of the times the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.910
 vices are going to be the order 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.070
 you have to remove all the screws then 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.420
 remember what edge riva does that 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.910
 I must remember that the little 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.890
 tongue that is here and well being in 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.070
 back or does no connection 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.990
 then the metal side protects the 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.850
 surface that were all the circuits 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.800
 so once you remember this 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.690
 test of riding so I remove them 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.330
 four cities on the side all 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.190
 simply remove the first one by the 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.200
 sequel jean the era of the second I was 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.350
 normally worries about everything 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.960
 laptops only so we'll take the 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.550
 time to do it properly 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.590
 so of course the purpose of price knows that 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.470
 our next drive the virgin way him 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.420
 here there will be no data in 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.500
 since and new fact that the goal this 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.090
 would be to install a new system 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.880
 operating for example install 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.650
 windows on top made that I removed the 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.990
 four vices and takes away their little 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.210
 wafer that gives so sometimes ap hard 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.220
 it's wolf and I lose customers but 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.200
 in ex hard the lowest at the site did 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.020
 the trick is when you take over 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.490
 leslie mann big barrel disc mixes with 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.890
 roughly in the same position with the 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.210
 connections at the top then writing in 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.290
 down like these then all you have 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.640
 face and take it 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.800
 then put on that you like that 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.130
 must not deceive you made to him he could 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.600
 good you put it aside later a 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.730
 even vis-Ã -vis levis like these 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.500
 the other side then give you the four 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.800
 screw simply into small wheels 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.830
 peter vi do I will do tomorrow with 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.330
 this new hard drive seagate 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.920
 we have when I said it just takes 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.040
 sector to have the right connections 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.750
 worse it's very simple lamp to 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.330
 different models that would have other 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.640
 login sites but jose haedo small 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.320
 platelets like this this 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.400
 practically five is in excess are more 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:05.000
 complex so by cons but hey it's 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.200
 clear we read nice 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.100
 I will go for a long time now 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.340
 lack of screws in this one see here 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.710
 of course the bes sas rip of the autumn 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.900
 then of life it's a little bit right for 

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:22.310
 that she hold like this then after you 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:27.169
 want to complete with your turn 10 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:29.960
 and last, not least, we saw her 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:32.480
 a little bit and we will complete with 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.919
 our tonelli what once that is 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.960
 does you now have your new 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.820
 hard drive on the original wafer 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.139
 with the little yates we had 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.389
 do the madmen their masters in 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.280
 the imposition look like the 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.200
 connections are made the small the little 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.010
 connector and the sata sas and 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.990
 supply 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.669
 same thing if does all I have to 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.290
 easy to put as I remove them and 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.870
 do them I put them pretty much in 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:57.350
 the same position as those here and there we 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.150
 just pushed like this for them 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.130
 are connected thereafter once 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.870
 that was asked we just have to close the 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.700
 hood and we have now done 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.500
 installing a new hard drive 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.600
 a laptop 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.910
 so of course I will know when 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.919
 you go to turn them off ok you 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.350
 will have windows to install right now there 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.780
 is blank tells them nothing is light 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.880
 your error no operation system 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.130
 system five which means in French 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.260
 no operating system detected 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.850
 so it does not detect anything a 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.890
 cd player it would have to submit a cd 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.789
 windows xp windows vista or windows 7 or 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.110
 even windows 8 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.690
 depending on the system you want 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.710
 install bcd and proceed to 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.150
 Installation 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.729
 if you want to see how to install 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.590
 for example a new system 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.180
 operating on a computer 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.440
 well I made the video that is 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.010
 available in the description of the 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.140
 video down 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.580
 so you can go and see how 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.250
 install by putting windows xp windows 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.020
 vista windows 7 or even windows 8 on a 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.660
 new computer with a new drive 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.160
 so hard to go see that's gone then 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.720
 that's it for this long video 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.610
 games is putting the battery back and by 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.500
 the fall we do not install a 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.990
 new hard drive of our laptop 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.520
 thank you very much goodbye so I hope 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.080
