00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
as you can see i did an extension that

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:51.330 
as you can see i did an extension that
goes<00:01:45.530> under<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.280> letter<00:01:46.840> it<00:01:47.840> looks<00:01:48.080> good<00:01:48.470> ads

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.030 

I<00:01:52.340> don't<00:01:53.120> know<00:01:53.210> what<00:01:53.360> it<00:01:53.480> adds<00:01:53.690> anymore<00:01:54.230> I<00:01:54.470> keep

I don't know what it adds anymore I keep

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.090 
I don't know what it adds anymore I keep
saying<00:01:55.280> length<00:01:55.730> variety<00:01:56.630> or<00:01:56.840> style<00:01:57.230> flow

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
saying length variety or style flow

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.080 
saying length variety or style flow
which<00:01:58.850> it<00:01:59.030> does<00:01:59.530> but<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:00.800> just<00:02:01.040> looks<00:02:01.160> good<00:02:01.700> a

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
which it does but it just looks good a

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.460 
which it does but it just looks good a
lot<00:02:03.130> but<00:02:04.130> you<00:02:04.400> can<00:02:05.030> go<00:02:05.210> over<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.780> or<00:02:06.110> under<00:02:06.440> it

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
lot but you can go over it or under it

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.440 
lot but you can go over it or under it
that<00:02:07.160> adds<00:02:07.370> variety<00:02:07.730> like<00:02:08.180> I<00:02:08.360> said<00:02:08.630> before<00:02:08.780> I

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
that adds variety like I said before I

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.630 
that adds variety like I said before I
already<00:02:11.450> did<00:02:11.750> an<00:02:11.870> over<00:02:12.230> one<00:02:12.440> on<00:02:12.650> my<00:02:12.860> see<00:02:13.220> as<00:02:13.460> you

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
already did an over one on my see as you

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.820 
already did an over one on my see as you
can<00:02:13.790> see<00:02:13.970> here<00:02:14.180> they<00:02:14.390> went<00:02:14.600> under<00:02:14.960> maybe

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
can see here they went under maybe

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.130 
can see here they went under maybe
that's<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.220> reason<00:02:16.400> why<00:02:16.690> not<00:02:17.690> sure<00:02:20.140> this

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
that's the reason why not sure this

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.020 
that's the reason why not sure this
letter<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.740> don't<00:02:22.070> want<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.430> have<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.610> lot<00:02:23.000> of

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
letter you don't want to have a lot of

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.080 
letter you don't want to have a lot of
extensions<00:02:23.870> for<00:02:24.110> it's<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:25.130> very<00:02:25.460> hard<00:02:25.790> letter

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
extensions for it's a very hard letter

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.160 
extensions for it's a very hard letter
to<00:02:26.420> stop<00:02:26.750> making<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.290> look<00:02:27.470> like<00:02:27.650> an<00:02:27.800> end<00:02:29.170> so

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
to stop making it look like an end so

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
side which I mentioned at the beginning

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.520 
side which I mentioned at the beginning
of<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.730> video<00:02:54.850> which<00:02:55.180> most<00:02:55.480> grapher<00:02:56.050> is<00:02:56.170> will

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
of the video which most grapher is will

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.640 
of the video which most grapher is will
have<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.730> then<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:58.120> just<00:02:58.480> did<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.990> left<00:02:59.230> side<00:02:59.440> I

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
have and then I just did the left side I

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.290 
have and then I just did the left side I
had<00:03:00.250> this<00:03:01.020> what<00:03:02.020> we<00:03:02.200> call<00:03:02.440> block<00:03:03.300> separate

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
had this what we call block separate

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.460 
had this what we call block separate
block<00:03:06.300> it<00:03:07.300> doesn't<00:03:07.660> look<00:03:07.690> complete<00:03:08.230> here

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
block it doesn't look complete here

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.500 
block it doesn't look complete here
right<00:03:08.680> you<00:03:09.190> can't<00:03:09.550> have<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.880> like<00:03:09.910> that<00:03:10.180> but<00:03:10.420> it

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
right you can't have it like that but it

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.840 
right you can't have it like that but it
doesn't<00:03:10.600> look<00:03:10.870> complete<00:03:11.489> therefore<00:03:12.489> I<00:03:12.520> had<00:03:12.819> a

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
doesn't look complete therefore I had a

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.050 
doesn't look complete therefore I had a
block<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.450> make<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:13.900> look<00:03:14.080> finished<00:03:14.850> having<00:03:15.850> a

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
block to make it look finished having a

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.120 
block to make it look finished having a
space<00:03:16.360> or<00:03:16.720> a<00:03:16.750> river<00:03:16.900> between<00:03:17.200> it<00:03:17.560> looks<00:03:17.860> good

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
space or a river between it looks good

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.120 
space or a river between it looks good
on<00:03:18.900> my<00:03:19.900> especially<00:03:20.319> if<00:03:20.380> that<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:20.709> have<00:03:20.920> like

you're really high three which I do kind

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.759 
you're really high three which I do kind
of<00:03:24.959> anything<00:03:25.959> higher<00:03:26.170> would<00:03:26.410> look<00:03:26.590> actually

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
of anything higher would look actually

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.290 
of anything higher would look actually
better<00:03:27.130> but<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.300> adds<00:03:29.190> very<00:03:30.190> cool<00:03:30.580> it<00:03:30.730> touch<00:03:30.970> to

the<00:04:04.100> 3d<00:04:04.570> like<00:04:05.570> I<00:04:05.690> mentioned<00:04:05.990> before<00:04:06.200> try<00:04:07.010> to

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
the 3d like I mentioned before try to

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.170 
the 3d like I mentioned before try to
rotate<00:04:07.310> it<00:04:07.750> that's<00:04:08.750> good<00:04:09.050> for<00:04:09.380> your<00:04:10.040> hand<00:04:10.310> they

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
rotate it that's good for your hand they

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.850 
rotate it that's good for your hand they
don't<00:04:11.390> have<00:04:11.510> to<00:04:11.660> strain<00:04:12.020> it<00:04:12.050> by<00:04:12.440> going<00:04:12.650> a

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
don't have to strain it by going a

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.130 
don't have to strain it by going a
different<00:04:13.040> diagonal<00:04:13.610> I<00:04:15.370> think<00:04:16.370> that's<00:04:16.579> it<00:04:16.850> add

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
different diagonal I think that's it add

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.190 
different diagonal I think that's it add
the<00:04:18.140> stacks<00:04:18.530> are<00:04:19.010> better<00:04:19.549> effects<00:04:20.049> more<00:04:21.049> of<00:04:21.109> a

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
the stacks are better effects more of a

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.720 
the stacks are better effects more of a
goblin<00:04:21.620> feel<00:04:21.859> which<00:04:22.070> is<00:04:22.100> what<00:04:22.340> we're<00:04:22.460> doing

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
goblin feel which is what we're doing

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:29.470 
goblin feel which is what we're doing
adding<00:04:23.180> bubbles<00:04:23.600> too<00:04:25.570> yeah<00:04:27.730> but<00:04:28.730> you<00:04:28.820> can<00:04:29.180> do

the inner sides like this i use the

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.000 
the inner sides like this i use the
center<00:04:41.930> marker<00:04:42.320> it<00:04:42.860> is<00:04:43.010> a<00:04:43.040> good<00:04:43.280> effect<00:04:43.580> and
