up but I wanted to get out here and get
some<00:00:42.180> footage<00:00:42.480> before<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.989> totally<00:00:43.350> lost<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
some footage before I totally lost the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.990 
some footage before I totally lost the
light<00:00:45.410> came<00:00:46.410> out<00:00:46.530> looking<00:00:46.829> pretty<00:00:47.399> good<00:00:47.730> a

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
light came out looking pretty good a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.760 
light came out looking pretty good a
little<00:00:48.270> better<00:00:48.539> than<00:00:48.750> my<00:00:48.870> previous<00:00:49.079> efforts<00:00:49.620> i

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
little better than my previous efforts i

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.270 
little better than my previous efforts i
think<00:00:50.039> because<00:00:50.280> after<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.500> stone<00:00:52.500> washed<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.100> I

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
think because after I stone washed it I

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.619 
think because after I stone washed it I
actually<00:00:54.920> polished<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.070> up<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.280> little<00:00:56.430> bit<00:00:56.629> and

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
actually polished it up a little bit and

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.840 
actually polished it up a little bit and
that<00:00:57.780> took<00:00:57.960> out<00:00:58.140> some<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.739> cloudiness<00:00:59.489> I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
that took out some of the cloudiness I

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.060 
that took out some of the cloudiness I
was<00:01:00.000> getting<00:01:00.300> sometimes<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.739> my<00:01:01.890> first

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
was getting sometimes and so my first

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.200 
was getting sometimes and so my first
few<00:01:02.340> tries<00:01:03.409> so<00:01:04.409> that's<00:01:05.250> pretty<00:01:05.430> cool<00:01:08.030> this<00:01:09.030> one

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
few tries so that's pretty cool this one

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.140 
few tries so that's pretty cool this one
didn't<00:01:09.479> come<00:01:09.630> out<00:01:09.659> perfectly<00:01:10.530> centered<00:01:11.150> which

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
didn't come out perfectly centered which

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.940 
didn't come out perfectly centered which
bugs<00:01:12.420> me<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> little<00:01:12.750> bit<00:01:13.080> but<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.680> not

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
bugs me a little bit but it's not

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
bugs me a little bit but it's not
touching<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.430> liner<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.420> okay<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> is

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
touching the liner so it's okay so is

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.460 
touching the liner so it's okay so is
that<00:01:18.830> also<00:01:19.830> Stone<00:01:20.220> wash<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:21.320> really<00:01:22.320> like

this knife this is my sanremo 939 xtb

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.030 
this knife this is my sanremo 939 xtb
4939<00:01:30.630> which<00:01:30.990> signifies<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.770> has<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
4939 which signifies that it has the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.340 
4939 which signifies that it has the
black<00:01:32.189> coating<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.840> took<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.020> apart

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
black coating on it and I took it apart

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.140 
black coating on it and I took it apart
and<00:01:34.470> stone<00:01:34.740> wash<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.220> whole<00:01:35.369> thing<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:35.909> now<00:01:36.060> it

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
and stone wash the whole thing so now it

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.940 
and stone wash the whole thing so now it
has<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.540> stone<00:01:36.840> washed<00:01:37.079> gray<00:01:37.380> coding<00:01:37.619> which

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
has this stone washed gray coding which

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.530 
has this stone washed gray coding which
I<00:01:38.100> think<00:01:38.340> looks<00:01:38.400> awesome

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.390 

a<00:01:43.660> little<00:01:44.200> sort<00:01:44.380> of<00:01:44.440> highlights<00:01:44.890> at<00:01:45.190> all<00:01:45.280> the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
a little sort of highlights at all the

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.190 
a little sort of highlights at all the
corners<00:01:45.790> where<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.210> stones<00:01:46.450> hit<00:01:46.690> more<00:01:46.870> often

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
corners where the stones hit more often

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.690 
corners where the stones hit more often
I<00:01:49.200> think<00:01:50.200> they<00:01:50.260> just<00:01:50.410> look<00:01:50.590> much<00:01:51.040> cooler<00:01:51.430> like

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
I think they just look much cooler like

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.980 
I think they just look much cooler like
that<00:01:51.910> and<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.950> little<00:01:54.220> guy<00:01:54.340> here<00:01:55.230> this<00:01:56.230> is<00:01:56.470> a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
bokor pocket Bowie I actually got this

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.360 
bokor pocket Bowie I actually got this
quite<00:02:01.030> a<00:02:01.060> while<00:02:01.270> ago<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:02.050> it's<00:02:02.920> been<00:02:03.010> kind<00:02:03.310> of

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
quite a while ago and it's been kind of

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.830 
quite a while ago and it's been kind of
sitting<00:02:03.580> around<00:02:03.729> because<00:02:04.360> I<00:02:04.420> had<00:02:04.630> some

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
sitting around because I had some

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.090 
sitting around because I had some
problems<00:02:05.320> with<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.890> factory<00:02:06.280> kydex<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:08.100> i'm

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
problems with the factory kydex and i'm

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.889 
problems with the factory kydex and i'm
working<00:02:09.460> on<00:02:09.490> a<00:02:09.550> review<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:10.000> this<00:02:10.090> but<00:02:10.509> I<00:02:10.690> just

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
working on a review of this but I just

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.360 
working on a review of this but I just
didn't<00:02:11.110> get<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.260> carrying<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:11.800> often<00:02:12.100> because

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
didn't get the carrying it often because

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.640 
didn't get the carrying it often because
that<00:02:13.210> sheath<00:02:13.510> wasn't<00:02:13.870> working<00:02:14.110> for<00:02:14.140> me<00:02:14.350> at<00:02:14.530> all

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
that sheath wasn't working for me at all

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.949 
that sheath wasn't working for me at all
but<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.370> finally<00:02:15.700> got<00:02:15.790> around<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.180> finishing<00:02:16.330> up

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
but I finally got around to finishing up

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.480 
but I finally got around to finishing up
my<00:02:17.200> own<00:02:17.320> kydex<00:02:17.709> for<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:20.070> pretty<00:02:21.070> happy

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
my own kydex for it and pretty happy

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.590 
my own kydex for it and pretty happy
with<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.700> way<00:02:21.820> that<00:02:21.940> turned<00:02:22.240> out<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:25.000> doesn't

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600
