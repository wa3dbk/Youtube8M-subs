00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
the safe zone this case will use premium

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.540 
the safe zone this case will use premium
cards<00:02:22.530> net

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.580 

and<00:02:25.970> we'll<00:02:26.090> place<00:02:26.300> it<00:02:26.330> about<00:02:27.110> another<00:02:27.380> eighth

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
and we'll place it about another eighth

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.970 
and we'll place it about another eighth
of<00:02:27.890> an<00:02:28.010> inch<00:02:28.130> away<00:02:28.370> from<00:02:28.520> that<00:02:28.730> actual<00:02:29.980> safe

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
of an inch away from that actual safe

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.059 
of an inch away from that actual safe
zone<00:02:31.300> area

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
zone area

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.530 
zone area
and<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.610> just<00:02:33.670> gives<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:33.939> a<00:02:34.030> better<00:02:34.120> balance

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
and it just gives it a better balance

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.869 
and it just gives it a better balance
