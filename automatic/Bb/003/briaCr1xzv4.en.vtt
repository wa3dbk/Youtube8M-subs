streams<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.489> arachnid<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:37.170> decided<00:00:37.500> to

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
streams and arachnid and I decided to

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.280 
streams and arachnid and I decided to
kind<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.010> go<00:00:38.219> with<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.520> idea<00:00:38.879> but<00:00:39.239> extend<00:00:40.140> it

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
kind of go with that idea but extend it

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.510 
kind of go with that idea but extend it
a<00:00:40.320> little<00:00:40.379> bit<00:00:40.590> more<00:00:40.710> further<00:00:41.010> because<00:00:41.340> I

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
a little bit more further because I

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.810 
a little bit more further because I
don't<00:00:41.879> want<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.450> really<00:00:42.719> copy<00:00:43.320> anyone<00:00:43.789> so<00:00:44.789> I

so as you can see I used two different
I'll<00:02:16.099> actually<00:02:16.280> choose<00:02:17.060> spider<00:02:17.390> limbs<00:02:17.719> two

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
I'll actually choose spider limbs two

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.649 
I'll actually choose spider limbs two
sets<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:18.980> spider<00:02:19.250> limbs<00:02:19.489> because<00:02:20.120> arachnid

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
sets of spider limbs because arachnid

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.289 
sets of spider limbs because arachnid
comes<00:02:20.840> with<00:02:20.989> three<00:02:21.260> sets<00:02:21.500> which<00:02:21.849> is<00:02:22.849> sort<00:02:23.239> of

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
comes with three sets which is sort of

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.390 
comes with three sets which is sort of
limited<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:24.079> a<00:02:24.530> lot<00:02:24.650> of<00:02:24.739> people<00:02:24.920> were<00:02:25.010> kind<00:02:25.280> of

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
limited and a lot of people were kind of

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.099 
limited and a lot of people were kind of
unhappy<00:02:26.000> with<00:02:26.390> that<00:02:26.599> particular<00:02:26.840> idea

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.109 
unhappy with that particular idea

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.160 
unhappy with that particular idea

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
eight because of the micron but normally

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.830 
eight because of the micron but normally
she<00:02:39.889> has<00:02:39.980> six<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.969> I<00:02:41.060> guess<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.420> other<00:02:41.569> two

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
she has six and I guess the other two

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.330 
she has six and I guess the other two
counts<00:02:42.379> for<00:02:42.590> our<00:02:42.709> arms<00:02:43.099> or<00:02:43.250> legs<00:02:43.670> or<00:02:43.939> whichever

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
counts for our arms or legs or whichever

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.720 
counts for our arms or legs or whichever
and<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:47.269> used<00:02:47.590> Tara<00:02:48.590> dives<00:02:48.829> Trident<00:02:49.489> or<00:02:49.700> a

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
and I used Tara dives Trident or a

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.819 
and I used Tara dives Trident or a
pitchfork<00:02:52.510> which<00:02:53.510> is<00:02:53.629> this<00:02:53.810> deadly<00:02:54.439> weapon

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
pitchfork which is this deadly weapon

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.899 
pitchfork which is this deadly weapon
here<00:02:55.129> and<00:02:56.349> what<00:02:57.349> else<00:02:57.560> I<00:02:57.950> think<00:02:58.400> that's<00:02:58.730> just

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
here and what else I think that's just

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.909 
here and what else I think that's just
about<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.269> but<00:02:59.629> there's<00:03:00.260> more<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.769> this

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:00.919 
about it but there's more to this

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.539 
about it but there's more to this
because<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.400> had<00:03:01.519> to<00:03:01.579> do<00:03:01.730> some<00:03:02.180> extensive

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
because I had to do some extensive

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.740 
because I had to do some extensive
modification<00:03:04.549> to<00:03:04.730> this<00:03:04.879> such<00:03:05.090> as<00:03:05.299> heating<00:03:05.569> up

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
modification to this such as heating up

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.940 
modification to this such as heating up
the<00:03:05.870> parts<00:03:06.579> so<00:03:07.629> when<00:03:08.629> it<00:03:08.720> transforms<00:03:09.500> into<00:03:09.709> her

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
the parts so when it transforms into her

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.250 
the parts so when it transforms into her
jet<00:03:10.220> mode<00:03:10.459> I<00:03:10.700> had<00:03:11.299> to<00:03:11.389> heat<00:03:11.569> up<00:03:11.599> the<00:03:11.780> parts<00:03:12.079> so

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
jet mode I had to heat up the parts so

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.780 
jet mode I had to heat up the parts so
they<00:03:12.379> can<00:03:12.530> all<00:03:12.650> warp<00:03:13.010> together<00:03:13.370> and<00:03:13.579> fit

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
they can all warp together and fit

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.809 
they can all warp together and fit
properly<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.329> this<00:03:14.930> is<00:03:15.169> not<00:03:15.440> as<00:03:15.739> easy<00:03:16.519> as<00:03:16.699> it

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
properly and this is not as easy as it

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.879 
properly and this is not as easy as it
looks<00:03:17.229> so<00:03:18.459> you<00:03:19.459> can<00:03:19.609> go<00:03:19.669> in<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:19.909> try<00:03:20.090> this<00:03:20.150> but

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
looks so you can go in and try this but

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.369 
looks so you can go in and try this but
you<00:03:22.150> I'm<00:03:23.150> give<00:03:23.359> you<00:03:23.419> a<00:03:23.449> heads<00:03:23.599> up<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:23.959> may<00:03:24.169> not

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379

such as the head laying improperly on

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.680 
such as the head laying improperly on
the<00:03:30.590> chassis<00:03:30.829> I<00:03:31.250> had<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:31.849> do<00:03:32.000> some<00:03:32.209> cutting<00:03:32.479> and

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
the chassis I had to do some cutting and

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.580 
the chassis I had to do some cutting and
filing<00:03:33.139> it<00:03:33.519> excuse<00:03:34.519> me<00:03:35.199> sir<00:03:36.199> her<00:03:36.290> head<00:03:36.440> can

filing it excuse me sir her head can

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.930 
filing it excuse me sir her head can
actually<00:03:36.859> lay<00:03:37.370> on<00:03:37.639> the<00:03:38.979> the<00:03:39.979> chassis<00:03:40.400> properly

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
actually lay on the the chassis properly

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.050 
actually lay on the the chassis properly
and<00:03:41.150> the<00:03:41.690> jet<00:03:41.900> boat<00:03:42.190> so<00:03:43.190> let's<00:03:43.370> take<00:03:43.609> this<00:03:43.790> off

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
and the jet boat so let's take this off

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.449 
and the jet boat so let's take this off
here<00:03:45.040> show<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.099> her<00:03:46.489> back<00:03:47.859> this<00:03:48.859> here<00:03:49.310> is

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
here show you her back this here is

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.659 
here show you her back this here is
actually<00:03:50.199> sculpted<00:03:51.199> parts<00:03:51.979> that<00:03:52.159> I<00:03:52.190> added<00:03:52.430> on

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:52.669 
actually sculpted parts that I added on

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:56.710 
actually sculpted parts that I added on
to<00:03:52.940> this<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.680> make<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.859> design<00:03:55.159> more<00:03:55.720> wicked

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
to this to make the design more wicked

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.039 
to this to make the design more wicked
and<00:03:56.870> evil<00:03:56.959> I<00:03:57.260> guess

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
and evil I guess

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:10.110 
and evil I guess
so<00:04:00.049> side<00:04:02.049> arm<00:04:03.049> down

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.970 

carefully<00:04:11.120> rotate<00:04:11.660> this<00:04:11.870> because<00:04:12.260> she's<00:04:12.770> on<00:04:12.950> a

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
carefully rotate this because she's on a

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.070 
carefully rotate this because she's on a
stand<00:04:13.760> because<00:04:14.090> she<00:04:14.270> does<00:04:14.480> have<00:04:14.630> bad<00:04:14.870> cable

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
stand because she does have bad cable

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.070 
stand because she does have bad cable
because<00:04:15.470> of<00:04:15.590> this<00:04:15.650> project<00:04:16.160> and<00:04:19.930> I'm<00:04:20.930> gonna

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
because of this project and I'm gonna

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:28.000 
because of this project and I'm gonna
pull<00:04:21.680> this<00:04:21.920> out<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:26.170> she<00:04:27.170> does<00:04:27.350> stand<00:04:27.650> pretty

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
pull this out and she does stand pretty

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.130 
pull this out and she does stand pretty
good<00:04:28.220> but<00:04:28.580> she<00:04:28.730> still<00:04:28.940> needs<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.300> base<00:04:29.480> to

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
good but she still needs the base to

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.750 
good but she still needs the base to
support<00:04:31.120> black<00:04:32.120> little<00:04:32.510> symbol<00:04:32.840> in<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.050> back

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.250 
sculpt them out and shape them and once
it<00:05:10.610> dries<00:05:10.850> you<00:05:11.120> got<00:05:11.270> to<00:05:11.360> go<00:05:11.450> back<00:05:11.600> and<00:05:11.810> manicure

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
it dries you got to go back and manicure

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.920 
it dries you got to go back and manicure
them<00:05:12.440> sand<00:05:12.770> them<00:05:12.950> and<00:05:13.100> shape<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.330> or

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
them sand them and shape the or

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.980 
them sand them and shape the or
compensate<00:05:15.500> for<00:05:15.620> the<00:05:15.710> contour<00:05:16.780> which<00:05:17.780> is<00:05:17.930> the

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
compensate for the contour which is the

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.990 
compensate for the contour which is the
shape<00:05:18.200> of<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.410> legs<00:05:18.590> to<00:05:18.919> give<00:05:19.520> it<00:05:19.610> back<00:05:19.760> its

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
shape of the legs to give it back its

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.390 
shape of the legs to give it back its
original<00:05:20.390> design<00:05:20.750> and<00:05:21.260> that's<00:05:22.010> what<00:05:22.160> I<00:05:22.190> did

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
original design and that's what I did

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.200 
original design and that's what I did
there's<00:05:23.180> still<00:05:23.450> some<00:05:23.750> well<00:05:24.080> there's<00:05:24.350> slight

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
there's still some well there's slight

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.030 
there's still some well there's slight
limitation<00:05:26.210> but<00:05:26.390> it's<00:05:26.570> okay<00:05:26.960> it's<00:05:27.500> just<00:05:27.620> for

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
limitation but it's okay it's just for

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.600 
limitation but it's okay it's just for
looks<00:05:28.250> only<00:05:28.430> this<00:05:28.820> is<00:05:28.970> not<00:05:29.300> a<00:05:29.330> toy<00:05:29.720> you<00:05:30.610> can

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
looks only this is not a toy you can

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.290 
looks only this is not a toy you can
still<00:05:31.850> add<00:05:32.060> extra<00:05:32.600> micron<00:05:33.520> guys<00:05:34.520> on<00:05:34.820> this<00:05:35.030> too

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
still add extra micron guys on this too

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.130 
still add extra micron guys on this too
and<00:05:35.510> these<00:05:36.380> do<00:05:36.620> unplug<00:05:37.600> so<00:05:38.600> you<00:05:38.690> can<00:05:38.810> plug<00:05:38.960> them

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
and these do unplug so you can plug them

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.290 
and these do unplug so you can plug them
on<00:05:39.260> to<00:05:39.470> other<00:05:40.400> figures<00:05:41.360> if<00:05:41.540> you<00:05:41.630> want<00:05:43.090> and<00:05:44.090> so

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
on to other figures if you want and so

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:53.110 
on to other figures if you want and so
on<00:05:45.850> and<00:05:48.040> I'll<00:05:49.040> go<00:05:49.400> pull<00:05:49.700> this<00:05:49.940> off<00:05:50.210> anyway<00:05:52.120> just

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
on and I'll go pull this off anyway just

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.450 
on and I'll go pull this off anyway just
kind<00:05:53.390> of<00:05:53.450> twist<00:05:54.020> this<00:05:54.260> from<00:05:54.470> side<00:05:54.740> to<00:05:54.770> side<00:05:54.919> or

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
kind of twist this from side to side or

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:01.749 
kind of twist this from side to side or
rotate<00:05:55.820> it

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:04.290 

okay

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
okay

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.369 
okay
set<00:06:05.300> this<00:06:05.479> down<00:06:05.539> for<00:06:05.960> a<00:06:05.990> little<00:06:06.080> bit<00:06:08.169> put<00:06:09.169> her

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:09.379 
set this down for a little bit put her

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:12.580 
set this down for a little bit put her
back<00:06:09.650> here<00:06:10.120> since<00:06:11.120> this<00:06:11.300> is<00:06:11.360> her<00:06:11.750> drone

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
back here since this is her drone

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.779 
back here since this is her drone
because<00:06:13.430> this<00:06:13.639> is<00:06:13.759> what<00:06:13.909> this<00:06:14.030> is<00:06:14.090> or<00:06:14.979> it<00:06:15.979> could

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
because this is what this is or it could

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:23.950 
because this is what this is or it could
have<00:06:16.819> a<00:06:16.940> spark<00:06:17.300> of<00:06:17.360> its<00:06:17.509> own<00:06:17.659> as<00:06:17.810> well<00:06:22.599> I'm<00:06:23.599> not

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
have a spark of its own as well I'm not

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.070 
have a spark of its own as well I'm not
sure<00:06:24.020> if<00:06:24.259> this<00:06:24.379> is<00:06:24.470> no<00:06:24.560> fit<00:06:24.830> on<00:06:25.009> camera<00:06:25.960> do<00:06:26.960> it

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
sure if this is no fit on camera do it

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:33.850 
sure if this is no fit on camera do it
this<00:06:27.199> way<00:06:29.889> so<00:06:30.889> yeah<00:06:31.870> I'm<00:06:32.870> not<00:06:32.930> gonna<00:06:33.379> transform

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
this way so yeah I'm not gonna transform

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.510 
this way so yeah I'm not gonna transform
this<00:06:34.129> because<00:06:34.810> it's<00:06:35.810> yeah<00:06:36.469> I<00:06:36.500> could<00:06:37.009> transform

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
this because it's yeah I could transform

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.760 
this because it's yeah I could transform
it<00:06:37.610> but<00:06:37.729> I'm<00:06:37.849> not<00:06:38.030> because<00:06:38.509> I'm<00:06:39.469> not<00:06:39.620> gonna

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
it but I'm not because I'm not gonna

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.350 
it but I'm not because I'm not gonna
take<00:06:39.949> the<00:06:40.039> risk<00:06:40.219> of<00:06:40.460> scuffing<00:06:41.030> the<00:06:41.120> paint

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
take the risk of scuffing the paint

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.369 
take the risk of scuffing the paint
anything<00:06:41.990> like<00:06:42.169> that<00:06:42.199> I<00:06:43.419> did<00:06:44.419> spray<00:06:44.930> protect

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:45.379 
anything like that I did spray protect

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:46.809 
anything like that I did spray protect
your<00:06:45.500> coat<00:06:45.620> on<00:06:45.650> this<00:06:45.949> and<00:06:46.190> most<00:06:46.340> likely<00:06:46.580> the

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:46.819 
your coat on this and most likely the

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:49.119 
your coat on this and most likely the
paint<00:06:47.030> will<00:06:47.240> not<00:06:47.449> flake<00:06:47.960> off<00:06:48.229> as<00:06:48.409> I<00:06:48.500> transform

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:49.129 
paint will not flake off as I transform

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:53.020 
paint will not flake off as I transform
it<00:06:49.280> but<00:06:49.719> the<00:06:50.719> transformation<00:06:51.139> procedure<00:06:52.030> is

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
it but the transformation procedure is

00:06:53.030 --> 00:07:05.409 
it but the transformation procedure is
just<00:06:53.090> too<00:06:53.719> long<00:07:03.250> so<00:07:04.250> I<00:07:04.280> think<00:07:04.789> that<00:07:04.940> wraps<00:07:05.210> it

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:05.419 
just too long so I think that wraps it

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:07.540 
just too long so I think that wraps it
up<00:07:05.569> this<00:07:05.719> is<00:07:05.870> just<00:07:06.080> a<00:07:06.169> quick<00:07:06.530> video<00:07:06.860> review<00:07:07.340> and

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
up this is just a quick video review and

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.040 
up this is just a quick video review and
this<00:07:08.479> is<00:07:08.690> going<00:07:08.990> out<00:07:09.139> to<00:07:09.199> date<00:07:09.529> because<00:07:09.800> I<00:07:11.050> sold

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.050 
this is going out to date because I sold

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.769 
this is going out to date because I sold
it<00:07:12.289> and<00:07:12.610> I<00:07:13.610> was<00:07:13.969> hoping<00:07:14.270> for<00:07:14.360> some<00:07:14.659> more

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:14.779 
it and I was hoping for some more

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:18.100 
it and I was hoping for some more
bidding<00:07:15.110> on<00:07:15.259> eBay<00:07:15.289> but<00:07:16.389> once<00:07:17.389> people<00:07:17.599> see<00:07:17.930> this

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110 
bidding on eBay but once people see this

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.450 
bidding on eBay but once people see this
they're<00:07:18.319> gonna<00:07:18.409> want<00:07:18.710> it<00:07:18.800> right<00:07:18.919> away<00:07:19.159> so<00:07:19.219> I

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:19.460 
they're gonna want it right away so I

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.839 
they're gonna want it right away so I
just<00:07:19.849> went<00:07:20.120> ahead<00:07:20.210> and<00:07:20.360> made<00:07:20.870> an<00:07:20.990> offer<00:07:21.849> so

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:22.849 
just went ahead and made an offer so

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:24.540 
just went ahead and made an offer so
