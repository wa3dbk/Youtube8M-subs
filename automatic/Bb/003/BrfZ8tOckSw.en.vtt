00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.840
 relevant on your twitter is also another 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.909
 thing if you have material with 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.040

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.840
 Accept the content is the way 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.979
 What can you send then? 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.140
 basically the following you have a 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.970
 cool content you imagine as video 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.380
 the new long content section will not 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.390
 present none 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.040
 the show name to present excerpts from 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.560
 interesting things can be a bit 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.659
 of a game 1 you killing a champion 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.390

 Interesting. I find it interesting. 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.010
 also the barrel to present these 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.709
 bizarre things and it appears on the internet 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.070
 also with more interactivity with you 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.360

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.420
 technology also attended several 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.340
 things from here today are also doing 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.470
 technology have become part of 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.209

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.330
 do you think that will stay cool is it that 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.340
 so the strip will continue 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.230

 happened to have reviewed movies and 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.430
 because many people say that they do not 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.220

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.750
