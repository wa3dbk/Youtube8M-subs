the<00:02:37.200> characters<00:02:38.400> probably<00:02:39.400> could<00:02:39.610> have<00:02:39.670> been

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
the characters probably could have been

but the action sequences were pretty

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.870 
but the action sequences were pretty
decent<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.620> way<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:44.860> dragons<00:02:45.430> were<00:02:45.490> flying

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
decent the way the dragons were flying

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.260 
decent the way the dragons were flying
around<00:02:46.300> I<00:02:46.770> mean<00:02:47.770> it<00:02:48.640> really<00:02:48.820> kept<00:02:49.150> my

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
around I mean it really kept my

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.840 
around I mean it really kept my
attention<00:02:49.390> for<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.930> most<00:02:50.140> part<00:02:50.410> I<00:02:50.740> just<00:02:51.640> felt

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
attention for the most part I just felt

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.460 
attention for the most part I just felt
that<00:02:51.940> they<00:02:52.060> went<00:02:52.240> a<00:02:52.300> little<00:02:52.540> too<00:02:52.690> heavy<00:02:53.050> on<00:02:53.200> the

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
that they went a little too heavy on the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.150 
that they went a little too heavy on the
adult<00:02:53.800> stuff<00:02:54.160> between<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.640> dad<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.150> son

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
adult stuff between the dad and the son

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.290 
adult stuff between the dad and the son
