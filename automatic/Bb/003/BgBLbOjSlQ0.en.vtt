00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.750
 good people today I bring you 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.059
 a different video an informative by 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.430
 say it many people have been me 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.099
 asking if there is the 3ds emulator 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.379
 and if it works and like many people 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.589
 they asked that I decided to answer them 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.829
 with this video there is the 3ds emulator 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:25.230
 if people exist the emulator but this 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.729
 still in creation I do not recommend 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.859
 download it from the videos of 

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:30.779
 youtube since there they put links with virus 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.670
 therefore I recommend that you 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.770
 download from the official website of 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.350
 wings but where are the last 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.150
 updates of this emulator but what 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.820
 bad thing about this is that you can not play 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.160
 no game so far the emulator is 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.110
 so to speak an alpha version but 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.840
 I'm going to tell you that the beta phase of 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.670
 emulator would leave mid-2015 its 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.220
 final version is calculated to be 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.490
 end of 2015 although it may be that 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.710
 also be at the beginning of 2016 another 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.870
 thing to say is that in many videos 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.060
 they say that this emulator can only be 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.519
 use if you have a super mega gamer pc 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.620
 powerful but with an intermediate pc I would 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.260
 can run in my case I could 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.270
 but the low quality computers do not 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.370
 could run it since there would be many 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.680
 errors in the emulator with a lot of like 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.750
 which, so to speak, can damage your pc 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.880
 but this happens with PCs that do not 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.460
 They have graphic card to run game 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.130
 at least normal just that since I do not know 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.410
 how to express myself well with this theme 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.540
 another side this emulator is going to be had 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.910
 to be updated every month like this 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.740
 correct several errors and finally 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.490
 calculates that its final version reaches 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.170
 weigh almost 4 or 5 gigabytes on the other hand 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.540
 are the rooms that would be the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.850
 video games good first of all the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.710
 3ds games are calculated that 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.960
 they work although they may have 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.210
 many bugs can currently be 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.970
 find the pokemon x and the breaks 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.940
 legend of zelda ocarina of time 3d super 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.100
 mario 3d land etcetera what if 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.470
 games take too long to convert 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.570
 in addition rooms they can weigh much 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.580
 that is also advisable to have a lot 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.770
 memory to avoid errors with the 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.619
 downloads and that your pc does not walk so 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.840
 slow the last thing I'm going to say this 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.580
 message is that they do not download emulator 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.500
 buy the console such 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.540
 they do not have much money but based on 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.430
 savings can come to buy it the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.050
 experience in a console is very 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.030
 different from playing in an emulator 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.580
 which does not allow you online mode 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.680
 I'm just saying that not everything has to be 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.170
 piracy if you do not have money 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.290
 well download the emulator but it's 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.180
 very different from playing in a console 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.790
 well before I leave I want to thank 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.920
 rays 14 for doing promotion in one of 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.080
 your videos I will leave your channel in the 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.480
 description also below I leave you the 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.670
 Emulator link does not work but is 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.010
 I leave them also because it has an emulator 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.780
 of all the consoles so I'll come back 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.540
 to say the emulator is not going to work 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.580
 is in alpha phase so I do not want 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.800
 complaints of anything on the other hand I hope that 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.850
 This information has been served online 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.040
 it costs nothing 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.290
 also share it so that much more 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.750
 people find out about this do not do 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.030
 cases to other links except those of 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.820
 the official wins page but where 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.320
 is the 3 mod good now yes no 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.320
 more nothing to say goodbye
