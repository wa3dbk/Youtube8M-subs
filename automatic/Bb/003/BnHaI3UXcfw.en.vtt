another<00:00:16.199> location<00:00:16.500> but<00:00:17.460> this<00:00:17.640> for<00:00:17.850> our<00:00:17.970> car

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
another location but this for our car

00:00:18.210 --> 00:01:33.039 
another location but this for our car
this<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> nice<00:00:18.810> spot<00:00:34.760> here's<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.910> inside

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.060 

just<00:01:34.049> make<00:01:34.170> sure<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.440> tucks<00:01:34.680> out<00:01:34.830> of<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.950> way

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
just make sure that tucks out of the way

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.440 
just make sure that tucks out of the way
so<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.340> doesn't<00:01:35.369> interfere<00:01:35.580> with<00:01:35.850> any<00:01:35.970> linkage

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
so it doesn't interfere with any linkage

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.030 
so it doesn't interfere with any linkage
or<00:01:36.659> any<00:01:36.780> electrical<00:01:37.200> items<00:01:37.590> or<00:01:37.710> anything<00:01:37.830> like

or any electrical items or anything like

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.850 
or any electrical items or anything like
that<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.490> everything<00:01:39.030> should<00:01:39.150> be<00:01:39.210> good<00:01:39.860> now

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
that and everything should be good now

the<00:01:42.270> vacuum<00:01:42.570> lines<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.990> went<00:01:43.200> ahead<00:01:43.290> and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
the vacuum lines I went ahead and

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.140 
the vacuum lines I went ahead and
replace<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:44.040> vacuum<00:01:44.190> advanced<00:01:44.610> line<00:01:44.909> because

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
replace the vacuum advanced line because

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.880 
replace the vacuum advanced line because
the<00:01:45.240> old<00:01:45.390> line<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.630> pretty<00:01:45.840> cracked<00:01:46.080> and<00:01:46.350> we're

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
the old line is pretty cracked and we're

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.080 
the old line is pretty cracked and we're
just<00:01:47.040> asking<00:01:47.250> for<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.430> vacuum<00:01:47.759> leak<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:48.000> we

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
just asking for a vacuum leak if we

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.010 
just asking for a vacuum leak if we
don't<00:01:50.240> now<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.390> particular<00:01:51.659> vacuum

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
don't now this particular vacuum

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.530 
don't now this particular vacuum
advanced<00:01:52.440> uses<00:01:53.040> ported<00:01:53.729> or<00:01:53.880> they<00:01:54.030> call<00:01:54.149> timed

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
vacuum and the way we can tell that

under carburetor is if you're looking at

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.080 
under carburetor is if you're looking at
the<00:01:58.380> ports<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.860> front<00:01:58.890> one<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.850> slightly

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
the ports on the front one is slightly

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
higher than the other if you look at

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.529 
higher than the other if you look at
this<00:02:01.979> one<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> little<00:02:02.490> bit<00:02:02.580> lower<00:02:02.790> this

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
this one it's a little bit lower this

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.080 
this one it's a little bit lower this
one's<00:02:03.750> slightly<00:02:03.810> higher<00:02:04.289> on<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.619> carburetor

we're<00:02:06.090> going<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.270> use<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.479> one<00:02:06.600> that's

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
we're going to use the one that's

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.359 
we're going to use the one that's
slightly<00:02:06.810> higher<00:02:07.259> because<00:02:07.710> that's<00:02:07.979> above<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
slightly higher because that's above the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.219 
slightly higher because that's above the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
they call timed vacuum the other one

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.120 
they call timed vacuum the other one
we're<00:02:16.080> not<00:02:16.110> going<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.350> use<00:02:16.650> now<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:16.980> is

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
we're not going to use now this is

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.150 
we're not going to use now this is

electric choke so we're going to take

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.199 
electric choke so we're going to take
one<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.440> vacuum<00:02:41.010> line<00:02:41.190> plugs<00:02:41.549> we're<00:02:42.090> just

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
one of the vacuum line plugs we're just

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.310 
one of the vacuum line plugs we're just
going<00:02:42.329> to<00:02:42.360> plug<00:02:42.570> that<00:02:42.600> one<00:02:42.930> off<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:45.269> then<00:02:46.230> we

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
going to plug that one off and then we

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.780 
going to plug that one off and then we
have<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.530> PCV<00:02:46.860> port<00:02:47.250> right<00:02:47.430> here<00:02:47.459> so<00:02:47.700> I'm<00:02:47.760> just

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
have the PCV port right here so I'm just

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.720 
have the PCV port right here so I'm just
going<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.060> plug<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.299> PCV<00:02:48.690> line<00:02:48.720> in<00:02:49.730> we're

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
going to plug the PCV line in we're

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
going to plug the PCV line in we're
going<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:50.880> reuse<00:02:51.030> this<00:02:51.329> line<00:02:51.540> right<00:02:51.690> here

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
going to reuse this line right here

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.410 
going to reuse this line right here
because<00:02:51.989> it's<00:02:52.140> fairly<00:02:52.290> new

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420
