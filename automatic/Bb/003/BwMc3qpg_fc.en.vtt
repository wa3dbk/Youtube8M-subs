one of the categories let's say you say
smart<00:01:20.979> all<00:01:21.220> right<00:01:21.369> then<00:01:22.360> they're<00:01:23.140> going<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.470> do

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
smart all right then they're going to do

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.380 
smart all right then they're going to do
the<00:01:23.890> first<00:01:24.130> challenge<00:01:24.460> card<00:01:24.910> your<00:01:25.270> opponent

the first challenge card your opponent
the<00:01:26.170> opposing<00:01:26.619> team<00:01:26.770> will<00:01:27.400> draw<00:01:27.790> the<00:01:27.850> card<00:01:28.330> so

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
the opposing team will draw the card so

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.010

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
for example this one here is weird Simon

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.800 
for example this one here is weird Simon
so<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:33.280> challenge<00:01:33.550> here<00:01:33.910> is<00:01:33.940> everyone<00:01:34.600> takes

so the challenge here is everyone takes
part<00:01:35.050> in<00:01:35.080> this<00:01:35.170> game<00:01:35.380> you<00:01:35.560> start<00:01:35.800> the<00:01:35.979> game<00:01:36.009> so

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
part in this game you start the game so

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.190 
part in this game you start the game so
you're<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.729> you're<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.450> opponent<00:01:38.020> player

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
you're the you're the opponent player

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.050 
you're the you're the opponent player
and<00:01:38.560> so<00:01:38.830> you<00:01:38.890> make<00:01:39.070> a<00:01:39.100> weird<00:01:39.399> noise<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.880> player

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060

and so you make a weird noise the player
to<00:01:40.180> you<00:01:40.240> off<00:01:40.390> repeat<00:01:40.750> that<00:01:40.899> noise<00:01:41.080> and<00:01:41.110> adds<00:01:41.470> a

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.230 
to you off repeat that noise and adds a
new<00:01:41.710> noise<00:01:41.890> and<00:01:42.130> you<00:01:42.190> keep<00:01:42.340> going<00:01:42.640> around<00:01:42.759> and

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
new noise and you keep going around and

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.660 
new noise and you keep going around and
until<00:01:44.229> somebody<00:01:44.619> messes<00:01:45.009> up<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.250> sequence

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
until somebody messes up the sequence

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.670 
until somebody messes up the sequence
and<00:01:45.940> if<00:01:46.690> you<00:01:46.810> make<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.170> mistake<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:47.649> other

the you know you're moving through the
maze<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:31.870> then<00:03:31.960> you<00:03:32.080> say<00:03:32.290> left<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.220> right<00:03:33.430> and

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
maze and then you say left to right and

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.520 
maze and then you say left to right and
if<00:03:34.030> they<00:03:34.120> make<00:03:34.270> the<00:03:34.390> wrong<00:03:34.510> choice<00:03:34.810> they<00:03:35.290> lose

but they make it all the way to the

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.480 
but they make it all the way to the
treasure<00:03:36.940> they<00:03:37.720> win<00:03:38.080> so<00:03:38.770> the<00:03:38.890> luck<00:03:39.100> ones<00:03:39.310> are

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490

so you look at this picture and this

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.840 
so you look at this picture and this
will<00:04:01.690> have<00:04:01.810> a<00:04:01.840> time<00:04:02.200> limit<00:04:02.410> of<00:04:02.590> 30<00:04:02.800> seconds<00:04:03.370> for

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.170 
find it but that doesn't the point but
but<00:05:20.169> that's<00:05:20.290> an<00:05:20.440> interesting<00:05:20.800> idea<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.940> game

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
but that's an interesting idea the game

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.910 
but that's an interesting idea the game
is<00:05:22.360> kind<00:05:22.600> of<00:05:22.690> luck<00:05:22.990> it's<00:05:23.200> laughed

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
is kind of luck it's laughed

is kind of luck it's laughed
I<00:05:23.950> mean<00:05:24.250> I<00:05:24.490> don't<00:05:25.060> know<00:05:25.150> that<00:05:25.300> the<00:05:25.390> cards<00:05:25.690> that

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
I mean I don't know that the cards that

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.270 
I mean I don't know that the cards that
give<00:05:25.840> you<00:05:26.050> the<00:05:26.080> extra<00:05:26.380> metals<00:05:26.740> are<00:05:26.890> that<00:05:27.130> much

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
give you the extra metals are that much

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.160 
give you the extra metals are that much
harder<00:05:27.550> than<00:05:27.730> the<00:05:27.850> ones<00:05:28.030> that<00:05:28.270> don't<00:05:28.690> and

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
harder than the ones that don't and

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.840 
harder than the ones that don't and
those<00:05:29.440> extra<00:05:29.920> metals<00:05:30.250> probably<00:05:30.730> determine

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
those extra metals probably determine

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.090 
those extra metals probably determine
who<00:05:31.270> wins<00:05:31.480> but<00:05:31.840> it<00:05:32.560> is<00:05:32.680> kind<00:05:32.920> of<00:05:33.010> an

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
who wins but it is kind of an

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.290 
who wins but it is kind of an
