00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.889
 welcome to with ay 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.000
 here I bring you another video guys and in 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.680
 this video we are going to make a small 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.469
 review on new features 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.420
 that have been added on t1 9 in the 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.070
 ninth update plus some 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.990
 other things that I wanted to comment 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.580
 and they are quite curious the first 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.960
 of the options or functions that we are going to 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.279
 see that they are new and that many 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.519
 subscribers have you been asking 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.710
 for them they are the restart of putting the 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.230
 restart of the lower world I will tell you that 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.970
 this option is enabled through the 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.950
 selection of our worlds normally 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.020
 as you see here before loading our 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.969
 worlds we will have to go to more options and 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.039
 there we will enable the box that puts 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.960
 restore the lower world as you see 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.430
 and even minecraft does not indicate it anymore or 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.989
 less and the lower world is activated it 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.609
 will regenerate this is useful if you have a 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.800
 old saved game where it is not 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.690
 present the strength of the lower world 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.090
 This is one of the best for me 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.070
 options of the ninth update we 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.480
 a message will be sent to confirm if 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.010
 we want to restore the lower world 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.839
 just in case we have been wrong about 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.370
 world when we go back to the neder 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.960
 we will have all the available options 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.130
 as if he were a leader of the last 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.780
 update the truth that this is 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.340
 very well you already know for those worlds 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.170
 old ones where there were no fortresses 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.759
 and we could not do potions or 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.360
 get blaze bars in addition now 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.610
 you know what 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.110
 of blaze we need to go to what 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.360
 that would be the spear world so it's 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.310
 very important guys you look at these 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.770
 options for our ancient worlds 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.330
 in addition to this function of this new 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.950
 functionality that is already available in 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.200
 our ancient worlds that will come to us 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.190
 everything is great let's see another function 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.840
 yes he has also called me 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.220
 quite the attention especially for 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.820
 customize our minecraft air boss 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.930
 360 and that function is to give size 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.580
 customized to our hood either in 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.620
 single screen or split screen 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.479
 that's great and we're going to go 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.369
 configuration and in user interface 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.530
 besides they have also added a 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.509
 option to enable or disable 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.400
 what about the animated characters we can 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.470
 modify the qt in three sizes this 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.300
 would be the third or the largest and then 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.700
 the second would be the normal one of all the 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.009
 life to see how big it looks with this 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.869
 size and then the one size one would be the 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.520
 smaller than we are going to take a 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.060
 glance also looks a lot more 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.590
 small so small to the best then 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.270
 it would be more to see buildings and 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.950
 things so it would be more secondary the 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.690
 toolbar but hey I think 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.489
 that is pretty good that they have added 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.440
 this option and that each one choose what 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.060
 We want to go with more things that I wanted 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.200
 comment in this video you know if you already 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.750
 we talk about gravel 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.640
 texture which is now in 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.959
 pc but good I wanted to teach it in case 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.760
 some had not realized it looks 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.230
 clearly that the gravel is different 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.819
 another little thing that has also called me 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.920
 very much the attention is that finally 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.050
 our sheep eat the grass of what 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.550
 which is the earth to regenerate its wool 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.319
 you know that if we ski we wash 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.970
 re generated the wool I do not know why but 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.680
 at last they have fixed it and this would be 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.819
 all for this video guys apart from 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.530
 those new objects that we have already 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.150
 analyzed these new functions these 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.830
 new things do seem to me 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.030
 interesting to see so I hope that 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.980
