with<00:02:10.459> something<00:02:10.700> that's<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.150> better<00:02:11.420> number

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
with something that's a better number

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.960 
with something that's a better number
that<00:02:12.560> has<00:02:12.709> more<00:02:12.890> accuracy<00:02:13.310> they're<00:02:13.640> happy

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
that has more accuracy they're happy

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.240 
that has more accuracy they're happy
about<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.390> so<00:02:14.629> that's<00:02:15.290> what's<00:02:15.769> made<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:16.040> an

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
about it so that's what's made it an

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.160 
about it so that's what's made it an
easy<00:02:16.370> decision<00:02:16.519> for<00:02:16.940> us<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.239> use<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.720> 50<00:02:18.019> K

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
easy decision for us to use the 50 K

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.559 
easy decision for us to use the 50 K
test<00:02:18.409> we<00:02:19.069> have<00:02:19.250> been<00:02:19.430> performance<00:02:20.060> testing

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
test we have been performance testing

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.309 
test we have been performance testing
since<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:21.019> very<00:02:21.230> beginning<00:02:21.409> and<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.519> we<00:02:22.670> take

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
since the very beginning and and we take

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.750
