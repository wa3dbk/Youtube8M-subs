today we're going to talk about another
odd<00:00:28.529> time<00:00:29.400> signature<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.750> called<00:00:30.960> 58<00:00:31.940> 58

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
odd time signature and it's called 58 58

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.500 
odd time signature and it's called 58 58
that's<00:00:34.860> five<00:00:35.489> beats<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> measure<00:00:36.210> each

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
that's five beats in a measure each

eighth note receives one deep we count

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.000 
eighth note receives one deep we count

let's<00:01:41.009> play<00:01:41.189> something<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:43.850> all<00:01:44.850> drummers<00:01:45.329> I

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
let's play something so all drummers I

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.690 
let's play something so all drummers I
think<00:01:45.810> should<00:01:46.020> know<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.619> little<00:01:46.799> bit<00:01:47.130> about<00:01:47.430> odd

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
think should know a little bit about odd

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.340 
think should know a little bit about odd
time<00:01:48.030> signatures<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.689> it's<00:01:48.930> just<00:01:49.110> because

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
time signatures and it's just because

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.499 
time signatures and it's just because
we're<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.590> timekeepers<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.640> it's<00:01:51.180> almost

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
we're the timekeepers and it's almost

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.350 
we're the timekeepers and it's almost
our<00:01:51.689> duty<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.200> know<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.700> familiar<00:01:54.329> with

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
our duty to know and to be familiar with

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.920 
our duty to know and to be familiar with
odd<00:01:54.840> time<00:01:55.200> signatures<00:01:55.229> beyond<00:01:56.159> 4<00:01:56.460> 4<00:01:56.729> 6<00:01:57.149> 8<00:01:57.299> 12<00:01:57.630> 8

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
odd time signatures beyond 4 4 6 8 12 8

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.450 
odd time signatures beyond 4 4 6 8 12 8
and<00:01:58.350> all<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.159> even<00:01:59.520> number<00:01:59.840> signatures<00:02:00.840> so

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
and all the even number signatures so

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.200 
and all the even number signatures so
what<00:02:02.460> we're<00:02:02.579> going<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.759> do<00:02:02.880> we're<00:02:02.969> going<00:02:03.149> to

down a little bit so we got kick and hat
on<00:02:22.020> one<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.530> three<00:02:22.800> we<00:02:23.070> have<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.280> snare<00:02:23.520> on<00:02:23.550> to

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
on one and three we have to snare on to

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.390 
on one and three we have to snare on to
four<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.810> five<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.800> we're<00:02:25.890> going<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.070> count<00:02:26.280> it

four and five so we're going to count it

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:46.040 
four and five so we're going to count it
as<00:02:26.610> one<00:02:27.540> two<00:02:27.990> three<00:02:28.620> four<00:02:29.040> five<00:02:29.430> one<00:02:45.050> can't

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
like in seven what we can do there's

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.550 
like in seven what we can do there's
another<00:04:14.640> anomaly<00:04:14.970> that<00:04:15.240> we<00:04:15.510> have<00:04:15.660> 158<00:04:16.290> and

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
another anomaly that we have 158 and

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.229 
another anomaly that we have 158 and
that's<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.370> can<00:04:17.609> play<00:04:17.820> in<00:04:18.299> 4<00:04:19.260> 4<00:04:19.530> 4<00:04:19.890> over<00:04:20.280> 8<00:04:20.489> i'll

play a four four time signature over in
58<00:04:24.630> time<00:04:25.230> signatures<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:25.980> what's<00:04:26.130> going<00:04:26.310> to

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
58 time signatures and what's going to

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.090 
58 time signatures and what's going to
happen<00:04:26.700> is<00:04:26.820> I<00:04:26.970> can<00:04:27.360> play<00:04:27.510> for<00:04:27.780> four<00:04:28.070> five<00:04:29.070> times

and on the sixth time or the first time
if<00:04:33.150> you<00:04:33.300> think<00:04:33.510> about<00:04:33.570> it<00:04:33.750> it's<00:04:34.410> going<00:04:34.620> to<00:04:34.680> come

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
if you think about it it's going to come

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.800 
if you think about it it's going to come
back<00:04:35.040> on<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.340> downbeat<00:04:35.880> i'm<00:04:36.450> going<00:04:36.630> to<00:04:36.690> show

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
back on the downbeat i'm going to show

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.750 
back on the downbeat i'm going to show
you<00:04:36.840> this<00:04:37.110> again<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:37.770> it<00:04:38.040> worked<00:04:38.160> with<00:04:38.430> seven

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
you this again and it worked with seven

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.700 
you this again and it worked with seven
it<00:04:38.880> also<00:04:39.150> works<00:04:39.330> with<00:04:39.480> five<00:04:39.720> check<00:04:40.050> this<00:04:40.140> app

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.620 

once<00:04:43.710> I'm<00:04:43.830> 501<00:04:44.730> for<00:04:44.940> over<00:04:45.180> five

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:59.720 

show<00:04:49.970> 3<00:04:56.600> goes<00:04:57.600> it<00:04:57.780> down<00:04:57.960> deep<00:04:58.170> right<00:04:58.410> there<00:04:58.730> how

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
show 3 goes it down deep right there how

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.330 
show 3 goes it down deep right there how
about<00:04:59.880> 1605<00:05:00.780> I'm<00:05:01.590> going<00:05:01.770> to<00:05:01.830> place<00:05:01.950> to<00:05:02.130> take

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
about 1605 I'm going to place to take

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.490 
about 1605 I'm going to place to take
five<00:05:02.730> times<00:05:03.090> it's<00:05:03.720> going<00:05:03.930> to<00:05:03.960> land<00:05:04.170> on<00:05:04.350> the

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
five times it's going to land on the

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:19.250 
five times it's going to land on the
downbeat<00:05:04.770> on<00:05:05.160> the<00:05:05.490> sixth<00:05:06.270> time<00:05:17.630> so<00:05:18.630> that's<00:05:19.050> a

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
downbeat on the sixth time so that's a

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.830 
downbeat on the sixth time so that's a
one<00:05:19.800> of<00:05:19.890> those<00:05:20.040> really<00:05:20.490> weird<00:05:20.910> anomalies<00:05:21.630> uh

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
one of those really weird anomalies uh

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.620 
one of those really weird anomalies uh
that<00:05:22.710> you<00:05:22.890> have<00:05:23.040> in<00:05:23.220> music<00:05:23.610> and<00:05:23.760> I<00:05:23.820> think<00:05:24.510> it's

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
that you have in music and I think it's

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.970 
that you have in music and I think it's
interesting<00:05:24.900> you<00:05:25.260> might<00:05:25.380> think<00:05:25.560> it's<00:05:25.740> stupid

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
interesting you might think it's stupid

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.850 
interesting you might think it's stupid
or<00:05:26.220> boring<00:05:26.580> but<00:05:26.790> I<00:05:27.030> don't<00:05:27.570> anyway<00:05:28.110> so<00:05:28.650> we're<00:05:28.830> on

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
or boring but I don't anyway so we're on

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.700 
or boring but I don't anyway so we're on
these<00:05:29.130> five<00:05:29.430> eight<00:05:29.640> groups<00:05:29.970> and<00:05:30.240> go<00:05:31.080> over<00:05:31.530> to

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
these five eight groups and go over to

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.860 
these five eight groups and go over to
my<00:05:31.890> other<00:05:32.340> video<00:05:32.940> that<00:05:33.150> has<00:05:33.300> seven<00:05:33.750> eighths

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
my other video that has seven eighths

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.650 
my other video that has seven eighths
called<00:05:34.170> all<00:05:34.380> about<00:05:34.620> the<00:05:34.740> seven<00:05:35.100> and<00:05:35.510> maybe<00:05:36.510> you

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
called all about the seven and maybe you

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.990 
called all about the seven and maybe you
can<00:05:36.690> combine<00:05:36.990> it<00:05:37.290> you<00:05:37.380> can<00:05:37.560> actually<00:05:37.650> combine

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
can combine it you can actually combine

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.030 
can combine it you can actually combine
five<00:05:39.000> and<00:05:39.270> seven<00:05:39.600> or<00:05:39.750> seven<00:05:40.050> and<00:05:40.110> five<00:05:40.410> and<00:05:40.770> get

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
five and seven or seven and five and get

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.890 
five and seven or seven and five and get
a<00:05:41.070> full<00:05:41.310> 12<00:05:41.580> 8<00:05:41.760> measure<00:05:42.030> but<00:05:42.330> it<00:05:42.480> doesn't<00:05:42.780> sound

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
a full 12 8 measure but it doesn't sound

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:49.960 
a full 12 8 measure but it doesn't sound
like<00:05:43.050> 12<00:05:43.410> 8<00:05:43.560> so<00:05:44.100> what<00:05:44.280> sound<00:05:44.490> like<00:05:44.640> this<00:05:44.850> a

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.280 

normal<00:05:50.970> 12-8<00:05:51.570> measure<00:05:51.780> would<00:05:51.990> sound<00:05:52.170> like

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
normal 12-8 measure would sound like

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:59.870 
normal 12-8 measure would sound like
this<00:05:56.180> or<00:05:57.180> sticks<00:05:57.540> whatever<00:05:58.130> but<00:05:59.130> this<00:05:59.700> is<00:05:59.850> a

this or sticks whatever but this is a

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:14.280 
this or sticks whatever but this is a
12-8<00:06:00.360> that's<00:06:00.600> totally<00:06:00.950> freaking<00:06:01.950> weird
