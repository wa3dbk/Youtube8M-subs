00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
also one of the most odd it is a first

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.550 
also one of the most odd it is a first
shot<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:29.340> non<00:00:30.029> production<00:00:30.420> colors<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.260> happy

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
people of a rubber band around it

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.920 
people of a rubber band around it
because<00:00:34.200> it's<00:00:34.410> still<00:00:35.399> not<00:00:35.430> finalized<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.719> it

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
because it's still not finalized and it

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.790 
because it's still not finalized and it
will<00:00:37.469> fall<00:00:37.800> as<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:39.000> see<00:00:39.379> that<00:00:40.379> will<00:00:40.500> keep<00:00:40.649> it

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
will fall as you see that will keep it

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.000 
will fall as you see that will keep it
attached<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:42.660> egg<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.989> translucent

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
attached the egg is translucent

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.590 
attached the egg is translucent
I<00:00:44.160> think<00:00:44.550> Kenner<00:00:44.789> was<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.180> keep<00:00:45.420> it

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
I think Kenner was going to keep it

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.090 
I think Kenner was going to keep it
translucent<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:47.030> it<00:00:48.030> has<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> great<00:00:48.800> movie<00:00:49.800> type

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
translucent so it has a great movie type

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.250 
translucent so it has a great movie type
feel<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.120> look<00:00:51.270> into<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.629> eggs<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.199> see

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
feel like we look into the eggs and see

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.799 
feel like we look into the eggs and see
the<00:00:52.379> facehuggers<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:55.260> egg<00:00:55.739> itself<00:00:56.550> Falls<00:00:57.480> the

pieces and I swear in a comic that I saw

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.999 
pieces and I swear in a comic that I saw
that<00:01:33.299> might<00:01:33.479> have<00:01:33.570> been<00:01:33.659> unproduced<00:01:34.229> at<00:01:34.829> least

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
that might have been unproduced at least

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.810 
that might have been unproduced at least
the<00:01:35.130> original<00:01:35.460> artwork<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:37.189> eggshell<00:01:38.189> pieces

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
the original artwork the eggshell pieces

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.510 
the original artwork the eggshell pieces
or<00:01:39.090> actually<00:01:39.630> wings<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.530> these<00:01:40.950> guys<00:01:41.250> could

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
or actually wings and these guys could

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.010 
or actually wings and these guys could
fly<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:43.040> it's<00:01:44.270> possible<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.780> just

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
fly and it's possible but it just

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.109 
fly and it's possible but it just
doesn't<00:01:47.009> work<00:01:47.100> out<00:01:47.369> too<00:01:47.640> well<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:48.000> you

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
doesn't work out too well if you

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.980 
doesn't work out too well if you
collapse<00:01:48.720> down<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.170> side<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.890> just<00:01:50.990> still

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
collapse down the side it just still

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.160 
collapse down the side it just still
doesn't<00:01:52.470> look<00:01:52.680> too<00:01:52.979> good<00:01:53.479> that's<00:01:54.479> good<00:01:54.810> reason

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
doesn't look too good that's good reason

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.800 
doesn't look too good that's good reason
why<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.950> was<00:01:56.100> possible<00:01:56.310> Kenner<00:01:57.060> decided<00:01:57.600> to

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
why it was possible Kenner decided to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.370 
why it was possible Kenner decided to
axe<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:59.009> toy<00:01:59.219> line<00:01:59.250> ever<00:01:59.700> seen

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:36.420 

we<00:02:05.380> get<00:02:05.679> a<00:02:05.710> better<00:02:06.310> shot
