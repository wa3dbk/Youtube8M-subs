00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.210
 and what is the same Basque spirit? 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.580
 showed droid and I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.410
 that the easy and enough to all 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.860
 youtubers and all the people who 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.150
 they have certain videos that were thrown at them 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.610
 to lose for a certain reason for example 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.079
 they were recording at a concert and they're 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.970
 very attached we realize the matter 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.430
 and when we realize 100 recording 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.230
 you and point disappears the next 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.150
 the pile ends then what happens with the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.140
 video are usually corrupted and we're 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.120
 they can reproduce will happen to them 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.190
 generally this in android happens to us 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.230
 much this they say by video bus and 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.090
 It also happens to many youtubers with 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.520
 applications that record screen like 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.980
 scr show and rec are the ones that have most 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.560
 used and usually passes more text in 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.790
 cases like they are very long videos when 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.970
 you run memory recorder does not 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.470
 could cut the video well or when 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.380
 Restart the device by X or Y 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.520
 reason or also when it goes off then 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.110
 any video that is being generated and 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.790
 the device is interrupted or turned off 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.960
 it's not going to be well saved and it's going to be 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.330
 how timid you are seeing here that 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.740
 it looks gray now that they are going to have to 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.520
 do this tutorial that had them 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.140
 brought in pc 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.329
 that's right but a lot of people told me 'not a 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.219
 Android right now I was a while 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:17.619
 that if you search for applications but not 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:20.110
 I found and today weed aircraft a great 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.659
 friend youtuber told me this the 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.159
 creator of scr that is urban without 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.359
 size your little in the video of your 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.789
 application that they go where the place 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.709
 Thor well then this one as they were full 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.209
 the place thor got a very application 

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:34.299
 useful that they were watching here on screen 

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:36.909
 it's called video repair and that 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.039
 application is very cool because it serves 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.600
 more than anything for me to prepare videos 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.520
 how it is going to be mentioned and it works 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.899
 perfectly I already tried it what they are going to 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.789
 need first of all as well as 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.979
 on screen is another video that is fine 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.270
 here we have this video on the screen 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.789
 that if it looks good that you are here 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.679
 up this is coming this I recorded it nothing 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.280
 plus a short little video like 2 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.079
 seconds 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.539
 no matter how long it has to be 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.010
 to recover the video you have to 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.380
 have a good bone video 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.990
 for example it was from his camera with his 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.520
 cellular if who retrieves a video that 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.170
 they record with their camera because they have to 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.450
 record another video with your camera that 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.130
 serve to use it as an example right now 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.570
 they will see why and if it was with a degree 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.450
 screen with that same record of 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.160
 screen with the same settings recorded 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.840
 a short video like what it has just been 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.190
 I here recorded on my desk once 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.540
 that have uploaded example let's go to the 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.340
 application and let's give it in there that 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.890
 select first of all here where 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.960
 says select broken video and let's go 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.360
 to our video that serves us as a 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.280
 they will realize it does not work because 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.890
 they have not even image there the one 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.390
 serious and one up if you have this no 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.700
 then we will select what is 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.130
 the video that serves us we already have there and 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.050
 let's give it a change and let's go 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.520
 select the video that does serve to 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.560
 that the application does not take as an example 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.780
 what is this that is served once 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.360
 we do not select already says we are ready 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.100
 says some required information is 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.380
 misplaced needs to be copied from another 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.810
 video this video should be recorded with the 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.380
 Same camera resolution and quality as 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.210
 I say yes 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.340
 who retrieves a video of his 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.900
 camcorder the serious the other another with the 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.940
 same serious phone in another video as 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.640
 example and ready if you want to recover a 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.170
 video that was recorded with scr grammy what 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.390
 I'll know if I want it for a video that 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.130
 was recorded with rec graben lo with reik or 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.560
 be each video has to like it was 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.180
 good to record another example so that the 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.070
 application know where the video came from 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.320
 that is corrupt the since they did 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.840
 that of the video example as I say 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.540
 let's give it in says repair and you have to 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.120
 wait a bit 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.859
 ready now let's go to the gallery in 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.209
 the same folder where it was is going to 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.189
 save as you can see we have three 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.590
 videos we have this that is the one that 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:44.870
 damaged the damaged we have the below that 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.969
 is the example and this new one that is here 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.439
 up is the video already repaired and you 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.480
 They will say how a corrupt video exists 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:53.060
 well I did it on purpose because we're going to see 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.120
 how I did it let's reproduce what 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.730
 I did was this one I started to record screen 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.010
 crazy and restart the tablet to 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.870
 make the video corrupt as 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.849
 can see there restart and up 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.340
 even if it was recorded when I was 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.810
 restarting and I think that's why the 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.459
 video because then the tablet was organized 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.680
 then it happens to many that sometimes 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.759
 videos are corrupted by X 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:19.910
 reason have commented the in go 2 on it 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:22.130
 many times it has also happened to him and 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.750
 if it served me better than pc but 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.759
 have some problems there suddenly 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.289
 audio is accelerated then this one is 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:28.880
 application is better than the one I brought them 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.650
 I started but the same goes down the central pc 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.840
 in the discussion so you want to see it and 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.120
 this this is much better because the 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.680
 videos are perfect then it is 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.520
 very like something else that are going to 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.440
 need 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.750
 the free space because if for example 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.910
 it happens a lot that videos are corrupted very 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.410
 long are also not very large and if 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.419
 the video weighs a gig will need 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.250
 then the other one arrive or that is so that 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.400
 re-save the copy that is served 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.930
 in case they do not have space then 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.610
 you will not be able to complete the process 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.650
 so you have to try to have the 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.810
 double video space that despite the 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.789
 corrupt video and as I tell you then 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.199
 served as an example that can not be missed and 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.900
 because nothing people think that everything for this 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.940
 video if you liked it already be from jesus like 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.190
 share the video comment how you like them 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.479
 it worked and most of all it's youtubers or 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.889
 People simply want to 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.380
 recover your videos that get corrupted 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.270
 this means a lot and also many 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.889
 thank you craft the data base myself 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.569
 because yes yes with the cultural ones of 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.039
 csr but I did not know how to keep this 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:24.229
 application with this they shot him from 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:27.050
 the place tour as I mentioned a few days ago 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:29.270
 in the video of this scr if I did not know this 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.190
 it's application and it's totally 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.840
 so download the forum link in 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.430
 the description where you put the application 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.990
 and the direct download link of the 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.509
 application with the code totally free 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.219
 Obviously if you like you can donate is 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:42.830
 one of the things that he commented on 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:44.330
 forum yes good if it really served them and 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.620
 if they have the possibilities then where 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.509
 because the truth deserves this 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.129
 application is very good that has 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:52.220
 gone a lot and more with the series like 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:54.500
 minecraft example that are things when 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.030
 you can not go back to them 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.560
 back does not bone 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.720
 it's very fire when this is when I 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.310
 greased you did something epic or something happens 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.650
 very father a construct very 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.290
 good and you get corrupted the video is very 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.540
 very ugly because very small things happen 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.010
 that you can not repeat or for 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.360
 example a very special video some 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.790
 very special moment that you can not 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.810
 repeat again and it is damaged then with 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.150
 this application can not be recovered 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.160
 that kind of special moments other than 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.460
 me the truth that yes 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.230
 It was very useful because today is more 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.030
 happened but it happens to me generally when 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.580
 recorded with his when he recorded videos very 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.980
 long and I know that many colleagues do not 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.770
 happens then this application that 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.360
 love that yes it is very very very useful because 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.860
 for example there are games that you can 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.510
 re-record and nothing happens but there 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.460
 games that already exist some no I'm going 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:44.340
 to repeat they pass unique things that are not 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.950
 they can repeat then after serving 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.150
 and it will not be the next video what emotion 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.670
 the truth is very good the app seriously 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.770
 that this iguana creator is called 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.840
 creator of scr is very very good does not know 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.280
 that is at home but that is amazing and 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.080
 Nothing more and do not know if I gave you my 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.160
 I dismiss a lot but I got excited with this 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.160
 app seriously take care
