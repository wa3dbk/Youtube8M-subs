00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.849
 yes 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.750
 ah 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.200
 the new front design worthy the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.120
 experience of a wide vehicle and 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.340
 modern combined with benefits 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.220
 practical as excellent aerodynamics and 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.619
 good engine cooling 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.660
 the design of the yaris lateral has 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.430
 straight lines that flow from the part 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.320
 front to the back 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.230
 resulting in a greater appearance 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.809
 volume 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.270
 the design on the back gives a 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.160
 wider print waist 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.559
 lateral is wrapped towards a part 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.780
 rear of the trunk for a 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.030
 better aerodynamic behavior and a 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.610
 more attractive appearance 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.850
 this redesign have a roof 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.710
 catamaran thanks to its shape allows a 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.719
 more efficient air flow and also 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.019
 allows a lighter structure without 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.269
 sacrifice rigidity in the body the 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.149
 new yaris betting on optimization 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.580
 of its spaces what offers more 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.100
 spaciousness and comfort inside 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.080
 the yaris engine as its grants 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.950
 previous has a high 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.950
 fuel efficiency 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.870
 car has double air bag for 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.490
 the driver's seat and the passenger 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.680
 anti-lock braking system with 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.470
 electronic distribution of the force of 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.240
 braking the engine line already combines 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.130
 a high fuel efficiency and 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.790
 few emissions with an excellent 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.790
 acceleration
