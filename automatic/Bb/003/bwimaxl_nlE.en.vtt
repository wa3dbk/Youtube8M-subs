00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
out without weight practice doing this

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.109 
out without weight practice doing this
before<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.780> grab<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.170> weight<00:02:04.430> if<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.759> start

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
before you grab the weight if you start

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
variation these are a little harder to

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.319 
variation these are a little harder to
do<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.599> don't<00:02:18.599> mind<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.140> twisting<00:02:19.590> action<00:02:20.329> but

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
do I don't mind the twisting action but

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.179 
do I don't mind the twisting action but
being<00:02:21.599> a<00:02:21.689> beginner<00:02:21.840> you'll<00:02:22.530> tend<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.010> twist

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
being a beginner you'll tend to twist

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.399 
being a beginner you'll tend to twist
and<00:02:23.670> then<00:02:24.180> sort<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.480> untwist<00:02:25.019> at<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.230> wrong

and then sort of untwist at the wrong
time<00:02:25.709> let's<00:02:26.400> concentrate<00:02:26.989> and<00:02:27.989> keeping<00:02:28.379> it

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
time let's concentrate and keeping it

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.830 
time let's concentrate and keeping it
forward

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
forward

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.680 
forward
get<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.870> good<00:02:31.140> bicep<00:02:31.650> squeezing<00:02:32.190> pump<00:02:32.489> I<00:02:32.790> always

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
get a good bicep squeezing pump I always

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.039 
get a good bicep squeezing pump I always
tell<00:02:33.870> my<00:02:33.989> clients<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.590> think<00:02:35.010> about<00:02:35.220> having<00:02:35.489> an

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
tell my clients to think about having an

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.690 
tell my clients to think about having an
egg<00:02:37.049> in<00:02:37.290> between<00:02:37.650> their<00:02:37.769> form<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.099> bicep<00:02:38.519> and

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
egg in between their form and bicep and

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.330 
egg in between their form and bicep and
you're<00:02:39.150> squeezing<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:39.989> egg<00:02:40.230> just<00:02:40.890> like<00:02:40.980> so

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
you're squeezing that egg just like so

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.250 
you're squeezing that egg just like so
so<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:41.970> can't<00:02:42.269> squeeze<00:02:42.659> when<00:02:42.930> you're<00:02:43.049> coming

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
so you can't squeeze when you're coming

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.930 
so you can't squeeze when you're coming
all<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.560> way<00:02:43.590> up<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.099> your<00:02:44.250> biceps<00:02:44.400> actually

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
all the way up and your biceps actually

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.420 
all the way up and your biceps actually
rest<00:02:45.209> when<00:02:45.390> they're<00:02:45.510> all<00:02:45.599> the<00:02:45.629> way<00:02:45.840> up<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:46.430> the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
rest when they're all the way up so the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.270 
rest when they're all the way up so the
common<00:02:47.760> mistake<00:02:48.090> would<00:02:48.209> be<00:02:48.319> this<00:02:49.319> I<00:02:49.590> can<00:02:50.040> sit

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
common mistake would be this I can sit

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.610 
common mistake would be this I can sit
like<00:02:50.310> this<00:02:50.519> all<00:02:50.849> day<00:02:50.989> once<00:02:51.989> I<00:02:52.139> bring<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.470> arm

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
like this all day once I bring the arm

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.020 
like this all day once I bring the arm
down<00:02:52.680> right<00:02:53.099> there<00:02:53.519> my<00:02:54.239> biceps<00:02:54.480> are<00:02:54.810> working

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
down right there my biceps are working

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.640
