00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.730
 all today I made a video 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.970
 fast enough to show you a 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.230
 example of snacks actually made from 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.990
 carbohydrate but very low in carbohydrates 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.090
 still with proteins from 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.570
 lipids finally a little bit everything so that's okay 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.809
 to be in fact a kind of coated crepe 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.750
 bulk we call it as we want 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.010
 in I noted to remind you 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.120
 are worth to remind me a bit because 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.149
 I'm a little at ease in 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:51.449
 general so there is a lawyer there 2 e 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:53.399
 there is cimade 100 g of a quarter tone 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.820
 of cucumber there is that tomatoes 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.329
 cherries and a whole onion but a 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.030
 little Eastern by tastes and that's it 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.180
 so in fact that I did I crashed 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.909
 in fact the lawyer with the 100 g of donations 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.400
 so tried to crush all that makes a 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.140
 kind of mashed up so the place that if he 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.369
 still remains pieces but of 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.790
 way actually it's going to really make the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.890
 base so that it does not stick there actually 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.369
 I put cucumbers on the tomatoes and 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.340
 the onion is cut into small pieces 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.900
 double the smallest possible and in that 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.840
 It will hurt 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.960
 amano 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.850
 inside two young turkish are there and 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.340
 savanna does more of that 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.740
 is that it is consumed cold and that 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.310
 can actually transport it to his place 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.359
 from work to sport as you want 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.920
 hero I have that even him the 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.409
 civilians had something else it's better 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.819
 the parchment paper relay or what so 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.899
 there in fact what you do 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:54.579
 creams it's the same a besson decree 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.859
 and his buckwheat address only 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.810
 so the recipe and there is nothing more 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:05.049
 simple as I recall it is 70 g of 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:10.539
 buckwheat flour mixed with an egg 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:13.180
 whole and with that there is 25 centiliters 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.670
 of water so we mix all that 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.680
 either come an object a pinch of salt and 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.090
 I left to rest buzzer it is 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.129
 let rest for two hours that I 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.170
 let stand two hours there is no 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.319
 at all from wheat flour to launch without 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.790
 taste gluten and wood so that gives 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.470
 a pancake but it has to be alcohol on 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.459
 very hot she if not because 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.930
 it's not the same consistency 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.609
 oh yes and I forgot I put a 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.620
 teaspoon of mustard in the dough 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:37.329
 to bind a little bit is fast 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.959
 it is and s burst in fact when we 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:43.720
 try to turn it back that's what I 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:49.569
 am going to do i'm going to put my trait 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:54.670
 I like to be my salad so directly 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:57.910
 in it's a meal so it's not 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.500
 facing arbas and a snack or even if 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.079
 you load like me you can 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:08.099
 take like europe 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:08.099
 here I am 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:31.069
 preparation so a case is good 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:34.069
 loaded and the companion mans vegetables 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.069
 onions 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.069
 do men get that back 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.069
 is going to be another story 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.700
 so here I will take more 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:07.650
 definitely 9 put the hard on there's gonna have to 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:12.380
 roughly in animal source 30 g of 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.380
 ambient proteins good a little more this 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:23.039
 month ago you see that's a maxi so 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:27.380
 it's not very glamorous but we're going 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.380
 try to develop all that 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:12.150
 here is the advantage is that you 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:16.290
 have the sandwich sandwich a big arm at 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:19.290
 protein- based dinner volume of him 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.370
 that he is it's so I did 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.820
 several clear like that I could 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.650
 do other 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.450
 snack an advantage that there is that 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.630
 in fact with that is that you go 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.490
 to be able to prepare for the advanced by the years 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.740
 several months with you can do 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.450
 another proposal but here the 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.300
 composition it's more the composition of the 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.920
 sportsman with one or two products in 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.540
 prepare for the advanced book them at 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.950
 fresh and at least you know you 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.240
 have your snack for those who want 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.220
 not take over the supplement for example 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.680
 it can be an idea and it's 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.840
 relatively complete without gluten and without 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.970
 low lactose so I hope the recipe 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.780
 you liked the ingredients I'm going to them 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:57.540
 put on my website so www.finesse.com 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:02.210
 to do and like him this one 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.210
 all the friends to apply them
