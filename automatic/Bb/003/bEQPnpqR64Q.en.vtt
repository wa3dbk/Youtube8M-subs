 cubic centimeters of water ready knows 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.130
 how much bread will you get out of a kilogram of 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.500
 flour approximately 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.960
 is going to take out about a kilo and 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.750
 half a kilo of bread is what is going to 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.509
 pay will always depend on the gluten 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.070
 have the high flour more amount of 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.070
 Obama absorb more quantity bread I'm going to 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.530
 take note of it because to 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.360
 continue to economize at home and can go 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.020
 kneading and keep walking until in the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.750
 Freezer and how crazy people precook it 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.679
 before I take little color if they take it out 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.789
 from the oven and then to the freezer last 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:05.880
 six months a year quietly the crumb 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.649
 it has been what this bread 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.700
 cool chest front as castellitto 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:14.200
 do it, do not doubt it 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.180
 get a quick baguette to the network 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.060
 getting exactly a marketing the 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.590
 I stretched the rectangle 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.019
 now simply with the base of the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.599
 hands and this is practical there is no other 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:30.470
 if we are going to go as rolling and 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:33.140
 squeezing on roll and squeezed a roll and 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.450
 learn by the kilo bun gadget 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.569
 and half of finished flour when it comes out 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.680
 appear that pirulÃ­n 200 grams to 250 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.040
 grams others 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.110
 aha if there is weak of it is also going to 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.900
 depend on the plate you have designed 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.890
 or here calculation more or less because what 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.530
 I'm going to put on this plate 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.060
 with 200 grams I will get justito already 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.060
 that cuts from the mother bun 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.160
 in the oven and in the oven have in 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.980
 account that yeast if it was good 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.410
 60 degrees until the yeasts up 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.540
 that the temperature say the center 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.640
 of the patch at 60 degrees of yeast and 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.350
 grow up what do you mean I see it from 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.890
 that size and the oven will apply a little 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:26.630
 more to another faster than 8 tight 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.630
 I roll up tight and there 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:40.709
 another payment cut to make a 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:43.739
 felipe 88 how much it cuts 100 grams 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.489
 of 108 I'm just going to press it 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.489
 little bit against the table 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.200
 and that's also what I wanted to tell in a 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.730
 professional bakery when we are 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.920
 bread earrings which means that 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.250
 we are next and taking the time 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.500
 and already being ready to cook it 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.110
 we cut and the bread raised in front that 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.870
 come into the oven yes but at home already in 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.150
 my case what they are going to do is cut it 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.310
 before I want to say they are going to grab a 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.290
 cutter and so when they finish like I'm 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.860
 doing I'm going to make the cuts 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.440
 there before but letting rise and that 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.030
 I already have it cut because I tell you so 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.100
 they do not take risks and there they are going to 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.400
 form the exact one by half 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.919
 Exactly there it comes down to you because 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.290
 without taking into account that this bread is going to 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.180
 start to rise like a balloon and if I 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.919
 I'm not fast and I do not put it in the oven 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.930
 hot that will be 200 degrees 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.940
 to cook this bread what is going to 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.479
 to happen is that another 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.610
 question 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.770
 there is also tomorrow that I am going to 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.330
 teaching if the bread is too much 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.889
 I can not make the cut 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.889
 deep and I do not have colorful 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.740
 then if the bread is at its point 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.169
 just that I can make the cut of 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:09.030
 deep and directly baked and going to 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.030
 open very well then 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.730
 the millions will be equal to the most 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.700
 little ones 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:21.250
 if the same way I squeeze the idea of 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.950
 this money exactly this kind of bread 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.480
 be aware that I'm putting it 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:30.480
 as a chain that is called pegadito 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.480
 classic 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.950
 down is very good question now you 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.930
 will show something autistic 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.700
 what he called the fold or the closure 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.230
 always have to go down then if 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:49.780
 I put it to the side or up 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.780
 it opens now we are going to show you 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.470
 if we put them to the side what 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.560
 we put for more up the cut it 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.460
 lose and the funk opens we have in 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.350
 account 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.870
 I 'm going to tell you everything here 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.520
 that I am what I do not secret what I do not 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.450
 I know I will try to learn it for everyone 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.570
 your 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.490
 but what generosity what I want them 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.020
 say applauded that demonstrate in the 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.940
 I'll put the closing flautita 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.350
 go ahead and that is the closing that I speak 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.560
 that go down 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:31.790
 in counting all the silver that is there is no 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.500
 more than practicing and practicing a cut 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.150
 also and this one are also short of 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.770
 autistic since it is with cut and cut 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.690
 come on a cut you think 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.360
 we go back in a second do not miss anything 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.690
 at the formal beginning of the sixth 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.750
 season in Argentine cooks 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.750
