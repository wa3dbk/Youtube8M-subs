 gual complex sustente inc know come to the house the painting is like 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.960
 a staging environment this medal is stripped naming 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.279
 Yes too 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.989
 as a recreation an allegories of the painting what the current times and 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.210
 the contemporaneity and d 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.370
 its relationship with other media and 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.510
 and as if from a 9 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.290
 the art market and like all your mind a kind of book fair 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.010
 and if someone says that 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.340
 that the constitution as the religion in the fires that suits 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.130
 and we are the tamers the emilistas him 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.260
 and that's a bit what he lived will tell what 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.329
 in the 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:00.930
 pieces together 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.190
 it turns on the one hand into a room 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.470
 to close these curtains is in the air the world for the uncomfortable 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.050
 fair booth lives in theater 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.230
 a little 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.030
 walking 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.670
 with few pretensions 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.410
 and on the one hand 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.590
 we have the center piece that 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.280
 in which in a 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.729
 so indecent of struggle 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.090
 who has become the king of almost him 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.020
 in the fundamental event of d all the art the painting sell them from the beginning 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.310
 of the 21st century 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.420
 at least it is the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.420
 the founding father of many things 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.280
 at the end the great battle between mate and psychics or almost opted for the 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.700
 third the shadow that the 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.640
 Porcel fight 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.640
 because it is both the piece is a 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.580
 allegory although the prize are a bit nineteenth-century of the painting itself and 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.200
 another also of all the arts to that of working 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.340
 in a scenario 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.040
 as reflected in 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.830
 is the way it has become 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.490
 the art has passed ds as something of meditation and a more spiritual terrain 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.979
 to the world of entertainment and 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.679
 invisible basically 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:19.320
 within this one not the elm figure means 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.619
 embodied in lion and the road activist 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:25.619
 The videos 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.849
 the camera in this case that takes the dog complains the action is 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:35.159
 the performance would be light bulb photography arts 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:43.889
 we have the central figure that would be in this case the painting too 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.719
 tesla with the eternal history of death the painting with which it is 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.069
 trying to resurrect a 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.979
 something that simple has always been 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:56.979
 if we stop in that plan 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:01.780
 but all the times it's an allegory of the painting itself because all those 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:03.679
 means is the fiom 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:05.870
 He directed the photograph 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.199
 everything will be done 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:10.419
 he has joined the painting he of the 21st century 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.019
 then what they are giving will give life to the inanimate see basically what 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.609
 that we all try to create over coco inanimate matter he 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.169
 and life 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.169
 aa where there is not 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.579

 centraco is trying to rebel 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.779
 you should not perform yesterday creator of this case would you support the painter flights of 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:38.799
 any artist 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.209
 the one of inconformity of 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.319
 of the model 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.039
 formed by all the advertising of 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:48.709
 fairs and exhibitions 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.649

 kowa be 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.769
 took the face totally different and oblivious to what 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.629
 now what the goal allegedly tried to kill 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.879
 forward gonzalo quevedo 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.129

 comes impact on the world the subjects

 formally pixelated the image televised at least fit the past 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.550
 and they are because they are also points 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.509
 and what in this case would be still taken are the artist's eye 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:45.919
 for melo by artists like the bridge 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.780
 or the return between your inner world the outer world or both so to 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:51.729
 in as out 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.259
 It is the step between 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.430
 or the curtain that separates

 london world 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.699
 the eyes both removed is the list to to choose the artists

 he was referring to the worker 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:16.270
 of the artistic present 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.930
 and among those who are not very few artists the truth is only about 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:19.759
 how many 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.759
