00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:08.290
 share a myth a reality a thing 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.910
 that will be true is a tip that the 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.769
 make-up artists more full of fairies 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.959
 of the world from which I left where it 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.490
 they marry but I use it a lot and good 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.220
 I wanted to share it with you in fact it's 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.170
 a is a tip that shares and in my workshop 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.570
 of makeup and that in fact I use it in 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.039
 lots of customers and it's something for everyone 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.599
 you girls who always write to me 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.169
 they say I have that greasy and I do not know what 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.730
 it's a good thing English has written a couple 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.890
 of times I think I made a post too 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.360
 I have posted posts on facebook or in 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.860
 instagram ports really important that I 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.149
 continue on instagram and also on 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.699
 instagram how makeup is done and 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.170
 twitter and also on facebook I commented on the 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.930
 makeup artist because there I share things 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.940
 that I do not share with this video is to give them 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.859
 an important tip against the first or 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.960
 always be that I tell them that if you have 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:53.500
 complicated skin is to say you have 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.120
 quite porous skin and many lines of 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.050
 expression the first one is an excellent 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.600
 option for what 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.270
 do not erase completely because nothing erases 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.649
 completely that but yes so that 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.630
 disguise it is a bit that and you download a 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.580
 little the expression like that the temple is the 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.500
 first great and above all the prize of 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.930
 silicone the silicone baby that to me 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.330
 like more next to my soul is the study 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.130
 perfect photos loading timer that is of my 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.970
 ex that aside from being super cheap to 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.710
 meet 52 soles these 52 soles is 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.330
 quite comfortable because really not 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.190
 They use much I learn a little Nomás 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.720
 are you have to put your enough yo 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.430
 same I recommend the first one always for 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.840
 people who have dry skin the people that 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.910
 has oily skin does not need a 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.179
 extra fat to put things on 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.590
 so what do I do to make my skin 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:40.460
 that the makeup improves more time and 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.619
 to try that the fat does not affect 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.179
 so much to my skin what I use with my 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.259
 customers and what I use mostly for 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.580
 example when I have to do works 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.979
 of theater and in this makeup 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.140
 best hours of hours when I go to 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.789
 dance a lot and I'm going to help double one 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.020
 normal person then like that 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.990
 will study 10 hours when makeup 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.800
 used milk of magnesia if milk from 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.530
 magnesia 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.209
 phillips the normal as blue that milk 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.530
 of magnesia the pharmacy is between 6 and 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:05.960
 12 new soles agreed very well 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.660
 dawn church is great for skins 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.530
 complicated and oily skin that make the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.450
 milk dawns 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.640
 it's like that you'll throw a layer of ducó 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.100
 the skin and makes it totally matte 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.140
 and that ay forms a barrier between your 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.880
 pores and makeup then if you have 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.650
 very oily skin what I recommend 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.450
 is that you put two layers of milk 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.340
 magnesia how are you going to do it is going to be a 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.810
 Cotton quoted normal until milk 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.300
 magnesia you're going to throw it all over the 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.680
 face and especially in areas where 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.570
 have more fat as for example 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.790
 times in the cheeks on the tf in the 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.890
 nose here and on your chin you're going to put 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.440
 there this whole week you already let 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.510
 dry it suddenly becomes a little me 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.670
 it gives like blanquillos ah but not much and 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.950
 then if you think your skin is mea fat you already 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.810
 you know me sugar that you put another 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.430
 stage if not only with is one in my 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.989
 case I do not have much fat on my face 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.850
 but where there are hours sometimes is in 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.709
 the nose then I get kanharith 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.569
 and suddenly with little beats and there 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.880
 just because all the rest of my face 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.319
 well very dry this is going to make the 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.410
 makeup sticks to milk 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.120
 magnesia and that it lasts longer and you do not 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.470
 Oil your skin so fast eventually 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.989
 is going to get oiled because the skin gets on 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.670
 fat or fat free so if you're a 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.550
 greasy skin person anyway 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.100
 at the moment mentally it goes 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.370
 in two ways but it's going to be that it's not 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.920
 as fast as this usually happens 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.390
 that if that's the big guy what the 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.000
 thousands of makeup artists around 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.590
 world is great use it try you're going to 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.140
 see that you will not regret it and if you do 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.740
 television theater those things is also 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.080
 a good weapon to use it I 'll give you my skin 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.550
 It is very delicate and in fact if I scratch 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.020
 it turns red and everything and never had any 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.460
 problem with milk magnesium nor with 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.440
 no customer that is the one used so 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.850
 just as in fact before strut in all 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.350
 the face I recommend that you use it 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.770
 bit and see if your skin reacts 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.210
 somehow I do not think he will react but 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.210
 same because almost everything prevented before 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.620
 regret this is a very expensive first 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.730
 very expensive that you can find it in 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.320
 all pharmacies 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.550
 If you do not know what is it dawns them 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.040
 álex dawn was actually a 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.810
 digestive is a laxative so you can 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.820
 have it in case you stomach or also 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.070
 to put will or makeup so 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.320
 this is a tip that is a myth or not 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.790
 it's a myth it 's a thing that works and 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.380
 that people like and about all 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.269
