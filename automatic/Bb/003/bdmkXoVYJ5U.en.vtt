00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
pretty good so anyways the settings make

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.790 
pretty good so anyways the settings make
sure<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.629> those<00:00:48.809> stabilizers<00:00:49.260> are<00:00:49.500> up<00:00:49.620> here

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
sure that those stabilizers are up here

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.410 
sure that those stabilizers are up here
is<00:00:50.010> set<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.460> highest<00:00:50.489> setting<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.270> your

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
is set to the highest setting that your

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.240 
is set to the highest setting that your
computer<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:51.840> handle<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.949> say<00:00:53.129> this

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
computer can handle and I say this

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.680 
computer can handle and I say this
because<00:00:53.460> most<00:00:53.699> people<00:00:54.059> will<00:00:54.180> suggest<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.629> to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
because most people will suggest you to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.639 
because most people will suggest you to
hold<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.140> all<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.469> way<00:00:55.559> up<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.890> s7<00:00:56.629> but<00:00:57.629> if<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.590> do

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
hold it all the way up to s7 but if I do

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.430 
hold it all the way up to s7 but if I do
that<00:00:58.969> my<00:00:59.969> computer<00:01:00.420> actually<00:01:00.780> likes<00:01:01.050> when<00:01:01.410> I

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.219 
that my computer actually likes when I
started<00:01:01.739> trying<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.340> soon<00:01:05.780> so<00:01:06.780> basically

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
computer can handle I normally just keep

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.410 
computer can handle I normally just keep
it<00:01:14.250> at<00:01:14.369> 15<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.720> works<00:01:15.900> fine<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:17.330> now<00:01:18.330> for

water<00:01:43.140> on<00:01:43.259> top<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.210> take<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> sketch<00:01:45.509> layer

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
water on top so I take the sketch layer

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.389 
water on top so I take the sketch layer
and<00:01:46.020> then<00:01:46.110> turn<00:01:46.350> up<00:01:46.470> has<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:46.979> down<00:01:47.220> to

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
and then turn up has to be down to

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.039 
and then turn up has to be down to
around<00:01:47.579> 15<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.149> 20%

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
around 15 to 20%

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.010 
around 15 to 20%
I'll<00:01:49.530> go<00:01:49.860> lower<00:01:50.220> if<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.670> need<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.630> never

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
I'll go lower if I need to but I never

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.770 
I'll go lower if I need to but I never
go<00:01:52.290> higher<00:01:52.530> than<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.040> then<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.939> make<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.479> layer

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
go higher than that then I make a layer

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.749 
go higher than that then I make a layer
on<00:01:54.869> top<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.470> sketch<00:01:55.710> layer<00:01:55.740> called<00:01:56.399> line

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
on top of the sketch layer called line

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.819 
on top of the sketch layer called line
art<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.180> start<00:01:58.049> through<00:01:58.229> my<00:01:58.350> things

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
art and start through my things

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.639 
art and start through my things
generally<00:01:59.700> for<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.360> face<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:01.350> use<00:02:01.619> a

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
generally for the face I like use a

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.569 
generally for the face I like use a
thick<00:02:02.310> brush<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.939> tend<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.420> undo<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.320> lot<00:02:04.409> cuz<00:02:05.369> I'm

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
thick brush I tend to undo a lot cuz I'm

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.150 
thick brush I tend to undo a lot cuz I'm
a<00:02:05.610> perfectionist<00:02:06.320> which<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.500> why<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.680> normally

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
a perfectionist which is why I normally

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.389 
a perfectionist which is why I normally

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
beeping cuz it'll double the length I go

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.160 
beeping cuz it'll double the length I go
back<00:02:12.970> in<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.329> make<00:02:13.450> sure<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.750> lines<00:02:13.930> on<00:02:14.079> the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
back in to make sure the lines on the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.140 
back in to make sure the lines on the
face<00:02:14.349> are<00:02:14.590> thick<00:02:14.829> enough<00:02:14.860> if<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.579> need<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.909> and

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
face are thick enough if I need to and

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.720 
face are thick enough if I need to and
for<00:02:17.079> the<00:02:17.170> mouth<00:02:17.349> in<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.620> nose<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.129> use<00:02:18.489> a

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
for the mouth in the nose I use a

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.449 
for the mouth in the nose I use a
slightly<00:02:19.299> smaller<00:02:19.930> brush<00:02:20.379> and<00:02:20.650> same<00:02:21.189> goes<00:02:21.430> for

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
slightly smaller brush and same goes for

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.009 
slightly smaller brush and same goes for
clothing<00:02:22.769> now<00:02:23.769> let's<00:02:24.459> make<00:02:25.269> a<00:02:25.329> new<00:02:25.599> layer<00:02:25.780> for

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
clothing now let's make a new layer for

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.470 
clothing now let's make a new layer for
the<00:02:26.109> eyes<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.650> with<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.370> eyes<00:02:27.489> I<00:02:27.909> turned<00:02:28.390> a

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
the eyes and with the eyes I turned a

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.360 
the eyes and with the eyes I turned a
pasty<00:02:28.870> level<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.379> brush<00:02:29.620> down<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:30.220> around

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
pasty level of the brush down to around

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.110 
pasty level of the brush down to around
70%<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.930> give<00:02:32.079> it<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.349> softer<00:02:32.799> look<00:02:32.950> then<00:02:33.700> I<00:02:33.730> fill

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
70% to give it a softer look then I fill

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.020 
70% to give it a softer look then I fill
it<00:02:34.269> in<00:02:34.450> so<00:02:34.689> that<00:02:34.720> it's<00:02:34.930> open<00:02:35.349> and<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.849> just

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
it in so that it's open and this is just

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.539 
it in so that it's open and this is just
something<00:02:37.359> that<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.780> like<00:02:38.079> to<00:02:38.140> do<00:02:38.439> for<00:02:38.980> no

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
something that I like to do for no

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.780 
something that I like to do for no
particular<00:02:40.390> reasons<00:02:41.099> it's<00:02:42.099> just<00:02:42.310> my<00:02:42.400> style<00:02:42.639> I

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
particular reasons it's just my style I

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.059 
particular reasons it's just my style I
guess<00:02:43.030> so<00:02:43.450> obviously<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.560> don't<00:02:44.680> have<00:02:44.799> to

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
guess so obviously you don't have to

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:53.850 
guess so obviously you don't have to
fill<00:02:45.519> it<00:02:45.639> in<00:02:45.760> if<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.060> don't<00:02:46.450> want<00:02:46.540> to

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.960 

so<00:02:54.860> now<00:02:55.640> we<00:02:56.180> make<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.780> new<00:02:57.590> layer<00:02:57.860> for<00:02:58.370> him

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
so now we make a new layer for him

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.570 
so now we make a new layer for him
here<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.110> paucity<00:03:00.530> of<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.830> brush<00:03:01.040> goes<00:03:01.340> back

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
here the paucity of the brush goes back

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.260 
here the paucity of the brush goes back
up<00:03:01.820> to<00:03:02.120> around<00:03:02.450> 90%<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.590> using<00:03:04.580> a<00:03:04.760> relatively

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
up to around 90% and using a relatively

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.600 
up to around 90% and using a relatively
small<00:03:05.750> brush<00:03:06.050> I<00:03:06.290> started<00:03:06.800> to<00:03:07.040> work<00:03:07.250> out<00:03:07.460> the

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
small brush I started to work out the

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.300 
small brush I started to work out the
details<00:03:07.840> but<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:08.870> aligned<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.350> hair<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:09.620> like<00:03:10.040> to

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
details but I aligned a hair I like to

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.950 
details but I aligned a hair I like to
make<00:03:10.490> some<00:03:10.730> improvisations

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
make some improvisations

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.070 
make some improvisations
so<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.530> opacity<00:03:12.830> of<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.400> sketch<00:03:13.820> goes<00:03:14.780> down

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
so the opacity of the sketch goes down

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:41.080 
so the opacity of the sketch goes down
to<00:03:15.410> around<00:03:15.770> 5<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.730> 8%

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.690 

and<00:03:42.090> after<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:43.110> I<00:03:43.410> go<00:03:43.770> back<00:03:43.980> in<00:03:44.280> with<00:03:44.550> an

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
and after that I go back in with an

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.380 
and after that I go back in with an
airbrush<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.660> make<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.080> iron<00:03:46.290> starter<00:03:47.040> and

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
airbrush to make the iron starter and

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.630 
airbrush to make the iron starter and
then<00:03:48.390> I<00:03:48.720> used<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:49.500> pen<00:03:49.710> tool<00:03:49.860> again<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.190> flick

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
then I used the pen tool again to flick

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.550 
then I used the pen tool again to flick
in<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:51.060> face<00:03:51.300> the<00:03:51.690> outer<00:03:51.960> parts<00:03:52.410> of<00:03:52.500> the

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
in the face the outer parts of the

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.300 
in the face the outer parts of the
clothing<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.640> etc<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.540> make<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.950> add<00:03:56.100> more

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
clothing and etc to make the to add more

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.480 
clothing and etc to make the to add more
definition<00:03:56.690> then<00:03:57.690> I<00:03:58.010> just<00:03:59.010> move<00:03:59.190> things

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
definition then I just move things

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.400 
definition then I just move things
around<00:03:59.670> a<00:03:59.910> bit<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.390> fix<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:01.020> things<00:04:01.230> that

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
around a bit and fix the things that

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.070 
around a bit and fix the things that
didn't<00:04:01.680> look<00:04:01.830> right<00:04:02.100> to<00:04:02.160> me<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.700> I'm<00:04:03.690> not<00:04:03.900> sure

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
didn't look right to me and I'm not sure

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.130 
didn't look right to me and I'm not sure
if<00:04:04.200> you<00:04:04.290> guys<00:04:04.410> can<00:04:04.470> see<00:04:05.040> with<00:04:05.370> the

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
if you guys can see with the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.690 
if you guys can see with the
fast-forward<00:04:07.140> game<00:04:07.440> but<00:04:07.710> I'm<00:04:07.890> slowly<00:04:08.310> merging

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
fast-forward game but I'm slowly merging
