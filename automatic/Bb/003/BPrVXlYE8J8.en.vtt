scored 20 we managed to get just up over
140<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.710> go<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:25.949> give<00:00:26.070> us<00:00:26.189> something

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
140 to go and give us something

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.849 
140 to go and give us something
reasonable<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.810> try<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.230> defend<00:00:28.529> but<00:00:28.769> we

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
reasonable to try and defend but we

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.830 
reasonable to try and defend but we
picked<00:00:28.980> up<00:00:29.160> some<00:00:29.340> early<00:00:29.580> wickets<00:00:29.910> and

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
picked up some early wickets and

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.400 
picked up some early wickets and
hopefully<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:32.099> can<00:00:32.309> go<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:33.140> well<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> guess

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
hopefully that can go and well I guess

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.870 
hopefully that can go and well I guess
we<00:00:34.559> can<00:00:34.739> bowl<00:00:34.950> them<00:00:35.130> out<00:00:35.280> for<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.550> very<00:00:35.670> low

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
we can bowl them out for a very low

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.819 
we can bowl them out for a very low
total<00:00:36.120> because<00:00:36.360> as<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.750> said<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.110> think<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.530> may

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
total because as I said I think this may

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.150 
total because as I said I think this may
be<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.760> last<00:00:38.790> round<00:00:39.660> robin<00:00:39.960> game<00:00:40.140> I'm<00:00:40.649> not<00:00:41.010> too

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
be the last round robin game I'm not too

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.680 
be the last round robin game I'm not too
sure<00:00:41.340> where<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:41.640> are<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.000> table<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.420> think

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
sure where we are on the table I think

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.270 
sure where we are on the table I think
we<00:00:42.840> may<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.110> there<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:43.800> abouts<00:00:44.100> in

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
we may be there and there abouts in

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.670 
we may be there and there abouts in
regards<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> semi<00:00:45.000> final<00:00:45.329> spot<00:00:45.600> move<00:00:46.289> off

regards to a semi final spot move off

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.740 
regards to a semi final spot move off
the<00:00:47.010> fielder<00:00:47.370> moves<00:00:47.640> he<00:00:47.879> had<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> chance<00:00:48.480> at

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the fielder moves he had a chance at

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.389 
the fielder moves he had a chance at
that<00:00:48.809> but<00:00:49.469> what<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.680> he<00:00:49.770> doing<00:00:50.100> he's<00:00:50.219> just

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399

outside<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.490> get<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.640> good<00:02:03.000> one<00:02:03.360> because<00:02:03.570> it

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
outside and get a good one because it

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.139 
outside and get a good one because it
ideally<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.829> what<00:02:05.009> we<00:02:05.100> wanted<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.490> as<00:02:05.729> i<00:02:05.790> said

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.520 
ideally is what we wanted like as i said
i<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.420> t<00:02:06.509> remember<00:02:06.719> where<00:02:07.049> we<00:02:07.079> are<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
i can t remember where we are in the

i can t remember where we are in the
rankings<00:02:07.890> i<00:02:07.979> think<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.340> may<00:02:08.550> be<00:02:08.580> third<00:02:09.060> at<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
rankings i think we may be third at the

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.199 
rankings i think we may be third at the
moment<00:02:09.869> but<00:02:10.020> don't<00:02:10.890> get<00:02:11.370> don't<00:02:11.670> quote<00:02:11.970> me<00:02:12.180> on

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.030 
moment but don't get don't quote me on
there<00:02:12.420> because<00:02:12.599> I

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
there because I

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.860 
there because I
wrong<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.519> actually<00:02:13.760> can't<00:02:14.120> remember<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:14.810> we

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
wrong I actually can't remember so we

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.179 
wrong I actually can't remember so we
get<00:02:14.989> a<00:02:15.019> nice<00:02:15.140> outside<00:02:15.439> edge<00:02:15.739> and<00:02:15.769> they<00:02:16.010> are

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189 
get a nice outside edge and they are

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.240 
get a nice outside edge and they are
really<00:02:16.579> struggling<00:02:17.150> here<00:02:17.329> the<00:02:18.319> Hobart

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
really struggling here the Hobart

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.520 
really struggling here the Hobart
hurricanes<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.879> must<00:02:20.030> be<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.209> very<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.840> very<00:02:21.109> good

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
hurricanes it must be a very a very good

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.899 
hurricanes it must be a very a very good
pitch<00:02:21.739> for<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.040> bowlers<00:02:22.400> I'm<00:02:22.549> guessing

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
pitch for the bowlers I'm guessing

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.390 
pitch for the bowlers I'm guessing
because<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.620> guess<00:02:24.620> no<00:02:24.859> one's<00:02:25.010> really<00:02:25.189> got

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
because I guess no one's really got

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.000 
because I guess no one's really got
going<00:02:25.430> when<00:02:25.819> you<00:02:25.879> only<00:02:26.060> score<00:02:26.209> 51<00:02:26.989> runs<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.560> a

at this stage of the innings that when
I'm<00:02:33.590> watching<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.920> t20<00:02:34.430> normally<00:02:34.970> if<00:02:35.420> it's<00:02:36.170> a

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
I'm watching a t20 normally if it's a

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.509 
I'm watching a t20 normally if it's a
good<00:02:36.319> bedding<00:02:36.530> track<00:02:36.769> of<00:02:36.890> course<00:02:37.129> so<00:02:37.310> if<00:02:37.370> it's

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
good bedding track of course so if it's

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.009 
good bedding track of course so if it's
not<00:02:37.609> a<00:02:37.849> good<00:02:38.090> bedding<00:02:38.299> track<00:02:38.569> then<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:38.900> have

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
not a good bedding track then you have

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.360 
not a good bedding track then you have
to<00:02:39.139> go<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.319> readjust<00:02:39.709> but<00:02:39.829> if<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.069> bedding

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
to go and readjust but if the bedding

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.479 
to go and readjust but if the bedding
track<00:02:40.519> is<00:02:40.639> pretty<00:02:40.819> decent<00:02:42.040> yeah<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.069> think<00:02:43.219> you

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
track is pretty decent yeah I think you

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.250 
track is pretty decent yeah I think you
may<00:02:43.670> be<00:02:43.700> itch<00:02:44.000> they're<00:02:44.299> onto<00:02:44.629> us<00:02:44.719> pair<00:02:45.019> but<00:02:45.200> I'm

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
may be itch they're onto us pair but I'm

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.660 
may be itch they're onto us pair but I'm
not<00:02:45.379> too<00:02:45.500> sure<00:02:45.709> if<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.220> bedding<00:02:46.459> tracks

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
not too sure if the bedding tracks

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.220 
not too sure if the bedding tracks
decent<00:02:47.090> offer<00:02:47.239> it's<00:02:47.389> got<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.540> bit<00:02:47.720> in<00:02:47.840> there<00:02:47.959> for

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
decent offer it's got a bit in there for

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.589 
decent offer it's got a bit in there for
our<00:02:48.500> for<00:02:49.430> both<00:02:49.609> the<00:02:49.760> batsman<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:50.359> bowler

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
our for both the batsman and the bowler

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.259 
our for both the batsman and the bowler
normally<00:02:51.109> at<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.409> 12<00:02:51.709> /<00:02:52.010> mark<00:02:52.220> that's<00:02:52.549> where<00:02:52.939> I

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
normally at the 12 / mark that's where I

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.149 
normally at the 12 / mark that's where I
think<00:02:53.870> if<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.019> team's<00:02:54.260> going<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.650> get<00:02:54.799> a<00:02:54.829> good

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
think if the team's going to get a good

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.879 
think if the team's going to get a good
school<00:02:55.519> in<00:02:55.870> my<00:02:56.870> opinion<00:02:57.139> anyway<00:02:57.349> I<00:02:57.560> think<00:02:57.680> the

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889 
school in my opinion anyway I think the

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.399 
school in my opinion anyway I think the
team<00:02:58.099> should<00:02:58.129> be<00:02:58.430> at<00:02:58.669> close<00:02:59.299> to<00:02:59.329> 100<00:02:59.870> runs<00:03:00.049> 90

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 
team should be at close to 100 runs 90

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.349 
team should be at close to 100 runs 90
to<00:03:00.470> 100<00:03:00.799> runs<00:03:00.950> off<00:03:01.099> those<00:03:01.280> 12<00:03:01.579> overs<00:03:01.909> those

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
to 100 runs off those 12 overs those

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:03.580 
to 100 runs off those 12 overs those
first<00:03:02.540> 12<00:03:02.840> overs<00:03:03.109> because<00:03:03.260> then<00:03:03.379> it<00:03:03.470> can

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
first 12 overs because then it can

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.530 
first 12 overs because then it can
really<00:03:03.709> go<00:03:03.919> and<00:03:04.099> launch<00:03:04.359> especially<00:03:05.359> if<00:03:05.450> it

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
really go and launch especially if it

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.300 
really go and launch especially if it
got<00:03:05.599> a<00:03:05.659> batsman<00:03:06.049> who's<00:03:06.169> in<00:03:06.319> who's<00:03:06.530> been<00:03:06.739> who's

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659 
been in for a while and time in the ball

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.619 
been in for a while and time in the ball
well<00:03:09.439> so<00:03:09.680> i<00:03:10.159> don't<00:03:11.090> know<00:03:11.180> if<00:03:11.209> i<00:03:11.299> change<00:03:11.450> my

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
well so i don't know if i change my

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.800 
well so i don't know if i change my
field<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:11.989> been<00:03:12.169> dunk<00:03:13.299> don't<00:03:14.299> think<00:03:14.480> i<00:03:14.540> did<00:03:14.720> but

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
field to been dunk don't think i did but

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.759 
field to been dunk don't think i did but
it's<00:03:14.959> not<00:03:15.079> going<00:03:15.169> to<00:03:15.260> matter<00:03:15.379> we're<00:03:15.620> just

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
it's not going to matter we're just

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.330 
it's not going to matter we're just
going<00:03:15.919> to<00:03:15.980> go<00:03:16.159> for<00:03:16.819> another<00:03:17.889> solitary<00:03:18.889> run<00:03:19.190> off

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
going to go for another solitary run off

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.509 
going to go for another solitary run off
that<00:03:19.489> over<00:03:19.790> so<00:03:19.970> two<00:03:20.329> overs<00:03:21.040> two<00:03:22.040> runs<00:03:22.280> in<00:03:22.459> a

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
that over so two overs two runs in a

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.099 
that over so two overs two runs in a
wicket<00:03:22.909> so<00:03:23.060> we've<00:03:23.209> really<00:03:23.510> gone<00:03:23.659> and<00:03:23.900> slow

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
wicket so we've really gone and slow

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.899 
wicket so we've really gone and slow
down<00:03:24.349> proceedings<00:03:24.919> and<00:03:25.159> even<00:03:25.669> though<00:03:25.729> I'm

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909 
down proceedings and even though I'm

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.089 
down proceedings and even though I'm
taking<00:03:26.239> wickets<00:03:26.419> that<00:03:26.900> it's<00:03:27.290> not<00:03:27.590> too<00:03:27.859> much<00:03:28.040> of

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
taking wickets that it's not too much of

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.550 
taking wickets that it's not too much of
an<00:03:28.340> issue<00:03:28.430> if<00:03:28.729> we're<00:03:28.879> going<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.560> containing

an issue if we're going and containing

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.349 
an issue if we're going and containing
the<00:03:30.769> batsman<00:03:31.159> because<00:03:31.310> as<00:03:31.430> I<00:03:31.549> said<00:03:31.609> we<00:03:32.239> don't

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
the batsman because as I said we don't

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:33.610 
the batsman because as I said we don't
have<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:32.599> hold<00:03:32.750> them<00:03:32.930> out<00:03:33.019> we<00:03:33.229> just<00:03:33.409> need<00:03:33.560> to

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
to be even harder now they've got to

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.409 
to be even harder now they've got to
pluck<00:03:43.129> that<00:03:43.310> one<00:03:43.519> over<00:03:43.669> here<00:03:43.909> what<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.120> catch

that is just diving away puts out the
left<00:03:48.019> Matt<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:48.560> just<00:03:48.829> sticks<00:03:49.569> sometimes

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
left Matt and it just sticks sometimes

those<00:03:50.959> catches<00:03:51.409> they<00:03:51.680> just<00:03:52.099> they<00:03:52.459> just<00:03:52.489> happen

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
those catches they just they just happen

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.000 
those catches they just they just happen
don't<00:03:53.479> they<00:03:53.599> they<00:03:53.840> just<00:03:54.169> happen<00:03:54.500> so<00:03:54.889> it's

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
don't they they just happen so it's

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.610 
don't they they just happen so it's
going<00:03:55.159> to<00:03:55.220> be<00:03:55.280> even<00:03:55.760> harder<00:03:56.299> here<00:03:56.720> now<00:03:56.959> six

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
going to be even harder here now six

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
Lachlan and I think he's got a wii edge

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.390 
Lachlan and I think he's got a wii edge
on<00:04:02.750> that<00:04:02.810> one<00:04:03.290> there<00:04:03.470> so<00:04:03.650> he's<00:04:03.680> not<00:04:04.069> going<00:04:04.340> to

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
not really worth the review but another

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.140 
not really worth the review but another
dot<00:04:09.859> ball<00:04:10.099> and<00:04:10.280> that's<00:04:10.430> what<00:04:10.609> we<00:04:10.759> want<00:04:10.970> we<00:04:11.120> want

Ben dunk on strap in don't need to face

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.360 
Ben dunk on strap in don't need to face
I'd<00:04:18.049> say<00:04:18.109> a<00:04:18.769> majority<00:04:19.039> of<00:04:19.669> this<00:04:20.449> last<00:04:21.250> what<00:04:22.250> are

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
I'd say a majority of this last what are

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.240 
I'd say a majority of this last what are
we<00:04:22.520> five<00:04:22.789> and<00:04:23.000> a<00:04:23.029> half<00:04:23.060> overs<00:04:23.680> for<00:04:24.680> hobart<00:04:25.039> to

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
we five and a half overs for hobart to

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.880 
we five and a half overs for hobart to
get<00:04:25.490> anywhere<00:04:25.880> near

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
get anywhere near

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.110 
get anywhere near
the<00:04:27.890> total<00:04:28.310> but<00:04:28.460> I<00:04:28.490> don't<00:04:28.730> think<00:04:28.820> that's<00:04:28.970> going

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
the total but I don't think that's going

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.460 
the total but I don't think that's going
to<00:04:29.180> happen<00:04:29.300> how<00:04:29.540> about<00:04:29.750> I<00:04:29.780> don't<00:04:30.140> think<00:04:30.350> can

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
to happen how about I don't think can

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.920 
to happen how about I don't think can
qualify<00:04:30.740> for<00:04:31.640> the<00:04:32.120> simi's<00:04:32.510> at<00:04:32.660> all<00:04:32.780> i<00:04:32.810> think

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
qualify for the simi's at all i think

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.800 
qualify for the simi's at all i think
they're<00:04:33.230> in<00:04:33.320> last<00:04:33.560> place<00:04:33.800> at<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.190> moment<00:04:34.340> so
