00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:13.490

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.799
 since I put and wrinkled 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.050
 she beats he's dead that does not mean 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.910
 it's not at all good at all 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.439
 still we can say because that's it 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.119
 says in this video that breeders 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.990
 it's over we will not hear anymore 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.900
 nor on youtube the nest on youtube 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.730
 here it is finished will use more this 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.309
 nickname anyway I'll go back 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.480
 on youtube it's set and then like 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:43.150
 you could see the fuck you tube and 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.220
 minecraft month a fear of youyous 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.659
 finally short well stopped here it is if 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.309
 sad but more seriously what is it 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:54.049
 this delusion why they stop youtube 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.100
 why they stop minecraft that's 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.080
 what this mess 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.449
 frankly you do not have the right to stop 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.790
 videos and the ferry is obliged to 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.680
 continue no but I'm kidding children I 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.810
 resume a short message from his video 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.729
 like what he says he gets 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.560
 messages that forbid him 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.570
 to stop videos youtube no but 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.070
 frankly opens up to what people and 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.170
 must not be there we can not force him to 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.119
 do anything you do not have the right 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.619
 to stop making videos but that's 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.539
 true that it can be understood but 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.310
 here are the people they are so fan of 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.439
 you do not know how you stop like that 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.810
 overnight it's flipping when 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.579
 even you imagine or like that followed 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.179
 videos from round to round and then from 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.179
 saucers naught 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.950
 but after that it's true that you have to 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.110
 understand he wants to move on 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.509
 thing there is in life to have two 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.159
 turning in his life from youtube it was 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.240
 that a passage in his book there is this 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.750
 that he explains in this video where 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.310
 find the description in the 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.830
 description the link of this video 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.009
 explains that for 17 minutes 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.080
 yes 17 minutes why the conditions 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.500
 that it was in popularity and minecraft 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.880
 he says it's very important it's true that 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.909
 it was still someone who had 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.490
 created sacred concept a box to 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.429
 quote sands what he says fan of 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.610
 acid and hakuna matata and I forget the 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.519
 plus the main fallen kingdom when 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:23.269
 even I know still fallen 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:25.280
 kingdom when even name but otherwise it's 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:32.299
 true that it saddens us also months 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:34.100
 a little bit more we knew that 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.019
 it was still a youtube hours of 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.280
 we are laughing well word 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.230
 personally he was really doing nothing 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.549
 create things really very very 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.950
 interesting on his youtube channel 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.600
 by the way it's a shame they 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.440
 have all deleted or while they have 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.580
 taken 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.710
 it's impossible to find his videos 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.790
 on Youtube 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.220
 that's a shame because here we would have 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.160
 wanted to replay them to one can more 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:05.670
 finish I think it'll do when 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:11.100
 even a big victims finally it's good 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:13.200
 sad all that is life is life 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.150
 so here I am doing this video for 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.490
 you explain a little bit the an opinion 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.250
 staff on precisely on these 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.140
 reactions the fact that there is this is true 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.180
 that it's a pity and poultry goes on 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.400
 something else is life 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.319
 Why 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.939
 so here I present you his 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:35.010
 successor made in the back 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:37.810

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.000
 djinn I think it's good 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.849
 good if not really to give you my 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.459
 notice me I'm when I saw this 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.150
 video I was really disappointed but I 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.150
 understand his reaction 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.800
 he wants to move on I 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.390
 understand that for sure there was a 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.830
 period too I got a little bit 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.310
 the youtube site where I almost stopped 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.959
 videos like that I still like 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.340
 to fly his skis so that we 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.050
 please continue and do not 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.830
 you like it more you do not go 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.019
 I want it 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.850
 this video will have pleased you so it was 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.700
 in a small video it's for you 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.690
 explain a little bit what I think 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.910
 of all that 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.180
 in any case we lost anyway 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.940
 someone from 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.530
 in reference I find on youtube same 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.910
 if it was one of the first hours tubes 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.330
 to make videos on minecraft 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.160
 I think it was someone who 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.310
 give good ideas that launched him from 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.259
 very good concept and it will stop there 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.030
 that's how it's youtube 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.030
 you go everyone
