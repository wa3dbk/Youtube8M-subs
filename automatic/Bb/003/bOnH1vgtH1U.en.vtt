00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.130
 we did everything in unique tomato in the world we approach the world 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.129
 automobile from a point of view there it is about innovation design 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.520
 in this show we take stock of my Cuban cleland barguigner the

 we present you the brand new brewery recall the sports car 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.780
 to their spahic debt hours and we finish with the portrait of such 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.170
 ideas a concept and a belgian with a worldwide reputation 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.789
 I was not at the start 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:27.800
 oriented by my parents 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.160
 make city competition 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.070
 mechanical sports 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.509
 my first bike I read them high visibility hard train fight 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.690
 to convince my parents of 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.390
 to let me ride on my bike 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.610
 before making the competition tom the motorcyclist 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.580
 so I found myself six months later on motorcycles 500 centimeters 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.510
 cubes 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.840
 while initially I had asked for a Bikesolex 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.170
 i-tele 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.170
 for 100 th I made a career 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.250
 of 5,600 the trial 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.740
 and then I jumped quite by chance into the automobile by the 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.250
 meeting with a friend who offered me 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.559
 from the EU tinkering with a car during my military service 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:11.829
 and then of course 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.899
 there I had a career of ten years for 100 th 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:18.099
 in motor racing with more and more powerful cars 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.919
 ended with a formula to de-diabolize a 5000 formula of 500 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.219
 horses 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.989
 emc my last season I think this ad could say it was 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.479
 the apotheosis of my career since on nineteen races I won 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.609
 the nineteen shorts I beat 14 more records 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.609
 I had the law account of the king in 24 hours of Francorchamps 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:41.629
 I think it was difficult to do better yes stopped the competition 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:54.569
 it's a project that started in 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.229
 19 cents 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:58.429
 90 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:00.109
 % 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.729
 launch a car 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:04.599
 belga in belgium 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.519
 revolutionary burial since in e entirely composite materials 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:14.670
 practice wanted when we start with the project german and years 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.930
 91 and the elected 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.989
 a year later we presented the car at the auto show 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:25.549
 in the patio we had got the current fedis at a stadium in the patio 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.549
 and we presented the first prototype of the vertigo 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.259
 at the salon brussels after 

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:37.279
 really marked for the blacklist because there are not 36 solutions for 

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:38.909
 make a brand known 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.449
 how long do you have to wait 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.559
 or try to make 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:45.559
 I am an event 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:48.779
 and I think the most media event 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:51.509
 at world level been beating a world record 

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:55.419
 I had the opportunity to beat him to break the record from 0 to 100 with a 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.059
 dead bank a few years ago 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:00.399
 so that few things except health 

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:01.999
 1 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:03.959
 an event that could mark 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.519
 and I tried roba apple records with the vertigo 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.729
 and at that moment 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:12.529
 I the years flats 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:14.279
 in November 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:17.389
 and a few days later that I was presenting the car at the salon of 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:18.329
 strait 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.759
 by coming up with a world record 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:24.729
 its repression but terribly Americans have to do a score 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.129
 of minutes on cnn 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:28.939
 it's still not easy for small brands like us 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:31.879
 larry king did his show on our booth 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:34.879
 for 100 euros we had really% 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:38.249
 an incredible audience and percent 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:41.249
 2 a very warm welcome from the woman 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:54.279
 original gift also in the project of the widow clicquot must still 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:55.639
 not to forget it is that 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.719
 we are not just assemblers we have not made 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:01.249
 completely the car 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:04.740
 for samba is behind me for example parts 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.740
 of the competition car that are called mechanized welding 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.740
 e these tests from there pec niqab iation 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.240
 but the carbon molds 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.520
 bodywork chassis 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.180
 everything is made here 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.980
 but what have I not done yet and I would dream to do well 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.559
 it's very simple because I actually make cars but 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:29.719
 the passion of the really visceral is the bike so 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:33.509
 if a day came up could a little 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:36.600
 take a step back from the weather 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.490
 only returns 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.180
 allowed it 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.139
 a few hours of relaxation 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:43.669
 it's clear that 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:46.669
 2 my dream would be to build a 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:03.240
 in the book
