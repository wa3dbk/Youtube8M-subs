more<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.969> it<00:03:30.180> tastes<00:03:30.480> almost<00:03:30.599> almost

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
more and it tastes almost almost

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.860 
more and it tastes almost almost
identical<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.829> bread<00:03:32.069> is<00:03:32.250> very<00:03:33.120> delicious<00:03:33.419> it

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
identical the bread is very delicious it

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.649 
identical the bread is very delicious it
does<00:03:34.109> stand<00:03:34.319> out<00:03:34.879> but<00:03:35.879> it<00:03:35.970> needs<00:03:36.150> more<00:03:36.269> sauce<00:03:36.540> I

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
does stand out but it needs more sauce I

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.089 
does stand out but it needs more sauce I
think<00:03:36.810> that's<00:03:36.930> one<00:03:37.049> of<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:37.139> proofs<00:03:37.349> out<00:03:37.560> put

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
think that's one of the proofs out put

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.360 
think that's one of the proofs out put
put<00:03:38.699> more<00:03:38.879> sauce<00:03:39.620> maybe<00:03:40.620> put<00:03:40.889> a<00:03:40.919> cheese<00:03:41.129> on<00:03:41.280> the

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
put more sauce maybe put a cheese on the

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.149 
put more sauce maybe put a cheese on the
bottom<00:03:43.669> and<00:03:44.669> I<00:03:44.759> think<00:03:44.939> that's<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.889> just<00:03:46.889> put<00:03:47.129> a

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
bottom and I think that's it just put a

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.860 
bottom and I think that's it just put a
little<00:03:47.280> bit<00:03:47.370> more<00:03:47.459> house<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.419> cheese<00:03:48.689> in<00:03:48.810> the

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
little bit more house and cheese in the

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.059 
little bit more house and cheese in the
bottom<00:03:49.139> and<00:03:49.349> then<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:49.650> think<00:03:49.769> that<00:03:49.859> would

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
bottom and then I think that would

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.009 
bottom and then I think that would
really<00:03:50.310> enhance<00:03:50.489> it<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.120> then<00:03:51.239> something<00:03:51.870> I

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
really enhance it and then something I

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.689 
really enhance it and then something I
would<00:03:52.169> buy<00:03:52.290> again<00:03:52.409> I'm<00:03:53.280> kind<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.519> glad<00:03:53.609> I

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
would buy again I'm kind of glad I

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.099 
would buy again I'm kind of glad I

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.270
