use<00:05:45.659> for<00:05:46.580> me<00:05:53.509> this<00:05:54.509> might<00:05:54.689> be<00:05:54.719> kind<00:05:55.080> of<00:05:55.169> tedious

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
but I think if you're gonna buy

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:13.309 
but I think if you're gonna buy
something<00:05:58.619> online<00:05:58.830> you<00:06:00.439> should<00:06:12.110> so<00:06:13.110> this<00:06:13.289> is

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 
something online you should so this is

I think as far as we're on the bottom me

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.520 
I think as far as we're on the bottom me
turn<00:06:34.620> it<00:06:34.800> on<00:06:34.860> that<00:06:35.100> tables<00:06:35.990> cancel<00:06:36.990> the<00:06:37.110> extent

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
turn it on that tables cancel the extent

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:59.200 
turn it on that tables cancel the extent
of<00:06:37.590> that<00:06:40.280> and<00:06:41.280> again<00:06:42.470> no<00:06:43.470> way<00:06:43.680> on<00:06:43.919> the<00:06:44.039> bottom
