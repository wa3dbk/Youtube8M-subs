Barcelona Mobile World Congress and
we're<00:00:07.020> looking<00:00:07.230> at<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.379> new<00:00:07.500> l<00:00:07.710> series<00:00:08.010> of

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
we're looking at the new l series of

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.890 
we're looking at the new l series of
phone<00:00:08.550> so<00:00:08.820> these<00:00:08.940> are<00:00:09.030> phones<00:00:09.360> designed<00:00:09.719> with

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
phone so these are phones designed with

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.419 
phone so these are phones designed with
style<00:00:10.260> in<00:00:10.410> mind<00:00:10.530> they're<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> little<00:00:11.130> bit<00:00:11.309> on

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
style in mind they're a little bit on

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.919 
style in mind they're a little bit on
the<00:00:11.490> lower<00:00:11.700> end<00:00:11.910> but<00:00:12.150> they<00:00:12.360> come<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.809> variety

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
the lower end but they come in a variety

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.700 
the lower end but they come in a variety
of<00:00:13.730> sizes<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.000> levels<00:00:15.420> there's<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.990> l3<00:00:16.500> which

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
of sizes and levels there's the l3 which

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.700 
of sizes and levels there's the l3 which
is<00:00:16.859> right<00:00:17.039> here<00:00:17.270> and<00:00:18.270> then<00:00:18.359> we<00:00:18.449> have<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.779> l5

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
is right here and then we have the l5

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.410 
is right here and then we have the l5
down<00:00:20.039> here<00:00:22.789> if<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:23.880> look<00:00:24.000> over<00:00:24.119> there<00:00:24.240> that's

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
down here if we look over there that's

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.120 
down here if we look over there that's
going<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.750> be<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> L<00:00:25.500> settle<00:00:25.859> which<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.070> the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
going to be the L settle which is the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.679 
going to be the L settle which is the
most<00:00:26.279> time<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:26.820> we've<00:00:26.939> got<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.210> 1<00:00:27.420> gigahertz

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689

its<00:00:59.940> kind<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.180> got<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.329> unique<00:01:00.719> take<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.680> but

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
its kind of got a unique take on it but

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.080 
its kind of got a unique take on it but
you<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.010> save<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.219> does<00:01:03.140> multitasking<00:01:05.090> the

more ice cream sandwich button setup but

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.320 
more ice cream sandwich button setup but
was<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:07.979> far<00:01:08.340> where<00:01:08.490> buttons<00:01:08.790> not<00:01:09.000> we're<00:01:09.210> not

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
was so far where buttons not we're not

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.420 
was so far where buttons not we're not
using<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.689> software<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.260> spit<00:01:10.470> up<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.280> with

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
using the software but spit up so with

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.050 
using the software but spit up so with
the<00:01:11.520> l5<00:01:11.960> we<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> four<00:01:13.350> inch<00:01:13.500> display

the l5 we have a four inch display

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.850 
the l5 we have a four inch display
there's<00:01:15.060> also<00:01:15.210> again<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> 800<00:01:16.650> megahertz

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
there's also again the 800 megahertz

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.670 
there's also again the 800 megahertz

back<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.790> now<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.930> will<00:01:22.049> actually<00:01:22.229> carry<00:01:22.500> so

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
back and now this will actually carry so

NFC support inside
with<00:01:27.540> else<00:01:27.750> then<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.110> get<00:01:28.260> a<00:01:28.290> 1<00:01:28.440> gigahertz

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680

little<00:01:51.570> bit<00:01:51.780> thinner<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.590> actually<00:01:52.980> comes<00:01:53.160> on

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
little bit thinner it actually comes on

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.000 
little bit thinner it actually comes on
but<00:01:53.970> uh<00:01:54.030> actually<00:01:54.870> bite<00:01:55.260> feels<00:01:55.590> nice<00:01:55.800> in<00:01:55.830> the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
hand but again these are going to be

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.370 
hand but again these are going to be
mostly<00:02:00.030> about<00:02:00.300> that<00:02:00.479> looks<00:02:00.690> mostly<00:02:01.080> about

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
mostly about that looks mostly about

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.690 
mostly about that looks mostly about
kind<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.490> upping<00:02:03.000> your<00:02:03.080> style<00:02:04.080> quotient

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
kind of upping your style quotient

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.500 
kind of upping your style quotient
quotient<00:02:07.490> without<00:02:08.490> adding<00:02:08.910> too<00:02:09.030> much<00:02:09.240> power

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
quotient without adding too much power

quotient without adding too much power
so<00:02:09.660> these<00:02:10.020> are<00:02:10.170> not<00:02:10.410> going<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.649> be<00:02:10.740> necessarily

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
so these are not going to be necessarily
