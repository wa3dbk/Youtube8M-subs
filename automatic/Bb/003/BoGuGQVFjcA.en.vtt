00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
Schneider have put together a winning

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.490 
Schneider have put together a winning
formula<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.300> sure<00:00:39.420> there<00:00:39.629> but<00:00:39.809> every<00:00:40.320> team

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
formula for sure there but every team

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.319 
formula for sure there but every team
every<00:00:40.530> organization<00:00:41.399> has<00:00:41.430> weaknesses<00:00:42.149> what

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
every organization has weaknesses what

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.910 
every organization has weaknesses what
are<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.480> weaknesses<00:00:42.750> right<00:00:43.290> now<00:00:43.469> going<00:00:43.770> into

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
are the weaknesses right now going into

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.860 
are the weaknesses right now going into
camp<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.700> Seahawks<00:00:45.000> there<00:00:45.450> isn't<00:00:45.719> many

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
camp for the Seahawks there isn't many

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.540 
camp for the Seahawks there isn't many
but<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.410> think<00:00:46.710> one<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> weaknesses<00:00:47.250> that

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
but I think one of the weaknesses that

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.130 
but I think one of the weaknesses that
they<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.969> focus<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.660> their<00:00:48.870> inability

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
they have to focus on is their inability

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.520 
they have to focus on is their inability
to<00:00:49.770> utilize<00:00:50.219> every<00:00:50.879> player<00:00:51.149> every<00:00:51.180> game<00:00:51.780> what

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
to utilize every player every game what

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.860 
to utilize every player every game what
we<00:00:52.649> saw<00:00:52.860> last<00:00:53.010> year<00:00:53.520> guys<00:00:54.059> would<00:00:54.329> disappear

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
we saw last year guys would disappear

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.240 
we saw last year guys would disappear
for<00:00:55.110> periods<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.620> time<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.010> they<00:00:56.070> would

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
for periods of time and they would

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.670 
for periods of time and they would
reimburse<00:00:56.719> games<00:00:57.719> later<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.289> make<00:00:58.469> plays

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
reimburse games later and make plays

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.590 
reimburse games later and make plays
like<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.070> Luke<00:00:59.340> Wilson<00:00:59.820> at<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.149> tight<00:01:00.449> end

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
like a Luke Wilson at the tight end

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.389

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
and consistent is that all of their

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.300 
and consistent is that all of their
weapons<00:01:09.960> will<00:01:10.290> continue<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.770> make<00:01:10.979> plays

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
weapons will continue to make plays

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.460 
weapons will continue to make plays
every<00:01:12.090> single<00:01:12.390> game<00:01:12.510> like<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> Robert<00:01:13.200> Turbin

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
every single game like a Robert Turbin

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.590 
every single game like a Robert Turbin
you<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.310> combine<00:01:14.520> him<00:01:14.939> with<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.270> talents

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
you have to combine him with the talents

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600 
you have to combine him with the talents
of<00:01:15.659> Marshawn<00:01:16.140> Lynch<00:01:16.350> they<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:17.009> talent<00:01:17.490> I

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
of Marshawn Lynch they have talent I

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.280 
of Marshawn Lynch they have talent I
think<00:01:17.939> they<00:01:18.060> have<00:01:18.240> some<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> best<00:01:18.689> depth

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
think they have some of the best depth

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.289 
think they have some of the best depth
in<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> NFL<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:20.250> they<00:01:20.729> got<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.060> learn<00:01:21.240> to

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
in the NFL but they got to learn to

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.240 
in the NFL but they got to learn to
utilize<00:01:21.600> every<00:01:22.380> player<00:01:22.650> every<00:01:22.680> game<00:01:23.220> you

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
utilize every player every game you

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.010 
utilize every player every game you
can't<00:01:23.520> afford<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.909> have<00:01:24.030> guys<00:01:24.240> disappear<00:01:24.900> for

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
can't afford to have guys disappear for

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.899 
can't afford to have guys disappear for
weeks<00:01:25.049> at<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.380> time<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:26.400> interesting<00:01:26.610> that

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
weeks at a time it's interesting that

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.120 
weeks at a time it's interesting that
the<00:01:27.180> point<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.540> bring<00:01:27.689> up<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.470> Patriots<00:01:28.979> do

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
the point you bring up the Patriots do

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.249 
the point you bring up the Patriots do
this<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.909> they<00:01:30.119> tend<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.479> like<00:01:30.600> mix<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.110> match

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
this and they tend to like mix and match

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.960 
this and they tend to like mix and match
sometimes<00:01:31.890> perhaps<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.430> Seahawks<00:01:32.790> are

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
sometimes perhaps the Seahawks are

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.390 
sometimes perhaps the Seahawks are
trying<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.299> match<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.200> formula<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
trying to match that formula that the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.649 
trying to match that formula that the
Patriots<00:01:35.759> for<00:01:35.880> over<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.090> years<00:01:36.180> all<00:01:36.540> right

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
Patriots for over the years all right

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.999 
Patriots for over the years all right
