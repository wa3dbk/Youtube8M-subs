we are running two point two point one
which<00:05:43.480> I<00:05:43.990> would<00:05:44.260> normally<00:05:44.380> be<00:05:44.740> kind<00:05:45.130> of

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
which I would normally be kind of

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.800 
which I would normally be kind of
benefit<00:05:45.550> about<00:05:45.640> and<00:05:46.030> I<00:05:46.060> do<00:05:46.120> think<00:05:46.480> it's<00:05:46.600> a<00:05:46.660> bit

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
benefit about and I do think it's a bit

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.960 
benefit about and I do think it's a bit
ridiculous<00:05:47.200> that<00:05:47.560> we're<00:05:47.860> not<00:05:48.040> shipping

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
ridiculous that we're not shipping

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:49.890 
ridiculous that we're not shipping
everything<00:05:49.180> with<00:05:49.390> Gingerbread

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
everything with Gingerbread

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.590 
everything with Gingerbread
but<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:51.220> performance<00:05:51.820> of<00:05:51.910> this<00:05:52.000> phone<00:05:52.270> isn't

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
but the performance of this phone isn't

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.010 
but the performance of this phone isn't
so<00:05:53.140> bad

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
so bad

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.790 
so bad
you<00:05:54.590> know<00:05:54.740> I'm<00:05:55.580> going<00:05:55.879> to<00:05:56.000> get<00:05:56.150> up<00:05:56.270> in<00:05:56.800> arms

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
you know I'm going to get up in arms

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.510 
you know I'm going to get up in arms
about<00:05:57.979> it

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
about it

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.920 
about it
I<00:05:58.550> think<00:05:59.030> they've<00:05:59.120> skinned<00:05:59.419> it<00:05:59.509> really<00:05:59.750> well

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
I think they've skinned it really well

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.779 
I think they've skinned it really well
and<00:06:00.289> I<00:06:00.860> think<00:06:00.919> that<00:06:01.160> it's<00:06:01.280> running<00:06:01.520> pretty

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:01.789 
and I think that it's running pretty

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:04.480 
and I think that it's running pretty
smoothly<00:06:02.180> in<00:06:02.539> this<00:06:02.690> hands-on<00:06:03.139> you<00:06:04.039> don't<00:06:04.280> get

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
smoothly in this hands-on you don't get

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.330 
smoothly in this hands-on you don't get
a<00:06:04.520> lot<00:06:04.789> of<00:06:04.849> onboard<00:06:05.569> storage

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
a lot of onboard storage

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.939 
a lot of onboard storage
unfortunately<00:06:07.340> you<00:06:07.460> get<00:06:07.690> 512<00:06:08.690> megs<00:06:09.229> standard

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:09.949 
unfortunately you get 512 megs standard

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:12.070 
unfortunately you get 512 megs standard
and<00:06:10.190> just<00:06:11.150> with<00:06:11.300> what<00:06:11.449> the<00:06:11.539> system<00:06:11.840> is<00:06:11.930> using

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
and just with what the system is using

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.320 
and just with what the system is using
in<00:06:12.319> my<00:06:12.440> absence<00:06:12.650> all<00:06:13.129> but<00:06:13.310> we're<00:06:13.430> down<00:06:13.490> to<00:06:13.669> 424

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
in my absence all but we're down to 424

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.629 
in my absence all but we're down to 424
already<00:06:14.629> so<00:06:15.379> could<00:06:16.099> have<00:06:16.190> asked<00:06:16.340> for<00:06:16.430> little

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
already so could have asked for little

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.460 
already so could have asked for little
bit<00:06:16.729> more<00:06:16.789> storage<00:06:17.210> but<00:06:17.569> it<00:06:17.900> does<00:06:18.080> support<00:06:18.379> up

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
bit more storage but it does support up

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.939 
bit more storage but it does support up
to<00:06:18.500> 32<00:06:18.740> gigabyte<00:06:19.539> micro<00:06:20.539> sd<00:06:20.900> so<00:06:21.349> that<00:06:21.560> is<00:06:21.740> one

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:21.949 
to 32 gigabyte micro sd so that is one

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:24.790 
to 32 gigabyte micro sd so that is one
way<00:06:22.099> to<00:06:22.129> get<00:06:22.370> through<00:06:22.580> it<00:06:22.729> and<00:06:23.740> otherwise<00:06:24.740> I

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
way to get through it and otherwise I

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.450 
way to get through it and otherwise I
mean<00:06:25.220> there's<00:06:25.909> no<00:06:26.650> single<00:06:27.650> app<00:06:27.889> that<00:06:28.159> is<00:06:28.280> so

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
mean there's no single app that is so

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.129 
mean there's no single app that is so
compelling<00:06:28.789> I<00:06:29.030> feel<00:06:29.300> like<00:06:29.419> I<00:06:29.479> need<00:06:29.659> to<00:06:29.690> show<00:06:29.960> it

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:30.139 
compelling I feel like I need to show it

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:31.719 
compelling I feel like I need to show it
just<00:06:30.289> that<00:06:30.380> there's<00:06:30.560> a<00:06:30.620> lot<00:06:30.680> of<00:06:30.800> 18t<00:06:31.340> stuff<00:06:31.610> and

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:31.729 
just that there's a lot of 18t stuff and

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:33.249 
just that there's a lot of 18t stuff and
