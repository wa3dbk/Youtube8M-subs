their<00:00:28.800> toes<00:00:29.010> into<00:00:29.279> pvp<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.119> they<00:00:30.270> don't<00:00:30.420> really

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
their toes into pvp so they don't really

which piece of armor i want now the next
to<00:01:30.360> our<00:01:30.600> tokens<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.440> on<00:01:31.910> arcane<00:01:32.910> orb<00:01:32.940> arcane

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
to our tokens and on arcane orb arcane

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.900 
to our tokens and on arcane orb arcane
crystal<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.260> arcane<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.860> slivers<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.730> pick

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
crystal and arcane so slivers you pick

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.930 
crystal and arcane so slivers you pick
one<00:01:36.120> of<00:01:36.240> these<00:01:36.360> three<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.870> then<00:01:37.610> these<00:01:38.610> three

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
one of these three and then these three

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.690 
one of these three and then these three
basically<00:01:39.800> determine<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:40.920> quality<00:01:41.160> of<00:01:41.400> gear

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
like level 30 plus then maybe you could

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.700 
like level 30 plus then maybe you could
look<00:02:34.330> up<00:02:34.510> different<00:02:35.020> types<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.260> gear<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:35.500> you

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
look up different types of gear that you

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.500 
look up different types of gear that you
could<00:02:35.890> get<00:02:36.040> with<00:02:36.160> chip<00:02:37.000> with<00:02:37.150> your<00:02:37.330> ring

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
could get with chip with your ring

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.710 
could get with chip with your ring
tokens<00:02:37.900> instead<00:02:38.290> but<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.700> as<00:02:40.120> far<00:02:40.390> as<00:02:40.570> like

to make anything in the mystic forage

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.670 
to make anything in the mystic forage
you<00:02:51.550> need<00:02:51.730> five<00:02:51.940> arcane<00:02:52.300> powder<00:02:52.690> that<00:02:53.560> he

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
piece of our minds so you tell the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.680 
piece of our minds so you tell the
mystic<00:03:06.190> forge<00:03:06.400> what<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:06.700> want<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.660> then

mystic forge what you want and then

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.630 
mystic forge what you want and then
these<00:03:07.960> are<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.290> two<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.890> specified<00:03:09.460> the

I'll<00:03:16.660> do<00:03:16.840> a<00:03:16.870> video<00:03:17.140> later<00:03:17.470> on<00:03:17.680> showing<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:18.130> how

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
I'll do a video later on showing you how

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.090 
I'll do a video later on showing you how
to<00:03:18.340> make<00:03:18.670> more<00:03:19.000> of<00:03:19.060> each<00:03:19.480> so<00:03:19.870> I<00:03:19.900> have<00:03:20.290> 35<00:03:20.770> arcane

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
to make more of each so I have 35 arcane

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.530 
to make more of each so I have 35 arcane
whores<00:03:21.280> I<00:03:21.490> could<00:03:21.640> actually<00:03:21.760> turn<00:03:22.090> those<00:03:22.330> into

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
whores I could actually turn those into

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.170 
whores I could actually turn those into
more<00:03:22.810> crystals<00:03:23.320> so<00:03:24.160> I<00:03:24.190> can<00:03:24.670> make<00:03:24.820> more

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
more crystals so I can make more

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.910 
more crystals so I can make more
slippers<00:03:25.630> later<00:03:25.870> on<00:03:26.080> because<00:03:26.440> slivers<00:03:26.800> are

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
slippers later on because slivers are

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.950 
slippers later on because slivers are
