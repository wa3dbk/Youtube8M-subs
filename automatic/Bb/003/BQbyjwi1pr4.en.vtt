poison<00:00:18.890> which<00:00:19.609> in<00:00:19.759> my<00:00:19.880> opinion<00:00:19.999> is<00:00:20.419> pretty

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
poison which in my opinion is pretty

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.269 
poison which in my opinion is pretty
awesome<00:00:20.929> because<00:00:21.470> of<00:00:21.769> the<00:00:21.829> four<00:00:22.039> times

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
awesome because of the four times

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.359 
awesome because of the four times
resistance<00:00:22.669> to<00:00:23.089> fighting<00:00:23.539> and<00:00:23.720> grass<00:00:24.140> which<00:00:25.099> I

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
resistance to fighting and grass which I

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.399 
resistance to fighting and grass which I
find<00:00:25.609> to<00:00:25.699> be<00:00:25.789> very<00:00:25.880> useful<00:00:26.119> especially<00:00:26.599> for

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:27.409 
find to be very useful especially for

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:28.720 
find to be very useful especially for
the<00:00:27.470> fighting<00:00:27.800> portion<00:00:28.220> since<00:00:28.489> fighting

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730

the fighting portion since fighting
types<00:00:29.060> are<00:00:29.210> everywhere<00:00:29.689> in<00:00:29.749> competitive

types are everywhere in competitive

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:33.160 
types are everywhere in competitive
battling<00:00:30.829> but<00:00:31.789> a<00:00:32.119> lot<00:00:32.599> of<00:00:32.630> people<00:00:32.899> would<00:00:33.020> argue

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
battling but a lot of people would argue

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.259 
battling but a lot of people would argue
that<00:00:33.380> it<00:00:33.590> is<00:00:33.620> kind<00:00:33.980> of<00:00:34.070> bad<00:00:34.280> just<00:00:34.579> because<00:00:34.730> it

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:35.269 
that it is kind of bad just because it

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:36.970 
that it is kind of bad just because it
is<00:00:35.449> a<00:00:35.480> bug<00:00:35.840> type<00:00:36.109> so<00:00:36.440> that<00:00:36.590> means<00:00:36.769> it's<00:00:36.920> going

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
is a bug type so that means it's going

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.619 
is a bug type so that means it's going
to<00:00:37.070> be<00:00:37.219> taking<00:00:37.550> extra<00:00:37.910> damage<00:00:38.090> from<00:00:38.390> Stealth

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
to be taking extra damage from Stealth

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.229 
to be taking extra damage from Stealth
Rock<00:00:38.780> but<00:00:39.679> in<00:00:39.890> my<00:00:40.039> opinion<00:00:40.190> it<00:00:40.579> really<00:00:40.820> doesn't

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
Rock but in my opinion it really doesn't

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.869 
Rock but in my opinion it really doesn't
hinder<00:00:41.420> it<00:00:41.629> that<00:00:41.840> much<00:00:42.050> as<00:00:42.379> for<00:00:43.280> its<00:00:43.399> abilities

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
hinder it that much as for its abilities

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:45.520 
hinder it that much as for its abilities
though<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.660> first<00:00:44.899> one<00:00:45.109> that<00:00:45.140> I<00:00:45.289> got

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
though the first one that I got

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.950 
though the first one that I got
previously<00:00:46.250> is<00:00:46.609> still<00:00:47.269> the<00:00:47.390> best<00:00:47.420> ability

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
previously is still the best ability

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.509 
previously is still the best ability
that<00:00:48.109> it<00:00:48.199> has<00:00:48.350> which<00:00:48.649> is<00:00:48.800> on<00:00:48.890> a<00:00:48.980> shield<00:00:49.280> dust

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
that it has which is on a shield dust

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.840 
that it has which is on a shield dust
which<00:00:50.269> is<00:00:50.660> a<00:00:50.719> awesome<00:00:51.589> ability<00:00:52.280> that<00:00:52.460> makes<00:00:52.670> it

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
which is a awesome ability that makes it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.639 
which is a awesome ability that makes it
so<00:00:52.999> that<00:00:53.030> secondary<00:00:53.660> effects<00:00:54.230> will<00:00:54.469> never

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
so that secondary effects will never

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.489 
so that secondary effects will never
occur<00:00:55.039> such<00:00:55.879> as<00:00:55.910> like<00:00:56.390> flinching<00:00:56.960> as<00:00:57.170> like<00:00:57.469> a

shield dust which is really awesome for
dustox<00:01:16.160> but<00:01:17.150> as<00:01:17.270> for<00:01:17.300> its<00:01:17.540> true<00:01:17.720> moldability

dustox but as for its true moldability
compound<00:01:18.800> eyes<00:01:18.980> it's<00:01:19.910> not<00:01:20.090> really<00:01:20.270> useful<00:01:20.750> on

compound eyes it's not really useful on

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.080 
compound eyes it's not really useful on
dustox<00:01:21.350> at<00:01:21.680> all<00:01:21.950> because<00:01:22.550> even<00:01:22.970> though

by thirty percent dustox doesn't have

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.530 
by thirty percent dustox doesn't have

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
sludge even because it can be used

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.170 
sludge even because it can be used
against<00:03:48.740> trickers<00:03:49.130> but<00:03:49.520> at<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:49.730> same<00:03:49.940> time

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
black sludge can also trick it back onto

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.810 
black sludge can also trick it back onto
another<00:03:54.290> pokemon<00:03:54.950> of<00:03:54.980> yours<00:03:55.310> that<00:03:55.400> isn't<00:03:55.790> a

another pokemon of yours that isn't a
poison-type<00:03:56.270> so<00:03:56.960> it's<00:03:57.110> kind<00:03:57.320> of<00:03:57.440> like<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:57.770> risky

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.469 
choice between roost and moonlight
basically<00:04:57.650> determined<00:04:58.490> or<00:04:58.639> is<00:04:58.849> dependent

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
basically determined or is dependent

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:00.850 
basically determined or is dependent
upon<00:04:59.539> what<00:04:59.900> kind<00:05:00.139> of<00:05:00.199> team<00:05:00.470> you're<00:05:00.620> running

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
upon what kind of team you're running

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.589 
upon what kind of team you're running
roost<00:05:01.550> is<00:05:01.819> usually<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.210> better<00:05:02.330> choice

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
roost is usually the better choice

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.050 
roost is usually the better choice
because<00:05:03.050> it<00:05:03.169> has<00:05:03.349> more<00:05:03.680> PP<00:05:04.099> then<00:05:04.639> moonlight

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
because it has more PP then moonlight

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.170 
because it has more PP then moonlight
does<00:05:05.300> but<00:05:06.169> it<00:05:06.680> doesn't<00:05:07.130> necessarily<00:05:07.759> need<00:05:07.789> to

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
does but it doesn't necessarily need to

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.180 
does but it doesn't necessarily need to
be<00:05:08.300> used<00:05:08.569> because<00:05:08.780> it<00:05:09.530> doesn't<00:05:09.919> get<00:05:09.979> rid<00:05:10.159> of

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
be used because it doesn't get rid of

be used because it doesn't get rid of
dustox<00:05:10.669> as<00:05:10.880> flying<00:05:11.150> typing<00:05:11.630> since<00:05:11.870> it<00:05:11.990> isn't<00:05:12.110> a

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:12.259 
dustox as flying typing since it isn't a

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:14.409 
dustox as flying typing since it isn't a
flying<00:05:12.530> type<00:05:12.740> but<00:05:13.490> moonlight<00:05:13.880> would<00:05:14.120> be<00:05:14.240> the

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
flying type but moonlight would be the

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.240 
flying type but moonlight would be the
preferred<00:05:14.810> set<00:05:15.080> if<00:05:15.289> you're<00:05:15.440> going<00:05:15.530> to<00:05:15.620> start<00:05:16.190> a

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
preferred set if you're going to start a

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.830 
preferred set if you're going to start a
preferred<00:05:16.550> mood<00:05:16.759> if<00:05:17.000> we're<00:05:17.449> going<00:05:17.599> to<00:05:17.690> be

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
preferred mood if we're going to be

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.589 
preferred mood if we're going to be
using<00:05:17.870> a<00:05:18.259> son<00:05:18.530> team<00:05:18.800> because<00:05:19.639> moonlight<00:05:20.210> gets

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 
using a son team because moonlight gets

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:23.920 
using a son team because moonlight gets
a<00:05:20.810> boost<00:05:21.560> in<00:05:21.889> the<00:05:22.460> sun<00:05:22.669> recovering<00:05:23.479> two-thirds

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
a boost in the sun recovering two-thirds

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.960 
a boost in the sun recovering two-thirds
of<00:05:24.080> your<00:05:24.199> help<00:05:24.409> as<00:05:24.620> opposed<00:05:25.009> to<00:05:25.280> just<00:05:25.310> one<00:05:25.729> half

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
of your help as opposed to just one half

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.089 
of your help as opposed to just one half
so<00:05:26.690> it<00:05:26.810> really<00:05:26.990> depends<00:05:27.380> on<00:05:27.470> kind<00:05:27.800> of<00:05:27.949> team

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099 
so it really depends on kind of team

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:30.249 
so it really depends on kind of team
you're<00:05:28.250> running<00:05:28.460> bug<00:05:29.360> buzz<00:05:29.569> is<00:05:29.840> there<00:05:30.050> as

you're running bug buzz is there as

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:32.350 
you're running bug buzz is there as
you're<00:05:30.440> only<00:05:30.590> attacking<00:05:30.949> move<00:05:31.250> because<00:05:32.030> it<00:05:32.210> is

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
you're only attacking move because it is

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.689 
you're only attacking move because it is
probably<00:05:32.810> dustox<00:05:33.259> is<00:05:33.469> best<00:05:33.710> move<00:05:33.949> to<00:05:34.130> use<00:05:34.280> for

probably dustox is best move to use for

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.430 
probably dustox is best move to use for
attacking<00:05:34.969> unless<00:05:35.479> of<00:05:35.630> course<00:05:35.659> you<00:05:35.990> want<00:05:36.229> to

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
attacking unless of course you want to

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.620 
attacking unless of course you want to
run<00:05:36.680> some<00:05:37.340> type<00:05:37.550> of<00:05:37.580> hidden<00:05:37.849> power<00:05:38.180> that<00:05:38.479> you

run some type of hidden power that you

different options that bug buzz can't

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.379 
different options that bug buzz can't
but<00:05:43.099> for<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:43.370> purposes<00:05:43.759> of<00:05:43.820> having<00:05:44.150> a<00:05:44.210> nice

but for the purposes of having a nice
stab<00:05:44.690> move<00:05:44.960> and<00:05:45.229> being<00:05:45.440> super<00:05:45.650> effective

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
against grass dark and psychic i prefer

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.070 
against grass dark and psychic i prefer
to<00:05:49.310> have<00:05:49.490> that<00:05:49.699> and<00:05:49.969> obviously<00:05:50.210> toxic<00:05:50.960> is

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
to have that and obviously toxic is

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.770 
to have that and obviously toxic is
there<00:05:51.229> to<00:05:51.469> allow<00:05:51.680> you<00:05:51.740> to<00:05:51.830> toxic<00:05:52.219> stall<00:05:52.430> so<00:05:53.419> in

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
there to allow you to toxic stall so in

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.779 
there to allow you to toxic stall so in
my<00:05:53.930> opinion<00:05:54.020> though<00:05:54.440> in<00:05:54.650> using<00:05:55.039> the<00:05:55.130> set<00:05:55.370> it<00:05:55.580> is

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
my opinion though in using the set it is

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.390 
my opinion though in using the set it is
very<00:05:56.090> very<00:05:56.210> useful<00:05:56.900> and<00:05:57.349> effective<00:05:57.560> against<00:05:58.280> a

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
very very useful and effective against a

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.029 
very very useful and effective against a
lot<00:05:58.580> of<00:05:58.729> things<00:05:58.909> that<00:05:59.330> maybe<00:06:00.020> try<00:06:00.469> to<00:06:00.500> out

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
lot of things that maybe try to out

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:03.939 
lot of things that maybe try to out
stall<00:06:01.460> you<00:06:01.639> in<00:06:01.789> a<00:06:01.880> way<00:06:02.030> because<00:06:02.710> dustox<00:06:03.710> is

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:03.949 
stall you in a way because dustox is

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:06.070 
stall you in a way because dustox is
probably<00:06:04.340> one<00:06:04.580> of<00:06:04.610> the<00:06:04.819> best<00:06:05.030> stallers<00:06:05.750> by

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
probably one of the best stallers by

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.309 
probably one of the best stallers by
using<00:06:06.319> the<00:06:06.530> set<00:06:06.830> due<00:06:07.520> to<00:06:07.669> the<00:06:08.210> amount<00:06:08.930> of<00:06:09.050> bulk

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:09.319 
using the set due to the amount of bulk

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:11.260 
using the set due to the amount of bulk
it<00:06:09.500> can<00:06:09.650> have<00:06:09.860> from<00:06:10.219> the<00:06:10.340> quiver<00:06:10.550> dances<00:06:11.000> and

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
it can have from the quiver dances and

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.290 
it can have from the quiver dances and
the<00:06:11.840> EV<00:06:12.080> spread<00:06:12.409> and<00:06:12.590> defense<00:06:12.860> so<00:06:13.789> i<00:06:13.819> really

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
the EV spread and defense so i really

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.240 
the EV spread and defense so i really
really<00:06:14.509> like<00:06:14.780> using<00:06:14.960> the<00:06:15.110> set<00:06:15.440> especially<00:06:15.740> in

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
really like using the set especially in

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.999 
really like using the set especially in
like<00:06:16.430> the<00:06:16.639> lower<00:06:16.849> tiers<00:06:17.330> like<00:06:17.719> nu<00:06:18.169> or<00:06:18.199> ru<00:06:18.710> or

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:19.009 
like the lower tiers like nu or ru or

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:21.459 
like the lower tiers like nu or ru or
whatever<00:06:19.490> but<00:06:20.240> the<00:06:20.569> great<00:06:20.719> thing<00:06:20.750> about<00:06:20.990> it<00:06:21.319> is

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:21.469 
whatever but the great thing about it is

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:23.559 
whatever but the great thing about it is
that<00:06:21.530> even<00:06:22.009> though<00:06:22.280> the<00:06:22.490> set<00:06:22.759> is<00:06:22.969> really

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:23.569 
that even though the set is really

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:26.170 
that even though the set is really
really<00:06:23.840> bad<00:06:24.069> against<00:06:25.069> steel<00:06:25.490> type<00:06:25.729> pokemon

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
really bad against steel type pokemon

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.540 
really bad against steel type pokemon
there<00:06:26.810> really<00:06:26.990> aren't<00:06:27.289> that<00:06:27.530> many<00:06:27.949> in<00:06:28.280> the

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
there really aren't that many in the

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.850 
there really aren't that many in the
lower<00:06:28.729> tiers<00:06:29.150> because<00:06:29.840> most<00:06:30.440> of<00:06:30.590> the<00:06:30.710> good

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
lower tiers because most of the good

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.249 
lower tiers because most of the good
steel<00:06:31.130> types<00:06:31.370> are<00:06:31.610> upper<00:06:32.030> so<00:06:32.599> you<00:06:32.690> can<00:06:32.990> still

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:33.259 
steel types are upper so you can still

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.770 
steel types are upper so you can still
toxic<00:06:33.770> a<00:06:33.889> majority<00:06:34.310> of<00:06:34.340> things<00:06:34.639> and<00:06:34.969> bug<00:06:35.569> buzz

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
toxic a majority of things and bug buzz

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.600 
toxic a majority of things and bug buzz
will<00:06:36.020> still<00:06:36.199> not<00:06:36.469> be<00:06:36.530> that<00:06:36.830> resisted<00:06:37.370> because

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
will still not be that resisted because

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.579 
will still not be that resisted because

there won't be really any steel types to

against poison
types<00:06:42.919> too<00:06:43.280> but<00:06:43.699> pretty<00:06:44.630> much<00:06:44.840> anything<00:06:45.169> that

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
types too but pretty much anything that

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.309 
types too but pretty much anything that
you<00:06:45.710> can<00:06:45.889> toxic<00:06:46.400> you<00:06:46.789> will<00:06:46.910> be<00:06:47.060> able<00:06:47.150> to<00:06:47.330> beat

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 
you can toxic you will be able to beat

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.770 
you can toxic you will be able to beat
because<00:06:49.280> actually<00:06:50.060> earlier<00:06:50.300> today<00:06:50.509> I<00:06:50.630> was

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:50.780 
because actually earlier today I was

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.379 
because actually earlier today I was
playing<00:06:51.229> a<00:06:51.530> little<00:06:51.770> bit<00:06:51.919> and<00:06:52.160> I<00:06:52.490> ax<00:06:52.669> actually

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:53.389 
playing a little bit and I ax actually

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:56.290 
playing a little bit and I ax actually
toxic<00:06:53.630> stalled<00:06:54.139> a<00:06:54.349> yanmega<00:06:54.949> which<00:06:55.759> is<00:06:55.940> really

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300 
toxic stalled a yanmega which is really

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.450 
toxic stalled a yanmega which is really
funny<00:06:56.479> because<00:06:56.840> it<00:06:57.470> kept<00:06:57.740> air<00:06:57.919> slashing<00:06:58.370> me

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
funny because it kept air slashing me

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.249 
funny because it kept air slashing me
and<00:06:58.699> obviously<00:06:58.819> I<00:06:59.120> can't<00:06:59.479> get<00:06:59.599> flinched<00:07:00.080> and

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:00.259 
and obviously I can't get flinched and

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:02.350 
and obviously I can't get flinched and
because<00:07:00.889> i<00:07:00.919> had<00:07:01.160> a<00:07:01.190> couple<00:07:01.370> quiver<00:07:01.729> dances<00:07:02.150> set

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
because i had a couple quiver dances set

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.420 
because i had a couple quiver dances set
up<00:07:02.479> already<00:07:02.660> I<00:07:03.110> wasn't<00:07:03.740> taking<00:07:04.130> a<00:07:04.190> lot<00:07:04.310> of

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.430 
up already I wasn't taking a lot of

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.559 
up already I wasn't taking a lot of
damage<00:07:04.610> to<00:07:04.880> them<00:07:05.030> due<00:07:05.180> to<00:07:05.270> the<00:07:05.389> special

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:05.569 
damage to them due to the special

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:08.110 
damage to them due to the special
defense<00:07:05.960> boosts<00:07:06.410> so<00:07:07.099> in<00:07:07.370> my<00:07:07.520> opinion<00:07:07.639> this<00:07:08.060> is

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 
defense boosts so in my opinion this is

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.520 
defense boosts so in my opinion this is
an<00:07:08.330> excellent<00:07:08.599> set<00:07:08.930> if<00:07:09.080> you're<00:07:09.229> going<00:07:09.319> to<00:07:09.380> ever
