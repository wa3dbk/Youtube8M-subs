00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
around at these boats that creativity

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.280 
around at these boats that creativity
isn't<00:00:32.579> meant<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> see<00:00:33.060> and<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.750> themes<00:00:34.020> that

isn't meant to see and the themes that

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.200 
isn't meant to see and the themes that
people<00:00:34.710> are<00:00:34.800> now<00:00:34.950> dressing<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.789> fit<00:00:35.969> their

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
people are now dressing to fit their

people are now dressing to fit their
boats<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.750> think<00:00:37.019> that's<00:00:37.230> fantastic<00:00:38.039> I'm<00:00:38.399> Ringo

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
the spirit I raise chickens and so that

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.279 
the spirit I raise chickens and so that
forgive<00:00:52.559> me<00:00:52.679> the<00:00:52.800> idea<00:00:53.100> for<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> boat

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.130 

we're<00:00:56.859> slaying<00:00:57.789> debt<00:00:58.120> for<00:00:58.329> our<00:00:58.390> members<00:00:58.780> and

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
we're slaying debt for our members and

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.840 
we're slaying debt for our members and
this<00:00:59.320> is<00:00:59.440> actually<00:00:59.769> the<00:00:59.859> dead<00:01:00.070> monster

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
this is actually the dead monster

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.289 
this is actually the dead monster
and<00:01:01.030> so<00:01:01.629> Earth's<00:01:01.899> why<00:01:02.170> in<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.469> water

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
and so Earth's why in the water

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.480 
and so Earth's why in the water
boy<00:01:04.659> if<00:01:04.839> it<00:01:04.960> sinks<00:01:05.199> into<00:01:05.439> submarines<00:01:06.039> so<00:01:06.310> we'll

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
boy if it sinks into submarines so we'll

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.270 
boy if it sinks into submarines so we'll
be<00:01:06.579> doing<00:01:06.700> this<00:01:06.850> job<00:01:07.119> and<00:01:07.630> so<00:01:07.829> we're<00:01:08.829> fine

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
be doing this job and so we're fine

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.060 
be doing this job and so we're fine
I<00:01:10.369> hope<00:01:11.270> it'll<00:01:11.479> float<00:01:11.720> but<00:01:12.020> if<00:01:12.440> it<00:01:12.590> does<00:01:12.770> sing

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
I hope it'll float but if it does sing

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.560 
I hope it'll float but if it does sing
I'm<00:01:13.369> gonna<00:01:13.520> ride<00:01:14.090> it<00:01:14.240> all<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.450> way<00:01:14.540> down

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
I'm gonna ride it all the way down

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.090 
I'm gonna ride it all the way down
though<00:01:14.930> I'll<00:01:15.080> go<00:01:15.260> down<00:01:15.470> with<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.710> boat<00:01:15.860> we've

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
though I'll go down with the boat we've

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.940 
though I'll go down with the boat we've
got<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.460> fat<00:01:16.670> free<00:01:16.880> cornucopia<00:01:17.600> it<00:01:18.320> resembles

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
got the fat free cornucopia it resembles

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.680 
got the fat free cornucopia it resembles
an<00:01:19.040> icy<00:01:19.340> air<00:01:19.460> of<00:01:19.549> Missouri<00:01:19.880> corn<00:01:20.240> we're<00:01:20.570> gonna

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
an icy air of Missouri corn we're gonna

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.120 
an icy air of Missouri corn we're gonna
we're<00:01:20.990> gonna<00:01:21.080> care<00:01:21.409> up<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.650> water<00:01:21.860> when<00:01:22.040> we

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
we're gonna care up the water when we

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.249 
we're gonna care up the water when we
get<00:01:22.250> out<00:01:22.400> there<00:01:22.640> you<00:01:23.360> know<00:01:23.479> economists<00:01:24.049> like

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
get out there you know economists like

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.800 
get out there you know economists like
to<00:01:24.500> analyze<00:01:25.040> things<00:01:25.340> overanalyze<00:01:26.270> things<00:01:26.300> so

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
to analyze things overanalyze things so

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.600 
to analyze things overanalyze things so
we've<00:01:26.960> over<00:01:27.290> analyzed<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:27.920> structure<00:01:28.430> in<00:01:28.520> the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
we've over analyzed the structure in the

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.100 
we've over analyzed the structure in the
building<00:01:29.000> of<00:01:29.180> it<00:01:29.300> none<00:01:29.570> of<00:01:29.659> us<00:01:29.720> have<00:01:29.930> boat

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
building of it none of us have boat

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.320 
building of it none of us have boat
engineers<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:30.950> this<00:01:31.130> got<00:01:31.520> a<00:01:31.550> chance<00:01:32.149> to

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
engineers and so this got a chance to

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.030 
engineers and so this got a chance to
pull<00:01:32.509> out<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.780> trigonometry<00:01:33.440> skills<00:01:33.710> out<00:01:33.920> of

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
pull out the trigonometry skills out of

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.399 
pull out the trigonometry skills out of
the<00:01:34.159> back<00:01:34.759> shelf<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:35.360> actually<00:01:36.020> run<00:01:36.170> club

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
the back shelf and actually run club

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:37.930 
the back shelf and actually run club
through<00:01:36.649> Zoe<00:01:36.890> we<00:01:37.220> think<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.580> thing<00:01:37.700> afloat

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
through Zoe we think the thing afloat

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.440 
through Zoe we think the thing afloat

a<00:01:58.190> lot<00:01:58.550> of<00:01:58.640> fun<00:01:58.819> building<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.300> boat<00:01:59.479> but

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
a lot of fun building the boat but
