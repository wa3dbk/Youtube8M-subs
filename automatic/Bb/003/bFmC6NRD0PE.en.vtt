00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
I found at a thrift store so here's what

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.030 
I found at a thrift store so here's what
it<00:00:39.420> sounds<00:00:39.690> like<00:00:40.610> this<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.180> clean<00:00:42.570> sound

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
it sounds like this is the clean sound

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:55.139 
it sounds like this is the clean sound
from<00:00:44.059> my<00:00:45.059> Gibson<00:00:45.450> Explorer

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.350 

and<00:00:56.149> when<00:00:56.450> I<00:00:56.480> switch<00:00:56.719> it<00:00:56.870> on<00:00:57.489> with<00:00:58.489> with<00:00:59.059> it<00:00:59.210> at

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
and when I switch it on with with it at

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.330 
and when I switch it on with with it at
around<00:00:59.480> 9<00:00:59.870> o'clock<00:00:59.899> there's<00:01:00.559> no<00:01:00.710> change<00:01:01.010> in

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
around 9 o'clock there's no change in

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.630 
around 9 o'clock there's no change in
the<00:01:01.430> volume<00:01:02.500> any<00:01:03.500> lower<00:01:03.769> than<00:01:03.860> that<00:01:04.070> it'll<00:01:04.339> cut

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
the volume any lower than that it'll cut

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.930 
the volume any lower than that it'll cut
the<00:01:04.790> volume<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:05.420> when<00:01:06.320> it<00:01:06.440> goes<00:01:06.560> higher<00:01:06.940> it'll

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
the volume and when it goes higher it'll

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.859 
the volume and when it goes higher it'll
boost<00:01:08.619> so<00:01:09.619> as<00:01:09.770> you<00:01:09.920> can<00:01:10.009> see<00:01:10.630> not<00:01:11.630> much

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
boost so as you can see not much

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.010 
boost so as you can see not much
difference<00:01:12.320> a<00:01:12.920> little<00:01:13.759> bit<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.090> little<00:01:14.659> bit<00:01:14.810> of

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
difference a little bit a little bit of

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:44.660 
difference a little bit a little bit of
distortion

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.010 

that's<00:01:45.670> pretty<00:01:45.970> much<00:01:46.120> all<00:01:46.300> there<00:01:46.480> is<00:01:46.660> to<00:01:46.870> it

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
that's pretty much all there is to it

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.300 
that's pretty much all there is to it
it's<00:01:47.650> just<00:01:47.710> a<00:01:47.950> clean<00:01:48.190> mousse<00:01:48.430> and<00:01:48.870> it<00:01:49.870> will<00:01:50.310> get

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
it's just a clean mousse and it will get

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.480 
it's just a clean mousse and it will get
incredibly<00:01:52.180> loud<00:01:52.450> I<00:01:52.980> don't<00:01:53.980> want<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.160> crank<00:01:54.310> it

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
incredibly loud I don't want to crank it

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.920 
incredibly loud I don't want to crank it
too<00:01:54.610> much<00:01:55.150> because<00:01:55.420> I<00:01:55.540> live<00:01:55.690> in<00:01:55.720> an<00:01:55.870> apartment

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
too much because I live in an apartment

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.800 
too much because I live in an apartment
but

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.640 

that's<00:02:02.810> it<00:02:03.250> thanks<00:02:04.250> for<00:02:04.280> watching
