00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
yellow tin lenses which obviously take a

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.740 
yellow tin lenses which obviously take a
bit<00:01:35.009> more<00:01:35.159> glare<00:01:35.460> off<00:01:35.640> but<00:01:36.210> obviously<00:01:36.479> if<00:01:36.600> your

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
bit more glare off but obviously if your

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.569 
really see the colors on the screen so
that's<00:01:40.049> what<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.290> about<00:01:40.560> these<00:01:40.829> I'll<00:01:41.310> let

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
that's what I like about these I'll let

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.920 
that's what I like about these I'll let
the<00:01:41.670> fact<00:01:41.880> everything<00:01:42.270> around<00:01:42.540> these<00:01:42.720> stays

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
the fact everything around these stays

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.649 
the fact everything around these stays
the<00:01:43.049> same<00:01:43.229> color<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:44.729> next<00:01:45.180> thing<00:01:45.390> is

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
the same color the next thing is

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.450 
the same color the next thing is
basically<00:01:46.439> with<00:01:46.619> these<00:01:46.710> glass<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.159> takes<00:01:47.369> a

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
basically with these glass it takes a

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.090 
basically with these glass it takes a
lot<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.700> glare<00:01:47.939> off<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.240> screen<00:01:48.920> that<00:01:49.920> is

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
lot of the glare off the screen that is

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.830 
lot of the glare off the screen that is
my<00:01:50.280> initial<00:01:50.520> response<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.720> also

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
my initial response and it also

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.780 
my initial response and it also
magnifies<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.740> little<00:01:52.920> bit<00:01:53.070> but<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.610> thing

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
magnifies it a little bit but the thing

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.370 
magnifies it a little bit but the thing
that<00:01:53.909> I've<00:01:54.000> definitely<00:01:54.299> noticed<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:55.079> where

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
that I've definitely noticed that where

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.289 
that I've definitely noticed that where
it<00:01:55.530> reduces<00:01:56.040> glare<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.549> screen<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.240> they

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
it reduces glare on the screen and they

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.770 
it reduces glare on the screen and they
are<00:01:57.329> quite<00:01:57.750> comfortable<00:01:58.880> when<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.030> then<00:02:00.299> move

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
are quite comfortable when I then move

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.539 
are quite comfortable when I then move
away<00:02:01.020> from<00:02:01.170> what<00:02:01.560> PC<00:02:01.950> because<00:02:02.070> everyone

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
away from what PC because everyone

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.340 
away from what PC because everyone
stares<00:02:02.969> when<00:02:03.240> they're<00:02:03.329> on<00:02:03.420> PC<00:02:03.840> our<00:02:03.930> struggle

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
stares when they're on PC our struggle

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.139 
stares when they're on PC our struggle
to<00:02:04.439> know<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.740> why<00:02:04.920> anyone<00:02:05.189> would<00:02:05.520> blink<00:02:05.909> when

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
to know that why anyone would blink when

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.429 
to know that why anyone would blink when
they're<00:02:06.329> at<00:02:06.390> their<00:02:06.479> PC<00:02:06.899> because<00:02:07.020> always<00:02:07.290> seem
