00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.490
 hello in this video I'm going to present 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.700
 a combined action of a system to 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.800
 1433 where the players of 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.529
 second line and players 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.539
 completion in this regard we know the 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.300
 importance of the automatisms 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.310
 in attack 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.710
 of the equipment nowadays therefore or 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.980
 due importance is important 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.250
 work it a lot in training 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.559
 Here I present a play where as 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.430
 the commented before participate the two 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.880
 half tips of 433 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.310
 number 11 the number 7 and number 9 in 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.940
 tip then we'll start the 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.970
 midfielder is worth a support clearance 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.670
 of outside band player 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.500
 we will make the pass for that player 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.640
 less good and join where the sea 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:10.420
 that gives support and can perform a simple 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.550
 so that this player reaches up 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.250
 here and something inside because what 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.100
 well we know that in 433 the players 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.600
 band always has an amplitude but 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.030
 in this sense sometimes the importance 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.840
 of the inner game is important why 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.600
 in this play 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.659
 this player is going to be the one who takes 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.479
 decision if you will incorporate mediapunta 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.259
 opposite or outer band in this 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.390
 once felt sorry I have a game 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.909
 inside inside 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.729
 this opposing player midfielder is 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.700
 incorporates so that this player can 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:51.340
 move to this and this second line 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.500
 come to this goal or even sometimes 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.170
 the importance of decision making 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.539
 of this player is if this player is 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.299
 they will leave several distracting 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.969
 opposing players this ball will come 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:07.990
 to band so this player is worth 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:10.209
 sorry, come with baron and you can center 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.250
 why here the importance of that 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.890
 have players in the automatisms 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.580
 outside the decision making if it is for 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.580
 inside or outside 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.320
