00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.500
 hi girls, guys, how are we? 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.840
 good and I'll try to get to the point because 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.240
 I always give a few detours 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.530
 I go through the hills of Ubeda which no 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.480
 he understands to go through the hills of Ubeda 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.029
 is that it starts with one thing and ended in 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.810
 another so my friend faith takes the 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.720
 messing around 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.810
 Well look, I show you the eyelashes 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.970
 I did a video yesterday about the position and 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.720
 so then good even if you see me with 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.969
 this red red red carnation carnation in 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.039
 the lips is that it really is even more 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.810
 live red of what they are here in 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:38.440
 camera and I used to put this 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.410
 background 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.000
 but today I came to tell you the trick of 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.950
 almendruco because from time to time 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.860
 once a week I want to make a 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.170
 trick of the almond tree how to fight 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.940
 spots let's see I think I've already 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.570
 tried all the creams and had 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.670
 I have no blemish on my face 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.940
 the truth I thank god that I do not 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.580
 have a spot but wanted elementary 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.250
 watson that among the hormones 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.010
 I do not know if it's estrogen or whatever 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.930
 and etc etc or the melamine of the skin or the 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.729
 Love the inah or whatever you call it 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.860
 neckline because when I go to the beach 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.990
 is that I let myself hang up apart from 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.240
 put on a full screen protection 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.850
 that you can not even imagine is a 50 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.580
 a 90 and there's one thing that I hate most and 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.100
 in what more ages is the neckline 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.340
 good apart from that I leave you always 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.440
 videos of my massages what I do I leave 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.850
 to do and also see how well I'm doing 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.330
 the massages that I'm doing 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.590
 lately and I've put myself here even 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.649
 Now they have found so many 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.490
 very many, that is to say, I bought the 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.140
 shea butter and my mother and also 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.020
 the one I bought carries rosa damascena 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.630
 Well, I think I found no 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.970
 only use for hair for 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.580
 skin for massages for everything 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.470
 everything all good I'll tell you why 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.120
 how did I treat the spots and first 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.270
 I'm going to stand up 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.600
 It's worth it because I can tell you that 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.610
 summer now the pity is that I can not 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.950
 take any pictures of my videos from 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.410
 summer but I'm going to stand up eye 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.480
 he wears a shirt so I 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.860
 maquillo up here what I'm going to do 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.990
 is to make up under my chest 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.470
 let's see if we see it 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.720
 without passing me well because all this area of 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.800
 here all this now you see small 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.360
 droplets of spots a little thing 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.670
 OK 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.010
 there was a time and he spoke as if I'm 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.410
 talking about the average age that I arrived 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.400
 a moment in the face I have here a 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.450
 tiny but it 's practically 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.180
 invisible is not mine or touch it and in the 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.020
 hand'm fighting for it and remove me 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.620
 one here that was from a burn 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.590
 I had done with the oven and other 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.750
 but I will say what I do I got tired 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.530
 of hypo potingues have saliva like this 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.250
 that I myself with myself thought today and 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.040
 yes every day 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.319
 I go from here to the area 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.150
 stain the sea the stain of capanda 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.010
 pickling of capanda growing as a 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.460
 Daily exfoliation at night 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.200
 habitat that I made 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.810
 apart from all the segments of the 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.360
 grandmother I have a dog at home that mix 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.260
 and good and if I do not have it then I do it in 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.390
 the moment 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.380
 I put a splash of soap and detergent 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:36.350
 that I have told you many times and apart from 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:40.090
 that I put what is called this 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:45.130
 Seville beach when I'm going 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.130
 as it is more than ever 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.320
 or if I gave a hand that white 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.320
 to 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.870
 for the ardors 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.040
 of carbonate so I can stand here the 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.989
 wax did not come out I mix it even if it's a 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.540
 little bit of baking so I have it 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.819
 always in the water bicarbonate oil 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.580
 of whatever it is or of rosehip or 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.680
 olive etc a trickle sometimes I put 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.690
 a splash of soap because it's easier 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.880
 after removing and sometimes I put cream 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.440
 cleaner what I want total 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.540
 that another charge begins on the spot 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.380
 carracao raca raca a little bit about each 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.600
 stain an exfoliation is worth it I take it off 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.310
 with water and clear the digital arm 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.790
 because that little soap as 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.300
 automatically then delete before and you 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:43.080
 planted during the whole holy night 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:48.810
 pure lemon juice hey hallucinating 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:51.689
 but I can tell you that before putting 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:55.409
 the pure lemon I got used to doing 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:57.719
 the massages of the neck is to say here not 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:00.599
 I'm going to wake up but I can tell you in 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:02.729
 the massages doing this way well the 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:05.639
 neck up and then those 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.270
 same massages worth doing things and for 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.860
 to have 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.310
 this is an exercise that also goes from 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.199
 coña does not do this type of exercise to 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.050
 stretch and that this area here also 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.430
 do not stay dry and then I 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.219
 I realize that after doing the 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.050
 massages that normally - something with 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:23.849
 shea butter sometimes I put a 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.889
 little rosehip oil good 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:28.259
 anything regenerating oil by 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.090
 during the morning not because I do not have 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.310
 time but note that it hits you from that 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.819
 I hit you and then comes a pettiness 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.550
 Tomás dejas is when I put him in each 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:39.400
 stain 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:42.460
 and also I'm going to teach one you see 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.849
 example to see if you appreciate this that 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.409
 I have here 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:50.240
 it was and it was here and you can do it 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:51.919
 imagine and I do not want to go down 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.979
 but good if I get to the center of 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:58.759
 neckline is more this area here had it 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:01.849
 super rough in the part of here of my 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:03.679
 neck was not with spots but with 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:06.860
 the typical signs of these of age 

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:09.529
 they start to mark and monkey and I have 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.959
 around here a hairline plus I have a 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:16.189
 way that at work is to be 

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:18.469
 crouched so to be crouched then 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:20.179
 you have to make it clear when you are for example 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:22.959
 doing manual work or working 

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:25.279
 with the seam or whatever it is also 

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:27.019
 this will tend to check more 

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:31.550
 important to do the massages these 

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:35.689
 of going to lift so I hope that 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:38.649
 my remedy against the stains that looks 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:41.119
 it's easy to sunbathe and what hair 

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:43.099
 look, I have a mane that I have to 

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:47.449
 go to cut the hair but that gives me 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:49.159
 very sad because he saw me so that is no longer 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:51.349
 he saw me he did not even live in autumn or 

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:53.989
 nothing nothing is that the hair is that I 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:55.549
 Chifla and I love it if I know that I do not 

00:06:53.989 --> 00:06:59.739
 have nothing to wear these queens but 

00:06:55.549 --> 00:06:59.739
 today and the one that demands a collected 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:06.030
 I'm a coquette busted those who make you 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:08.240
 a video after this I hope that 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:11.560
 see me 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.560
 when i love you
