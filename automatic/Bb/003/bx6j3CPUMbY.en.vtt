00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
thank goodness we covered the toilet and

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.120 
thank goodness we covered the toilet and
the<00:01:57.119> sink<00:01:57.149> really<00:01:57.630> well<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:58.439> we<00:01:58.590> didn't<00:01:59.040> have

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
the sink really well that we didn't have

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.920 
the sink really well that we didn't have
to<00:01:59.250> replace<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.610> now<00:02:00.240> look<00:02:00.450> at<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.689> store

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
to replace that now look at the store

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.300 
to replace that now look at the store
the<00:02:01.110> store<00:02:01.320> had<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.500> lot<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.799> paint<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.280> it

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
the store had a lot of paint on it

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.429 
the store had a lot of paint on it
because<00:02:02.549> we<00:02:02.670> use<00:02:02.820> paint<00:02:03.119> at<00:02:03.270> our<00:02:03.390> shop<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.899> it

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
because we use paint at our shop and it

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.469 
because we use paint at our shop and it
was<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:04.710> splattered<00:02:05.189> with<00:02:05.219> paint<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.390> we

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
was like splattered with paint and so we

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.670 
was like splattered with paint and so we
went<00:02:06.630> ahead<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.840> use<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> paint<00:02:07.320> zoom<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
went ahead and use a paint zoom the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.490 
went ahead and use a paint zoom the
paint<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:08.849> actually<00:02:09.270> use<00:02:09.420> for<00:02:09.810> coats<00:02:10.170> it

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
paint that we actually use for coats it

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.290 
paint that we actually use for coats it
was<00:02:10.679> just<00:02:10.890> time<00:02:11.099> consuming

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
was just time consuming

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.790 
was just time consuming
have<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.570> cover<00:02:12.780> up<00:02:12.960> a<00:02:13.080> lot<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.230> stuff<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.710> I

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
have to cover up a lot of stuff and I

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.410 
have to cover up a lot of stuff and I
don't<00:02:13.860> think<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.340> paint<00:02:14.610> zoom<00:02:14.850> is<00:02:15.030> really

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
don't think the paint zoom is really

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.420 
don't think the paint zoom is really
worth<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.960> money<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.200> spent<00:02:16.680> on<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.980> on<00:02:17.130> all<00:02:17.400> I

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
worth the money I spent on it on all I

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.400 
worth the money I spent on it on all I
probably<00:02:17.910> will<00:02:18.210> never<00:02:18.510> ever<00:02:18.780> ever<00:02:18.990> use<00:02:19.260> it

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
probably will never ever ever use it

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.210 
probably will never ever ever use it
again<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.780> this<00:02:22.110> right<00:02:22.380> here<00:02:22.620> is<00:02:22.680> why<00:02:22.890> Joel

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
again and this right here is why Joel

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.020 
again and this right here is why Joel
gave<00:02:23.430> up<00:02:23.580> on<00:02:23.730> it

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
gave up on it

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.970 
gave up on it
this<00:02:24.270> hose<00:02:24.600> just<00:02:24.930> kept<00:02:25.200> coming<00:02:25.410> apart<00:02:25.860> from

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
this hose just kept coming apart from

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.490 
this hose just kept coming apart from
the<00:02:26.250> attachment<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.150> compressor<00:02:27.660> so

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
the attachment to the compressor so

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.310 
the attachment to the compressor so
bye-bye<00:02:28.710> paint<00:02:29.130> zu
