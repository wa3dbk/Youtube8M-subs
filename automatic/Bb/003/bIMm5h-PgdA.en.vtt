smart<00:00:23.150> watches<00:00:23.359> but<00:00:23.840> rather<00:00:24.080> just<00:00:24.470> regular

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
smart watches but rather just regular

smart watches but rather just regular
watches<00:00:25.039> with<00:00:25.430> geeky<00:00:25.820> and<00:00:26.000> unique<00:00:26.330> designs

the<00:00:27.890> uzumaki<00:00:28.189> is<00:00:28.699> rather<00:00:29.000> simple<00:00:29.390> as<00:00:29.689> it

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
the uzumaki is rather simple as it

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.990 
the uzumaki is rather simple as it
operates<00:00:29.990> just<00:00:30.410> like<00:00:30.650> any<00:00:30.890> other<00:00:30.980> watch<00:00:31.369> it's

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
operates just like any other watch it's

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.640 
operates just like any other watch it's
also<00:00:32.210> easy<00:00:32.480> to<00:00:32.599> tell<00:00:32.839> the<00:00:32.870> time<00:00:33.110> on<00:00:33.290> this<00:00:33.470> which

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
also easy to tell the time on this which

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.930 
also easy to tell the time on this which
you'll<00:00:33.830> see<00:00:33.890> when<00:00:34.250> you<00:00:34.370> actually<00:00:34.519> set<00:00:34.850> the

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
you'll see when you actually set the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.270 
you'll see when you actually set the
time<00:00:35.150> so<00:00:35.809> for<00:00:36.019> example<00:00:36.080> this<00:00:36.860> right<00:00:37.100> here

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
time so for example this right here

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.200 
time so for example this right here
would<00:00:37.430> be<00:00:37.489> one<00:00:37.760> o'clock<00:00:38.089> this<00:00:38.750> would<00:00:38.960> be<00:00:38.989> 115

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
would be one o'clock this would be 115

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:47.229 
would be one o'clock this would be 115
130<00:00:41.739> 145<00:00:43.000> two<00:00:44.000> o'clock<00:00:44.269> and<00:00:44.540> so<00:00:45.019> on<00:00:46.239> although

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
130 145 two o'clock and so on although

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:48.880 
130 145 two o'clock and so on although
it<00:00:47.360> has<00:00:47.510> this<00:00:47.750> design<00:00:48.110> to<00:00:48.350> represent<00:00:48.799> the

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
it has this design to represent the

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.070 
it has this design to represent the
hours<00:00:49.159> and<00:00:49.309> minutes<00:00:49.489> it<00:00:50.000> still<00:00:50.330> has<00:00:50.479> a<00:00:50.510> hand<00:00:50.839> to

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
hours and minutes it still has a hand to

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.920 
hours and minutes it still has a hand to
display<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.619> seconds<00:00:52.040> the<00:00:52.970> X<00:00:53.180> acetate<00:00:53.690> white

display the seconds the X acetate white

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.049 
display the seconds the X acetate white
is<00:00:54.199> quite<00:00:54.500> a<00:00:54.559> bit<00:00:54.710> different<00:00:54.739> this<00:00:55.460> has<00:00:55.699> an<00:00:55.850> LED

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
is quite a bit different this has an LED

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.090 
is quite a bit different this has an LED
power<00:00:56.479> display<00:00:56.930> which<00:00:57.290> seems<00:00:57.559> to<00:00:57.680> show<00:00:57.799> the

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
power display which seems to show the

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.910 
power display which seems to show the
time<00:00:58.309> in<00:00:58.580> the<00:00:58.670> weirdest<00:00:58.970> way<00:00:59.089> possible<00:00:59.920> but

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
time in the weirdest way possible but

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.350 
time in the weirdest way possible but
it's<00:01:01.100> pretty<00:01:01.250> easy<00:01:01.460> to<00:01:01.610> figure<00:01:01.699> out<00:01:01.939> once<00:01:02.210> you

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
it's pretty easy to figure out once you

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.759 
it's pretty easy to figure out once you
read<00:01:02.540> the<00:01:02.629> documentation<00:01:03.140> that<00:01:03.320> comes<00:01:03.559> with

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
read the documentation that comes with

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.859 
read the documentation that comes with
it<00:01:03.799> the<00:01:04.519> watch<00:01:04.670> is<00:01:04.699> divided<00:01:05.269> into<00:01:05.420> four<00:01:05.689> areas

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
it the watch is divided into four areas

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.640 
it the watch is divided into four areas
so<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.710> top<00:01:06.890> bottom<00:01:07.549> left<00:01:07.729> and<00:01:08.270> right<00:01:08.840> which

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
so the top bottom left and right which

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.800 
so the top bottom left and right which
each<00:01:09.890> display<00:01:10.250> a<00:01:10.580> contorted<00:01:11.149> digit<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:11.719> I'll

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
each display a contorted digit and I'll

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.660 
each display a contorted digit and I'll
show<00:01:12.020> you<00:01:12.049> this<00:01:12.289> by<00:01:12.530> turning<00:01:13.159> it<00:01:13.310> on<00:01:13.429> really

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
show you this by turning it on really

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.169 
show you this by turning it on really
quick<00:01:13.939> um<00:01:15.070> so<00:01:16.070> you<00:01:16.130> will<00:01:16.399> actually<00:01:16.609> understand

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179 
quick um so you will actually understand

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:19.029 
quick um so you will actually understand
what<00:01:17.299> these<00:01:17.750> digits<00:01:18.320> are<00:01:18.469> supposed<00:01:18.799> to<00:01:18.859> be

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
what these digits are supposed to be

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.840 
what these digits are supposed to be
when<00:01:19.340> you<00:01:19.369> read<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.729> manual<00:01:20.119> but<00:01:20.840> right<00:01:21.740> now

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
when you read the manual but right now

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.419 
when you read the manual but right now
you'll<00:01:22.850> see<00:01:23.200> let's<00:01:24.200> go<00:01:24.350> in<00:01:24.499> this<00:01:24.619> order<00:01:24.829> this

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:25.429 
you'll see let's go in this order this

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:28.450 
you'll see let's go in this order this
is<00:01:25.579> a<00:01:25.609> zero<00:01:25.999> this<00:01:26.689> is<00:01:26.840> a<00:01:26.869> five<00:01:27.200> this<00:01:27.859> is<00:01:28.039> a<00:01:28.070> two

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
is a zero this is a five this is a two

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.399 
is a zero this is a five this is a two
and<00:01:28.789> this<00:01:29.119> is<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.299> one<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:29.780> you<00:01:29.960> read<00:01:30.109> the<00:01:30.229> time

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
and this is a one and you read the time

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.440 
and this is a one and you read the time
in<00:01:30.590> that<00:01:30.710> exact<00:01:31.039> order<00:01:31.249> so<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:31.999> current<00:01:32.179> time

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
in that exact order so the current time

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.669 
in that exact order so the current time
according<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:33.259> watch<00:01:33.409> is<00:01:33.820> 521<00:01:35.530> you<00:01:36.530> can

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
according to the watch is 521 you can

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.590 
according to the watch is 521 you can
also<00:01:36.829> set<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:37.189> date<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:37.640> an<00:01:37.999> alarm<00:01:38.270> on<00:01:38.450> the

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
watch you can also recharge it by

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.609 
watch you can also recharge it by

charger<00:01:48.200> these<00:01:49.100> watches<00:01:49.490> are<00:01:49.670> pretty<00:01:49.969> cool<00:01:50.119> to

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
charger these watches are pretty cool to

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.120 
charger these watches are pretty cool to
look<00:01:50.359> at<00:01:50.569> but<00:01:50.780> find<00:01:51.109> that<00:01:51.319> their<00:01:51.469> prices<00:01:51.889> are<00:01:52.100> a

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
look at but find that their prices are a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.550 
look at but find that their prices are a
bit<00:01:52.280> high<00:01:52.869> people<00:01:53.869> who<00:01:54.049> would<00:01:54.200> be<00:01:54.319> interested

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
bit high people who would be interested

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.469 
bit high people who would be interested
in<00:01:54.979> these<00:01:55.159> watches<00:01:55.609> would<00:01:55.759> most<00:01:55.969> likely<00:01:56.179> be

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
in these watches would most likely be
