00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.710
 to solve the preparation has gone I think 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.379
 that is a little bit of the entrance to the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.139
 planned we have 32 work days 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.029
 75 training sessions today 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.070
 the morning then the two things 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.350
 specific better physical condition 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.289
 general speed primarily 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.449
 clarify the defense work of being 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.160
 synchronized to understand it from 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.650
 communicate it on the court and good 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.470
 obviously the perimeter work then 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.980
 of already understood I believe that 100% 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.620
 the offensive work of the concept the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.750
 goal in the Pan-American Games is similar 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.000
 to read but clean to be in both 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.100
 first is the first phase that we have 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.750
 to work we know we identify the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.980
 teams the rivals we believe that what 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.289
 we can do we have competed a 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.260
 most of them in Monaco Argentina in 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.300
 wet with Cuba in wet with Brazil with 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.280
 Much respect he said but he 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.260
 he said that we are 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.539
 disability the rose girl who 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.050
 we can go to a competition to compete 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.050
 Really 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.330
 we think for the Pan American 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.510
 already since we classify we are 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.420
 mentalized is a totally a goal 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.800
 a challenge for each one of us 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.710
 individually and collectively from 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:26.040
 the coach until all of us 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.930
 we mentalize first by training 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.790
 every day that we get up at 5 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.190
 the morning to train the hours that the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.880
 coach want we are psyched 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.650
 in the for Americans I would like 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.750

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.090
