00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
to pick out the same shape or letter in

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.740 
to pick out the same shape or letter in
this<00:01:55.439> case<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.009> color<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.610> see<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.600> the

you're playing with the group of people
and<00:02:32.720> depending<00:02:33.620> on<00:02:33.710> how<00:02:33.890> you're<00:02:34.130> sitting<00:02:34.400> and

how they're sitting their letter might

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.870 
how they're sitting their letter might
line<00:02:36.440> up<00:02:36.470> right<00:02:36.920> away<00:02:37.070> and<00:02:37.220> they<00:02:37.430> might<00:02:37.580> see<00:02:37.850> it

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
line up right away and they might see it

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.930 
line up right away and they might see it
much<00:02:38.120> quicker<00:02:39.220> because<00:02:40.220> their<00:02:40.490> card<00:02:40.730> might<00:02:40.910> be

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
much quicker because their card might be

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.580 
much quicker because their card might be
here<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:41.420> they<00:02:41.510> might<00:02:41.720> have<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.080> eight<00:02:42.230> which

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
here and they might have the eight which

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.530 
here and they might have the eight which
is<00:02:42.740> lined<00:02:43.010> up<00:02:43.160> better<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:43.730> just<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:44.150> know<00:02:44.210> kind

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
is lined up better so just you know kind

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:55.860 
is lined up better so just you know kind
of<00:02:45.220> has<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.250> lot<00:02:46.490> to<00:02:46.550> do<00:02:46.760> with<00:02:46.790> visual<00:02:47.360> our<00:02:50.470> tea

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
the first deck let's take a look at the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.970 
the first deck let's take a look at the
second<00:03:23.060> deck<00:03:23.240> which<00:03:23.480> is<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.810> numbers<00:03:24.740> and

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
second deck which is the numbers and

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.699 
second deck which is the numbers and
shapes<00:03:26.680> let's<00:03:27.680> put<00:03:27.860> that<00:03:27.980> off<00:03:28.190> to<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.400> side

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
shapes let's put that off to the side

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.150 
shapes let's put that off to the side
and<00:03:30.709> then<00:03:31.430> move<00:03:31.580> this<00:03:31.790> one<00:03:32.000> in<00:03:32.800> so<00:03:33.800> the<00:03:33.920> same

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
and then move this one in so the same

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.860 
and then move this one in so the same
games<00:03:34.519> probably<00:03:34.850> let's<00:03:35.330> just<00:03:35.510> take<00:03:35.630> a<00:03:35.660> quick

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
games probably let's just take a quick

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.390 
games probably let's just take a quick
look<00:03:36.970> twins<00:03:38.739> there's<00:03:39.739> all<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.100> different

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
look twins there's all the different

look twins there's all the different
designs<00:03:40.700> in<00:03:40.910> there<00:03:41.060> so<00:03:41.209> I<00:03:41.239> don't<00:03:41.300> really<00:03:41.450> need

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
designs in there so I don't really need

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.000 
designs in there so I don't really need
to<00:03:41.690> show<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:41.930> this<00:03:42.050> whole<00:03:42.230> instruction<00:03:42.769> sheet

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
to show you this whole instruction sheet

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.640 
to show you this whole instruction sheet
the<00:03:43.640> tower<00:03:43.880> game<00:03:44.239> and<00:03:44.480> then<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.110> wall<00:03:45.290> on<00:03:45.470> the

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
the tower game and then the wall on the

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.520 
the tower game and then the wall on the
well<00:03:45.800> game<00:03:46.040> yes<00:03:46.280> that's<00:03:46.820> the<00:03:47.030> same<00:03:47.380> let's<00:03:48.380> just

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
well game yes that's the same let's just

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.920 
well game yes that's the same let's just
take<00:03:48.680> a<00:03:48.709> look<00:03:48.950> at<00:03:49.040> these<00:03:49.160> cards<00:03:49.550> so<00:03:49.910> let's<00:03:50.750> just

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
take a look at these cards so let's just

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.570 
take a look at these cards so let's just
say<00:03:51.140> they<00:03:51.320> aren't<00:03:51.470> mixed<00:03:52.010> up<00:03:52.280> but<00:03:52.459> we'll<00:03:52.550> just

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
say they aren't mixed up but we'll just

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.270 
say they aren't mixed up but we'll just
mix<00:03:52.850> them<00:03:53.090> up<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.300> little<00:03:53.450> and<00:03:53.739> then<00:03:54.739> my<00:03:55.010> first

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
mix them up a little and then my first

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.220 
mix them up a little and then my first
one<00:03:55.519> down<00:03:55.730> this<00:03:55.880> time<00:03:56.060> I'll<00:03:56.269> set<00:03:56.510> this<00:03:56.690> pile

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
one down this time I'll set this pile

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.570 
one down this time I'll set this pile
correctly<00:03:57.860> so<00:03:58.370> now<00:03:58.550> you<00:03:59.150> have<00:03:59.360> two<00:03:59.510> I<00:03:59.540> D<00:03:59.660> shapes

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
correctly so now you have two I D shapes

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:08.160 
correctly so now you have two I D shapes
and<00:04:02.470> numbers<00:04:03.470> so<00:04:04.040> I'm<00:04:04.130> ready<00:04:04.340> go<00:04:06.700> triangle

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
and numbers so I'm ready go triangle

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:18.390 
and numbers so I'm ready go triangle
five<00:04:11.080> rectangle<00:04:15.190> square

the<00:05:21.130> nine<00:05:21.370> see<00:05:21.670> what<00:05:21.820> I'm<00:05:21.910> saying<00:05:22.180> this<00:05:22.330> could

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
the nine see what I'm saying this could

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.690 
the nine see what I'm saying this could
be<00:05:22.660> hard<00:05:23.260> depending<00:05:23.530> on<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:23.950> six<00:05:24.220> to<00:05:24.370> the<00:05:24.490> nine

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
be hard depending on the six to the nine
