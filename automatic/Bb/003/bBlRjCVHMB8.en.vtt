you<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:41.640> terms<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.119> like<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.420> guys<00:01:42.570> love

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
you in terms of like you guys love

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.630 
you in terms of like you guys love
technology<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.829> definitely<00:01:44.100> want<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.369> swap

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
technology and definitely want to swap

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.270 
technology and definitely want to swap
out<00:01:44.820> CPUs<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.329> swap<00:01:45.899> out<00:01:46.079> things<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.560> think<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
out CPUs and swap out things I think the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.010 
out CPUs and swap out things I think the
most<00:01:47.460> interesting<00:01:47.640> part<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.329> being<00:01:48.630> able<00:01:48.750> to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
most interesting part is being able to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.660 
most interesting part is being able to
swap<00:01:49.259> out<00:01:49.439> your<00:01:49.590> image<00:01:49.890> sensor<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.490> your

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
swap out your image sensor and your

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.700 
swap out your image sensor and your
actual<00:01:51.030> camera<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.079> pretty<00:01:52.229> cool<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.649> me

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
actual camera that is pretty cool to me

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.620 
actual camera that is pretty cool to me
and<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.009> think<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.670> might<00:01:53.850> be<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.090> very<00:01:54.360> big

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and I think that it might be a very big

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.139 
and I think that it might be a very big
consumer<00:01:54.990> thing<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.470> market<00:01:55.920> he<00:01:56.369> won<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.790> sony

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
consumer thing to market he won a sony

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.480 
consumer thing to market he won a sony
camera<00:01:57.689> or<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.290> want<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.590> motorola<00:01:58.950> cameron<00:01:59.399> i

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
camera or you want a motorola cameron i

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.219 
camera or you want a motorola cameron i
don't<00:01:59.640> know<00:01:59.700> why<00:01:59.880> you'd<00:02:00.060> want<00:02:00.360> one<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:01.049> would

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
don't know why you'd want one that would

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.959 
don't know why you'd want one that would
be<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> very<00:02:01.619> interesting<00:02:02.219> thing<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:02.790> i<00:02:02.850> think

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
be a very interesting thing so i think

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.359 
be a very interesting thing so i think
it<00:02:03.210> really<00:02:03.329> has<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.630> do<00:02:04.020> with<00:02:04.259> how<00:02:04.770> expensive

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
it really has to do with how expensive

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.160 
it really has to do with how expensive
this<00:02:05.759> thing<00:02:05.939> will<00:02:06.090> be<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.509> when<00:02:06.930> they<00:02:07.049> can

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
this thing will be and when they can

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.510 
this thing will be and when they can
actually<00:02:07.320> get<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.950> market<00:02:08.099> because

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
actually get it to the market because

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.430 
actually get it to the market because
right<00:02:08.729> now<00:02:08.759> we've<00:02:09.060> only<00:02:09.209> seen<00:02:09.569> prototypes<00:02:10.200> and

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
right now we've only seen prototypes and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.720 
right now we've only seen prototypes and
we<00:02:11.250> actually<00:02:11.670> haven't<00:02:11.910> gotten<00:02:12.300> the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
we actually haven't gotten the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.119 
we actually haven't gotten the
shipped<00:02:12.940> at<00:02:13.090> all<00:02:13.209> so<00:02:13.450> that's<00:02:14.170> my<00:02:14.349> answer<00:02:14.379> next

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
shipped at all so that's my answer next

hololens and if you haven't seen this
thing<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.680> actually<00:02:23.799> is<00:02:24.069> pretty<00:02:24.129> cool<00:02:24.549> they

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
thing it actually is pretty cool they

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.940 
thing it actually is pretty cool they
kind<00:02:25.209> of<00:02:25.269> debut<00:02:25.690> this<00:02:25.810> with<00:02:26.049> Windows<00:02:26.409> 10<00:02:26.739> and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
kind of debut this with Windows 10 and

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.759 
kind of debut this with Windows 10 and
it's<00:02:27.069> sort<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.519> like<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.970> virtual<00:02:28.720> reality<00:02:29.410> mix

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
it's sort of like a virtual reality mix

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.589 
it's sort of like a virtual reality mix
of<00:02:29.980> holographic<00:02:30.580> world<00:02:31.120> or<00:02:31.390> holographic

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
of holographic world or holographic

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.320 
of holographic world or holographic
world<00:02:32.170> now<00:02:32.860> in<00:02:33.250> my<00:02:33.400> opinion<00:02:33.430> it's<00:02:34.000> virtual

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
world now in my opinion it's virtual

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.670 
world now in my opinion it's virtual
reality<00:02:34.690> because<00:02:34.959> you<00:02:35.140> have<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.440> wear<00:02:35.560> this

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
reality because you have to wear this

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.259 
reality because you have to wear this
headset<00:02:36.129> I<00:02:36.370> mean<00:02:36.640> you're<00:02:36.760> not<00:02:36.879> really<00:02:37.090> gonna

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
headset I mean you're not really gonna

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.000 
headset I mean you're not really gonna
have<00:02:37.510> Holograms<00:02:38.049> coming<00:02:38.440> out<00:02:38.560> of<00:02:38.590> your<00:02:38.709> floor

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
have Holograms coming out of your floor

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.190 
have Holograms coming out of your floor
anything<00:02:39.579> that<00:02:39.970> would<00:02:40.120> be<00:02:40.239> cool<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:40.750> think<00:02:41.079> that

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
anything that would be cool I think that

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.890 
anything that would be cool I think that
would<00:02:41.349> be<00:02:41.410> awesome<00:02:41.709> actually<00:02:42.129> but<00:02:43.090> this<00:02:43.690> whole

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
would be awesome actually but this whole

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.210 
would be awesome actually but this whole
little<00:02:44.079> world<00:02:44.349> where<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:44.620> can<00:02:44.769> just<00:02:44.799> kind<00:02:45.129> of

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
little world where you can just kind of

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.430 
little world where you can just kind of
build<00:02:45.489> things<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:46.090> can<00:02:46.269> use<00:02:46.299> things<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.230> I

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
build things you can use things and I

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.080 
build things you can use things and I
think<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.129> biggest<00:02:48.280> or<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.640> coolest

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
think the biggest or the coolest

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.089 
think the biggest or the coolest
demonstration<00:02:49.660> is<00:02:49.840> they<00:02:50.680> were<00:02:50.739> making<00:02:51.040> a

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
demonstration is they were making a

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.819 
demonstration is they were making a
quadcopter<00:02:51.579> and<00:02:52.060> then<00:02:52.269> they<00:02:52.810> actually<00:02:53.260> turned

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
quadcopter and then they actually turned

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.000 
quadcopter and then they actually turned
that<00:02:54.069> holographic<00:02:55.000> image<00:02:55.420> into<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:55.959> 3d<00:02:56.590> printed

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
that holographic image into a 3d printed

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.190 
that holographic image into a 3d printed
item<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:57.819> actually<00:02:58.180> works<00:02:58.480> on<00:02:58.840> guessing

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
item that actually works on guessing

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.440 
item that actually works on guessing
Rangers<00:02:59.470> fitted<00:02:59.799> motors<00:03:00.099> of<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:00.370> right<00:03:00.549> ah<00:03:00.760> but

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
Rangers fitted motors of it right ah but

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.470 
Rangers fitted motors of it right ah but
that<00:03:01.900> is<00:03:02.019> a<00:03:02.049> pretty<00:03:02.440> cool<00:03:02.829> idea<00:03:03.010> now<00:03:03.970> again<00:03:04.090> I

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
that is a pretty cool idea now again I

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.289 
that is a pretty cool idea now again I
think<00:03:04.780> that<00:03:04.870> they<00:03:05.079> have<00:03:05.109> to<00:03:05.560> really

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
think that they have to really

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.490 
think that they have to really
streamline<00:03:07.299> the<00:03:07.420> whole<00:03:07.540> process<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:08.170> not<00:03:08.200> say

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
streamline the whole process and not say

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.800 
streamline the whole process and not say
things<00:03:08.769> like<00:03:08.890> copy<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.519> paste<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.090> do<00:03:10.510> things

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
things like copy and paste and do things

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.210 
things like copy and paste and do things
and<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.019> kind<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.260> sound<00:03:11.470> a<00:03:11.650> little<00:03:11.769> stupid

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
and you kind of sound a little stupid

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.910 
and you kind of sound a little stupid
when<00:03:12.549> you<00:03:12.640> do<00:03:12.879> that<00:03:13.090> so<00:03:13.840> um<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.560> definitely

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
when you do that so um it definitely

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.800

will<00:04:50.530> only<00:04:50.680> get<00:04:50.860> hot<00:04:51.160> with<00:04:51.520> quad<00:04:51.880> HD<00:04:52.270> displays

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
will only get hot with quad HD displays

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.030 
will only get hot with quad HD displays
this<00:04:53.020> is<00:04:53.140> a<00:04:53.170> very<00:04:53.230> interesting<00:04:53.470> question

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
this is a very interesting question

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.220 
this is a very interesting question
because<00:04:54.280> I<00:04:54.700> don't<00:04:54.910> think<00:04:55.240> these<00:04:55.660> nav<00:04:55.930> Reagan

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
because I don't think these nav Reagan

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.960 
because I don't think these nav Reagan
810<00:04:56.530> presses<00:04:56.890> were<00:04:56.980> actually<00:04:57.250> get<00:04:57.400> hot<00:04:57.700> with<00:04:57.910> a

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
810 presses were actually get hot with a

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.780 
810 presses were actually get hot with a
quad<00:04:58.210> HD<00:04:58.570> display<00:04:58.600> I<00:04:59.140> think<00:04:59.770> it's<00:04:59.950> more<00:05:00.040> due<00:05:00.610> to

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
quad HD display I think it's more due to

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.520 
quad HD display I think it's more due to
the<00:05:00.910> performance<00:05:01.510> while<00:05:01.990> an<00:05:02.080> 810<00:05:02.380> processor

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
the performance while an 810 processor

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.950 
the performance while an 810 processor
will<00:05:02.950> probably<00:05:03.430> be<00:05:03.640> able<00:05:03.820> to<00:05:04.060> handle<00:05:04.450> a<00:05:04.630> quad

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
will probably be able to handle a quad

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.530 
will probably be able to handle a quad
HD<00:05:05.230> display<00:05:05.260> with<00:05:05.560> ease<00:05:06.040> I<00:05:06.250> think<00:05:06.970> that<00:05:07.180> people

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
HD display with ease I think that people

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.380 
HD display with ease I think that people
are<00:05:07.750> kind<00:05:08.110> of<00:05:08.260> realizing<00:05:08.740> about<00:05:09.030> 1440p<00:05:10.030> and

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
are kind of realizing about 1440p and

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.830 
are kind of realizing about 1440p and
1080p<00:05:10.990> are<00:05:11.380> very<00:05:11.980> similar<00:05:12.550> there's<00:05:13.480> not<00:05:13.810> that

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
1080p are very similar there's not that

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.410 
1080p are very similar there's not that
much<00:05:14.230> difference<00:05:14.770> no<00:05:15.280> one's<00:05:15.460> making<00:05:15.700> native

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
much difference no one's making native

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.050 
much difference no one's making native
1440p<00:05:17.230> content<00:05:17.890> I<00:05:17.980> mean<00:05:18.130> we're<00:05:18.310> making<00:05:18.610> 4k

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
1440p content I mean we're making 4k

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.580 
1440p content I mean we're making 4k
content<00:05:19.300> but<00:05:19.960> if<00:05:20.050> you<00:05:20.110> watch<00:05:20.290> it<00:05:20.470> on<00:05:20.560> the

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
content but if you watch it on the

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.950 
content but if you watch it on the
YouTube<00:05:20.950> application<00:05:21.130> on<00:05:21.700> a<00:05:21.730> 1440<00:05:22.570> display

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
YouTube application on a 1440 display

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.590 
YouTube application on a 1440 display
then<00:05:23.650> you<00:05:23.860> can<00:05:24.010> actually<00:05:24.220> watch<00:05:24.610> it<00:05:24.820> in<00:05:24.910> 1440p

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
then you can actually watch it in 1440p

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.720 
then you can actually watch it in 1440p
but<00:05:25.900> that<00:05:26.020> the<00:05:26.200> content<00:05:26.650> was<00:05:26.800> not<00:05:27.040> shot<00:05:27.460> in

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
but that the content was not shot in

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.000 
but that the content was not shot in
1440p<00:05:28.660> I<00:05:28.990> think<00:05:29.320> someone<00:05:29.590> called<00:05:29.800> me<00:05:29.890> out<00:05:29.920> for

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
1440p I think someone called me out for

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.680 
1440p I think someone called me out for
that<00:05:30.250> but<00:05:30.640> that's<00:05:30.760> what<00:05:30.820> I<00:05:30.910> meant<00:05:31.240> native

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
that but that's what I meant native

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.680 
that but that's what I meant native
content<00:05:32.110> 4k<00:05:32.590> not<00:05:33.070> 1440p<00:05:33.760> so<00:05:34.330> there's<00:05:34.510> really

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
content 4k not 1440p so there's really

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.380 
content 4k not 1440p so there's really
not<00:05:34.960> a<00:05:35.020> big<00:05:35.380> reason<00:05:35.680> and<00:05:36.100> PPI<00:05:36.430> very

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
not a big reason and PPI very
