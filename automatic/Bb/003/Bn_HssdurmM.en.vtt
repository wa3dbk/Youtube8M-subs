00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
of languages stainless steel ball power

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.020 
of languages stainless steel ball power
and<00:01:17.880> lightness<00:01:19.040> so<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.070> was<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.549> little<00:01:20.790> bit<00:01:20.909> more

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
and lightness so I was a little bit more

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.609 
and lightness so I was a little bit more
heavy-duty<00:01:21.420> than<00:01:21.840> when<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.290> was<00:01:22.380> originally

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
heavy-duty than when I was originally

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.230 
heavy-duty than when I was originally
gonna<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.299> but<00:01:24.299> not<00:01:25.020> going<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.409> regret<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.240> so

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
gonna get but not going to regret it so

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.100 
gonna get but not going to regret it so
just<00:01:28.170> some<00:01:28.880> more<00:01:29.880> literature<00:01:30.329> stuff<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.869> hang

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
just some more literature stuff to hang

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.890 
just some more literature stuff to hang
it<00:01:32.100> was<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.280> lot<00:01:32.460> too<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.420> here's<00:01:33.689> what<00:01:33.810> we

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
it was a lot too but here's what we

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:43.429 
it was a lot too but here's what we
really<00:01:34.229> came<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.650> see<00:01:41.000> there<00:01:42.000> we<00:01:42.119> go<00:01:42.360> bang<00:01:43.140> in

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
really came to see there we go bang in

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.870 
really came to see there we go bang in
the<00:01:43.500> box<00:01:45.799> so<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.979> looks<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.399> only<00:01:47.490> comes

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
the box so it looks like it only comes

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.310 
the box so it looks like it only comes
with<00:01:48.180> one<00:01:51.290> removable<00:01:52.290> plate<00:01:52.820> it's<00:01:53.820> got<00:01:54.030> rubber

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
with one removable plate it's got rubber

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.370 
with one removable plate it's got rubber
on<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.969> it's<00:01:56.969> got<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.180> little<00:01:57.420> twist<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
on it it's got a little twist on the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.710 
on it it's got a little twist on the
bottom<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.799> put<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.490> camera

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.830 

so<00:02:04.720> it's<00:02:04.960> solids<00:02:05.970> construction<00:02:06.970> I<00:02:07.119> assume<00:02:07.659> it

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
so it's solids construction I assume it

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.020 
so it's solids construction I assume it
still<00:02:08.410> might<00:02:08.679> be<00:02:08.709> aluminum<00:02:09.220> it's<00:02:09.849> pretty

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
still might be aluminum it's pretty

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.229 
still might be aluminum it's pretty
light<00:02:10.239> I<00:02:10.270> can<00:02:10.450> say<00:02:10.599> it's<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.780> little<00:02:12.030> but<00:02:13.030> yeah

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
light I can say it's a little but yeah

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.830 
light I can say it's a little but yeah
it<00:02:13.360> looks<00:02:13.569> pretty<00:02:14.230> good<00:02:14.530> but<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:16.360> course<00:02:16.599> not

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
it looks pretty good but of course not

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.089 
it looks pretty good but of course not
just<00:02:17.080> like<00:02:17.440> most<00:02:18.250> demand<00:02:18.640> proto's<00:02:19.860> I've<00:02:20.860> never

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
just like most demand proto's I've never

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.740 
just like most demand proto's I've never
actually<00:02:21.220> used<00:02:21.760> one<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:23.500> way<00:02:24.510> pops<00:02:25.510> down

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
actually used one this way pops down

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.589 
actually used one this way pops down
locks<00:02:26.230> in<00:02:26.500> automatically<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.819> one<00:02:28.450> of<00:02:28.540> the

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
locks in automatically and one of the

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.270 
locks in automatically and one of the
cool<00:02:28.870> things<00:02:29.260> is<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:29.560> don't<00:02:29.980> have<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.160> worry

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
cool things is you don't have to worry

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.559 
cool things is you don't have to worry
about<00:02:30.310> open<00:02:30.819> this<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.060> accidentally

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
about open this and accidentally

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.110 
about open this and accidentally
releasing<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.760> because<00:02:33.760> there's<00:02:33.910> actually

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
releasing it because there's actually

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.280 
releasing it because there's actually
two<00:02:34.930> levers<00:02:35.700> little<00:02:36.700> tiny<00:02:36.880> one<00:02:37.060> here<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:38.200> you

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
two levers little tiny one here so you

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.420 
two levers little tiny one here so you
have<00:02:38.319> to<00:02:38.440> get<00:02:38.590> both<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.459> release<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:41.340> when<00:02:42.340> you

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
have to get both to release and when you

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.360 
have to get both to release and when you
do<00:02:42.640> it<00:02:42.880> keeps<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:43.390> up<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:44.019> when<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.040> go<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.190> put

do it keeps it up and when you go to put
it<00:02:45.400> back<00:02:45.549> of<00:02:45.790> course<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:47.560> has<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:47.739> little<00:02:48.959> kind

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
it back of course it has a little kind

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.900 
it back of course it has a little kind
of<00:02:50.049> bronze<00:02:50.290> just<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.799> brass<00:02:51.160> colored<00:02:51.610> plate

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
of bronze just a brass colored plate

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.479 
of bronze just a brass colored plate
there<00:02:52.209> when<00:02:52.959> you<00:02:53.049> push<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.380> down<00:02:53.410> on<00:02:53.799> that<00:02:53.830> and

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
there when you push it down on that and

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.370 
there when you push it down on that and
a<00:02:54.819> lot<00:02:54.940> of<00:02:55.000> matically<00:02:55.330> lock<00:02:55.569> into<00:02:55.780> place<00:02:55.870> for

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
a lot of matically lock into place for

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.059 
a lot of matically lock into place for
you<00:02:56.580> now<00:02:57.580> this<00:02:57.730> is<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.000> ball<00:02:58.269> mount<00:02:58.830> so<00:02:59.830> you<00:02:59.860> get

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
you now this is a ball mount so you get

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.100 
you now this is a ball mount so you get
all<00:03:00.130> those<00:03:00.250> really<00:03:00.580> cool<00:03:00.849> angles<00:03:01.630> that<00:03:02.049> you

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
all those really cool angles that you

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.539 
all those really cool angles that you
need<00:03:02.349> but<00:03:03.069> it's<00:03:03.220> also<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:04.500> pistol<00:03:05.500> grip<00:03:05.530> or<00:03:05.860> some

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
need but it's also a pistol grip or some

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.599 
need but it's also a pistol grip or some
people<00:03:06.670> call<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:07.150> a<00:03:07.299> joystick<00:03:07.810> grip<00:03:08.609> I've

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
people call it a joystick grip I've

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.880 
people call it a joystick grip I've
always<00:03:09.790> doing<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:10.150> as<00:03:10.299> a<00:03:10.329> pistol<00:03:10.750> grip<00:03:10.890> but

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
always doing it as a pistol grip but

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.479 
always doing it as a pistol grip but
yeah<00:03:12.459> you<00:03:12.519> just<00:03:12.670> squeeze<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:14.220> tilt<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.459> the

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
yeah you just squeeze it tilt it to the

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.289 
yeah you just squeeze it tilt it to the
angle<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:15.910> want<00:03:17.130> this<00:03:18.130> let<00:03:18.310> go<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:18.970> it<00:03:19.090> locks

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
angle you want this let go and it locks

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.860 
angle you want this let go and it locks
it<00:03:19.450> in<00:03:19.540> place<00:03:19.570> so<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:21.880> don't<00:03:21.910> have<00:03:22.239> any<00:03:22.510> you<00:03:22.810> know

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
it in place so I don't have any you know

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.740 
it in place so I don't have any you know
like<00:03:23.310> 50-pound<00:03:24.310> lenses<00:03:24.790> right<00:03:24.820> now<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.450> so

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
like 50-pound lenses right now that so

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.170 
like 50-pound lenses right now that so
I'm<00:03:25.840> really<00:03:26.140> not<00:03:26.380> too<00:03:26.650> worried<00:03:27.040> about<00:03:27.100> it<00:03:27.280> as

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
I'm really not too worried about it as

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.940 
I'm really not too worried about it as
far<00:03:28.329> as<00:03:28.630> you<00:03:28.810> know<00:03:28.900> help<00:03:29.079> tightly<00:03:29.470> grips<00:03:29.739> but

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
far as you know help tightly grips but

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.330 
far as you know help tightly grips but
it<00:03:30.040> does<00:03:30.190> seem<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.549> grip<00:03:32.010> pretty<00:03:33.010> tight<00:03:33.310> I

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
it does seem to grip pretty tight I

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.390 
it does seem to grip pretty tight I
can't<00:03:33.670> move<00:03:33.880> it<00:03:34.590> we<00:03:35.590> do<00:03:35.769> have<00:03:35.799> a<00:03:35.950> knob<00:03:36.190> under

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
can't move it we do have a knob under

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.800 
can't move it we do have a knob under

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
it and until I actually screw it onto a

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.990 
it and until I actually screw it onto a
tripod<00:03:46.569> I'm<00:03:47.079> not<00:03:47.350> gonna<00:03:47.530> be<00:03:47.739> sure<00:03:48.280> exactly<00:03:48.609> how

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
tripod I'm not gonna be sure exactly how

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.330 
tripod I'm not gonna be sure exactly how
I<00:03:49.030> want<00:03:49.389> it<00:03:49.450> now<00:03:50.139> how's<00:03:50.380> your<00:03:50.410> standard<00:03:50.950> thread

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
I want it now how's your standard thread

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.319 
I want it now how's your standard thread
on<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.150> bottom<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:53.250> looks<00:03:54.250> like<00:03:54.370> a<00:03:54.790> little

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
on the bottom and looks like a little

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.599 
on the bottom and looks like a little
bit<00:03:55.450> of<00:03:55.569> smudge<00:03:56.380> on<00:03:56.590> my<00:03:56.620> hands<00:03:57.069> playing<00:03:57.400> with

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
bit of smudge on my hands playing with

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.620 
bit of smudge on my hands playing with
it<00:03:59.069> hopefully<00:04:00.069> that's<00:04:00.340> from<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.519> bottom<00:04:00.670> that

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
it hopefully that's from the bottom that

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.599 
it hopefully that's from the bottom that
don't<00:04:01.810> want<00:04:01.959> that<00:04:02.049> on<00:04:02.170> my<00:04:02.200> hands<00:04:02.650> when<00:04:03.430> I'm

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
don't want that on my hands when I'm

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.690 
don't want that on my hands when I'm
playing<00:04:03.880> with<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.269> camera<00:04:05.310> see<00:04:06.310> we've<00:04:06.459> got

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
playing with the camera see we've got

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.099 
playing with the camera see we've got
two<00:04:07.239> holes<00:04:07.600> here<00:04:08.430> for<00:04:09.430> something<00:04:10.329> I<00:04:10.600> have<00:04:11.019> to

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
two holes here for something I have to

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.140 
two holes here for something I have to
read<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.350> instructions<00:04:11.820> I've<00:04:12.820> I<00:04:12.970> believe

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150

some sort I'm not sure what you're gonna
be<00:04:30.010> sticking<00:04:30.160> that<00:04:30.400> around<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:32.460> tiny<00:04:33.460> allen
