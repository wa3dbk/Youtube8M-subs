00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
and it's not that they didn't grow it's

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.959 
and it's not that they didn't grow it's
how<00:00:55.020> they<00:00:55.260> were<00:00:55.320> from<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> beginning<00:00:56.430> so

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
how they were from the beginning so

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.299 
how they were from the beginning so
that's<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.480> totally<00:00:57.809> different<00:00:58.320> beast<00:00:58.530> but

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
that's a totally different beast but

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.580 
that's a totally different beast but

year<00:01:02.100> they<00:01:02.309> actually<00:01:02.489> produced<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.660> much<00:01:03.930> more

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
year they actually produced so much more

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.310 
year they actually produced so much more
blooms<00:01:04.530> from<00:01:04.860> either<00:01:05.010> last<00:01:05.430> year<00:01:06.229> having<00:01:07.229> a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
blooms from either last year having a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.250 
blooms from either last year having a
bit<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.530> trouble<00:01:08.000> shaping<00:01:09.000> them<00:01:09.270> they<00:01:09.900> tend<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
bit of trouble shaping them they tend to

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.410 
bit of trouble shaping them they tend to
grow<00:01:10.439> kind<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.860> crazy<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.000> cannot<00:01:12.360> really

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
grow kind of crazy so you cannot really

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.590 
grow kind of crazy so you cannot really
really<00:01:12.900> see<00:01:13.290> all<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.470> flowers<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.420> is

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
really see all the flowers but it is

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.140 
really see all the flowers but it is
such<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> spectacle<00:01:16.740> they<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.030> many

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
such a spectacle they have so many

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.960 
such a spectacle they have so many
blooms<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.689> year<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.950> think<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.759> major

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
blooms this year and I think the major

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.810 
blooms this year and I think the major
factor<00:01:21.600> was<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.900> very<00:01:22.439> cold<00:01:22.770> spell<00:01:23.220> they<00:01:23.520> went

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
factor was the very cold spell they went

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.999 
factor was the very cold spell they went

danger of Frost
Kame<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:13.980> just<00:02:14.310> moved<00:02:14.610> them<00:02:14.910> back<00:02:15.150> inside<00:02:15.540> they

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
Kame I just moved them back inside they

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.559 
Kame I just moved them back inside they
already<00:02:16.500> had<00:02:16.770> buds<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.280> started<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.030> worry<00:02:18.300> them

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
already had buds I started to worry them

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.410 
already had buds I started to worry them
again<00:02:18.990> more<00:02:19.650> frequently<00:02:20.280> because<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.180> cane

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
again more frequently because the cane

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.750 
again more frequently because the cane
started<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.110> shrivel<00:02:22.380> today<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.459> watering

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
started to shrivel today is watering

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.660 
started to shrivel today is watering
days<00:02:24.030> foes<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.750> do<00:02:25.200> not<00:02:25.500> fertilize<00:02:25.800> just<00:02:26.370> yet

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
days foes I do not fertilize just yet

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.590 
days foes I do not fertilize just yet
and<00:02:27.030> lo<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.450> behold<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:28.440> great<00:02:29.400> display<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.360> am

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
and lo and behold a great display I am

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.040 
and lo and behold a great display I am
so<00:02:30.989> proud<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:32.280> happy<00:02:32.760> really<00:02:33.630> am

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
so proud so happy really am

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.960 
so proud so happy really am
there<00:02:34.200> are<00:02:34.290> spectacular<00:02:34.890> blooms<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.700> think

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
there are spectacular blooms so I think

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.479 
there are spectacular blooms so I think
that's<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.630> key<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.900> growing<00:02:37.650> them<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.100> if

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
that's the key to growing them and if

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.550 
that's the key to growing them and if
you<00:02:38.640> live<00:02:38.819> in<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.000> climate<00:02:39.390> which<00:02:39.959> does<00:02:40.260> not

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
you live in a climate which does not

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.210 
you live in a climate which does not
really<00:02:41.250> have<00:02:41.640> really<00:02:42.060> cold<00:02:42.450> winters<00:02:42.900> I

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
really have really cold winters I

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.190 
really have really cold winters I
suppose<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.520> can<00:02:44.670> try<00:02:44.989> refrigerating<00:02:45.989> them

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
suppose you can try refrigerating them

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.660 
suppose you can try refrigerating them
it<00:02:46.470> sounds<00:02:46.980> weird

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
it sounds weird

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.699 
it sounds weird
they're<00:02:47.940> quite<00:02:48.330> tall<00:02:48.750> they<00:02:49.170> can<00:02:49.380> be<00:02:49.500> quite

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
they're quite tall they can be quite

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.090 
they're quite tall they can be quite
tall<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.970> guess<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.810> will<00:02:51.900> be<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:52.110> hassle<00:02:52.380> but

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
tall so I guess it will be a hassle but

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.979 
tall so I guess it will be a hassle but
I'm<00:02:53.430> pretty<00:02:53.820> sure<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.180> if<00:02:54.330> you<00:02:54.450> don't<00:02:54.720> offer

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
I'm pretty sure that if you don't offer

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.710 
I'm pretty sure that if you don't offer
those<00:02:55.830> low<00:02:56.280> low<00:02:56.550> temperatures<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.180> cannot

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
those low low temperatures you cannot

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.080 
those low low temperatures you cannot
really<00:02:57.900> bloom<00:02:58.230> these<00:02:58.440> guys<00:02:58.709> unfortunately

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
really bloom these guys unfortunately

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.970 
really bloom these guys unfortunately
