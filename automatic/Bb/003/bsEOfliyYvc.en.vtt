warm white look we tried to bring into
balance<00:00:46.860> as<00:00:47.190> many<00:00:47.460> movements<00:00:47.760> as<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.239> can<00:00:48.420> get

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
balance as many movements as we can get

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.810 
balance as many movements as we can get
it<00:00:48.660> was<00:00:48.899> still<00:00:49.170> guaranteeing<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.039> super<00:00:50.670> long

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
it was still guaranteeing a super long

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.479 
it was still guaranteeing a super long
lifetime<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:52.199> reduce<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.129> amount<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.430> waste

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
lifetime to reduce the amount of waste

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.920 
lifetime to reduce the amount of waste
that<00:00:53.879> we're<00:00:54.120> actually<00:00:54.270> putting<00:00:54.570> into<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
that we're actually putting into the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.479 
that we're actually putting into the
waste<00:00:55.110> stream<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.829> let's<00:00:56.070> get<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.250> bit

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
waste stream so let's get a bit

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.490 
waste stream so let's get a bit
technical<00:00:56.730> first<00:00:57.239> about<00:00:57.539> illumines<00:00:58.020> per<00:00:58.260> watt

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
technical first about illumines per watt

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.880 
technical first about illumines per watt
a<00:00:58.800> compact<00:00:59.520> fluorescent<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.379> roughly<00:01:01.379> 45

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
a compact fluorescent is roughly 45

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.729 
a compact fluorescent is roughly 45
lumens<00:01:02.370> 4045<00:01:03.120> yeah<00:01:03.420> between<00:01:03.600> 40<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.229> 50<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
lumens 4045 yeah between 40 and 50 and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.039 
lumens 4045 yeah between 40 and 50 and
worried<00:01:05.010> about<00:01:05.159> 40<00:01:05.549> lumens<00:01:05.850> per<00:01:05.909> watt<00:01:06.060> so

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
worried about 40 lumens per watt so

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.450 
worried about 40 lumens per watt so
you're<00:01:07.200> comparable<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.280> we're

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
you're comparable with that so we're

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.950 
you're comparable with that so we're
interests<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:08.939> people<00:01:09.240> know<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.630> regular

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
interests so people know and the regular

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.920 
interests so people know and the regular
incandescent<00:01:10.260> bulb<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.400> our<00:01:11.729> 10<00:01:11.939> rooms<00:01:12.119> right

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
incandescent bulb is our 10 rooms right

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.080 
incandescent bulb is our 10 rooms right
10<00:01:13.290> lumens<00:01:13.470> per<00:01:13.650> watt<00:01:13.770> or<00:01:13.950> less<00:01:14.220> okay<00:01:14.760> which<00:01:14.939> is

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
10 lumens per watt or less okay which is

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.249 
10 lumens per watt or less okay which is
part<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> reason<00:01:15.750> why<00:01:15.780> many<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
part of the reason why many of the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.719 
part of the reason why many of the
municipalities<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.189> governments<00:01:17.640> are

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
municipalities and governments are

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.580 
municipalities and governments are
beginning<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.180> ban<00:01:18.360> incandescent<00:01:18.840> because

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
beginning to ban incandescent because

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.310 
beginning to ban incandescent because
they're<00:01:19.740> extremely<00:01:20.070> energy<00:01:21.020> efficient<00:01:22.020> now

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
they're extremely energy efficient now

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.249 
they're extremely energy efficient now
our<00:01:22.560> readers<00:01:22.950> complain<00:01:23.400> always<00:01:23.909> about<00:01:24.259> CFLs

our readers complain always about CFLs

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.840 
our readers complain always about CFLs
there<00:01:25.619> are<00:01:25.680> two<00:01:25.979> blue<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.820> color

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
there are two blue the color

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.319 
there are two blue the color
temperatures<00:01:27.689> awful<00:01:28.790> where<00:01:29.790> are<00:01:29.939> these<00:01:30.090> in

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
temperatures awful where are these in

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.120 
temperatures awful where are these in
color<00:01:30.570> temperature<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.530> how<00:01:31.650> do<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.799> do<00:01:31.979> it

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
color temperature and how do you do it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.359 
color temperature and how do you do it
so<00:01:32.430> what<00:01:32.790> we<00:01:33.000> have<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:34.170> read<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.619> 3000

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
so what we have is we read of 3000

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.870 
Kelvin college
okay<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.759> what<00:01:38.360> that<00:01:38.390> does<00:01:38.930> for<00:01:39.259> us<00:01:39.619> is<00:01:39.890> we

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
okay and what that does for us is we

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.529 
okay and what that does for us is we
have<00:01:41.539> a<00:01:41.600> very<00:01:41.869> high<00:01:42.079> color<00:01:42.409> rendering<00:01:42.939> okay<00:01:43.939> so

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
have a very high color rendering okay so

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.139 
have a very high color rendering okay so
that<00:01:44.780> we're<00:01:44.960> able<00:01:45.140> to<00:01:45.380> achieve<00:01:45.909> metric<00:01:46.909> of<00:01:47.000> an

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
that we're able to achieve metric of an

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.690 
that we're able to achieve metric of an
85<00:01:47.750> color<00:01:48.320> rendering<00:01:48.649> index<00:01:48.829> which<00:01:49.310> is<00:01:49.340> very

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
85 color rendering index which is very

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.490 
85 color rendering index which is very
high<00:01:49.939> so<00:01:50.329> all<00:01:50.929> of<00:01:50.960> your<00:01:51.229> foods<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:53.229> the<00:01:54.229> built

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
high so all of your foods and the built

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.529 
high so all of your foods and the built
