00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.800 
update for Minecraft Xbox 360 hopefully
we'll<00:01:38.700> get<00:01:38.850> things<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.299> trading<00:01:39.689> with

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
we'll get things like trading with

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.899 
we'll get things like trading with
villagers<00:01:39.840> maybe<00:01:40.560> command<00:01:41.040> blocks<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.700> bills

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
villagers maybe command blocks and bills

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:42.950 
villagers maybe command blocks and bills
I'll<00:01:42.329> talk<00:01:42.450> about<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.659> lot<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:42.899> stuff

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
I'll talk about a lot of this stuff

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.929 
I'll talk about a lot of this stuff
later<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.710> future<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.579> just<00:01:44.790> hang

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
later on in the future so just hang

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.580 
later on in the future so just hang
tight<00:01:45.180> but<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.780> do<00:01:45.960> want<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.290> say<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.560> that

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
tight but I do want to say is that

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.340 
tight but I do want to say is that
they'll<00:01:47.189> probably<00:01:47.520> release<00:01:47.790> time<00:01:48.329> craft<00:01:48.600> ps3

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
they'll probably release time craft ps3

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.380 
they'll probably release time craft ps3
first<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.100> then<00:01:50.520> it'll<00:01:50.700> probably<00:01:50.970> trickle

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
first and then it'll probably trickle

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.139 
first and then it'll probably trickle
down<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.869> maybe<00:01:52.430> when<00:01:53.430> we<00:01:53.549> get<00:01:53.700> minecraft

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
down and maybe when we get minecraft

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.209 
down and maybe when we get minecraft
xbox<00:01:54.509> one<00:01:54.600> that'll<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.439> like<00:01:55.740> things<00:01:56.009> like

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
xbox one that'll have like things like

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.249 
xbox one that'll have like things like
trading<00:01:56.579> all<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.299> good<00:01:57.450> stuff<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.719> then<00:01:58.049> when

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
trading all that good stuff so then when

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.990 
trading all that good stuff so then when
that<00:01:58.380> comes<00:01:58.649> out<00:01:58.890> which<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.430> believe<00:01:59.640> it'll<00:01:59.880> be

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
that comes out which I believe it'll be

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.789 
that comes out which I believe it'll be
out<00:02:00.090> before<00:02:00.240> march<00:02:00.689> hopefully<00:02:01.200> i'm<00:02:01.530> thinking

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
out before march hopefully i'm thinking

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
that update with minecraft xbox 360 I'm

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.440 
that update with minecraft xbox 360 I'm
pretty<00:02:32.800> sure<00:02:32.950> they're<00:02:33.130> not<00:02:33.220> gonna<00:02:33.430> run<00:02:33.730> behind

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
pretty sure they're not gonna run behind

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.510 
pretty sure they're not gonna run behind
on<00:02:34.840> updates<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.500> think<00:02:35.860> they'll<00:02:35.980> try<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.220> tie<00:02:36.460> it

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
on updates I think they'll try to tie it

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.100 
on updates I think they'll try to tie it
together<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:37.120> like<00:02:37.300> whenever<00:02:37.750> we<00:02:37.930> get<00:02:37.990> an

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
together so like whenever we get an

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.230 
together so like whenever we get an
update<00:02:38.410> on<00:02:38.440> xbox<00:02:38.980> one<00:02:39.310> will<00:02:39.820> get<00:02:39.910> an<00:02:39.970> update<00:02:40.209> on

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
update on xbox one will get an update on

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.900 
update on xbox one will get an update on
xbox<00:02:40.690> 360<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.410> i<00:02:41.830> think<00:02:42.040> i'd<00:02:42.130> be<00:02:42.250> very<00:02:42.280> sweet

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910

xbox 360 and i think i'd be very sweet
and<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.150> be<00:02:43.300> awesome<00:02:43.660> he<00:02:43.810> did<00:02:43.959> mention<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.380> a

not remember if it's going to be at the
exact<00:02:53.500> same<00:02:53.740> time<00:02:54.010> but<00:02:54.220> I'm<00:02:54.310> pretty<00:02:54.459> sure<00:02:54.580> it

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
exact same time but I'm pretty sure it

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.760 
exact same time but I'm pretty sure it
will<00:02:54.910> be<00:02:54.970> they'll<00:02:55.600> possibly<00:02:56.230> update<00:02:56.530> both

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
will be they'll possibly update both

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.890 
will be they'll possibly update both
consoles<00:02:57.280> at<00:02:57.520> the<00:02:57.640> same<00:02:57.880> time<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:58.720> don't

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
consoles at the same time and I don't
