00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.650
 riding a bicycle is very fun 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.090
 exercise and you can also go faster 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.150
 that walking truth 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.850
 but of course you also have to know how 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.900
 go by bike down the street so you'll go more 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.779
 sure and you will not have any accidents 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.990
 before riding on the bike you have to 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:35.930
 check all your equipment first the bike 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:39.320
 push the bike with the brake tight 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.990
 to prove that they work well is that 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.290
 As you run out of brakes, you can give 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.440
 a swipe 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.810
 then squeeze the wheels of the bike and 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.960
 Take a moment to see that 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:56.899
 they are not painted and they are not soft 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.800
 If everything is fine, it's your turn to check your 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.230
 team put on the helmet that is mandatory 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.050
 so if you fall you will not hurt yourself in the 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.430
 head if you want you can also use 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.040
 elbow pads knee pads 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.830
 if it is going to be done at night or there is little light 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.470
 you have to put some clothes on 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.480
 that is bright of that which shines through 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.820
 the night like the vest that the 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.630
 seniors in the car 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.340
 this is for everyone else to see you 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.210
 although it's still better if you carry light 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.000
 des on the bike 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.580
 you have to know something when you ride 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.920
 by bike it is very important to listen for 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.680
 whence come the other bikes 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.900
 other vehicles or people that's why 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.920
 You should never wear headphones to 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.520
 listen to music 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.430
 never go out riding a bike you alone is 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.950
 much better that you go with some greater 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.590
 you can go through special lanes 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.970
 what is there for bicycles is called lane 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.479
 bike and have this signal do not confuse it 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.320
 with this other one that means that it has already 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.229
 finished the lane 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.360
 If you go with the bike on the sidewalk, the best 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.790
 is that you go down and take her by the hand 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.860
 Be careful not to hit anyone with 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.290
 she 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.020
 another thing you can do to go more 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.390
 sure is to make signals with your hands 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:29.670
 when you go to make a turn or change 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.620
 of direction so others will know and 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.900
 they will be careful 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.239
 for example if you are going to turn the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.720
 left pulls out the left arm with 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.720
 watch out
