00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.510
 i 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.520
 greetings seekers of mystery and 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.300
 thank you for attending great mystery 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.630
 points 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.970
 have you ever seen yourself doing errands 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.970
 and favors to someone who has not 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.160
 asked directly or do you know someone 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.050
 which you visit frequently and you 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.480
 same you do not want to visit it you see yourself 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.960
 bound for some strange reason to 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.140
 do what 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.760
 the term psychic vampire does 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.239
 reference to those people who 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.090
 Through lies and deceptions they try 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.460
 take advantage of other people this 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.129
 class of people are very common in 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.960
 but unfortunately our world in 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.040
 occasions are very difficult to 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.930
 identify you will see the psychic vampire 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.890
 takes advantage of people 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.839
 responsible and virtuous never 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.750
 asks for nothing in return and neither does 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.509
 directly he drops subtly 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.710
 what you want you to do so that you do not 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.530
 you can deny him anything 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.020
 one of the most used techniques by 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.710
 these people would be psychology 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.440
 inverse for example the one they tell you not to 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.880
 I could ask you to do this but 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.700
 however you do it 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.060
 on many occasions the psychic vampire 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.829
 it depends on its victims without them the 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.130
 psychic vampire does not know how to play 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:36.590
 tasks on your own you need that 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.050
 others do things for him 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.540
 for that reason, fool them 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.700
 they choose first to open our 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.950
 heart with kind words and 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.690
 kindly and then open our 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.240
 wallets our pockets and 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.000
 pluck us 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.399
 the worst of all is that we do not give ourselves 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.490
 account because we trust in our 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.880
 aggressor in good faith we can not imagine 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.380
 how does this subject and the 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.760
 damage that he is doing to us can be 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.270
 quite serious 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.520
 these carcinogenic friendships exhaust 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.910
 our intellect steal our energy 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.310
 what we spend doing in their tasks we 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.250
 they fill with other people's problems and they make us 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.350
 docile and inert besides taking us 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.200
 our money 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.680
 but how could we identify this 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.630
 kind of people you will see for 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.780
 identify these people there are 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.110
 certain traits and attitudes that can 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.690
 give us some indication of its nature 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.820
 for example, people with shortages 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.580
 emotional ones that need to fill 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.790
 those gaps in your life and for that 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.490
 they do it lying, that is, if we catch 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.010
 a person lying many times to 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.900
 over a certain time already 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.720
 it would be a sign that they tell us that this 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.700
 person thinks differently 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.819
 that is not telling us and it is 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.879
 taking advantage of us 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.459
 we could say that many times a 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:10.280
 Nice smile hides a scary 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.950
 psychic vampire you have to think that the 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.319
 appearances deceive and can do it from 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.319
 very good way to educate us 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.959
 but without a doubt the psychic vampire more 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:26.549
 perfect would use the prohibited weapon 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.680
 most powerful of all love a bandage 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.349
 that enslaves you for life in this 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.689
 point at which if a physical vampire 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.870
 uses the techniques of love to 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:39.329
 to dupe you would no longer have a loophole 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.900
 you have ended up turning you into his lackey 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:45.560
 forever 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:49.099
 but do not be alarmed there is an antidote 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.430
 to fight the poisonous grabs of 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:54.500
 these people and that antidote is now 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.560
 same in my words in this video 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.439
 program the antidote is to know 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.780
 of its existence ask yourself 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:06.790
 the why of the things to whom it benefits 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.280
 and where are we going to stop with our acts 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.730
 only knowing that these people exist 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.739
 we can stop them and fight them 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.870
 but we will also have to talk about 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:20.799
 something that is a bit beyond the 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.440
 Vampirizing groups ie they exist 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.930
 groups of psychic vampires that operate 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.080
 in big offices to suck 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.750
 our money some multinationals or 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.229
 also governments are associations of 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.690
 psychic vampires that act to bring out 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.169
 the greatest benefit of the citizen and 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.330
 drown us with our work 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.479
 the entities that feed on 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.270
 our iniquities could be about 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.099
 a true reality day by day what 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.930
 we are seeing and every time more 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:57.199
 exaggerated we were using 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.960
 in conclusion these entities are 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:02.300
 trickster people who take advantage 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.180
 of our kindness are a tremendous 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.660
 reality day by day we are seeing it and 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.690
 our duty would be to identify them and 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.480
 fight them because our happiness does not 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.390
 is 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.210
 something that is from other people our 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.250
 happiness is our own and nobody 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.060
 have to enslave to be able 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.450
 take away the 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.460
 this is the end of this video program 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:31.380
 We send a warm hug and we 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.380
 we will see in another video
