know I want you to teach someone you're

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.400

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
think that's what makes it a success

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.740 
think that's what makes it a success
they<00:01:40.780> they<00:01:41.230> they<00:01:41.590> do<00:01:41.920> that<00:01:42.400> unselfishly<00:01:43.270> and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
they they they do that unselfishly and

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.130 
they they they do that unselfishly and
so<00:01:44.110> so<00:01:44.590> do<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.920> staff<00:01:45.250> from<00:01:45.970> from<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.570> top

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
so so do the staff from from the top

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.280 
so so do the staff from from the top
down<00:01:47.500> from

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
down from

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.380 
down from
what<00:01:48.380> I've<00:01:48.620> seen<00:01:51.730> gathered<00:01:52.730> here<00:01:52.910> to<00:01:53.030> hope<00:01:53.210> in

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
what I've seen gathered here to hope in

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.060 
what I've seen gathered here to hope in
you

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.130
