00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.669
 Oh 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:18.950
 The great musician Franz Josef Haydn was born in 1732 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:21.680
 Also referred to as the father of public stations who died in 1800 of friendship as well as Beethoven and Mozart at that time 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:28.520
 Is there was great musicians 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:31.760
 However, only the part of this Haydn's post-mortem head is cut off , and the head is the hand of people here and there. 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:36.860
 It has a strange fate to walk around 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:40.400
 The occurrence of the thing was called Johandatar who was the director of a prison in the kingdom of Australia 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.700
 A person digs out Haydn's Shito 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.960
 Underground be cut the neck 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:49.560
 Activator says phrenology that begins to say things 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.090
 In fact I have a hobby, such as examining the skull bone 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:01:00.480
 Such a fold that was the collection a variety of prisoners of skull 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.690
 Listening to Haydn death of news and want to come also examined the skull of a person is said to be a genius 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.310
 From the impulse of 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:11.649
 I was in a weird act of uncovering a grave and bringing my head home 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:14.770
 Chemical treatment of the raw neck which has been stolen is finished to a beautiful skull 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:22.000
 Measurement was repeated from various angles 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:25.980
 And he wrote a dissertation saying that Haydn 's skull could be seen with his uplifting music, etc. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.820
 It is that it was announced and was considerably envious 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:33.840
 After a while, a person named Rosenbaum who heard about this has visited the data 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.980
 The research is over 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.610
 I'd like you to hand over Hayden's skull, which has become obsolete 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:45.460
 The research has already ended for the data 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:52.110
 I told him a skull for that 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:59.490
 But this Rosenbaum also did not return to the skull tomb 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:02.250
 He embellished Haydn's skull at the entrance to his home and next to it a portrait of Hylon painted in a circle 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:09.630
 Each time you come exhibition to our side-by-side 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:12.100
 I say that this was proudly explained that such is the skull of Haydn, but from around this time 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:18.070
 Bizarre events have begun to occur 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:20.170
 The wife of a certain night Rosenbaum is up is eerie growl from the skull 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.620
 I heard it clearly 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:30.160
 Then the growl will be heard often 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:32.120
 While initially skull due, which is also Rosenbaum himself was skeptical rang one the chin 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:38.450
 Fly around in your home 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:42.260
 I often witness the roaring voices and the scenes that fly through the sky 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:50.420
 Rosenbaum decided to let go of the skull 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:55.280
 Thus Haydn skull of I went to another person, but where also happened is exactly the same phenomenon 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:59.420
 And the next one and the next person also got the same eye 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.990
 Haydn's torso is Soviet after the second world match 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:08.709
 Go to the reduction Russian standing residence in the side of the octopus 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:15.270
 A movement was made to bring Haydn's neck and torso together 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:21.020
 August 5 , 1954: A total of 5 guests at the cemetery's cemetery 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.020
 The neck and body were buried together for the first time in 10 years
