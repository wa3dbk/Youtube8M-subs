00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
just something as simple as bringing a

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.740 
just something as simple as bringing a
weight<00:00:28.920> overhead<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.460> walking<00:00:30.060> with<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.359> now

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
weight overhead and walking with it now

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.900 
weight overhead and walking with it now
not<00:00:31.230> just<00:00:31.470> walking<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:32.009> linear<00:00:32.489> motions<00:00:32.820> are

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
not just walking in linear motions are

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.549 
not just walking in linear motions are
straight<00:00:33.180> forward<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.600> back<00:00:33.750> but<00:00:34.230> even

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
straight forward and back but even

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.160 
straight forward and back but even
taking<00:00:34.829> some<00:00:35.370> turns<00:00:35.730> moving<00:00:36.600> around<00:00:36.809> with<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
taking some turns moving around with the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.200 
taking some turns moving around with the
weight<00:00:37.320> you'll<00:00:37.800> see<00:00:38.010> what<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.160> mean<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
weight you'll see what I mean but the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.090 
weight you'll see what I mean but the
idea<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:40.140> want<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.440> use<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.590> weight<00:00:40.829> that

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
idea is you want to use a weight that

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.729 
idea is you want to use a weight that
you<00:00:41.340> can<00:00:41.370> control<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.360> it's<00:00:42.690> still<00:00:42.960> heavy<00:00:43.170> but

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
you can control so it's still heavy but

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.850 
you can control so it's still heavy but
it's<00:00:43.860> not<00:00:44.100> your<00:00:44.430> max<00:00:44.910> rep<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.899> know<00:00:45.989> press<00:00:46.320> so

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
it's not your max rep you know press so

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.260 
it's not your max rep you know press so
something<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.670> control<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.239> that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
something that you can control so that

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.209 
something that you can control so that
you<00:00:48.480> still<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.230> ability<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.590> drop<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.129> if

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
you still have the ability to drop it if

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.979 
you still have the ability to drop it if
you<00:00:50.309> have<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.730> or<00:00:50.910> control<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.899> way

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
you have to or control it on the way

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.630 
you have to or control it on the way
down<00:00:52.230> if<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.829> but<00:00:53.039> you'll<00:00:53.399> see<00:00:53.550> what
