00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.250 

I<00:00:00.590> recently<00:00:01.460> bought<00:00:01.760> myself<00:00:02.210> these<00:00:02.870> six

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:03.260 
I recently bought myself these six

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.920 
I recently bought myself these six
ultrafire<00:00:04.040> lithium-ion<00:00:04.790> batteries<00:00:05.450> with<00:00:05.899> a

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
ultrafire lithium-ion batteries with a

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.060 
ultrafire lithium-ion batteries with a
capacity<00:00:06.559> of<00:00:06.700> 4800<00:00:07.700> milliamp<00:00:08.599> hours<00:00:09.019> and<00:00:09.320> that

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
capacity of 4800 milliamp hours and that

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.999 
capacity of 4800 milliamp hours and that
is<00:00:10.190> awesome<00:00:10.429> right<00:00:11.389> I<00:00:11.780> mean<00:00:12.410> they<00:00:12.620> have<00:00:12.740> twice

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
is awesome right I mean they have twice

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.069 
is awesome right I mean they have twice
the<00:00:13.070> capacity<00:00:13.789> than<00:00:14.059> big<00:00:14.329> brands<00:00:14.690> like

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:15.079 
the capacity than big brands like

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:17.680 
the capacity than big brands like
Samsung<00:00:15.369> Phillips<00:00:16.369> or<00:00:16.610> sanyo<00:00:17.120> with<00:00:17.420> their

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
Samsung Phillips or sanyo with their

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.950 
Samsung Phillips or sanyo with their
models<00:00:18.140> and<00:00:18.440> they<00:00:19.010> are<00:00:19.100> even<00:00:19.400> cheaper<00:00:19.630> well<00:00:20.630> it

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
models and they are even cheaper well it

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.960 
models and they are even cheaper well it
is<00:00:21.170> actually<00:00:21.620> too<00:00:21.860> good<00:00:21.890> to<00:00:22.280> be<00:00:22.430> true<00:00:22.460> just

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
is actually too good to be true just

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.810 
is actually too good to be true just
look<00:00:23.630> at<00:00:23.780> the<00:00:23.900> side<00:00:24.110> where<00:00:24.380> I<00:00:24.410> got<00:00:24.680> them<00:00:24.890> I<00:00:25.160> mean

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
look at the side where I got them I mean

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.930 
look at the side where I got them I mean
working<00:00:26.390> time<00:00:26.870> as<00:00:27.140> always<00:00:27.650> four<00:00:27.980> hours<00:00:28.340> are

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
working time as always four hours are

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.510 
working time as always four hours are
you<00:00:29.120> kidding<00:00:29.600> me<00:00:29.780> so<00:00:30.530> an<00:00:30.680> LED<00:00:31.070> will<00:00:31.250> light<00:00:31.280> up

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
you kidding me so an LED will light up

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.340 
you kidding me so an LED will light up
four<00:00:31.790> hours<00:00:31.820> with<00:00:32.419> the<00:00:32.570> little<00:00:32.839> current<00:00:33.230> it

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
four hours with the little current it

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.430 
four hours with the little current it
needs<00:00:33.589> but<00:00:34.280> a<00:00:34.550> bigger<00:00:34.879> motor<00:00:35.210> which<00:00:35.809> needs<00:00:36.079> way

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
needs but a bigger motor which needs way

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.349 
needs but a bigger motor which needs way
more<00:00:36.469> current<00:00:37.129> also<00:00:37.370> will<00:00:37.760> live<00:00:37.910> for<00:00:38.120> four

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:38.359 
more current also will live for four

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:42.579 
more current also will live for four
hours<00:00:38.719> you<00:00:39.589> know<00:00:39.739> what<00:00:39.920> I<00:00:40.219> call<00:00:41.749> so

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:42.589 
hours you know what I call so

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:44.529 
hours you know what I call so
in<00:00:42.739> this<00:00:42.920> video<00:00:43.129> let's<00:00:43.579> not<00:00:44.059> find<00:00:44.359> out<00:00:44.510> the

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
in this video let's not find out the

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.809 
in this video let's not find out the
true<00:00:44.870> capacitance<00:00:45.559> of<00:00:45.739> those<00:00:45.949> batteries<00:00:46.309> yet

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:46.819 
true capacitance of those batteries yet

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:49.360 
true capacitance of those batteries yet
but<00:00:47.539> let's<00:00:48.079> have<00:00:48.260> some<00:00:48.530> fun<00:00:48.829> with<00:00:49.069> a<00:00:49.100> bit<00:00:49.339> of

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
but let's have some fun with a bit of

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.259 
but let's have some fun with a bit of
extreme<00:00:49.909> discharging<00:00:50.979> overcharging<00:00:51.979> and

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
extreme discharging overcharging and

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.350 
extreme discharging overcharging and
short-circuit<00:00:53.269> experiments

first<00:01:06.950> of<00:01:07.130> all<00:01:07.250> let's<00:01:07.820> inspect<00:01:08.180> the

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
first of all let's inspect the

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.179 
first of all let's inspect the
protective<00:01:08.840> packaging<00:01:09.320> of<00:01:09.500> those<00:01:09.829> turrets

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
protective packaging of those turrets

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.999 
protective packaging of those turrets
and<00:01:10.640> as<00:01:11.180> you<00:01:11.299> can<00:01:11.509> see<00:01:11.750> it<00:01:12.079> tells<00:01:12.500> us<00:01:12.770> that

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
and as you can see it tells us that

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:14.709 
and as you can see it tells us that
there's<00:01:13.219> a<00:01:13.310> protective<00:01:13.880> circuit<00:01:14.329> inside

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
there's a protective circuit inside

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:16.959 
there's a protective circuit inside
which<00:01:15.439> prevents<00:01:15.950> it<00:01:16.039> from<00:01:16.219> over<00:01:16.700> discharge

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969 
which prevents it from over discharge

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:20.370 
which prevents it from over discharge
when<00:01:17.719> its<00:01:17.869> voltage<00:01:18.289> falls<00:01:18.649> under<00:01:19.100> 2.5<00:01:19.729> volts

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
when its voltage falls under 2.5 volts

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.950 
when its voltage falls under 2.5 volts
overcharge<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:21.710> short<00:01:22.460> circuits<00:01:22.969> now<00:01:23.719> that

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
overcharge and short circuits now that

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.080 
overcharge and short circuits now that
would<00:01:24.200> spoil<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.680> fun<00:01:24.950> but<00:01:25.549> first<00:01:25.820> of<00:01:26.000> all

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
would spoil the fun but first of all

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.510 
would spoil the fun but first of all
let's<00:01:26.689> check<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.079> voltage<00:01:27.200> of<00:01:27.710> all<00:01:27.979> those<00:01:28.189> six

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
let's check the voltage of all those six

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.849 
let's check the voltage of all those six
batteries<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:29.450> most<00:01:30.020> of<00:01:30.229> them<00:01:30.380> have<00:01:30.649> actually

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:30.859 
batteries and most of them have actually

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:33.249 
batteries and most of them have actually
a<00:01:31.100> pretty<00:01:31.399> good<00:01:31.609> voltage<00:01:31.850> no<00:01:32.719> complaints

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
a pretty good voltage no complaints

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.859 
a pretty good voltage no complaints
there<00:01:33.320> but<00:01:34.189> just<00:01:34.369> as<00:01:34.549> I<00:01:34.579> thought<00:01:34.939> there<00:01:35.570> was<00:01:35.810> a

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
there but just as I thought there was a

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.709 
there but just as I thought there was a
special<00:01:36.469> one<00:01:36.560> with<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.310> voltage<00:01:37.759> of<00:01:38.030> under<00:01:38.509> two

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
special one with a voltage of under two

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.590 
special one with a voltage of under two
volts<00:01:39.259> which<00:01:39.920> is<00:01:39.950> not<00:01:40.340> good<00:01:40.609> just<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:41.450> make

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
volts which is not good just to make

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.240 
volts which is not good just to make
sure<00:01:41.630> that<00:01:42.170> there<00:01:42.350> really<00:01:42.590> wasn't<00:01:43.009> a

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
sure that there really wasn't a

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.730 
sure that there really wasn't a
protective<00:01:43.729> circuit<00:01:44.179> I<00:01:44.390> started<00:01:45.200> to<00:01:45.320> solder<00:01:45.710> a

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
protective circuit I started to solder a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.859 
protective circuit I started to solder a
wire<00:01:45.770> to<00:01:46.219> the<00:01:46.369> plus<00:01:46.579> terminal<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.299> I<00:01:47.659> used

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
wire to the plus terminal and I used

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.929 
wire to the plus terminal and I used
sanding<00:01:48.289> paper<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:49.070> rough<00:01:49.280> up<00:01:49.429> the<00:01:49.549> negative

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
sanding paper to rough up the negative

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.029 
sanding paper to rough up the negative
terminal<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:50.780> I<00:01:50.810> could<00:01:51.079> solder<00:01:51.320> another<00:01:51.619> wire

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
terminal so I could solder another wire

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.700 
terminal so I could solder another wire
there<00:01:52.369> then<00:01:53.240> I<00:01:53.359> got<00:01:53.570> my<00:01:53.719> bench<00:01:53.960> power<00:01:54.229> supply

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
there then I got my bench power supply

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.940 
there then I got my bench power supply
and<00:01:54.979> limited<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.909> voltage<00:01:56.329> to<00:01:56.630> 4.2<00:01:57.289> volts<00:01:57.320> and

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
and limited the voltage to 4.2 volts and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.789 
and limited the voltage to 4.2 volts and
the<00:01:58.609> constant<00:01:59.090> current<00:01:59.299> to<00:01:59.630> 500<00:02:00.229> milliamps

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
the constant current to 500 milliamps

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.649 
the constant current to 500 milliamps
because<00:02:01.549> I<00:02:01.579> do<00:02:01.789> not<00:02:02.060> know<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.450> real

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
because I do not know the real

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.289 
because I do not know the real
capacitance<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:04.130> let's<00:02:04.369> charge<00:02:04.640> it<00:02:04.789> up<00:02:04.909> slowly

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
capacitance so let's charge it up slowly

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.169 
capacitance so let's charge it up slowly
it<00:02:06.109> took<00:02:06.439> quite<00:02:06.679> a<00:02:06.829> while<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.820> current

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
it took quite a while and the current

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.749 
it took quite a while and the current
draw<00:02:08.390> dropped<00:02:08.780> slowly<00:02:09.170> over<00:02:09.619> time<00:02:09.830> when<00:02:10.640> it

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
draw dropped slowly over time when it

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.540 
draw dropped slowly over time when it
was<00:02:10.940> somewhere<00:02:11.450> underneath<00:02:11.989> 100

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
was somewhere underneath 100

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.030 
was somewhere underneath 100
I<00:02:13.580> decided<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.360> stop<00:02:14.629> charging<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.409> put<00:02:16.010> a

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
I decided to stop charging and put a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.550 
I decided to stop charging and put a
load<00:02:16.250> on<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.519> battery<00:02:16.700> at<00:02:17.239> first<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:18.080> used<00:02:18.110> this

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
load on the battery at first I used this

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.250 
load on the battery at first I used this
high<00:02:18.799> power<00:02:19.099> LED<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:19.970> monitored<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.840> voltage

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
high power LED and monitored the voltage

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.530 
high power LED and monitored the voltage
with<00:02:21.500> my<00:02:21.709> multimeter<00:02:22.129> but<00:02:22.849> that<00:02:23.000> was<00:02:23.180> quite<00:02:23.480> a

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
with my multimeter but that was quite a

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.990 
with my multimeter but that was quite a
small<00:02:23.870> load<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:24.769> I<00:02:24.799> got<00:02:25.040> this<00:02:25.190> old<00:02:25.459> fashioned

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
small load so I got this old fashioned

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.300 
small load so I got this old fashioned
pole<00:02:26.239> which<00:02:26.840> drew<00:02:27.140> way<00:02:27.379> more<00:02:27.620> currents<00:02:28.129> and

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
pole which drew way more currents and

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.960 
pole which drew way more currents and
speeded<00:02:29.030> up<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.209> process<00:02:30.160> okay<00:02:31.160> now<00:02:31.760> we<00:02:31.819> are

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
speeded up the process okay now we are

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.610 
speeded up the process okay now we are
2.5<00:02:32.930> volts<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:34.220> should<00:02:34.430> turn<00:02:34.670> off<00:02:34.970> now<00:02:35.660> or

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
2.5 volts and it should turn off now or

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.460 
2.5 volts and it should turn off now or
now<00:02:38.049> or<00:02:39.049> now<00:02:39.500> well<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.760> call<00:02:41.750> this

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
now or now well I call this

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.589 
now or now well I call this
thing<00:02:42.799> has<00:02:43.129> no<00:02:43.370> protective<00:02:43.790> circuits<00:02:44.420> and

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
thing has no protective circuits and

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.110 
thing has no protective circuits and
where<00:02:45.260> should<00:02:45.470> it<00:02:45.500> hide<00:02:45.799> I<00:02:46.190> stripped<00:02:46.819> off<00:02:46.970> the

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
where should it hide I stripped off the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.539 
where should it hide I stripped off the
plastic<00:02:47.569> around<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.079> cell<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:48.590> there<00:02:49.370> is

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
plastic around the cell and there is

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.210 
plastic around the cell and there is
nothing<00:02:50.090> in<00:02:50.629> conclusion<00:02:51.200> there<00:02:51.890> is<00:02:52.040> no

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
nothing in conclusion there is no

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.160 
nothing in conclusion there is no
circuit<00:02:52.760> so<00:02:53.239> we<00:02:53.269> can<00:02:53.540> have<00:02:53.660> some<00:02:53.870> fun<00:02:53.900> with

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
circuit so we can have some fun with

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.650 
circuit so we can have some fun with
more<00:02:54.590> dangerous<00:02:55.069> experiments<00:02:55.940> for<00:02:56.599> the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
more dangerous experiments for the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.780 
more dangerous experiments for the
overcharge<00:02:57.260> test<00:02:57.620> I<00:02:57.859> got<00:02:58.129> myself<00:02:58.310> this

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
overcharge test I got myself this

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.539 
overcharge test I got myself this
12-volt<00:02:59.420> moped<00:02:59.930> battery<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.650> charge<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.430> up

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
12-volt moped battery and charge it up

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.400 
12-volt moped battery and charge it up
again<00:03:01.910> so<00:03:02.269> it<00:03:02.420> would<00:03:02.540> have<00:03:02.720> enough<00:03:03.019> power<00:03:03.230> to

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
again so it would have enough power to

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.309 
again so it would have enough power to
damage<00:03:04.010> these<00:03:04.310> things<00:03:04.700> I<00:03:05.030> also<00:03:05.540> chopped<00:03:06.049> up

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
damage these things I also chopped up

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.530 
damage these things I also chopped up
the<00:03:06.500> unprotected<00:03:06.859> battery<00:03:07.489> because<00:03:08.209> this

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
the unprotected battery because this

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.660 
the unprotected battery because this
will<00:03:08.780> be<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:08.989> victim<00:03:09.530> for<00:03:09.799> the<00:03:09.829> short<00:03:10.190> circuit

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
will be the victim for the short circuit

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.539 
will be the victim for the short circuit
experiment<00:03:11.299> I<00:03:11.540> also<00:03:12.109> use<00:03:12.470> these<00:03:12.769> long<00:03:13.040> acrylic

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
experiment I also use these long acrylic

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.280 
experiment I also use these long acrylic
pipes<00:03:13.819> and<00:03:14.239> hot<00:03:14.480> glued<00:03:14.750> a<00:03:14.900> piece<00:03:15.109> of

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
pipes and hot glued a piece of

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.229 
pipes and hot glued a piece of
cardboards<00:03:15.829> in<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.099> top<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:16.940> that<00:03:16.970> the

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
cardboards in the top so that the

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.879 
cardboards in the top so that the
batteries<00:03:17.630> can<00:03:17.930> sit<00:03:18.169> there<00:03:18.410> later

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
batteries can sit there later

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.699 
batteries can sit there later
ok<00:03:19.669> now<00:03:20.060> let's<00:03:20.269> move<00:03:20.419> this<00:03:20.599> outside<00:03:20.810> because

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
ok now let's move this outside because

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.430 
ok now let's move this outside because
this<00:03:22.250> can<00:03:22.579> be<00:03:22.730> dangerous<00:03:23.389> and<00:03:23.870> let<00:03:24.079> me<00:03:24.230> tell

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
this can be dangerous and let me tell

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.830 
this can be dangerous and let me tell
you<00:03:24.620> that<00:03:24.769> you<00:03:24.829> should<00:03:25.190> not<00:03:25.430> do<00:03:25.819> this<00:03:26.060> let's

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
you that you should not do this let's

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.589 
you that you should not do this let's
start<00:03:27.260> with<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.590> overcharge<00:03:28.220> we<00:03:28.790> place<00:03:29.090> a<00:03:29.120> 12

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
start with the overcharge we place a 12

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.870 
start with the overcharge we place a 12
volt<00:03:29.810> battery<00:03:29.900> on<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.500> ground<00:03:30.769> and<00:03:31.099> check<00:03:31.700> the

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
volt battery on the ground and check the

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.000 
volt battery on the ground and check the
voltage<00:03:32.000> again<00:03:32.540> we<00:03:33.290> used<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.650> screw

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
voltage again we used the screw

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.309 
voltage again we used the screw
terminals<00:03:34.549> to<00:03:34.819> secure<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:35.299> exposed<00:03:35.690> wires<00:03:36.019> to

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
terminals to secure the exposed wires to

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.710 
terminals to secure the exposed wires to
the<00:03:36.440> battery<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:37.099> cut<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:38.000> amp<00:03:38.150> meter<00:03:38.299> in

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
the battery and cut the amp meter in

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.349 
the battery and cut the amp meter in
place<00:03:38.989> with<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.099> flick<00:03:40.370> of<00:03:40.489> a<00:03:40.609> switch<00:03:40.639> the

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
place with the flick of a switch the

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.720 
place with the flick of a switch the
three<00:03:41.750> point<00:03:42.049> seven<00:03:42.440> volt<00:03:42.470> batteries<00:03:43.220> started

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
three point seven volt batteries started

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.900 
three point seven volt batteries started
charging<00:03:43.970> with<00:03:44.419> a<00:03:44.510> 12<00:03:44.810> volt<00:03:44.900> source<00:03:45.489> and<00:03:46.489> it

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
charging with a 12 volt source and it

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.620 
charging with a 12 volt source and it
was<00:03:47.150> boring<00:03:47.959> like<00:03:48.919> really<00:03:49.819> nothing<00:03:50.269> happens

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
was boring like really nothing happens

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.710 
was boring like really nothing happens
the<00:03:51.169> amp<00:03:51.319> draw<00:03:51.590> settle<00:03:52.069> around<00:03:52.310> 1m<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.150> we

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
the amp draw settle around 1m and we

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.860 
the amp draw settle around 1m and we
waited<00:03:54.049> and<00:03:54.290> waited<00:03:55.069> and<00:03:55.480> nothing<00:03:56.480> happens

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
waited and waited and nothing happens

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.259 
waited and waited and nothing happens
that's<00:03:57.530> a<00:03:57.769> plus<00:03:58.010> point<00:03:58.250> for<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.639> battery

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
that's a plus point for the battery

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.110 
that's a plus point for the battery
I<00:03:59.299> guess<00:03:59.959> now<00:04:00.650> let's<00:04:00.889> try<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.220> short<00:04:01.639> circuit

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
I guess now let's try the short circuit

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.300 
I guess now let's try the short circuit
I<00:04:02.359> used<00:04:02.780> some<00:04:03.019> silver<00:04:03.440> copper<00:04:03.739> wire<00:04:04.099> to

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
I used some silver copper wire to

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.670 
I used some silver copper wire to
connect<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.819> plus<00:04:05.060> and<00:04:05.359> minus<00:04:05.959> terminal<00:04:06.440> and

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
connect the plus and minus terminal and

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.890 
connect the plus and minus terminal and
immediately<00:04:07.459> drop<00:04:07.819> the<00:04:07.970> battery<00:04:08.359> into<00:04:08.690> the

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
immediately drop the battery into the

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.170 
immediately drop the battery into the
acrylic<00:04:09.230> pipe<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:10.069> guess<00:04:10.549> what<00:04:10.760> happened

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
acrylic pipe and guess what happened

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.770 
acrylic pipe and guess what happened
after<00:04:11.510> 20<00:04:11.959> minutes<00:04:12.579> nothing<00:04:13.579> well<00:04:14.419> it<00:04:14.569> got

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
after 20 minutes nothing well it got

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.930 
after 20 minutes nothing well it got
pretty<00:04:15.019> hot<00:04:15.319> but<00:04:15.859> nothing<00:04:16.340> more<00:04:16.519> happens

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
pretty hot but nothing more happens

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.930 
pretty hot but nothing more happens
another<00:04:17.780> plus<00:04:18.109> for<00:04:18.289> the<00:04:18.380> battery<00:04:18.709> but<00:04:19.370> we<00:04:19.729> got

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
another plus for the battery but we got

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.450 
another plus for the battery but we got
an<00:04:20.060> extra<00:04:20.479> and<00:04:20.720> now<00:04:21.140> a<00:04:21.169> short<00:04:21.530> circuit<00:04:22.010> but

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
an extra and now a short circuit but

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.670 
an extra and now a short circuit but
this<00:04:22.729> time<00:04:23.030> we<00:04:23.240> could<00:04:23.450> measure<00:04:23.719> the<00:04:24.020> amps

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
this time we could measure the amps

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.830 
this time we could measure the amps
and<00:04:24.770> at<00:04:24.979> first<00:04:25.220> they<00:04:25.520> went<00:04:25.759> down<00:04:25.940> to<00:04:25.970> around<00:04:26.419> 7

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
and at first they went down to around 7

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.710 
and at first they went down to around 7
amps<00:04:27.259> only<00:04:28.039> to<00:04:28.220> rise<00:04:28.370> up<00:04:28.580> to<00:04:28.639> around<00:04:29.060> 9<00:04:29.300> amps

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
amps only to rise up to around 9 amps

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.930 
amps only to rise up to around 9 amps
afterwards<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:30.620> we<00:04:31.130> even<00:04:31.310> got<00:04:31.550> a<00:04:31.610> small

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
afterwards and we even got a small

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.240 
afterwards and we even got a small
explosion<00:04:32.389> at<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.780> end<00:04:33.080> they<00:04:33.680> even<00:04:34.039> ripped

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
explosion at the end they even ripped

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.760 
explosion at the end they even ripped
off<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.610> plastic<00:04:35.060> protection<00:04:35.449> what<00:04:36.410> can<00:04:36.680> I

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
off the plastic protection what can I

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.279 
off the plastic protection what can I
say<00:04:37.009> at<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.370> end<00:04:37.520> these<00:04:38.210> things<00:04:38.630> may<00:04:38.990> not<00:04:39.169> have

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
say at the end these things may not have

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.260 
say at the end these things may not have
a<00:04:39.320> protective<00:04:39.860> circuits<00:04:40.370> but<00:04:40.850> they<00:04:41.030> are<00:04:41.120> not

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
a protective circuits but they are not

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.390 
a protective circuits but they are not
as<00:04:41.419> dangerous<00:04:41.660> as<00:04:42.139> I<00:04:42.350> thought<00:04:42.560> I<00:04:42.620> would<00:04:42.949> be<00:04:43.160> and

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
as dangerous as I thought I would be and

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.279 
as dangerous as I thought I would be and
that<00:04:43.430> doesn't<00:04:44.210> mean<00:04:44.330> that<00:04:44.690> you<00:04:44.810> should<00:04:45.020> try

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
that doesn't mean that you should try

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:45.580 
that doesn't mean that you should try
this

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
this

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.310 
this
let's<00:04:46.280> end<00:04:46.550> this<00:04:46.729> experiment<00:04:47.150> here<00:04:47.720> and<00:04:47.960> if

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
let's end this experiment here and if

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.140 
let's end this experiment here and if
