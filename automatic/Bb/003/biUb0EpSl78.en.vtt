00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
sounds like you're doing and I think

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.789 
sounds like you're doing and I think
that<00:01:53.460> you'll<00:01:53.610> be<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.820> pretty<00:01:54.030> good<00:01:54.119> shape

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
that you'll be in pretty good shape

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.499 
that you'll be in pretty good shape
having<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.979> well-trained<00:01:56.369> dog<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.270> side

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
having a well-trained dog is just a side

with your dog and I think you're gonna
be<00:02:03.719> just<00:02:04.079> fine<00:02:04.590> if<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.100> continue<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.880> do<00:02:06.329> that

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509
