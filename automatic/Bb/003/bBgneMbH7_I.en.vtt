make that comparison I mean here it is

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.000 
make that comparison I mean here it is
alright<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.630> distribution<00:01:47.050> of<00:01:47.560> bright<00:01:47.830> and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
alright the distribution of bright and

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
I know sizes the mental thing so there

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.470 
I know sizes the mental thing so there
you<00:02:14.830> go<00:02:15.010> that's<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.640> diffuse<00:02:16.060> line<00:02:16.239> and<00:02:16.390> they're

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
you go that's a diffuse line and they're

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.250 
you go that's a diffuse line and they're
going<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.659> look<00:02:16.780> at<00:02:16.870> fire<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.170> sparkle<00:02:17.920> now

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
going to look at fire and sparkle now

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.470 
going to look at fire and sparkle now
okay<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.860> when<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.489> dim<00:02:21.640> spot<00:02:21.970> lighting<00:02:22.239> now

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
okay and when the dim spot lighting now

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.140 
okay and when the dim spot lighting now
looking<00:02:22.870> at<00:02:23.019> fire<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:23.519> sparkle<00:02:24.519> primarily

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
looking at fire and sparkle primarily

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.050 
looking at fire and sparkle primarily
Sparkle<00:02:25.870> scintillation<00:02:27.390> okay

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
Sparkle scintillation okay

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.630 
Sparkle scintillation okay
and<00:02:30.060> we<00:02:30.209> can<00:02:30.390> see<00:02:30.599> it<00:02:33.050> okay<00:02:34.459> there<00:02:35.459> is<00:02:35.610> a

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
and we can see it okay there is a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:51.240 
and we can see it okay there is a
visible<00:02:36.150> difference<00:02:36.330> from<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.870> three

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.130 

really<00:03:05.340> an<00:03:05.519> excellent<00:03:06.120> demonstration<00:03:06.269> of<00:03:07.019> the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
really an excellent demonstration of the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.259 
really an excellent demonstration of the
trade-offs<00:03:08.450> when<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.540> go<00:03:09.689> from<00:03:10.969> you<00:03:11.969> know<00:03:12.000> the

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
trade-offs when you go from you know the

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.770 
trade-offs when you go from you know the
kind<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:12.840> diamonds<00:03:13.260> at<00:03:13.349> we<00:03:13.469> handpick<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.480> GI

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
kind of diamonds at we handpick to a GI
