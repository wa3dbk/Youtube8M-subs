for<00:01:41.939> example<00:01:42.479> avian<00:01:43.170> flu<00:01:43.380> we<00:01:44.130> think<00:01:44.399> most<00:01:44.700> of

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
for example avian flu we think most of

for example Lyme disease is transmitted

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.130 
for example Lyme disease is transmitted
by<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.009> bite<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.790> infected<00:02:03.030> ticks<00:02:03.810> that

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
by the bite of infected ticks that

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.950 
by the bite of infected ticks that

for that a multidisciplinary approach
