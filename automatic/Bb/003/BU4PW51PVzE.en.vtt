to raise money we know how to put
management<00:05:53.229> teams<00:05:53.440> together<00:05:53.620> we<00:05:54.190> know<00:05:54.310> how<00:05:54.490> to

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
management teams together we know how to

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.309 
management teams together we know how to
market<00:05:54.970> our<00:05:55.120> product<00:05:55.449> so<00:05:55.810> i<00:05:55.840> think<00:05:55.960> for<00:05:56.229> the

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 
market our product so i think for the

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:58.050 
market our product so i think for the
first<00:05:56.349> time<00:05:56.710> you<00:05:56.860> have<00:05:56.979> a<00:05:57.009> generation<00:05:57.520> and<00:05:57.970> I

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
first time you have a generation and I

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.089 
first time you have a generation and I
