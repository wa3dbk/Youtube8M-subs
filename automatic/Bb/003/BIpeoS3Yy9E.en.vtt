texture<00:00:04.680> now<00:00:05.490> when<00:00:05.700> we're<00:00:05.879> putting<00:00:06.150> a

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
texture now when we're putting a

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.049 
texture now when we're putting a
knockdown<00:00:06.930> texture<00:00:07.410> on<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.859> wall<00:00:08.309> it's

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059

what we're going to use is we're
actually<00:00:16.590> going<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.010> use<00:00:17.430> any<00:00:18.240> kind<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.720> a

that's<00:00:26.880> what<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.720> would<00:00:27.900> use<00:00:28.230> now<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
that's what we would use now the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.130 
that's what we would use now the
alternate<00:00:29.490> method<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.060> applying<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.779> that

alternate method of applying this that
I'm<00:00:31.830> going<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.070> demonstrate<00:00:32.610> today<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:33.410> just

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
I'm going to demonstrate today is just

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.680 
I'm going to demonstrate today is just
using<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:35.399> roller<00:00:37.700> so<00:00:38.700> with<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> roller<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.540> can

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
using a roller so with a roller we can

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.910 
using a roller so with a roller we can
actually<00:00:40.850> put<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:41.969> into<00:00:42.239> place<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.989> then

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
actually put this into place and then

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.639 
actually put this into place and then
take<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> roller<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.000> what<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:45.870> want<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.140> do<00:00:46.289> is

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
take a roller and what we want to do is

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.040 
take a roller and what we want to do is
we<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.100> want<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.550> roll<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.760> coat<00:00:48.090> now<00:00:48.719> as<00:00:48.899> I'm

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
we just want to roll a coat now as I'm

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.180 
we just want to roll a coat now as I'm
rolling<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.590> one<00:00:49.829> good<00:00:50.010> thing<00:00:50.039> about

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
rolling this one good thing about

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.119 
rolling this one good thing about
knockdown<00:00:50.910> texture<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.829> that<00:00:52.829> if<00:00:52.949> you've<00:00:53.100> got

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
knockdown texture is that if you've got

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.220 
knockdown texture is that if you've got
some<00:00:53.460> old<00:00:53.640> wall<00:00:53.850> particularly<00:00:54.510> old<00:00:54.629> plaster

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
some old wall particularly old plaster

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.170 
some old wall particularly old plaster
walls<00:00:55.500> or<00:00:55.980> walls<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.520> are<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.789> pretty<00:00:57.090> rough

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
walls or walls that are in pretty rough

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.299 
walls or walls that are in pretty rough
shape<00:00:57.440> instead<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.559> having<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.949> go<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
shape instead of having to go to the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.369 
shape instead of having to go to the
cost<00:00:59.579> of<00:01:02.120> completely<00:01:03.120> tearing<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.809> out<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
cost of completely tearing that out and

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.760 
cost of completely tearing that out and
redraw<00:01:04.890> watry<00:01:05.880> drywalling<00:01:06.360> nose<00:01:06.689> then<00:01:07.530> you

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
redraw watry drywalling nose then you

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.380 
redraw watry drywalling nose then you
can<00:01:07.950> use<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.280> knockdown<00:01:08.760> texture<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.330> gives

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
can use this knockdown texture it gives

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.870 
can use this knockdown texture it gives
you<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.689> nice<00:01:09.960> look<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:11.100> will<00:01:11.220> cover<00:01:11.549> all

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
you a nice look and it will cover all

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.660 
you a nice look and it will cover all
the<00:01:12.270> imperfections<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.560> wall<00:01:13.830> or<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the imperfections in a wall or in a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.820 
the imperfections in a wall or in a
ceiling<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.299> again<00:01:15.900> something<00:01:16.259> very<00:01:16.590> easy

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
ceiling and again something very easy

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.910 
ceiling and again something very easy
that<00:01:17.189> anybody<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.850> do<00:01:18.350> now<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.439> importance

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
that anybody can do now the importance

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.950 
that anybody can do now the importance
next<00:01:20.280> step<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.729> once<00:01:21.060> we've<00:01:21.270> got<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.689> good

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
next step is that once we've got a good

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.460 
next step is that once we've got a good
coating<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.220> wall<00:01:23.400> such<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.470> we're

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
coating on the wall such as this we're

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.240 
coating on the wall such as this we're
going<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.680> want<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.979> let<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.340> set<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.229> dry

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
going to want to let this set up and dry

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.920 
going to want to let this set up and dry
just<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.369> little<00:01:29.579> bit<00:01:29.790> now<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.030> longer<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:30.720> let

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
just a little bit now the longer we let

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.300 
just a little bit now the longer we let
it<00:01:31.049> dry<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:32.060> then<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.659> better<00:01:33.900> texture<00:01:34.860> we're

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
it dry and then the better texture we're

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.039 
it dry and then the better texture we're
going<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.610> get<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.360> better<00:01:36.509> knock<00:01:36.810> down

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
going to get the better knock down

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.350 
going to get the better knock down
texture<00:01:37.560> we're<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.040> get<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.520> then<00:01:39.299> you

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
texture we're going to get and then you

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.539 
texture we're going to get and then you
can<00:01:39.689> take<00:01:39.869> any<00:01:40.200> kind<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.920> knife<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.400> this

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
can take any kind of a knife in this

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.090 
can take any kind of a knife in this
case<00:01:41.820> I've<00:01:42.180> got<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.420> plastic<00:01:42.869> taping<00:01:43.560> knife<00:01:43.740> or

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
case I've got a plastic taping knife or

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.840 
case I've got a plastic taping knife or
a<00:01:44.640> broad<00:01:45.149> knife<00:01:45.450> such<00:01:45.810> as<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.350> six<00:01:47.340> inch<00:01:47.579> or

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
a broad knife such as this six inch or

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.300 
a broad knife such as this six inch or
even<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.899> 10<00:01:49.110> inch<00:01:49.290> taping<00:01:49.740> knife<00:01:49.890> now<00:01:50.100> they

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
even a 10 inch taping knife now they

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.190 
even a 10 inch taping knife now they
make<00:01:50.549> special<00:01:50.850> knockdown<00:01:51.509> knives<00:01:51.869> but

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
make special knockdown knives but

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.030 
make special knockdown knives but
believe<00:01:52.530> me<00:01:52.560> these<00:01:53.899> probably<00:01:54.899> more<00:01:55.560> unlikely

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
believe me these probably more unlikely

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.399 
believe me these probably more unlikely
or<00:01:56.280> tools<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.210> already<00:01:57.240> have<00:01:57.719> around<00:01:57.869> or

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
or tools that you already have around or

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.319 
or tools that you already have around or
they're<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> little<00:01:59.399> more<00:01:59.579> cost-effective<00:02:00.299> to

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
they're a little more cost-effective to

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.240 
they're a little more cost-effective to
buy<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.840> they<00:02:00.960> will<00:02:01.140> work<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:01.409> fine<00:02:01.799> on<00:02:02.159> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
buy and they will work just fine on the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.590 
buy and they will work just fine on the
knockdown<00:02:02.640> texture<00:02:03.890> now<00:02:04.890> once<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:05.460> do<00:02:05.640> once

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
knockdown texture now once we do once

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.960 
knockdown texture now once we do once
we've<00:02:06.750> got<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.259> place<00:02:08.250> we've<00:02:08.489> let<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.729> dry<00:02:08.940> a

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
we've got the place we've let it dry a

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.669 
we've got the place we've let it dry a
little<00:02:09.149> bit<00:02:09.300> then<00:02:09.989> what<00:02:10.200> we're<00:02:10.319> going<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.470> do

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
little bit then what we're going to do

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.440 
little bit then what we're going to do
is<00:02:10.830> we're<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.009> going<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.310> put<00:02:11.580> our<00:02:11.760> taping

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
is we're just going to put our taping

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.550 
is we're just going to put our taping
knife<00:02:12.750> at<00:02:13.050> a

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
knife at a

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.949 
knife at a
light<00:02:13.680> angle<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:14.880> find<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.270> easier<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.690> work

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
light angle and I find it easier to work

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.080 
light angle and I find it easier to work
left<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.440> right<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:17.040> then<00:02:17.550> we<00:02:17.730> want<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.030> just

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
left to right and then we want to just

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.890 
left to right and then we want to just
lightly<00:02:18.569> drag<00:02:19.280> over<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.670> top<00:02:20.880> now<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:21.720> is

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
lightly drag over the top now this is

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.270 
lightly drag over the top now this is
still<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.140> little<00:02:22.200> wet<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:22.800> we're<00:02:22.920> not<00:02:23.069> going<00:02:23.250> to

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
still a little wet so we're not going to

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.270 
still a little wet so we're not going to
quite<00:02:23.670> get<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.540> appearance<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.349> we<00:02:25.980> want

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
quite get the appearance that we want

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.030 
quite get the appearance that we want
but<00:02:27.239> as<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:27.540> see<00:02:27.690> right<00:02:27.840> here<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.410> this

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
but as you can see right here in this

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.729 
but as you can see right here in this
section<00:02:29.569> what<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:30.720> does<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.200> just<00:02:31.440> knocks

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
section what it does is it just knocks

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.360 
section what it does is it just knocks
down<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.550> top<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.450> leaves<00:02:34.370> some

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
down the top and it leaves some

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.210 
down the top and it leaves some
impressions<00:02:36.440> around<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.739> that's<00:02:37.890> what<00:02:38.130> we

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
impressions around and that's what we

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.000 
impressions around and that's what we
want<00:02:38.459> again<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.940> drier<00:02:39.269> this<00:02:39.599> is<00:02:39.900> then<00:02:40.530> the
