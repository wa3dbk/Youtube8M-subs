00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
I miss a couple of the first shots wide

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.110 
I miss a couple of the first shots wide
open<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.440> rating<00:00:37.440> shots<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.760> happens<00:00:39.059> a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
open a rating shots and this happens a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.910 
open a rating shots and this happens a
lot<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.600> game<00:00:39.840> where<00:00:42.350> you<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.770> throw

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
lot in a game where you you just throw

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.229 
lot in a game where you you just throw
up<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.100> lot<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.309> shots<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.059> just

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
up a lot of shots and you just you just

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.940 
up a lot of shots and you just you just
miss<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:46.050> no<00:00:46.200> idea<00:00:46.440> why<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.620> missed

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
miss and you have no idea why you missed

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.740 
miss and you have no idea why you missed
and<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> reason<00:00:47.910> why<00:00:48.059> these<00:00:48.510> are<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
and this is the reason why these are the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.209 
and this is the reason why these are the
hot<00:00:48.960> zones<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:49.739> see<00:00:49.890> these<00:00:50.070> by

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
hot zones and you can see these by

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.850 
hot zones and you can see these by
pressing<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:51.030> back<00:00:51.239> button<00:00:51.270> or<00:00:52.170> select<00:00:52.410> in

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
pressing the back button or select in

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.670 
pressing the back button or select in
the<00:00:53.579> practice<00:00:53.969> mode<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:54.930> see<00:00:55.140> even

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the practice mode as you can see even

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.459 
the practice mode as you can see even
though<00:00:55.920> Nick<00:00:56.129> Young<00:00:56.250> has<00:00:56.550> great<00:00:56.969> stats<00:00:57.690> great

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
though Nick Young has great stats great

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.689 
though Nick Young has great stats great
shooting<00:00:58.890> stats<00:00:59.250> he<00:01:00.059> has<00:01:00.629> no<00:01:01.020> good<00:01:01.949> hot<00:01:02.340> zones

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
shooting stats he has no good hot zones

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.509 
shooting stats he has no good hot zones
so<00:01:03.329> basically<00:01:04.290> what<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.589> hot<00:01:04.769> zones<00:01:05.010> do<00:01:05.280> is

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
so basically what the hot zones do is

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.060 
so basically what the hot zones do is
they<00:01:05.820> either<00:01:06.780> give<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.260> little<00:01:07.650> boost<00:01:07.799> of

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
they either give you a little boost of

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.590 
they either give you a little boost of
shooting<00:01:08.430> or<00:01:08.580> what<00:01:08.790> they<00:01:08.909> do<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.180> negate<00:01:09.570> some

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
shooting or what they do is negate some

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.560 
shooting or what they do is negate some
of<00:01:09.960> your<00:01:10.650> missed<00:01:10.920> time<00:01:11.280> shots<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.299> as<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.479> can

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
of your missed time shots so as you can

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.359 
of your missed time shots so as you can
see<00:01:12.630> right<00:01:12.900> here<00:01:12.930> even<00:01:13.710> though<00:01:13.799> I'm<00:01:13.920> shooting

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
see right here even though I'm shooting

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.190 
see right here even though I'm shooting
technically<00:01:15.000> well<00:01:15.210> I'm<00:01:15.540> missing<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.020> lot<00:01:16.049> of

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
technically well I'm missing a lot of

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.260 
technically well I'm missing a lot of
shots<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.340> if<00:01:17.430> you're<00:01:17.549> going<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.090> think

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
shots so but if you're going to I think

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.289 
shots so but if you're going to I think
two<00:01:18.600> shots<00:01:18.869> here<00:01:19.020> with<00:01:20.009> Maurice<00:01:20.400> sprites<00:01:21.090> was

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
two shots here with Maurice sprites was

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.630 
two shots here with Maurice sprites was
really<00:01:21.540> good<00:01:21.659> shooting<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.350> make<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.130> miss<00:01:23.400> one

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
really good shooting I make one miss one

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.690 
really good shooting I make one miss one
but<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:25.500> overall<00:01:25.890> message<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.490> if<00:01:26.610> you

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
but the overall message is that if you

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.149 
but the overall message is that if you
go<00:01:26.850> into<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.540> hot<00:01:27.810> zones<00:01:28.170> multiple<00:01:28.650> times

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
go into the hot zones multiple times

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.370 
go into the hot zones multiple times
you're<00:01:29.700> more<00:01:29.850> likely<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.420> make<00:01:30.750> them<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.320> a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
you're more likely to make them on a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.620 
you're more likely to make them on a
more<00:01:31.740> consistent<00:01:31.890> basis<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
more consistent basis this is the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.950 
more consistent basis this is the
difference<00:01:33.960> between<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.560> lot<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> players

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
difference between a lot of the players

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.660 
difference between a lot of the players
I'm<00:01:36.960> gonna<00:01:37.170> switch<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.530> here<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.890> LeBron<00:01:38.159> James

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
I'm gonna switch it here to LeBron James

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.819 
I'm gonna switch it here to LeBron James
really<00:01:39.060> quick<00:01:39.329> as<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.200> see<00:01:40.380> imma<00:01:40.560> shoot<00:01:40.710> a

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
really quick as you can see imma shoot a

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.210 
really quick as you can see imma shoot a
three-point<00:01:41.220> shot<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:42.030> his<00:01:42.270> hot<00:01:42.479> zone<00:01:42.799> and<00:01:43.799> he

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
three-point shot in his hot zone and he

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.980 
three-point shot in his hot zone and he
makes<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.520> no<00:01:44.640> problem<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.659> all<00:01:45.750> know<00:01:45.869> that

line one at mid-range Kevin is probably
one<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.760> better<00:02:42.600> mid-range<00:02:43.320> shooters<00:02:43.770> in

ton of shots his jump shot is what makes

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.130

him really deadly and it's really

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.950 
him really deadly and it's really
surprising<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.950> he<00:02:53.070> only<00:02:53.190> has<00:02:53.460> two<00:02:53.960> outside

the difference also it's easier to get

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.530 
the difference also it's easier to get
an<00:03:06.840> a-plus<00:03:07.320> rating<00:03:07.530> while<00:03:08.250> you're<00:03:08.490> in<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:09.030> hot

over<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.120> court<00:03:33.360> it<00:03:33.480> basically<00:03:33.750> means<00:03:33.960> that

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
over the court it basically means that

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.200

3-point shooter in real life it's a

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.680 
3-point shooter in real life it's a
weird<00:03:41.220> thing<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:41.790> they<00:03:41.880> gave<00:03:42.090> him<00:03:42.120> this<00:03:42.480> this

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
weird thing that they gave him this this

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.960 
weird thing that they gave him this this
is<00:03:42.960> mostly<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.290> reason<00:03:43.650> why<00:03:43.770> Steve<00:03:44.310> Novak<00:03:44.580> can

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
is mostly the reason why Steve Novak can

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.540 
is mostly the reason why Steve Novak can
do<00:03:45.090> stuff<00:03:45.450> like<00:03:45.540> this<00:03:45.810> in<00:03:46.020> a<00:03:46.080> game<00:03:46.430> coming<00:03:47.430> off

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
I'm not releasing it correctly and

I'm not releasing it correctly and
defense<00:04:11.610> that's<00:04:11.850> in<00:04:12.000> front<00:04:12.240> of<00:04:12.360> me

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
defense that's in front of me

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.890

because<00:04:13.590> I'm<00:04:13.709> in<00:04:13.830> a<00:04:13.860> hot<00:04:14.130> zone<00:04:14.160> in<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:15.720> and

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
because I'm in a hot zone in the and

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.570 
because I'm in a hot zone in the and
that's<00:04:16.049> probably<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.500> problem<00:04:17.010> here<00:04:17.190> now<00:04:17.340> as

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
that's probably the problem here now as

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.430 
that's probably the problem here now as
I<00:04:17.700> go<00:04:17.850> back<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.270> practice<00:04:18.720> here<00:04:18.989> you<00:04:19.290> can

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
I go back to the practice here you can

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.440 
I go back to the practice here you can
see<00:04:19.590> I'm<00:04:19.859> right<00:04:20.400> now<00:04:20.549> I'm<00:04:20.790> intentionally

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
see I'm right now I'm intentionally

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.150 
see I'm right now I'm intentionally
trying<00:04:21.720> to<00:04:21.810> miss<00:04:22.020> time<00:04:22.200> these<00:04:22.440> shots<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:22.919> as

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
trying to miss time these shots and as

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.950 
trying to miss time these shots and as
you<00:04:23.280> can<00:04:23.400> see<00:04:23.580> I'm<00:04:23.820> butter<00:04:24.540> everywhere<00:04:25.080> so

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
you can see I'm butter everywhere so

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.990 
you can see I'm butter everywhere so
this<00:04:26.110> is<00:04:26.259> just<00:04:26.440> a<00:04:26.530> little<00:04:26.889> insight<00:04:27.490> just<00:04:27.819> a

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
this is just a little insight just a

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.570 
this is just a little insight just a
small<00:04:28.270> insight<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:28.930> why<00:04:29.289> you<00:04:30.009> missed<00:04:30.250> so<00:04:30.460> many

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
small insight to why you missed so many

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.340 
small insight to why you missed so many
wide-open<00:04:31.090> shots<00:04:31.360> it's<00:04:31.750> mostly<00:04:32.199> because

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
wide-open shots it's mostly because

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.260 
wide-open shots it's mostly because
you're<00:04:32.680> not<00:04:32.889> in<00:04:33.250> a<00:04:34.410> hot<00:04:35.410> zone<00:04:36.030> so<00:04:37.030> if<00:04:37.120> you're

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
you're not in a hot zone so if you're

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.790 
you're not in a hot zone so if you're
missing<00:04:37.360> a<00:04:37.599> bunch<00:04:37.780> of<00:04:37.840> shots<00:04:38.080> that<00:04:38.410> you<00:04:38.530> think

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
missing a bunch of shots that you think

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.070 
missing a bunch of shots that you think
you<00:04:38.889> should<00:04:39.190> make<00:04:39.490> then<00:04:40.090> go<00:04:40.360> into<00:04:40.509> practice

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
you should make then go into practice

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.170 
you should make then go into practice
take<00:04:41.500> a<00:04:41.530> look<00:04:41.740> at<00:04:41.830> the<00:04:41.919> hot<00:04:42.099> zones<00:04:42.430> this<00:04:42.819> may

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
take a look at the hot zones this may

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.990 
take a look at the hot zones this may
lead<00:04:43.509> to<00:04:43.770> some<00:04:44.770> insight<00:04:45.280> about<00:04:45.490> why<00:04:45.940> you

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
lead to some insight about why you

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.600 
lead to some insight about why you
missed<00:04:46.419> so<00:04:46.630> many<00:04:46.750> jump<00:04:47.110> shots<00:04:47.169> but<00:04:47.800> a<00:04:48.160> lot<00:04:48.580> of

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
missed so many jump shots but a lot of

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.400 
missed so many jump shots but a lot of
the<00:04:48.819> superstars<00:04:49.419> like<00:04:49.690> Kevin<00:04:49.960> Durant<00:04:50.020> or

know if those things apply when you're

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:14.100 
know if those things apply when you're
in<00:05:12.220> practice<00:05:12.759> I<00:05:12.940> don't<00:05:13.030> know<00:05:13.150> if<00:05:13.270> it<00:05:13.360> just<00:05:13.509> uses

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
in practice I don't know if it just uses

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.159 
in practice I don't know if it just uses
that<00:05:14.139> actual<00:05:14.710> stats<00:05:15.070> themselves<00:05:15.699> but<00:05:16.419> at<00:05:16.990> the

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
that actual stats themselves but at the

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.260 
that actual stats themselves but at the
very<00:05:17.289> least<00:05:17.440> you<00:05:17.860> can<00:05:18.039> see<00:05:18.280> here<00:05:18.580> and<00:05:18.849> you<00:05:19.120> can

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
very least you can see here and you can

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.350 
very least you can see here and you can
see<00:05:19.479> that<00:05:19.720> Novak<00:05:20.349> has<00:05:20.620> nine<00:05:21.340> or<00:05:21.550> ten<00:05:21.789> hot<00:05:22.060> zones

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
see that Novak has nine or ten hot zones

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.529 
see that Novak has nine or ten hot zones
whereas<00:05:22.750> someone<00:05:23.020> like<00:05:23.139> Carmelo<00:05:23.710> or<00:05:24.539> Kevin

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
whereas someone like Carmelo or Kevin

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.110 
whereas someone like Carmelo or Kevin
Durant<00:05:25.810> has<00:05:26.050> has<00:05:26.409> one<00:05:26.710> or<00:05:26.860> two<00:05:26.909> there<00:05:27.909> has<00:05:28.090> to

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
Durant has has one or two there has to

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.790 
Durant has has one or two there has to
be<00:05:28.270> a<00:05:28.360> reason<00:05:28.750> behind<00:05:28.780> that<00:05:29.259> and<00:05:29.470> I<00:05:29.500> think<00:05:29.560> we

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
be a reason behind that and I think we

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.629 
be a reason behind that and I think we
should<00:05:29.979> look<00:05:30.070> at<00:05:30.220> that

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
should look at that

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.850 
should look at that
to<00:05:30.909> really<00:05:31.300> figure<00:05:31.509> out<00:05:31.780> why<00:05:32.080> certain<00:05:32.590> players

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
to really figure out why certain players

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.880 
to really figure out why certain players
missed<00:05:33.220> so<00:05:33.400> many<00:05:33.520> shots
