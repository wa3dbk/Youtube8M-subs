00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 Hello dear viewers with you filatov 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.730
 Alexander 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.120
 on my channel which is called a vector 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:13.620
 There is such a video as hang closet without 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.640
 the gap who did not watch it look I 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.270
 I think it will be useful to someone 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.890
 to today's video we dedicate to what 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.600
 this way which i'm about which i 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.849
 told the doctors a little bit finalized 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.349
 Simplified a bit and today I will tell 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:34.590
 how to assemble wall cabinets furniture 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:40.050
 yes you can and hated bottom cabinets in 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:43.320
 twice as fast and twice as comfortable I 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.309
 already here has prepared a wardrobe that in the future 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.640
 cuisine what is the principle 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:53.989
 advanced let's say so 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.520
 the way we milled four slots 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.770
 depth of 5 millimeters 5 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.460
 millimeters in 4 parts in two 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.250
 vertical 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.309
 in two horizontal and in these cuts 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.229
 inserted as a parse and stenochku in 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.159
 In this case, what I propose to do 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.760
 we do the side walls more than 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.670
 lower 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:22.680
 20 millimeters that is here 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:25.800
 you can clearly see the difference we only mill in 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.680
 two details in the left 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.970
 right vertically we mill 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.180
 our bottom pass did not touch that is 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.670
 we have two times less milling 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.760
 what remains for us to do the next stage 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.280
 let's put on the wall remember how 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.650
 pretty problematic alone 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:53.600
 man insert let on the wall here 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:58.380
 here you can insert in two ways 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:02.070
 grooves and push well me or me 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.290
 filed yes you have a lid more than necessary 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.210
 libya 3 grain 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.220
 at a depth of less than necessary there is always 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.700
 Plan b 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:17.990
 if the plan worked here, look at you 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.990
 how just expose our record 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.840
 that's actually all installation 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.480
 takes much less time that us 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:45.990
 it remains now we are sure to be shooting 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:45.990
 with you diagonal 1208 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:03:00.599
 1207 well, almost 1208 that is, such 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:02.010
 video the next stage is to have not or 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.590
 lorak as a result of some kind there 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:09.060
 the displacement of our our manipulations 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.910
 deans left me usually nailing 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.860
 stapler 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:18.569
 several places it is enough to 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:23.660
 fix and then what should be put 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.660
 take a drill to put pita 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:30.680
 put ratchet 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.010
 but torque one and notice 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.629
 self-tapping screws 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:41.190
 I do not know about you and I fix the back wall 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:42.829
 you will execute 16 screws me so 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.670
 Will not find the method calmly 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:51.060
 here and see what advantages 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:53.519
 two times less milling plus come on 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:58.079
 wall to assemble in seconds 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:01.010
 suppress too + cutter thereby with 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:05.430
 help with which our bases are milled 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:11.819
 serves twice as thick along daughter daughter 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:15.989
 and daughter and how let's get longer 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:19.699
 correctly what else would you like to say 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.699
 I would like to take this opportunity 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:27.110
 thank the viewers for watching and 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.810
 my channel and already more than twenty thousand 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.690
 subscribers already in the region of 150 people 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.720
 very nice for me, thus I 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.759
 I understand that I do it not for nothing that people 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.930
 like people maybe brings 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:45.900
 some favor a lot of comments 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.770
 about my videos there are positive 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.940
 there is no positive want to thank 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.400
 due to positive or negative 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.289
 for me it is also useful for me 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.099
 great experience but there are some 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:01.650
 comments which is very very bad and 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:05.789
 I would not want such 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:09.539
 comments more fell on my 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:12.000
 channel my friends if I want a little bit 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.349
 clarify the situation what I did I 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.139
 never said I'm the best 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:18.750
 master i never said my 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.870
 the best way to work 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.090
 the only way and nothing else is just 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.300
 my vision of this question is 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.310
 problems no more if you have other 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.639
 tell me another opinion 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:36.780
 but you should never be correct 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:39.599
 I urge you to see this 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.909
 if you have an apple and i have 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.979
 an apple we will exchange these 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:46.949
 apples that we will have each 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:49.139
 on apple and if you have information and 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:51.030
 I have information and we will exchange to 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.780
 Information everyone will have 2 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.620
 information so i call you 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:02.350
 let's instead discuss 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:04.420
 condemn our my videos or something suddenly 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.680
 and some masters let's share 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:10.140
 experience to organize a group of some 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.750
 I tell each other in the same way 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.560
 gain experience additional and 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:18.910
 self-cultivate i think it will 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:21.580
 more correctly and today it is all not 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:26.130
 work up to see you soon 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:28.470
 and by the way about the promised video about 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.460
 fixture bloom everything is filmed 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.320
 just not enough time to 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.910
 mount it soon 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.060
 I'll do these videos 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:40.290
 promised to see you see you soon
