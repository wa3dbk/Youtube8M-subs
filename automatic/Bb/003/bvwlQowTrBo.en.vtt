misteriosa and eliminating him the
terrain<00:00:41.010> was<00:00:41.040> really<00:00:41.519> easy<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.850> get<00:00:42.000> around

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
the rest so that is about it this is a

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.620 
the rest so that is about it this is a
really<00:01:20.399> short<00:01:20.640> one<00:01:20.819> actually<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.390> was

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
really short one actually I was

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.820 
really short one actually I was
surprised<00:01:21.929> how<00:01:22.080> quickly<00:01:22.289> i<00:01:22.410> was<00:01:22.560> able<00:01:22.649> to<00:01:22.709> get

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
surprised how quickly i was able to get

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.919 
surprised how quickly i was able to get
this<00:01:22.950> one<00:01:23.130> done<00:01:23.360> stealthily<00:01:24.360> too<00:01:24.660> which<00:01:24.899> is

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
this one done stealthily too which is

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.900 
this one done stealthily too which is
really<00:01:25.259> surprising<00:01:26.190> but<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.550> guess<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.880> just

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
really surprising but I guess it just

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.949 
really surprising but I guess it just
wasn't<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.360> many<00:01:27.450> guards<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.899> the

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:27.959 
wasn't that many guards in the

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:28.870 
wasn't that many guards in the
