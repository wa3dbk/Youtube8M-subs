00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.390
 can you help us find this channel of 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.130
 youtube stroman table to present 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.450
 the 5th day of our strength sequence 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.610
 directed to the strongman to improve the 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.360
 Basic marks or mass force 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.279
 good generated you have had before 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.260
 train a little special now what 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.329
 we will explain must be taken into account and 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.450
 analyze the four days that we have already 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.930
 hung up and think that this normally 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:46.160
 almost always it's a Friday we would have 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.239
 done day 1 2 3 and 4 monday tuesday 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.820
 Wednesday Thursday 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.070
 this would be Friday and then Saturday 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.469
 Sunday I would play hard training of 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.050
 stroman there are times that if we are very 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.940
 touched we rested Saturday and we 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.620
 we put Sunday morning but there 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.179
 many times when we leave a Sunday 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.000
 of rest is we put Saturday by the 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.080
 tomorrow so this should be Friday 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.690
 it's late 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.570
 here manager is not a little bit of 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.960
 recovery between quotation marks since good 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.160
 we are not machines either and the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.640
 Stromal training is very 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.710
 important to arrive a tad cool there 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.870
 Sometimes it comes we take it if it's something 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.790
 very important to total rest and 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.250
 rest and has shown the would happen to 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.680
 dominated but usually Monday Tuesday 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.420
 Wednesday Thursday are the four days of 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.820
 sequence that you have had but not 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.400
 are always in that order they are always 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.320
 those trainings in the current phase the 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.660
 Friday would be this and Saturday Sunday 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.540
 between the ends of agreement we have 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.880
 put the only muscle groups there 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.970
 stimulated in quotes because 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.720
 obviously with that amount of three 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.940
 it is both the triceps chest day and the 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.920
 shoulder day on all the triceps 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.510
 It was this worked but here we put 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.760
 guidelines in quotation marks because 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.270
 obviously in the gang always 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.410
 there is always some beach of those 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.270
 that when you're clueless is 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.429
 copying use your copying the high schools 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.709
 the fourth then to train a little 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.230
 free 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:18.230
 so I'm dedicated to doing 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.750
 isometric or do eccentric phases of 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.970
 biceps that injured me to try 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.430
 recover the best then maybe something 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.120
 some triceps thing the other that has 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.489
 more impetus for pumping indexes taking 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.159
 a little training of pulleys makes 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.560
 a little bit of the other is a little bit about 40 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.690
 minutes of free trainings on the 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.400
 so we understand arms for 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.349
 example I do not understand it properly 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.540
 because the heated content is sad 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:48.170
 of all the judges and more in this 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.989
 sequence that the day before these 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.900
 the clean is on Thursday, the 4th, this would be 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.760
 56 a brutal pressure tablecloth 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.639
 shoulders and therefore I have my feet 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.549
 warm and vice I do not dedicate myself more to 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:03.409
 stretch them and make a recovery of 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.659
 right biceps and then compensation 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.970
 from the left to train them on themselves but 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.639
 each in this 40 minute strip 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.650
 does what they get they also have to 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.790
 stop careful because it's the next day 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.519
 you have to make noise 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.069
 or that tore me with balls adif 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.560
 and for the care because you're not 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.900
 doing an aesthetic sport but that 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.250
 it's being a performance sport 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.799
 therefore it is not important 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.290
 biceps size but it comes healthy and 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:33.829
 strong to do for the wheels since 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.930
 you work a lot here and everyone that the 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.299
 Mount as you have goals if you 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.189
 he says I want to do biceps and I do 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.060
 I can incorporate already from back what can 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:42.950
 change 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.620
 this is the sequence as we do 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.389
 we would not be for aesthetics the most 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.670
 adequate because we do not train for 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:53.090
 aesthetic of agreement then we will do 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.849
 abdominal always very important not 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.889
 we have put them we usually do them 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.959
 a weekday and this day more a 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.329
 deeper background means almost one 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.430
 working hour working roller 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.049
 inferiors hanging today is 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.519
 very important to work it 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.680
 although I since I was a bodybuilder in 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.569
 numbers but and some 3g train 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.840
 with me says they see them they have no intention 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.819
 never do it because they work 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.459
 to be stronger the stroma by 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.010
 example and it is not its purpose in the 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.840
 actuality is the center of the body the 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.600
 center of gravity is important 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.220
 strong abdomen to lift a wheel 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.410
 prey with the abdomen side is 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.210
 constantly losing and point number 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.020
 two and very important to avoid hernias 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:38.050
 all of us who work hard a lot 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.660
 from the end to there all up 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.690
 here and there it is very important to have a 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.690
 Abdominal girdle shares and strong for 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.700
 avoid hernias because the hernias are 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.919
 very important injuries and very 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.380
 usual in strength goals here the 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:57.010
 importance of working the abdomen well 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.440
 agree not 10 minutes and work the 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.020
 10 minute Mali running after finishing 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.750
 the training we saved a day for 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.940
 do them well in group agreement and 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.660
 then cardillo energy what we do 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.910
 here is not working on 12 glasses or the 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.280
 anaerobic series that interest us 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.900
 for this sea that is much much 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.580
 intensity little time but that 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.080
 we just take a little bit for the 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.900
 champion we give you a ride 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.689
 chatting with each other to relax 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.460
 a little step to do a little cardio 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:30.250
 and chat and make the group that always 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:33.490
 they go very well agree to have a group 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.159
 strong the training of people who 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.770
 he explains but he is amazed at how he feels 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:42.129
 hears in the series but wants to finish 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.419
 the siege the pique is very important and 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.520
 then back all ones 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:48.639
 stretches in agreement we add that 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.349
 with the position the stretches to 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:54.280
 come back from the cardio also very 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:56.139
 important since we are not very 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.659
 supporters of the stretches very 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:01.030
 strong at the end of workouts like 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:03.909
 what we have done because the stones are 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.469
 swollen ones are very very very touched and 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:07.690
 from that moment stretch a little longer 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:09.909
 It's fine but we 're not supporters of 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.830
 hit the big stretched after a 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:13.779
 massacre of legs because there are many 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.940
 small fibrillar break much small 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:17.319
 contracture and maybe not the best 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.029
 moment 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:22.060
 the benefits of stretching maybe 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:24.940
 be less than at another time 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.400
 we prefer then this day quietly 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.470
 stretch in agreement we do a little bit 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.680
 2013 with the abdominals we take the ride 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:35.169
 and then calmly with the legs 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.880
 touched of previous then already but not 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:39.280
 of the same thousand but they have reposed 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.400
 10 and 124 hours we started the 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.470
 stretches 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.970
 We chatted about how we will do the storm and 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.380
 how is one found another 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.509
 same as in the change with the pass of 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.100
 the abs and everyone for 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:52.529
 home and among all talk of 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:55.079
 physical training we do is sure 

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:56.909
 is our way is our day 5 and 

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:57.709
 we think it 's good to do it a bit 

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:00.149
 group 

00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:02.459
 brings many benefits because always 

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:03.629
 As I tell you , I learn what it does to 

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:06.029
 that he learned from what the other does 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:07.319
 I learn from what I learn that I learn 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:08.969
 that he says he's loaded with 

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:11.099
 here for another week to come we change 

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:12.809
 that order I learn from the other you saw and 

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:15.359
 maybe we had to do it like that because 

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:17.189
 it feels like this is very important well 

00:07:15.359 --> 00:07:19.679
 listen to the people who train with you 

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:22.259
 and who suffers with you because closing in 

00:07:19.679 --> 00:07:24.449
 yourself and in an absolute truth never 

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:27.149
 it's good it's always important to learn 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:29.069
 of all those around you and 

00:07:27.149 --> 00:07:31.379
 around the world that makes us 

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:34.109
 wiser in one and we can give better 

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:36.209
 advice and more more clairvoyants of 

00:07:34.109 --> 00:07:39.749
 agreement because this is our day 5 and 

00:07:36.209 --> 00:07:42.239
 Now all that's missing is Day 6, which is the 

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:44.519
 stroman 3 the sequence let's say 

00:07:42.239 --> 00:07:46.229
 Workouts from 1 to 5 5 days 

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:48.749
 now I am given a day of rest 

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:50.999
 after this normally and the 

00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:53.639
 Stroman training before returning 

00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:54.989
 to start the sequence of agreement then 

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:57.120
 We hope you liked today 

00:07:54.989 --> 00:07:59.430
 the fifth day was clear 

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.440
 the next video is already day 6 on the day 

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:03.600
 of truth the strong stroma of 

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.680
 weekend and we thank you very much 

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.680
 we see in future videos
