silk based units and things like that

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.020 
silk based units and things like that
typically<00:00:43.379> most<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.039> units<00:00:44.429> that<00:00:44.519> I<00:00:44.730> wear

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
typically most of the units that I wear

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.479 
typically most of the units that I wear
or<00:00:45.449> the<00:00:45.719> units<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.289> make<00:00:46.589> for<00:00:46.800> myself

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
or the units that I make for myself

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.239 
or the units that I make for myself
they're<00:00:47.730> usually<00:00:47.969> constructed<00:00:48.719> with<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.379> lace

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:50.249 
they're usually constructed with a lace

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:53.569 
they're usually constructed with a lace
closure<00:00:50.899> but<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.079> find<00:00:52.409> that<00:00:52.710> sometimes<00:00:53.159> with

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
closure but I find that sometimes with

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.270 
closure but I find that sometimes with
lace<00:00:53.819> closures<00:00:54.329> they<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:55.050> take<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.440> bit<00:00:56.249> more

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
lace closures they can take a bit more

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.329 
lace closures they can take a bit more
tweaking<00:00:56.940> or<00:00:57.179> units<00:00:57.600> with<00:00:57.870> lace<00:00:58.440> because<00:00:58.829> you

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
tweaking or units with lace because you

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.029 
tweaking or units with lace because you
may<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.729> to<00:01:00.059> have<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.229> company<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.829> bleach

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
may have to have the company to bleach

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.340 
may have to have the company to bleach
the<00:01:02.249> knots<00:01:02.460> or<00:01:02.850> bleach<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.510> notch<00:01:03.690> yourself

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the knots or bleach the notch yourself

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.190 
the knots or bleach the notch yourself
and<00:01:04.800> then<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.519> may<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.060> do<00:01:06.240> plucking<00:01:06.870> and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
and then you may have to do plucking and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.380 
and then you may have to do plucking and
all<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.560> good<00:01:07.800> stuff<00:01:07.830> well<00:01:08.549> not<00:01:08.909> really<00:01:09.090> good

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
all that good stuff well not really good

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.020 
all that good stuff well not really good
stuff<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.869> all<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.229> stuff<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:11.130> really<00:01:11.549> make

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
stuff and all that stuff to really make

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.950 
stuff and all that stuff to really make
that<00:01:12.240> unit<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.920> base<00:01:14.640> look<00:01:15.180> natural<00:01:15.750> but

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
that unit and the base look natural but

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.920 
that unit and the base look natural but
I<00:01:16.140> find<00:01:16.469> that<00:01:16.649> with<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.460> silk<00:01:17.759> closures<00:01:18.390> all<00:01:18.869> I

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
I find that with the silk closures all I

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.800 
I find that with the silk closures all I
have<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.500> do<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:20.039> just<00:01:20.820> part<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.329> like<00:01:21.539> what<00:01:21.780> I
