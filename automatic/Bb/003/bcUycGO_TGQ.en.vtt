yeah<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.510> what<00:00:39.809> big<00:00:40.110> games<00:00:40.379> are

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
yeah and this is what big games are

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.440 
yeah and this is what big games are
supposed<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.160> look<00:00:41.340> like<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.149> why<00:00:42.270> we

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
supposed to look like and this is why we

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.060 
supposed to look like and this is why we
talked<00:00:42.690> about<00:00:42.840> Brazil<00:00:43.350> should<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.680> taken<00:00:43.980> an

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
talked about Brazil should have taken an

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.279 
talked about Brazil should have taken an
approach<00:00:44.309> similar<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.090> but<00:00:45.780> neither

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
approach similar to this but neither

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.560 
approach similar to this but neither
team<00:00:46.620> wanted<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.129> give<00:00:47.370> much<00:00:47.640> away<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.270> wanted

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
team wanted to give much away and wanted

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.930 
team wanted to give much away and wanted
to<00:00:48.629> limit<00:00:49.020> time<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.590> space<00:00:49.860> for<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.700> whole

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
to limit time and space for the whole

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.080 
to limit time and space for the whole
team<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:51.690> also<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.350> key<00:00:52.530> players<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.820> for

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
team but also for key players and so for

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.760 
team but also for key players and so for
me<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.510> know<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.989> maybe<00:00:55.170> from<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.530> fan

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
me I know that maybe from a fan

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.650 
me I know that maybe from a fan
perspective<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.760> wasn't<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.239> exciting

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
perspective it wasn't that exciting

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.029 
perspective it wasn't that exciting
because<00:00:57.930> there<00:00:58.199> weren't<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.410> lot<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.649> chances

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
because there weren't a lot of chances

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.029 
because there weren't a lot of chances
and<00:00:59.190> no<00:00:59.309> goals<00:00:59.609> but<00:01:00.270> from<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.570> tactical

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
and no goals but from a tactical

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.139 
and no goals but from a tactical
intelligent<00:01:02.039> perspective<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.760> thought<00:01:03.000> this

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
intelligent perspective I thought this

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.429 
intelligent perspective I thought this
was<00:01:03.359> one<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> best<00:01:03.960> games<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
was one of the best games of the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.410 
was one of the best games of the
tournament<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.640> interesting<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.299> watch

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
tournament and so interesting to watch

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.270 
tournament and so interesting to watch
how<00:01:06.479> each<00:01:06.869> team<00:01:07.110> decided<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.860> approach<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
how each team decided to approach the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.039 
how each team decided to approach the
game<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.640> was<00:01:08.760> interesting<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.540> watch<00:01:09.570> them

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
penalties I'm not gonna lie when it went

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.580 
penalties I'm not gonna lie when it went
to<00:01:44.220> penalties<00:01:44.700> as<00:01:44.939> an<00:01:45.060> Argentine<00:01:45.509> fan<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.140> was

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
to penalties as an Argentine fan I was

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.289 
to penalties as an Argentine fan I was
excited<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.159> thought<00:01:47.369> they<00:01:47.579> had<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> advantage

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
excited I thought they had the advantage

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.870 
excited I thought they had the advantage
for<00:01:48.479> two<00:01:48.689> reasons<00:01:49.110> one<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:50.159> Netherlands<00:01:50.670> went

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
for two reasons one the Netherlands went

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.460 
for two reasons one the Netherlands went
to<00:01:50.970> PK's<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.479> their<00:01:51.600> last<00:01:51.840> game<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.110> think<00:01:52.290> that

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
to PK's in their last game I think that

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.469 
to PK's in their last game I think that
play<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> little<00:01:53.430> psychologically<00:01:54.299> and

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
play is in a little psychologically and

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.209 
play is in a little psychologically and
the<00:01:54.750> second<00:01:55.110> thing<00:01:55.259> was<00:01:55.409> they<00:01:55.649> had<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.979> burn

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
the second thing was they had to burn

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.459 
the second thing was they had to burn
that<00:01:56.490> last<00:01:56.820> substitution<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:58.020> take<00:01:58.229> van

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
that last substitution to take van

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.499 
that last substitution to take van
Persie<00:01:58.950> out<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.579> overtime<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.450> that

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
Persie out in the overtime and that

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.410 
Persie out in the overtime and that
meant<00:02:00.869> no<00:02:01.140> cruel<00:02:01.619> for<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.189> PK<00:02:02.549> shootout<00:02:03.000> yeah

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
meant no cruel for the PK shootout yeah

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.850 
meant no cruel for the PK shootout yeah
and<00:02:03.719> when<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.930> look<00:02:04.170> at<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.469> it's<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
and when you look at it it's the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.789 
and when you look at it it's the
halftime<00:02:05.490> sub<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:06.119> taking<00:02:06.570> off<00:02:06.750> Martins<00:02:07.619> indi

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
halftime sub of taking off Martins indi

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.190 
halftime sub of taking off Martins indi
that<00:02:08.580> really<00:02:08.970> challenged<00:02:09.479> them<00:02:09.660> from<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.989> sub

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
that really challenged them from a sub

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.999 
that really challenged them from a sub
perspective

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
perspective

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.530 
perspective
and<00:02:11.159> I'm<00:02:11.550> not<00:02:11.700> sure<00:02:11.940> if<00:02:12.000> they<00:02:12.120> took<00:02:12.300> them<00:02:12.450> out

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
and I'm not sure if they took them out

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.420 
and I'm not sure if they took them out
because<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:13.019> a<00:02:13.080> yellow<00:02:13.409> because<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:13.980> an<00:02:14.069> injury

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
because of a yellow because of an injury

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.580 
because of a yellow because of an injury
or<00:02:14.640> because<00:02:14.909> of<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.120> tactical<00:02:15.599> decision<00:02:15.750> but

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
or because of a tactical decision but

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.990 
or because of a tactical decision but
they<00:02:16.739> pretty<00:02:16.980> much<00:02:17.220> knew<00:02:17.430> going<00:02:17.670> into<00:02:17.849> the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
they pretty much knew going into the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.460 
they pretty much knew going into the
game<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.360> Deon<00:02:18.750> wasn't<00:02:19.110> going<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.290> be<00:02:19.379> able
