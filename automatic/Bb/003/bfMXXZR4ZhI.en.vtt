00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.160

 So we were there, they made a 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.390
 tower with the three of them playing here 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:22.550
 is the technical valet stadium or better the 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.730
 alex's dispatch stadium 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.680

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.900

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:04.280
 set up for this final every game I 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:07.190
 I really liked it bad without getting wet 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.380
 so it's good here that you change the 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.380
 name and finish explaining the 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.510

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:21.070
 he advances by beating the best he has been 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:25.030

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:51.860
 also if you remember is I was 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.950

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:58.430
 It's going to be the same thing coming here. 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:00.200
 to continue to Bulgaria and can steal a 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.500
 strong exit 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.900
 This may also mean bike here 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.280
 more expensive for what would be the 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.789
 continuation of total 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:14.660

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:17.810

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:46.250

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:08.039
