00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.410 

you<00:01:51.950> come<00:01:52.159> up<00:01:52.189> here<00:01:52.340> though<00:01:52.880> we<00:01:53.780> have<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.079> sim

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
no it's kind of a different story so it

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.389 
no it's kind of a different story so it
it's<00:02:01.970> pretty<00:02:02.329> good<00:02:02.539> stuff<00:02:02.899> I<00:02:03.200> really<00:02:03.979> like<00:02:04.159> it

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
it's pretty good stuff I really like it

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:13.110 
it's pretty good stuff I really like it
and<00:02:05.409> it<00:02:06.409> dries<00:02:06.740> up<00:02:07.070> rock<00:02:07.789> hard<00:02:08.289> rock<00:02:09.289> hard<00:02:09.649> and

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.910 

this<00:02:14.120> stuff<00:02:14.390> I<00:02:14.510> just<00:02:14.540> sprayed<00:02:14.930> today<00:02:15.050> so

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
this stuff I just sprayed today so

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.680 
this stuff I just sprayed today so
that's<00:02:16.310> why<00:02:16.459> I<00:02:16.489> just<00:02:16.640> put<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.000> little<00:02:17.420> scratch

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
that's why I just put a little scratch

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.890 
that's why I just put a little scratch
on<00:02:17.930> there<00:02:18.110> so<00:02:18.880> it<00:02:19.880> kind<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.239> contradicts<00:02:20.750> my

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
on there so it kind of contradicts my

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.039 
on there so it kind of contradicts my
point<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.290> was<00:02:21.410> making<00:02:21.560> but<00:02:22.450> no<00:02:23.450> this<00:02:23.690> stuff<00:02:23.900> was

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
point I was making but no this stuff was

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.850 
point I was making but no this stuff was
sprayed<00:02:24.440> about<00:02:25.340> half<00:02:25.580> an<00:02:25.700> hour<00:02:25.760> ago<00:02:25.970> but<00:02:26.860> we

great<00:02:58.660> as<00:02:59.660> long<00:02:59.720> as<00:03:00.049> you<00:03:00.170> have<00:03:00.380> it<00:03:00.470> clean<00:03:00.739> that

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
great as long as you have it clean that

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.390 
great as long as you have it clean that
we<00:03:01.640> just<00:03:02.359> had<00:03:02.480> no<00:03:02.660> problem<00:03:03.109> with<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.290> so<00:03:03.560> it

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
we just had no problem with it so it

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.259 
we just had no problem with it so it
looks<00:03:04.640> good<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.630> only<00:03:05.750> thing<00:03:06.079> I<00:03:06.260> wish<00:03:06.500> is<00:03:07.269> they

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
looks good the only thing I wish is they

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.050 
looks good the only thing I wish is they
had<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.450> little<00:03:08.660> bit<00:03:08.810> more<00:03:08.989> texture<00:03:09.380> to<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:10.060> that

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
had a little bit more texture to it that

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.490 
had a little bit more texture to it that
was<00:03:11.510> kind<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:11.870> look<00:03:12.019> I<00:03:12.140> was<00:03:12.260> hoping<00:03:12.380> for

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
was kind of the look I was hoping for

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.569 
was kind of the look I was hoping for
not<00:03:15.500> quite<00:03:15.799> like<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:15.980> bedliner<00:03:16.480> look<00:03:17.480> but<00:03:18.579> you

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
not quite like a bedliner look but you

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.099 
not quite like a bedliner look but you
know<00:03:19.700> a<00:03:19.910> little<00:03:20.120> more<00:03:20.329> it<00:03:20.450> is<00:03:20.600> it's<00:03:20.840> almost

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
know a little more it is it's almost

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.289 
know a little more it is it's almost
like<00:03:21.350> paint<00:03:21.650> this<00:03:22.459> is<00:03:22.609> the<00:03:22.670> only<00:03:22.819> problem<00:03:23.180> it's

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
like paint this is the only problem it's

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.580 
like paint this is the only problem it's
got<00:03:23.389> a<00:03:23.450> little<00:03:23.630> bit<00:03:23.810> of<00:03:23.959> a<00:03:24.019> texture<00:03:24.319> a<00:03:24.410> little

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
got a little bit of a texture a little

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.870 
got a little bit of a texture a little
bit<00:03:24.799> more<00:03:24.980> than<00:03:25.069> paint<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:25.459> can<00:03:25.579> tell<00:03:25.760> the

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
bit more than paint you can tell the

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.410 
bit more than paint you can tell the
difference<00:03:26.470> I<00:03:27.470> don't<00:03:28.100> know<00:03:28.190> if<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.340> can<00:03:28.579> with

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
difference I don't know if you can with

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.759 
difference I don't know if you can with
the<00:03:29.540> camera<00:03:29.989> or<00:03:30.440> not<00:03:30.680> but<00:03:31.040> that's<00:03:31.760> painted

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
the camera or not but that's painted

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.860 
the camera or not but that's painted
that's<00:03:33.769> not<00:03:34.069> so<00:03:34.940> there's<00:03:35.120> also<00:03:35.329> there's

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
that's not so there's also there's

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.569 
that's not so there's also there's
obviously<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.470> gloss<00:03:36.769> difference<00:03:37.660> but<00:03:39.579> it's

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
obviously a gloss difference but it's

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:41.620 
obviously a gloss difference but it's
the<00:03:40.670> only<00:03:40.760> thing<00:03:40.880> I<00:03:41.030> can<00:03:41.150> really<00:03:41.209> complain

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
the only thing I can really complain

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.849 
the only thing I can really complain
about<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:41.989> I<00:03:42.049> don't<00:03:42.170> really<00:03:42.500> think<00:03:42.620> I<00:03:42.829> can

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.780 
about and I don't really think I can
complain<00:03:43.160> about<00:03:43.220> that<00:03:43.579> so<00:03:45.220> overall<00:03:46.220> I'd<00:03:46.609> say

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790
