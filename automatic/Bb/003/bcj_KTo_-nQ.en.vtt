you've<00:02:09.539> got<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.810> make<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.229> certain<00:02:10.800> amount<00:02:10.950> of

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
you've got to make a certain amount of

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.509 
you've got to make a certain amount of
setups<00:02:11.640> all<00:02:12.390> day<00:02:12.689> but<00:02:13.349> what<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:13.739> also<00:02:13.890> learned

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
setups all day but what I also learned

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.350 
setups all day but what I also learned
is<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.760> i<00:02:15.090> could<00:02:15.540> create<00:02:15.810> very

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
is that i could create very

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.210 
is that i could create very
matic<00:02:16.630> effects<00:02:16.990> with<00:02:17.200> very<00:02:17.470> very<00:02:17.560> simple

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
matic effects with very very simple

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.900 
matic effects with very very simple
lighting<00:02:18.750> basically<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:19.780> was<00:02:20.020> using<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.910> one

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
lighting basically I was using a one

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.630 
lighting basically I was using a one
maybe<00:02:22.270> two<00:02:22.440> fluorescent<00:02:23.440> lights<00:02:24.010> position

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
maybe two fluorescent lights position

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.330 
maybe two fluorescent lights position
fairly<00:02:25.150> close<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.690> my<00:02:25.870> flowers<00:02:26.350> and<00:02:26.560> just<00:02:27.160> by

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
fairly close to my flowers and just by

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.160 
fairly close to my flowers and just by
moving<00:02:27.520> them<00:02:27.880> this<00:02:28.360> way<00:02:28.600> or<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.750> way<00:02:28.960> a

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
moving them this way or that way a

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.290 
moving them this way or that way a
little<00:02:29.410> bit<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:29.770> could<00:02:30.100> discover<00:02:30.730> new<00:02:31.030> worlds

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
little bit I could discover new worlds

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.480 
little bit I could discover new worlds
in<00:02:31.810> front<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.230> camera<00:02:33.510> this<00:02:34.510> helped<00:02:35.110> me<00:02:35.490> it

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
in front of the camera this helped me it

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.480 
in front of the camera this helped me it
informed<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.630> choices<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.320> I<00:02:38.470> made<00:02:38.830> when<00:02:39.460> I

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
informed the choices that I made when I

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.850 
informed the choices that I made when I
was<00:02:39.580> back<00:02:40.180> on<00:02:40.420> this<00:02:40.630> set<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.680> business

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
was back on this set in the business

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.100 
was back on this set in the business
that<00:02:42.190> I'm<00:02:42.370> in<00:02:42.580> making<00:02:43.330> mainstream<00:02:43.780> motion

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
that I'm in making mainstream motion

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.310 
that I'm in making mainstream motion
pictures<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:46.000> way<00:02:46.300> that<00:02:46.690> images<00:02:47.170> were

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
pictures the way that images were

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.010 
pictures the way that images were
gathered<00:02:47.770> for<00:02:48.070> decades<00:02:48.730> was<00:02:49.300> very<00:02:49.750> very

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
gathered for decades was very very

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.260 
gathered for decades was very very
stable<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:50.770> it<00:02:51.370> was<00:02:51.490> conventionally<00:02:52.060> done

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
stable and it was conventionally done

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.460 
stable and it was conventionally done
with<00:02:52.959> a<00:02:53.470> film<00:02:54.340> capture<00:02:55.270> and<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:56.170> didn't

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
with a film capture and that didn't

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.110 
with a film capture and that didn't
change<00:02:56.530> for<00:02:56.950> years<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.459> years<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:57.730> years<00:02:58.060> but

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
change for years and years and years but

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.940 
change for years and years and years but
within<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.630> last<00:02:58.810> 10<00:02:59.200> years<00:02:59.230> we<00:02:59.709> saw<00:02:59.890> the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
within the last 10 years we saw the

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.570 
within the last 10 years we saw the
advent<00:03:00.459> of<00:03:00.640> digital<00:03:01.170> cinematography<00:03:02.310> we<00:03:03.310> saw

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
advent of digital cinematography we saw

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.940 
advent of digital cinematography we saw
the<00:03:04.090> Panavision<00:03:04.420> genesis<00:03:05.080> come<00:03:05.290> along<00:03:05.560> the

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
the Panavision genesis come along the

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.940 
the Panavision genesis come along the
Arriflex<00:03:06.790> coming<00:03:07.420> along<00:03:07.660> with<00:03:07.900> their<00:03:08.020> d21<00:03:08.739> and

Arriflex coming along with their d21 and

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.370 
Arriflex coming along with their d21 and
now<00:03:09.040> they're<00:03:09.250> Alexa<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:09.940> this<00:03:10.480> this<00:03:10.989> is<00:03:11.260> the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
now they're Alexa and this this is the

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.080 
now they're Alexa and this this is the
first<00:03:11.620> time<00:03:11.890> that<00:03:11.950> we<00:03:12.489> are<00:03:12.520> actually<00:03:12.790> looking

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
first time that we are actually looking

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.900 
first time that we are actually looking
at<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.660> real<00:03:14.410> change<00:03:14.860> in<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.430> end<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.760> way

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
at a real change in the end the way

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.479 
at a real change in the end the way
motion<00:03:16.300> pictures<00:03:16.660> are<00:03:16.870> made<00:03:17.110> and<00:03:17.410> then<00:03:18.160> within

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
motion pictures are made and then within

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.610 
motion pictures are made and then within
the<00:03:18.670> last<00:03:18.850> couple<00:03:19.060> of<00:03:19.390> years<00:03:19.480> there's<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.260> SATA

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
the last couple of years there's a SATA

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.220 
the last couple of years there's a SATA
dreva<00:03:21.070> Lucien<00:03:21.459> and<00:03:21.610> that<00:03:21.810> cannon<00:03:22.810> is<00:03:22.930> coming

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
dreva Lucien and that cannon is coming

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.060 
dreva Lucien and that cannon is coming
along<00:03:23.470> with<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.830> hdslr<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:26.019> this<00:03:26.769> has

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
along with the hdslr and this has

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.060 
along with the hdslr and this has
allowed<00:03:27.370> us<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:28.019> rethink<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.709> way<00:03:29.739> we're

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
allowed us to rethink the way we're

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.199 
allowed us to rethink the way we're
gathering<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.760> lot<00:03:31.090> of<00:03:31.480> what<00:03:32.489> we<00:03:33.489> need<00:03:33.760> for

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
gathering a lot of what we need for

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.430 
gathering a lot of what we need for
making<00:03:34.959> major<00:03:35.250> motion<00:03:36.250> pictures<00:03:36.640> for<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.870> very

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
making major motion pictures for a very

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.789 
making major motion pictures for a very
reasonable<00:03:38.739> price<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:41.019> very<00:03:41.440> small

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
reasonable price and in a very small

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.580 
reasonable price and in a very small
package<00:03:42.430> elements<00:03:43.330> of<00:03:43.420> major<00:03:43.690> motion

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
package elements of major motion

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.350 
package elements of major motion
pictures<00:03:45.040> can<00:03:45.250> now<00:03:45.370> be<00:03:45.549> captured<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.209> I've

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
pictures can now be captured and I've

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.660 
pictures can now be captured and I've
started<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.870> look<00:03:46.989> at<00:03:47.140> this<00:03:47.260> in<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.920> very<00:03:48.209> very

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
started to look at this in a very very

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.310 
started to look at this in a very very
concentrated<00:03:51.670> way<00:03:52.239> because<00:03:52.720> this<00:03:53.140> is<00:03:53.290> a

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
concentrated way because this is a

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.160 
concentrated way because this is a
revolution<00:03:53.560> that's<00:03:54.130> happening<00:03:54.580> very<00:03:54.850> quickly

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
revolution that's happening very quickly

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.920 
revolution that's happening very quickly
but<00:03:56.489> even<00:03:57.489> though<00:03:57.610> at<00:03:57.760> this<00:03:57.970> point<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:58.750> here

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
but even though at this point and here

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.280 
but even though at this point and here
we<00:03:59.019> are<00:03:59.170> in<00:03:59.290> 2010<00:04:00.190> I<00:04:00.489> may<00:04:01.269> not<00:04:01.480> say<00:04:01.780> oh<00:04:01.989> I'm

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
we are in 2010 I may not say oh I'm

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.140 
we are in 2010 I may not say oh I'm
going<00:04:02.470> to<00:04:02.530> shoot<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.860> whole<00:04:03.040> picture<00:04:03.340> on<00:04:03.790> an

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.130 
going to shoot the whole picture on an
hdslr<00:04:05.049> I<00:04:05.320> can<00:04:05.830> certainly<00:04:06.070> decide<00:04:06.700> i<00:04:07.000> can<00:04:07.930> get

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
hdslr I can certainly decide i can get

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.449 
hdslr I can certainly decide i can get
many<00:04:09.269> insert<00:04:10.269> shots<00:04:10.630> on<00:04:10.900> an<00:04:11.019> hdslr<00:04:11.950> if<00:04:12.250> they're

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
many insert shots on an hdslr if they're

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.050 
many insert shots on an hdslr if they're
not<00:04:12.700> going<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.630> be<00:04:13.690> on<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.900> screen<00:04:14.170> for<00:04:14.230> a

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
massive amount of time I can certainly

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.550 
massive amount of time I can certainly
do<00:04:17.859> driving<00:04:18.400> background<00:04:19.030> plates<00:04:19.930> at<00:04:20.500> a

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
are 25 feet wide and I have just been

are 25 feet wide and I have just been
blown<00:04:51.020> away<00:04:51.350> by<00:04:52.360> how<00:04:53.360> close<00:04:53.810> they<00:04:54.500> have<00:04:54.530> come

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
blown away by how close they have come

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.840 
blown away by how close they have come
to<00:04:55.400> cameras<00:04:56.120> that<00:04:56.300> cost<00:04:56.540> a<00:04:56.870> lot<00:04:57.380> more<00:04:57.440> I<00:04:57.980> really

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
to cameras that cost a lot more I really

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.750 
to cameras that cost a lot more I really
love<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.240> smoothness<00:04:59.720> I<00:05:00.350> love<00:05:00.740> the<00:05:00.890> way<00:05:01.100> the

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
love the smoothness I love the way the

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.990 
love the smoothness I love the way the
the<00:05:01.790> sensor<00:05:02.600> renders<00:05:03.350> flesh<00:05:04.160> tones<00:05:04.490> I<00:05:04.790> think

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
the sensor renders flesh tones I think

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.200 
the sensor renders flesh tones I think
it's<00:05:05.120> very<00:05:05.180> very<00:05:05.750> film<00:05:06.080> like<00:05:06.320> the<00:05:06.980> HH<00:05:07.460> DSLR

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
it's very very film like the HH DSLR

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.680 
it's very very film like the HH DSLR
camera<00:05:08.570> what<00:05:08.750> canon<00:05:09.170> has<00:05:09.260> come<00:05:09.560> up<00:05:09.710> with<00:05:09.860> as<00:05:09.980> is

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
camera what canon has come up with as is

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.230 
camera what canon has come up with as is
capable<00:05:11.690> of<00:05:11.900> teaching<00:05:12.350> us<00:05:12.710> new<00:05:12.980> ways<00:05:13.520> to<00:05:14.000> look

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
capable of teaching us new ways to look

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.110 
capable of teaching us new ways to look
especially<00:05:14.720> in<00:05:15.530> terms<00:05:15.830> of<00:05:16.220> the<00:05:16.430> energies<00:05:16.880> that

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
especially in terms of the energies that

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.770 
especially in terms of the energies that
are<00:05:17.180> coming<00:05:17.630> off<00:05:19.180> artificial<00:05:20.180> light<00:05:20.419> at<00:05:20.720> night

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
are coming off artificial light at night

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.800 
are coming off artificial light at night
these<00:05:21.560> cameras<00:05:22.100> have<00:05:22.280> a<00:05:22.360> remarkable<00:05:23.360> way<00:05:23.600> of

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
these cameras have a remarkable way of

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.560 
these cameras have a remarkable way of
seeing<00:05:24.140> and<00:05:24.560> tuning<00:05:25.400> our<00:05:25.550> eyes<00:05:25.760> and<00:05:26.210> I<00:05:26.300> think

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
seeing and tuning our eyes and I think

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.120 
seeing and tuning our eyes and I think
that's<00:05:26.780> going<00:05:27.050> to<00:05:27.110> have<00:05:27.260> a<00:05:27.290> major<00:05:27.650> influence

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
that's going to have a major influence

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.390 
that's going to have a major influence
on<00:05:28.730> on<00:05:28.970> how<00:05:29.540> we<00:05:29.600> work<00:05:29.990> in<00:05:30.169> the<00:05:30.260> future<00:05:30.470> but<00:05:31.220> what

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
on on how we work in the future but what

on on how we work in the future but what
I<00:05:31.430> do<00:05:31.550> see<00:05:32.030> is<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:33.320> gifted<00:05:33.710> cinematographer

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580
