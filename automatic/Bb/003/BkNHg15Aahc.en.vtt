illuminators in it and that's quite an

illuminators in it and that's quite an
array<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:30.050> would<00:01:31.050> probably<00:01:31.380> prefer<00:01:31.950> less<00:01:32.520> of

them equaling the power of that many but

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.910 
them equaling the power of that many but
such<00:01:37.860> as<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.160> case<00:01:38.399> it's<00:01:39.149> quite<00:01:39.420> an<00:01:39.539> array<00:01:39.810> of

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
such as the case it's quite an array of

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.770 
such as the case it's quite an array of
IR<00:01:41.450> see<00:01:42.450> how<00:01:42.599> that<00:01:42.810> serves<00:01:43.110> me

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
IR see how that serves me

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.859 
IR see how that serves me
this<00:01:45.380> is<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.650> camera<00:01:45.920> that's<00:01:46.190> coming<00:01:46.610> down

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
this is the camera that's coming down

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.770 
this is the camera that's coming down
and<00:01:47.869> it's<00:01:48.380> been<00:01:48.560> doing<00:01:48.799> okay<00:01:49.600> it's<00:01:50.600> looking

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
and it's been doing okay it's looking

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.640 
and it's been doing okay it's looking
down<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.100> driveway<00:01:55.100> area<00:01:56.380> but<00:01:57.380> it<00:01:57.500> is<00:01:57.619> a

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
down to the driveway area but it is a

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.780 
down to the driveway area but it is a
struggle<00:01:57.950> that<00:01:58.549> lamp<00:01:59.060> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.950 

motion<00:02:03.570> lights<00:02:04.880> make<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.030> difficult<00:02:08.060> so<00:02:09.060> I'm

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
motion lights make this difficult so I'm

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.320 
motion lights make this difficult so I'm
hoping<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.680> very<00:02:10.950> focal<00:02:11.430> lens<00:02:11.610> will<00:02:11.970> give<00:02:12.150> me

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
hoping the very focal lens will give me

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.970 
hoping the very focal lens will give me
a<00:02:12.360> tighter<00:02:12.750> shot<00:02:13.110> on<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.410> cars<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.890> the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.540 
really need some tighter closer ID shots
let's<00:02:37.950> hope<00:02:38.130> this<00:02:38.310> works<00:02:38.520> out<00:02:38.820> we'll<00:02:39.150> see<00:02:40.550> so

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
let's hope this works out we'll see so

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.220 
let's hope this works out we'll see so
jumping<00:02:42.060> ahead<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.600> having<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.200> installed

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
jumping ahead to having it installed

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.620 
jumping ahead to having it installed
that's<00:02:46.230> what's<00:02:47.180> that's<00:02:48.180> where<00:02:48.480> it's

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
that's what's that's where it's

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.270 
that's what's that's where it's
installed<00:02:49.170> doing<00:02:49.680> its<00:02:49.800> thing<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:51.920> have<00:02:52.920> dual

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
installed doing its thing I have dual

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.100 
installed doing its thing I have dual
bright<00:02:53.990> motion<00:02:54.990> lights<00:02:55.470> on<00:02:55.800> my<00:02:56.100> driveway<00:02:56.460> and

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
bright motion lights on my driveway and

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.170 
bright motion lights on my driveway and
they<00:02:58.110> often<00:02:58.410> times<00:02:58.740> most<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.490> the<00:02:59.580> time<00:02:59.790> keeps

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
they often times most of the time keeps

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.620 
they often times most of the time keeps
the<00:03:00.450> IRS<00:03:01.410> off<00:03:01.830> on<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.790> cameras<00:03:03.330> in<00:03:03.480> this

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
the IRS off on the cameras in this

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.400 
the IRS off on the cameras in this
position<00:03:04.940> I'm<00:03:05.940> gonna<00:03:06.120> just<00:03:06.660> untwist<00:03:07.050> them<00:03:07.290> a

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
position I'm gonna just untwist them a

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.870 
position I'm gonna just untwist them a
notch<00:03:07.620> because<00:03:08.010> that's<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.459> easiest<00:03:08.670> way<00:03:08.850> to

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
notch because that's the easiest way to

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.430 
notch because that's the easiest way to
do<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.270> I<00:03:09.420> can't<00:03:09.690> get<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:09.959> switch<00:03:10.170> at<00:03:10.320> the

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
do it I can't get to the switch at the

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.300 
do it I can't get to the switch at the
moment<00:03:10.770> and<00:03:10.950> there<00:03:11.190> is<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.459> IR<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:14.160> that

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
moment and there is the IR and that

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.800 
moment and there is the IR and that
looks<00:03:14.550> pretty<00:03:14.640> good<00:03:14.880> I<00:03:15.120> mean<00:03:15.420> it's<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.720> little

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
looks pretty good I mean it's a little

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.490 
looks pretty good I mean it's a little
noisy<00:03:16.410> but<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.830> may<00:03:17.100> be<00:03:17.690> attributed<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:19.020> me

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
noisy but that may be attributed to me

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.100 
noisy but that may be attributed to me
not<00:03:20.190> having<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.670> camera<00:03:21.090> set<00:03:21.300> just<00:03:21.600> right<00:03:21.840> yet

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
not having the camera set just right yet

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.810 
not having the camera set just right yet
I<00:03:22.140> think<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.560> have<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.830> sharpness<00:03:23.190> boosted<00:03:23.760> a

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
I think I have the sharpness boosted a

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.120 
I think I have the sharpness boosted a
little<00:03:24.000> bit<00:03:24.209> it's<00:03:25.080> probably<00:03:25.500> some<00:03:25.680> settings

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
little bit it's probably some settings

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.390 
little bit it's probably some settings
that<00:03:26.190> I'm<00:03:26.370> gonna<00:03:26.459> have<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.730> noodle<00:03:27.150> with<00:03:27.380> to

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
that I'm gonna have to noodle with to

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.150 
that I'm gonna have to noodle with to
make<00:03:29.400> everything<00:03:29.880> look<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:31.590> best<00:03:31.800> it<00:03:31.980> can

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
make everything look the best it can

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.949 
make everything look the best it can
it's<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.580> little<00:03:32.790> noisy<00:03:32.970> but<00:03:33.239> I'll<00:03:33.600> tell<00:03:33.810> you

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
it's a little noisy but I'll tell you

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.590 
it's a little noisy but I'll tell you
what<00:03:34.200> that<00:03:34.440> is<00:03:34.500> really<00:03:35.130> a<00:03:35.160> nice<00:03:35.580> throw<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.150> IR

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
what that is really a nice throw of IR

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.690 
what that is really a nice throw of IR
there<00:03:37.020> it<00:03:37.200> really<00:03:37.380> brightens<00:03:37.890> up<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.310> picture

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
there it really brightens up the picture

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.210 
there it really brightens up the picture
very<00:03:39.000> very<00:03:39.360> nicely<00:03:39.630> it<00:03:40.260> is<00:03:40.320> just<00:03:40.650> before<00:03:41.010> dawn

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
very very nicely it is just before dawn

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.940 
very very nicely it is just before dawn
anot<00:03:41.520> dawn<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.300> not<00:03:42.540> totally<00:03:43.200> totally<00:03:43.650> dark

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
but still very dark out nice throw of IR

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.840 
but still very dark out nice throw of IR
all<00:03:47.700> those<00:03:47.880> 84<00:03:48.450> IR<00:03:48.900> s<00:03:49.160> you<00:03:50.160> know<00:03:50.280> make<00:03:50.550> a<00:03:50.580> nice

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
all those 84 IR s you know make a nice

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.180 
all those 84 IR s you know make a nice
bright<00:03:51.270> throw<00:03:51.720> and<00:03:52.730> here<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:54.440> I'm<00:03:55.440> just<00:03:55.860> coming

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
bright throw and here is I'm just coming

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.080 
bright throw and here is I'm just coming
home<00:03:56.370> from<00:03:57.020> work

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
home from work

home from work
I<00:03:59.230> do<00:04:00.230> these<00:04:00.800> kind<00:04:01.069> of<00:04:01.129> things<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:02.000> don't<00:04:02.209> know

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
I do these kind of things you don't know

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.420 
I do these kind of things you don't know
what<00:04:02.629> your<00:04:02.750> camera<00:04:02.959> is<00:04:03.170> gonna<00:04:03.290> do<00:04:03.560> until<00:04:04.160> you

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
what your camera is gonna do until you

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.690 
what your camera is gonna do until you
see<00:04:05.349> what<00:04:06.349> what's<00:04:06.800> going<00:04:07.099> on<00:04:07.310> when<00:04:07.489> you're<00:04:07.519> in

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
see what what's going on when you're in

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.229 
see what what's going on when you're in
it<00:04:07.940> when<00:04:08.450> you're<00:04:08.629> in<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.930> in<00:04:09.470> front<00:04:09.800> of<00:04:09.890> it<00:04:10.239> um

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
it when you're in the in front of it um

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.520 
it when you're in the in front of it um
I<00:04:12.050> know<00:04:13.010> me<00:04:13.430> I<00:04:13.730> can<00:04:14.060> identify<00:04:14.209> me<00:04:14.840> could<00:04:15.500> I

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
I know me I can identify me could I

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.039 
I know me I can identify me could I
identify<00:04:16.070> someone<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:16.579> I<00:04:16.639> don't<00:04:16.669> know<00:04:17.049> well

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
identify someone and I don't know well

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.740 
identify someone and I don't know well
probably<00:04:18.470> if<00:04:19.370> they<00:04:19.639> do<00:04:20.389> something<00:04:20.660> like<00:04:20.840> that

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
probably if they do something like that

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.800 
probably if they do something like that
and<00:04:23.750> walk<00:04:23.990> around<00:04:24.139> the<00:04:24.320> cars<00:04:25.060> this<00:04:26.060> is<00:04:26.270> just<00:04:26.660> a

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
and walk around the cars this is just a

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.980 
and walk around the cars this is just a
little<00:04:27.050> bit<00:04:27.199> of<00:04:28.120> moving<00:04:29.120> adjusting<00:04:29.870> the

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
little bit of moving adjusting the

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.140 
little bit of moving adjusting the
camera<00:04:30.229> around<00:04:30.620> I<00:04:30.770> had<00:04:30.949> timestamp<00:04:31.669> in<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.000> way

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
camera around I had timestamp in the way

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.210 
camera around I had timestamp in the way
I<00:04:32.570> you<00:04:32.870> know<00:04:32.990> I<00:04:33.020> just<00:04:33.260> needed<00:04:33.500> to<00:04:33.680> adjust<00:04:33.800> the

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
I you know I just needed to adjust the

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.379 
I you know I just needed to adjust the
field<00:04:35.210> of<00:04:35.450> view<00:04:35.630> a<00:04:35.690> little<00:04:35.990> better<00:04:37.389> the

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
field of view a little better the

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.430 
field of view a little better the
hardware<00:04:38.930> on<00:04:39.169> this<00:04:39.380> camera<00:04:39.919> is<00:04:40.100> just<00:04:40.130> great

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
hardware on this camera is just great

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.230 
hardware on this camera is just great
when<00:04:42.440> you<00:04:42.620> have<00:04:42.770> to<00:04:42.979> adjust<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.520> camera<00:04:43.729> once

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
when you have to adjust the camera once

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.420 
when you have to adjust the camera once
it's<00:04:44.419> finally<00:04:44.870> in<00:04:44.990> position<00:04:45.200> it's<00:04:45.830> really

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
it's finally in position it's really

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.400 
it's finally in position it's really
nice<00:04:46.639> to<00:04:46.910> adjust<00:04:47.300> really<00:04:47.660> easy<00:04:47.930> it's<00:04:48.200> not

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
nice to adjust really easy it's not

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.940 
nice to adjust really easy it's not
flimsy<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:50.360> Allen<00:04:50.780> screws<00:04:51.139> are<00:04:51.350> great<00:04:51.620> it

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
flimsy the Allen screws are great it

sighting<00:07:16.099> color<00:07:16.610> perfectly<00:07:17.269> so<00:07:17.599> how<00:07:17.809> about

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:18.019

00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:21.040 
sighting color perfectly so how about
that<00:07:18.259> for<00:07:18.439> residential<00:07:18.949> just<00:07:19.849> you<00:07:20.329> know<00:07:20.449> just

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.050 
that for residential just you know just

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.100 
that for residential just you know just
cosmetic<00:07:21.919> things<00:07:22.189> that<00:07:22.490> make<00:07:22.669> it<00:07:22.879> not<00:07:23.300> only

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.110 
cosmetic things that make it not only

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.909 
cosmetic things that make it not only
useful<00:07:24.379> but<00:07:25.039> kind<00:07:25.849> of<00:07:25.909> blends<00:07:26.209> and<00:07:26.629> looks<00:07:27.050> good

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 
useful but kind of blends and looks good

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:30.429 
useful but kind of blends and looks good
rather<00:07:28.459> than<00:07:28.610> looking<00:07:29.059> obtrusive<00:07:29.689> I<00:07:29.899> like

00:07:30.429 --> 00:07:30.439 
rather than looking obtrusive I like

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:32.409 
rather than looking obtrusive I like
this<00:07:30.619> camera<00:07:30.949> I<00:07:31.399> think<00:07:31.819> it's<00:07:31.939> one<00:07:32.149> worth

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:32.419 
this camera I think it's one worth

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:36.729 
this camera I think it's one worth
considering<00:07:33.139> I<00:07:33.319> hope<00:07:33.649> this<00:07:33.860> demo<00:07:34.159> helps<00:07:34.579> you
