is top 10 lists are way too overrated so

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.179 
is top 10 lists are way too overrated so
and<00:00:31.349> I'm<00:00:31.439> gonna<00:00:31.560> cheat<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> little<00:00:31.949> bit<00:00:32.099> here

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
and I'm gonna cheat a little bit here

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.160 
and I'm gonna cheat a little bit here
cuz<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.550> can't<00:00:32.759> remember<00:00:32.940> all<00:00:33.180> my<00:00:33.300> own<00:00:33.450> top<00:00:33.690> top

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
9 list so number one is too many mics

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.979 
9 list so number one is too many mics
for<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> job<00:00:38.280> never<00:00:38.790> used<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.660> one<00:00:39.809> will

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
for the job never used to and one will

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.540 
for the job never used to and one will
do<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.559> going<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.710> sound<00:00:40.950> very<00:00:41.280> funny

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
do and this is going to sound very funny

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.549 
do and this is going to sound very funny
coming<00:00:41.910> from<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.180> mic<00:00:42.390> manufacturer<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.379> tell

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
coming from a mic manufacturer to tell

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.990 
coming from a mic manufacturer to tell
you<00:00:43.680> maybe<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.100> don't<00:00:44.399> need<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.789> use<00:00:44.969> that

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
you maybe you don't need to use that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.389 
you maybe you don't need to use that
many<00:00:45.390> microphones<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> common

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
many microphones but a common

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.400 
many microphones but a common
misperception<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.239> if<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.930> need<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.200> mic

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
misperception is if you need to mic

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.110 
misperception is if you need to mic
something<00:00:49.890> put<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> bunch<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.520> mics<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.940> it'll

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
something put a bunch of mics and it'll

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.299 
something put a bunch of mics and it'll
sound<00:00:51.270> bigger<00:00:51.629> well<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.440> reality<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.219> you

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
sound bigger well the reality and you

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.350 
sound bigger well the reality and you
can<00:00:53.340> watch<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.699> segment<00:00:53.820> I'm<00:00:54.090> going<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.239> do

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
can watch a segment I'm going to do

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.319 
can watch a segment I'm going to do
called<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.809> three<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.170> one<00:00:55.350> rule<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:57.180> more

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
called the three to one rule is the more

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.240 
called the three to one rule is the more
mics<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.719> use<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.199> more<00:00:58.500> problems<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.070> can

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
mics you use the more problems you can

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.650 
mics you use the more problems you can
have<00:00:59.430> with<00:00:59.609> phase<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.239> actually<00:01:00.359> make

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
have with phase and it can actually make

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.420 
have with phase and it can actually make
it<00:01:00.780> sound<00:01:00.930> thinner<00:01:01.410> okay<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:01.949> that's<00:01:02.250> number

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
it sound thinner okay so that's number

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.179 
it sound thinner okay so that's number
one<00:01:02.699> number<00:01:02.879> two<00:01:03.600> would<00:01:04.379> be<00:01:04.530> choosing<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
one number two would be choosing the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.920 
one number two would be choosing the
wrong<00:01:05.339> mic<00:01:05.640> or<00:01:05.850> monitor<00:01:06.240> placement<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> live

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
wrong mic or monitor placement in a live

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.500 
wrong mic or monitor placement in a live
situation<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.619> then<00:01:07.710> blaming<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> mic<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.119> a

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
situation and then blaming the mic so a

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.870 
situation and then blaming the mic so a
lot<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.110> times<00:01:10.380> these<00:01:10.860> microphones<00:01:11.280> well<00:01:11.610> in

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
lot of times these microphones well in

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.609 
lot of times these microphones well in
every<00:01:12.180> instance<00:01:12.510> they<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.810> polar<00:01:13.110> pattern

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
every instance they have a polar pattern

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.230 
every instance they have a polar pattern
and<00:01:13.890> if<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.400> don't<00:01:14.580> know<00:01:14.700> what<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:14.880> polar

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
and if you don't know what that polar

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.210 
and if you don't know what that polar
pattern<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.290> very<00:01:16.619> likely<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.040> you

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
pattern is it is very likely that you

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.859 
pattern is it is very likely that you
are<00:01:17.280> going<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.640> placing<00:01:18.060> your<00:01:18.150> monitors<00:01:18.689> in

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
are going to be placing your monitors in

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.140 
are going to be placing your monitors in
the<00:01:18.900> wrong<00:01:19.200> spot<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.340> be<00:01:20.460> from<00:01:20.640> vocals

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the wrong spot this can be from vocals

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.210 
the wrong spot this can be from vocals
or<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.869> could<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.140> from<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.350> drum<00:01:22.619> perspective

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
or this could be from a drum perspective

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.399 
or this could be from a drum perspective
let's<00:01:23.520> say<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> condenser<00:01:24.990> pointed

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
let's say I have a condenser pointed

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.140 
let's say I have a condenser pointed
down<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.770> my<00:01:25.890> hi-hat<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.640> then<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
down on my hi-hat and then I have the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.749 
down on my hi-hat and then I have the
drum<00:01:27.450> fill<00:01:27.720> sitting<00:01:28.170> right<00:01:28.320> there<00:01:28.670> for<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
drum fill sitting right there for the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.789 
drum fill sitting right there for the
drummer<00:01:30.090> I'm<00:01:30.360> blowing<00:01:30.869> audio<00:01:31.229> right<00:01:31.590> back

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
drummer I'm blowing audio right back

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.050 
drummer I'm blowing audio right back
into<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.220> microphone<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.540> mic<00:01:35.060> placement

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
into that microphone so mic placement

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.510 
into that microphone so mic placement
and<00:01:36.570> selection<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.320> very<00:01:37.530> important<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.280> this

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
and selection is very important in this

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.880 
and selection is very important in this
category<00:01:39.420> where<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.840> know<00:01:39.960> choose<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> right

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
category where you know choose the right

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.380 
category where you know choose the right
mic<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.340> nowhere<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.670> put<00:01:41.759> your<00:01:41.880> monitors

two<00:01:58.500> things<00:01:58.530> are<00:01:58.950> going<00:01:59.189> on<00:01:59.369> there<00:01:59.399> first<00:02:00.000> of

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
two things are going on there first of

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.550 
two things are going on there first of
all<00:02:00.240> microphones<00:02:00.719> are<00:02:00.899> made<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.170> sing<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
all microphones are made to sing in the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.069 
all microphones are made to sing in the
front<00:02:01.860> or<00:02:02.040> what<00:02:02.159> they<00:02:02.280> call<00:02:02.430> on<00:02:02.700> axis<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
front or what they call on axis so the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.600 
front or what they call on axis so the
audio<00:02:04.380> should<00:02:04.439> be<00:02:04.590> coming<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.009> from<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.310> front

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
audio should be coming in from the front

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.590 
audio should be coming in from the front
when<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.759> have<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.030> hanging<00:02:06.450> over

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
when you have that hanging over

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.419 
when you have that hanging over
obviously<00:02:06.930> you're<00:02:07.649> picking<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.069> up<00:02:08.160> on<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
obviously you're picking it up on the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.339 
obviously you're picking it up on the
side<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.000> microphone<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.810> your

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
side of the microphone so your

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.680 
side of the microphone so your
attenuating<00:02:11.099> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
attenuating the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.660 
attenuating the
and<00:02:13.080> you're<00:02:13.440> just<00:02:13.590> gonna<00:02:13.680> have<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:13.950> ride<00:02:14.430> your

and you're just gonna have to ride your
faders<00:02:15.150> more<00:02:15.450> that's<00:02:16.020> number<00:02:16.260> one<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.100> you're

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
faders more that's number one so you're

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.520 
faders more that's number one so you're
not<00:02:17.340> optimizing<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.060> mic<00:02:18.210> number<00:02:18.660> two<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.140> off

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
not optimizing the mic number two is off

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.610 
not optimizing the mic number two is off
axis<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.760> mic<00:02:20.910> sounds<00:02:21.600> very<00:02:21.960> different<00:02:22.500> it's

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
axis the mic sounds very different it's

placement of microphone actually will

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.550

omnidirectional

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.390 
omnidirectional
and<00:05:55.900> I've<00:05:56.230> also<00:05:56.380> made<00:05:56.650> it<00:05:56.740> some<00:05:56.920> thin<00:05:57.220> and

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
and I've also made it some thin and

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.980 
and I've also made it some thin and
hollow<00:05:57.610> and<00:05:57.850> the<00:05:57.940> reality<00:05:58.390> I<00:05:58.420> know<00:05:58.570> it<00:05:58.750> looks

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
hollow and the reality I know it looks

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.750 
hollow and the reality I know it looks
cool<00:05:59.290> but<00:05:59.860> at<00:05:59.980> the<00:06:00.070> end<00:06:00.100> of<00:06:00.340> the<00:06:00.400> day<00:06:00.520> don't

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
cool but at the end of the day don't

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.400 
cool but at the end of the day don't
want<00:06:00.910> your<00:06:01.060> voice<00:06:01.210> to<00:06:01.270> come<00:06:01.630> through<00:06:01.960> right
