when i was playing how effortless some

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.970 
when i was playing how effortless some
of<00:00:31.180> the<00:00:31.270> the<00:00:31.960> riffs<00:00:32.230> that<00:00:32.349> i<00:00:32.500> was<00:00:32.680> doing<00:00:32.920> the

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
of the the riffs that i was doing the

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.280 
of the the riffs that i was doing the
faster<00:00:33.400> it's<00:00:33.520> that<00:00:33.640> i<00:00:33.699> doing<00:00:34.000> work<00:00:34.239> were<00:00:34.809> and<00:00:35.140> i

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
faster it's that i doing work were and i

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.049 
faster it's that i doing work were and i
was<00:00:35.440> trying<00:00:35.739> to<00:00:35.800> figure<00:00:35.890> out<00:00:36.070> why<00:00:36.460> that<00:00:36.760> was

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
was trying to figure out why that was

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.450 
was trying to figure out why that was
and<00:00:37.390> I'd<00:00:38.110> noticed<00:00:38.590> that<00:00:38.800> I<00:00:38.830> was<00:00:38.920> using<00:00:39.220> my

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
and I'd noticed that I was using my

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.400 
and I'd noticed that I was using my
wrist<00:00:39.730> for<00:00:40.000> some<00:00:40.180> reason<00:00:40.600> and<00:00:40.750> I<00:00:41.019> had<00:00:41.140> always

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
wrist for some reason and I had always

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.620 
wrist for some reason and I had always
been<00:00:41.680> an<00:00:41.980> arm<00:00:42.160> picker<00:00:42.399> so<00:00:42.760> I<00:00:43.030> started

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
been an arm picker so I started

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.330 
been an arm picker so I started
investigating<00:00:44.320> that<00:00:44.559> and<00:00:44.770> I<00:00:44.860> noticed<00:00:45.250> that

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
investigating that and I noticed that

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.819 
investigating that and I noticed that
when<00:00:45.640> i<00:00:45.670> picked<00:00:46.000> from<00:00:46.180> my<00:00:46.360> wrist<00:00:46.690> that's<00:00:47.380> a<00:00:47.649> lot

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
when i picked from my wrist that's a lot

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.370 
when i picked from my wrist that's a lot
like<00:00:48.130> i<00:00:48.280> right<00:00:48.640> so<00:00:49.059> I<00:00:49.090> started<00:00:49.809> looking<00:00:49.870> at<00:00:50.230> how

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
like i right so I started looking at how

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.670 
like i right so I started looking at how
I<00:00:50.410> write<00:00:50.980> on<00:00:51.280> a<00:00:51.340> piece<00:00:51.489> of<00:00:51.670> paper<00:00:51.820> and<00:00:52.680> started

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
I write on a piece of paper and started

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.180 
I write on a piece of paper and started
mimicking<00:00:54.129> that<00:00:54.370> on<00:00:54.640> the<00:00:54.790> guitar<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:56.680> me<00:00:56.890> the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
mimicking that on the guitar for me the

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.940 
mimicking that on the guitar for me the
reason<00:00:57.370> of<00:00:57.640> doing<00:00:58.510> that<00:00:58.629> is<00:00:58.690> because<00:00:59.020> with

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
reason of doing that is because with

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.490 
reason of doing that is because with
your<00:01:00.129> arm<00:01:00.370> they're<00:01:00.640> moving<00:01:00.910> so<00:01:01.149> much<00:01:01.180> mass<00:01:01.750> to

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
your arm they're moving so much mass to

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.619 
your arm they're moving so much mass to
go<00:01:02.710> such<00:01:03.129> a<00:01:03.160> short<00:01:03.520> distance<00:01:03.850> you<00:01:04.300> actually

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
go such a short distance you actually

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.320 
go such a short distance you actually
have<00:01:04.780> to<00:01:04.960> I'm<00:01:05.199> sure<00:01:05.440> stop<00:01:05.830> that<00:01:06.190> mass<00:01:06.460> on<00:01:07.119> the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
have to I'm sure stop that mass on the

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.260 
have to I'm sure stop that mass on the
other<00:01:07.570> side<00:01:07.869> so<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:09.430> I<00:01:09.580> could<00:01:09.789> tell<00:01:10.000> I<00:01:10.060> was

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
other side so and I could tell I was

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.029 
other side so and I could tell I was
putting<00:01:10.660> way<00:01:10.869> too<00:01:10.930> much<00:01:11.110> effort<00:01:11.440> into<00:01:11.740> what<00:01:11.860> I

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
putting way too much effort into what I

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.070 
putting way too much effort into what I
was<00:01:12.220> trying<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.610> play<00:01:12.880> you<00:01:13.180> know<00:01:13.210> so<00:01:13.750> that's

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
was trying to play you know so that's

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.960 
was trying to play you know so that's
why<00:01:14.410> switched<00:01:14.920> and<00:01:15.130> I<00:01:15.220> definitely<00:01:15.670> believe

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
why switched and I definitely believe

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.059 
why switched and I definitely believe
it's<00:01:16.300> it's<00:01:16.569> a<00:01:16.869> better<00:01:17.200> way<00:01:17.410> to<00:01:17.470> go<00:01:17.649> even<00:01:17.860> though

00:01:18.059 --> 00:01:18.069 
it's it's a better way to go even though

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:21.389 
it's it's a better way to go even though
i<00:01:18.280> have<00:01:18.729> had<00:01:18.910> some<00:01:19.209> students<00:01:19.750> where<00:01:20.470> you<00:01:21.280> know

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
i have had some students where you know

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:22.980 
i have had some students where you know
maybe<00:01:21.640> it's<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:22.000> mechanism<00:01:22.539> in<00:01:22.630> their<00:01:22.780> hand

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
maybe it's the mechanism in their hand

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.499 
maybe it's the mechanism in their hand
you<00:01:23.170> know<00:01:23.289> they're<00:01:23.500> just<00:01:23.709> more<00:01:23.950> apt<00:01:24.429> to<00:01:24.640> prefer

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
you know they're just more apt to prefer

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.279 
you know they're just more apt to prefer
arm<00:01:25.990> picking<00:01:26.530> so<00:01:26.860> well<00:01:27.729> i<00:01:27.759> would<00:01:28.030> say<00:01:28.289> anything

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
arm picking so well i would say anything

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.719 
arm picking so well i would say anything
that<00:01:29.440> you<00:01:29.530> see<00:01:29.709> your<00:01:29.860> left<00:01:30.069> hand<00:01:30.280> doing<00:01:30.459> you

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
that you see your left hand doing you

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.760 
that you see your left hand doing you
mimic<00:01:31.240> on<00:01:31.390> your<00:01:31.569> right<00:01:31.720> hand<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:32.470> one<00:01:32.649> thing

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
I've noticed is if i'll try and execute

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.100 
I've noticed is if i'll try and execute

very<00:02:12.200> beneficial<00:02:12.470> in<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.130> development<00:02:13.610> of

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
very beneficial in the development of

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.360 
very beneficial in the development of
the<00:02:13.760> right<00:02:13.940> hand<00:02:14.210> I<00:02:14.860> recommend<00:02:15.860> starting<00:02:16.190> with

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
the right hand I recommend starting with

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.580 
the right hand I recommend starting with
pentatonic<00:02:17.180> scales<00:02:17.540> because<00:02:18.080> they're<00:02:18.380> so

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
pentatonic scales because they're so

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.740 
pentatonic scales because they're so
you've<00:02:19.070> got<00:02:19.100> such<00:02:19.460> a<00:02:19.490> nice<00:02:19.730> distance<00:02:20.330> between

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
you've got such a nice distance between

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.860 
you've got such a nice distance between
each<00:02:21.020> note<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:22.280> it's<00:02:22.730> not<00:02:22.940> too<00:02:23.120> complex<00:02:23.570> in

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
each note that it's not too complex in

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.100 
each note that it's not too complex in
the<00:02:23.900> beginning<00:02:24.080> for<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.680> right<00:02:24.860> hand
