Hi everyone, Tiffany Bliss, here.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.270
Today I'm going to show you how to make Princess
Aurora's dress from Sleeping Beauty for your

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.309
My Little Pony.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:22.980
First We'll use bright pink play-doh for the
top of the dress.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:31.100
Next we'll make a long snake of white play-doh
and outline the top.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.800
For the bottom of the dress we'll use a lighter
shade of pink and form it to the tail section

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:48.380
of the pony.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.470
Aurora's dress has triangle shapes around
the waist so we'll cut them out and wrap them

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:04.690
around the pony.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.770
Sleeping Beauty's hair is soft yellow so we'll
make lots of snake shapes of hair and place

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:25.650
them on the pony.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:43.130
We can also gently curl the ends.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:53.729
Now we'll top it off with a golden crown and
three pink jewels.

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.729
And that's it.

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:07.170
Now you have a beautiful sleeping beauty costume
for your my 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.450
little pony.
