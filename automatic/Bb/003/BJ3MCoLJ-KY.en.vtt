like this for example is they that I'm

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.380 
like this for example is they that I'm
basically<00:02:11.009> clipping<00:02:11.760> them<00:02:11.910> that's<00:02:12.120> what<00:02:12.209> ex

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
basically clipping them that's what ex

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.370 
basically clipping them that's what ex
Cal<00:02:12.599> calls<00:02:12.870> clipping

where<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.770> basically<00:02:13.980> look<00:02:14.400> over<00:02:14.670> son<00:02:15.500> sounds

was<00:02:20.280> high<00:02:20.490> quality<00:02:20.520> back<00:02:21.210> in<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.450> day<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:22.230> is

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
was high quality back in the day that is

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.770 
was high quality back in the day that is
all<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.830> needed<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.250> do<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.520> succeed<00:02:23.820> but<00:02:24.690> the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
all you needed to do to succeed but the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.170 
all you needed to do to succeed but the
fact<00:02:24.990> is<00:02:25.170> if<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.500> stayed<00:02:25.830> there<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.820> would<00:02:27.060> be

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
fact is if you stayed there you would be

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.420 
fact is if you stayed there you would be
considered<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.780> bad<00:02:28.050> person<00:02:28.740> or<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.890> bad<00:02:29.070> player

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
considered a bad person or a bad player

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.390 
considered a bad person or a bad player
or<00:02:29.580> bad<00:02:29.760> at<00:02:29.940> YouTube<00:02:30.420> here<00:02:31.320> is<00:02:31.530> what<00:02:31.980> my<00:02:32.070> videos

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
or bad at YouTube here is what my videos

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.250 
or bad at YouTube here is what my videos
looks<00:02:32.580> like<00:02:32.730> today<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.750> video<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.110> put

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
looks like today this is a video I put

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.940 
looks like today this is a video I put
out<00:02:34.590> at<00:02:34.800> two<00:02:35.220> o'clock<00:02:35.520> in<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.880> morning<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.950> it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
out at two o'clock in the morning and it

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.320 
out at two o'clock in the morning and it
basically<00:02:39.590> at<00:02:40.590> right<00:02:41.220> now<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.370> had<00:02:41.580> 16,000<00:02:42.270> we

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
basically at right now I had 16,000 we

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.210 
basically at right now I had 16,000 we
was<00:02:42.480> probably<00:02:42.720> end<00:02:43.290> up<00:02:43.320> dumping<00:02:43.500> on<00:02:43.830> 22

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
was probably end up dumping on 22

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.460 
was probably end up dumping on 22

sixty-eight thousand views and this was
a<00:02:52.590> video<00:02:52.710> I<00:02:52.890> put<00:02:53.040> up<00:02:53.190> at<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.490> very<00:02:53.850> late<00:02:54.240> night

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
a video I put up at the very late night

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.510 
a video I put up at the very late night
this<00:02:54.660> is<00:02:54.840> my<00:02:55.050> you<00:02:55.680> know<00:02:55.800> this<00:02:56.070> is<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.250> video<00:02:56.460> I

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
this is my you know this is the video I

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.490 
this is my you know this is the video I
don't<00:02:56.820> care<00:02:57.060> about<00:02:57.150> during<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.630> day<00:02:57.810> listen

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
don't care about during the day listen

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.430 
don't care about during the day listen
to<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.770> difference<00:02:59.160> here<00:03:00.440> speed

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
to the difference here speed

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.820 
to the difference here speed
transmission<00:03:01.950> gonna<00:03:02.100> be<00:03:02.160> really<00:03:02.460> smooth<00:03:02.730> but

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
transmission gonna be really smooth but

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.490 
transmission gonna be really smooth but
how<00:03:04.830> smooth<00:03:05.220> is<00:03:05.430> an<00:03:05.550> 8<00:03:05.670> speed<00:03:06.050> vs.<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.080> 6<00:03:07.410> speed

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
how smooth is an 8 speed vs. a 6 speed

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.070 
how smooth is an 8 speed vs. a 6 speed
and<00:03:07.860> how<00:03:08.490> many<00:03:08.700> gears<00:03:08.970> is<00:03:09.180> too<00:03:09.450> many<00:03:09.630> gears<00:03:09.900> I

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
and how many gears is too many gears I

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.560 
and how many gears is too many gears I
mean<00:03:10.320> are<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:10.560> gonna<00:03:10.800> sit<00:03:11.070> there<00:03:11.100> constantly

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
mean are you gonna sit there constantly

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.900 
mean are you gonna sit there constantly
like<00:03:12.570> for<00:03:12.990> example<00:03:13.080> I'm<00:03:13.380> thinking<00:03:13.440> about

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
like for example I'm thinking about

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.130 
like for example I'm thinking about
mountains<00:03:14.910> or<00:03:15.540> Hills

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
mountains or Hills

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.680 
mountains or Hills
or<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.590> know<00:03:16.710> roads<00:03:16.980> are<00:03:17.160> really<00:03:17.430> hilly<00:03:17.690> you

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
or you know roads are really hilly you

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.930 
or you know roads are really hilly you
percent<00:03:19.020> that<00:03:19.110> they<00:03:19.230> in<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.350> cruise<00:03:19.560> control

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
percent that they in the cruise control

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.730 
percent that they in the cruise control
how<00:03:20.940> much<00:03:21.120> is<00:03:21.360> it<00:03:21.480> gonna<00:03:21.570> take<00:03:21.840> for<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.110> at

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
how much is it gonna take for that at

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.410 
how much is it gonna take for that at
that<00:03:23.010> 8-speed<00:03:23.520> transmission<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:24.090> find<00:03:24.300> that

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
that 8-speed transmission to find that

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.210 
that 8-speed transmission to find that
money<00:03:24.600> gear<00:03:24.920> where's<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.010> gonna<00:03:26.100> be

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
money gear where's it gonna be

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.830 
money gear where's it gonna be
constantly<00:03:26.580> switching<00:03:26.820> gears<00:03:27.090> jumping<00:03:27.450> rpms

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
constantly switching gears jumping rpms

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.120 
constantly switching gears jumping rpms
back<00:03:28.050> and<00:03:28.230> forth<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.620> that<00:03:28.650> gonna<00:03:28.920> cause

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
back and forth is that gonna cause

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.790 
back and forth is that gonna cause
longevity<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:30.840> pretty<00:03:31.260> much<00:03:31.380> question

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
longevity and I pretty much question

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.950 
longevity and I pretty much question
Chrysler's<00:03:32.340> you<00:03:32.490> know<00:03:32.690> engineering<00:03:33.690> at<00:03:33.810> this

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
Chrysler's you know engineering at this

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.750
