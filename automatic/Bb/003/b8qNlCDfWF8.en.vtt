00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.299 

if<00:00:48.600> they<00:00:48.809> don't<00:00:48.930> get<00:00:49.140> enough<00:00:49.260> sunlight<00:00:49.710> I'm

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
if they don't get enough sunlight I'm

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.799 
if they don't get enough sunlight I'm
going<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.670> need<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.969> provide<00:00:51.300> them<00:00:51.539> with<00:00:51.570> an

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
artificial Sun like a grow light or a

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.779 
artificial Sun like a grow light or a
fluorescent<00:00:56.039> tube<00:00:56.430> light<00:00:56.699> kind<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.239> thing<00:00:57.559> now

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
fluorescent tube light kind of thing now

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.920 
fluorescent tube light kind of thing now
also<00:00:59.789> keep<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.090> mind<00:01:00.149> when<00:01:00.420> you're<00:01:00.510> doing<00:01:00.750> that

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
also keep in mind when you're doing that

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.310 
also keep in mind when you're doing that
that<00:01:01.379> because<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.520> fire<00:01:02.730> hazard<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.870> also

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
that because it's a fire hazard and also

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.929 
that because it's a fire hazard and also
your<00:01:04.650> neighbors<00:01:05.070> might<00:01:05.280> think<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.729> you're

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
your neighbors might think that you're

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.560 
your neighbors might think that you're
growing<00:01:06.750> some<00:01:07.020> kind<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.320> dodgy<00:01:07.560> plants<00:01:08.570> which

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
growing some kind of dodgy plants which

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.140 
growing some kind of dodgy plants which
can't<00:01:09.960> be<00:01:10.020> good<00:01:10.369> what<00:01:11.369> sort<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.640> climate<00:01:12.030> do

can't be good what sort of climate do

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.120 
can't be good what sort of climate do
they<00:01:12.299> need<00:01:12.450> there<00:01:12.900> are<00:01:13.020> two<00:01:13.170> types<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.740> goji

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
they need there are two types of goji

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.700 
they need there are two types of goji
berry<00:01:14.430> plants<00:01:14.790> as<00:01:14.909> far<00:01:15.119> as<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.330> know<00:01:15.680> there<00:01:16.680> is

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
berry plants as far as I know there is

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.080 
berry plants as far as I know there is
the<00:01:17.130> European<00:01:17.820> varieties<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.770> there<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
the European varieties and there is the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.469 
the European varieties and there is the
Chinese<00:01:21.090> variety<00:01:21.689> now<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:23.369> Chinese<00:01:24.030> variety

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
Chinese variety now the Chinese variety

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.980 
Chinese variety now the Chinese variety
grows<00:01:24.990> smaller<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.729> European<00:01:27.180> variety<00:01:27.750> grows

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
grows smaller the European variety grows

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.240 
grows smaller the European variety grows
taller<00:01:28.909> if<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.420> live<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.320> climate<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
taller if you live in a climate like the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.190 
taller if you live in a climate like the
UK<00:01:32.720> Europe<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.310> most<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.840> United<00:01:37.170> States

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
UK Europe and most of the United States

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.469 
UK Europe and most of the United States
and<00:01:37.710> Canada<00:01:37.890> then<00:01:38.729> you're<00:01:38.880> probably<00:01:39.030> going<00:01:39.420> to

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
and Canada then you're probably going to

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.560 
and Canada then you're probably going to
want<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.720> try<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.140> grow<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:41.570> European

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
want to try and grow the European

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.090 
want to try and grow the European
variety<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:43.290> if<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.649> grow<00:01:43.920> in

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
variety but if you grow in

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.969 
variety but if you grow in
a<00:01:46.330> climate<00:01:47.330> which<00:01:47.479> is<00:01:47.720> always<00:01:47.990> warmer<00:01:48.619> say

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
a climate which is always warmer say

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.399 
a climate which is always warmer say
perhaps<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.580> southern<00:01:49.970> United<00:01:50.390> States<00:01:50.720> or

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
perhaps the southern United States or

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.330 
perhaps the southern United States or
Mexico<00:01:52.009> that<00:01:52.759> kind<00:01:53.030> of<00:01:53.060> area<00:01:53.540> Florida

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
Mexico that kind of area Florida

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.370 
Mexico that kind of area Florida
etcetera<00:01:55.340> etcetera<00:01:55.450> then<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:56.600> might<00:01:57.140> want<00:01:57.320> to

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
etcetera etcetera then you might want to

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.950 
etcetera etcetera then you might want to
go<00:01:57.500> with<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.610> Chinese<00:01:59.030> variety<00:01:59.540> just<00:01:59.720> try

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
go with the the Chinese variety just try

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.609 
go with the the Chinese variety just try
it<00:01:59.990> out<00:02:00.820> what<00:02:01.820> should<00:02:02.149> sorry<00:02:03.049> how<00:02:03.259> much<00:02:03.440> should

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
it out what should sorry how much should

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.469 
it out what should sorry how much should
1e<00:02:04.009> to<00:02:04.220> create<00:02:04.520> any<00:02:04.670> kind<00:02:04.850> of<00:02:04.970> beneficial

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
1e to create any kind of beneficial

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.650 
1e to create any kind of beneficial
effect<00:02:05.780> that's<00:02:06.140> a<00:02:06.289> very<00:02:06.320> hard<00:02:06.799> question<00:02:07.660> one

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
effect that's a very hard question one

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.830 
effect that's a very hard question one
which<00:02:08.929> I<00:02:09.429> can<00:02:10.429> only<00:02:10.550> answer<00:02:10.880> through<00:02:12.730> perhaps

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
which I can only answer through perhaps

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.100 
which I can only answer through perhaps

beta-carotene in carrots they also

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.809 
beta-carotene in carrots they also
contain<00:02:36.920> 26<00:02:37.730> grams<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.690> believe<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.519> vitamin<00:02:40.519> C

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
contain 26 grams I believe of vitamin C

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.780 
contain 26 grams I believe of vitamin C
per<00:02:41.480> 100<00:02:42.140> grams<00:02:42.500> of<00:02:43.390> goji<00:02:44.390> berries<00:02:44.900> not<00:02:45.790> very

per 100 grams of goji berries not very

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.670 
per 100 grams of goji berries not very
very<00:02:47.090> high<00:02:47.299> so<00:02:47.540> they<00:02:47.690> are<00:02:47.900> considered<00:02:48.560> a

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
very high so they are considered a

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.850 
very high so they are considered a
superfood<00:02:49.160> I<00:02:49.700> guess<00:02:49.880> they<00:02:50.810> also<00:02:50.989> apparently

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860
