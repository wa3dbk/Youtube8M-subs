00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.650 
painstakingly put the Angele graphics
here<00:03:44.519> if<00:03:44.640> you<00:03:44.760> look<00:03:44.910> down<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.239> side<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.510> the

here if you look down the side of the
boat<00:03:45.840> here<00:03:46.079> you'll<00:03:46.590> see<00:03:46.739> everything<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:47.130> nice

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
boat here you'll see everything is nice

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.150 
boat here you'll see everything is nice
and<00:03:47.370> straight<00:03:47.820> smooth<00:03:48.239> and<00:03:48.510> clean<00:03:49.079> no<00:03:49.829> bleed

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.080 

we<00:03:55.319> also<00:03:55.530> have<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.010> Pacific<00:03:56.580> insight

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
we also have the Pacific insight

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.449 
we also have the Pacific insight
engineered<00:03:57.750> wiring<00:03:58.170> harness<00:03:58.500> where<00:03:59.160> every

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
engineered wiring harness where every

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.520 
engineered wiring harness where every
wire<00:03:59.670> on<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.270> wiring<00:04:00.959> harness<00:04:01.349> is

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
wire on the wiring harness is

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.380 
wire on the wiring harness is
individually<00:04:02.160> labeled<00:04:02.370> every<00:04:02.790> five<00:04:03.000> inches

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
individually labeled every five inches

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.350 
individually labeled every five inches
so<00:04:04.080> for<00:04:04.590> example<00:04:05.040> if<00:04:05.130> it<00:04:05.280> is<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.520> horn<00:04:05.790> it

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
so for example if it is the horn it

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.910 
so for example if it is the horn it
would<00:04:06.540> say<00:04:06.720> horn<00:04:07.020> from<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.380> horn<00:04:07.620> switch

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
would say horn from the horn switch

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.740 
would say horn from the horn switch
right<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.489> horn<00:04:08.700> if<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.270> is<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.540> bilge

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
right to the horn if it is the bilge

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.240 
right to the horn if it is the bilge
pump<00:04:09.840> it<00:04:10.260> would<00:04:10.380> be<00:04:10.500> right<00:04:10.739> from<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.040> billed

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
pump it would be right from the billed

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.220 
pump it would be right from the billed
switch<00:04:11.519> right<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:11.940> bilge<00:04:12.120> pump<00:04:12.239> labeled

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
switch right to the bilge pump labeled

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.949 
switch right to the bilge pump labeled
bilge<00:04:13.470> nav<00:04:14.010> anchor<00:04:14.370> light<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.420> on<00:04:15.630> all<00:04:15.840> the

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
bilge nav anchor light and so on all the

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.990 
bilge nav anchor light and so on all the
way<00:04:16.079> through<00:04:16.290> it<00:04:16.410> this<00:04:17.010> eliminates<00:04:17.579> a<00:04:17.730> great

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
way through it this eliminates a great

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.030 
way through it this eliminates a great
deal<00:04:18.180> of<00:04:18.329> warranty<00:04:18.720> claims<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.260> makes<00:04:19.889> it

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
deal of warranty claims and makes it

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.710 
deal of warranty claims and makes it
very<00:04:20.070> simple<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.790> not<00:04:21.120> having<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.510> need<00:04:21.690> for

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
very simple and not having the need for

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.080 
very simple and not having the need for
$100<00:04:22.350> an<00:04:22.500> hour<00:04:22.620> technician<00:04:23.250> up<00:04:23.400> with<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.910> helm
