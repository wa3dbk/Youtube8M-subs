upside down or sideways in these

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.050 
upside down or sideways in these
segments<00:01:32.990> pretty<00:01:33.290> sweet<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:34.550> camera<00:01:34.880> doesn't

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
segments pretty sweet the camera doesn't

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.730 
segments pretty sweet the camera doesn't
flip<00:01:35.420> though<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.660> apparently<00:01:36.350> did<00:01:36.620> the

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
flip though it apparently did the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.050 
flip though it apparently did the
developers<00:01:37.160> mess<00:01:37.400> with<00:01:37.550> that<00:01:37.670> for<00:01:37.880> a<00:01:37.940> while

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
developers mess with that for a while

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.610 
developers mess with that for a while
but<00:01:38.300> decided<00:01:38.660> that<00:01:38.780> it<00:01:38.990> was<00:01:39.110> too<00:01:39.260> disorienting

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
but decided that it was too disorienting

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.860 
but decided that it was too disorienting
when<00:01:40.430> you<00:01:40.490> do<00:01:40.610> bump<00:01:40.910> into<00:01:41.120> people<00:01:41.150> or<00:01:41.750> stuff

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
when you do bump into people or stuff

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.600 
when you do bump into people or stuff
that<00:01:42.110> is<00:01:42.350> glowing<00:01:42.530> blue<00:01:42.920> you<00:01:43.310> get<00:01:43.460> a<00:01:43.490> nice

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
that is glowing blue you get a nice

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.710 
that is glowing blue you get a nice
boost<00:01:43.910> so<00:01:44.090> it's<00:01:44.210> really<00:01:44.360> good<00:01:44.570> for

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
boost so it's really good for

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.540 
boost so it's really good for
competitive<00:01:45.230> racing<00:01:45.560> but<00:01:46.130> also<00:01:46.250> for
