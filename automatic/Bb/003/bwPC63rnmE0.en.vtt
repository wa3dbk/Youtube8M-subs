00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
home get a shaker cup fill it with some

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.420 
home get a shaker cup fill it with some
water<00:00:31.619> first<00:00:32.619> thing<00:00:32.800> I<00:00:32.860> recommend<00:00:33.010> is<00:00:33.370> that

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
water first thing I recommend is that

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.330 
water first thing I recommend is that
the<00:00:33.640> branched-chain<00:00:33.970> amino<00:00:34.030> acids<00:00:34.870> in<00:00:35.350> bcas

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
the branched-chain amino acids in bcas

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.100 
the branched-chain amino acids in bcas
are<00:00:36.670> there<00:00:36.940> the<00:00:37.090> time<00:00:37.270> the<00:00:37.420> trigger<00:00:37.720> to<00:00:37.840> turn

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
are there the time the trigger to turn

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.260 
are there the time the trigger to turn
on<00:00:38.290> building<00:00:38.770> muscle<00:00:39.070> and<00:00:39.129> burning<00:00:39.460> fat<00:00:39.670> so

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
on building muscle and burning fat so

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.700 
on building muscle and burning fat so
you<00:00:40.330> have<00:00:40.570> to<00:00:40.690> have<00:00:40.840> them<00:00:41.020> immediately<00:00:41.440> so<00:00:41.680> I

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
you have to have them immediately so I

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.950 
you have to have them immediately so I
usually<00:00:42.070> recommend<00:00:42.190> about<00:00:42.550> 10<00:00:42.760> grams<00:00:43.030> to<00:00:43.629> 15

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
usually recommend about 10 grams to 15

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.380 
usually recommend about 10 grams to 15
grams<00:00:44.260> of<00:00:44.350> bcaas<00:00:44.890> in<00:00:45.100> power<00:00:45.640> forms<00:00:46.059> because<00:00:46.210> it

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
grams of bcaas in power forms because it

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.490 
grams of bcaas in power forms because it
gets<00:00:46.510> through<00:00:46.690> your<00:00:46.809> body<00:00:46.930> a<00:00:47.050> little<00:00:47.080> quicker

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
gets through your body a little quicker

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
then on top of that for some more bcaa's

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.329 
then on top of that for some more bcaa's
and<00:00:50.080> other<00:00:50.170> essential<00:00:50.589> proteins<00:00:50.949> I<00:00:51.070> go<00:00:51.190> with<00:00:51.309> a

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
and other essential proteins I go with a

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:53.520 
and other essential proteins I go with a
whey<00:00:51.489> protein<00:00:51.940> powder<00:00:52.080> right<00:00:53.080> what<00:00:53.290> that<00:00:53.440> whey

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
whey protein powder right what that whey

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.930 
whey protein powder right what that whey
protein<00:00:53.920> powder<00:00:53.949> will<00:00:54.309> do<00:00:54.430> is<00:00:54.550> it<00:00:54.640> will<00:00:54.670> stop

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
protein powder will do is it will stop

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.090 
protein powder will do is it will stop
and<00:00:55.089> take<00:00:55.300> a<00:00:55.330> muscle<00:00:55.540> breakdown<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.949> may

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
and take a muscle breakdown that may

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.469 
and take a muscle breakdown that may
happen<00:00:57.370> from<00:00:57.610> your<00:00:57.729> training<00:00:58.030> session<00:00:58.300> help

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479 
happen from your training session help

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.270 
happen from your training session help
you<00:00:58.600> build<00:00:58.809> back<00:00:58.989> up<00:00:59.019> so<00:00:59.739> we<00:00:59.860> know<00:01:00.070> we<00:01:00.250> are

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
you build back up so we know we are

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.860 
you build back up so we know we are
setting<00:01:00.729> those<00:01:00.879> signals<00:01:01.210> to<00:01:01.299> the<00:01:01.360> muscle<00:01:01.720> tell

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
setting those signals to the muscle tell

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.479 
setting those signals to the muscle tell
them<00:01:01.989> what's<00:01:02.170> to<00:01:02.260> the<00:01:02.350> ground<00:01:02.589> the<00:01:03.129> last<00:01:03.370> thing

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
them what's to the ground the last thing

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.789 
them what's to the ground the last thing
I<00:01:03.610> do<00:01:03.670> is<00:01:04.269> I<00:01:04.420> add<00:01:04.570> a<00:01:04.600> carbohydrate<00:01:05.379> affection
