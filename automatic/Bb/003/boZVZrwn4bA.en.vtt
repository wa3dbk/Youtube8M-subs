00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:09.800
 Tigger LED bulb lea well product h 4 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:12.510
 I will explain that this item is superior to hid valves 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:18.180
 First German house to be a simple 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:23.460
 hid valves must be wired directly from the battery depending on the vehicle type 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.420
 If it is a car with patties at the rear of the vehicle body, long wires must be prepared to the front lights 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.690
 not 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:33.770
 This led bar can be easily installed with the same coupler as a normal valve 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:41.090
 It is a normal valve that is reflected in the lower right 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:48.180
 The next lighting speed is different. If the hid valve is turned on from the off state , it will be about 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:53.250
 It takes a long time to throw it for about one second , but in the case of this LED bulb, it falls over in a moment 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:01:00.040
 This difference would come to greatly influence Even though only use a few-year-old for a moment the high beam 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:03.079
 This product is also very good compared to the LED bulb made in China next 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:07.100
 First made in Japan 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:12.229
 And here it comes with a warranty period of 2 years 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:15.370
 So much of the long-term warranty does not have a First to wing sale ed valve 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:21.730
 The last point is that it corresponds to sake 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.330
 In the case of a Chinese LED bulb, the direction of the light may be out of alignment or the light may reach a short distance. 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.890
 Yes 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:30.800
 There is thing which does not correspond to car inspection, but there is not the worry here 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:37.180
 Actually comparing red 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.180
 The right side is the piano h 4 The left side is the normal valve 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:51.630
 Continue to make a comparison towards the wall on the left piano h 4 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.630
 The right side is the normal valve
