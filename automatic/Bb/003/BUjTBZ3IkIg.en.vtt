 Shinguuji Sakura there 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:16.100
 Shinguuji Sakura and the main heroine of the soft Sakura match for Sega Saturn 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:20.600
 It is a character like Yamato Riko with a sense of complete extinction now . 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.110
 It is a character that has been hugely popular in the anime and the stage despite its huge popularity since that time 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.420
 The 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:30.060
 In the battle part of the game, it is an avant-garde character without complaints , so raise the reliability of this child 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:34.800
 It is certain that you will struggle with it 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:40.079
 Super Mario Bros. is the chance to buy a NES body once with Sakura match 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:44.270
 As if it was the type that had the opportunity to buy the pc engine itself 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:48.900
 It is a popular game that became one of the triggers for purchasing the SEGA Saturn main body 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.050
 It is released from SEGA in 1996 and pushed to the PlayStation of rivals 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.520
 Sega Saturn that was standing 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:58.570
 Because it was a kind of Gundam that gave a faint light 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.960
 By the way, I bought Sega Saturn when I saw ASCII Tech Saturn 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.960
 Used 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:09.830
 The sisters of Sega Saturn were up to the end of the century, but my sister Asakura match was later in series 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.880
 Have been ported to various hardware 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.330
 Influenced various gal games as a masterpiece of dramatic adventure game 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:21.090
 However, in many ways works beyond this one have not been released yet 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:26.369
 It's no game company that puts the budget into the game. 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:29.429
 I'm angry I'm in the adventure part of the adventure part of the girls to increase confidence in the battle 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:34.280
 It is ok if the enemy to Lynch at everyone in Part 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:38.869
 Girls with low credibility are weak and need attention 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:43.520
 Surely the price is 1000 yen It was released from Sega in 1996 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:46.790
 It might have been 97 years, but it was released by Bandai at the same time 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.570
 On the finished product figure was good can be in the same pose 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.649
 The character chosen is also the same as the plastic model 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.270
 It was 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:58.409
 The work is well done but it is 5 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.650
 And I think 1000 yen is a little bit cheaper if it is a garage kit 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.070
 Hey because injection kit 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:07.370
 It is the place where the preference is divided though the proportion is narrow 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:11.780
 It's the hard work is a drawback Nde material of guard of flex 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.980
 Really was as big a figure that is attached to the Toka master grade of Neganpura 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.170
 Because it feels like 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.270
 Nde Poisaizu to the trash do not pedestal Toka sled Naon also a small paint brush sentence is Yosage 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.640
 It is this series 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.240
 at that time 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.569
 I went into a lucky bag of plastic model and I did 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.319
 The next kit is this 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.319
