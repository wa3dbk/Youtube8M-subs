achieved<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.299> by<00:01:51.420> allowing<00:01:51.899> my<00:01:52.140> hips<00:01:52.470> to

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
achieved that by allowing my hips to

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.440 
achieved that by allowing my hips to
open<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.070> more<00:01:53.310> by<00:01:53.700> fixing<00:01:54.030> kind<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.329> that

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
open up more by fixing kind of that

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.179 
open up more by fixing kind of that
glute<00:01:54.750> meet<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.170> my<00:01:55.259> knees<00:01:55.320> are<00:01:55.740> open<00:01:56.040> which

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
glute meet so my knees are open which

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.190 
glute meet so my knees are open which
makes<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.549> easier<00:01:56.909> for<00:01:57.060> my<00:01:57.180> hips<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.659> sink<00:01:57.899> down

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
makes it easier for my hips to sink down

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.249 
makes it easier for my hips to sink down
wearing<00:01:59.189> wrist<00:01:59.490> wraps<00:01:59.729> it<00:02:00.299> does<00:02:00.630> help<00:02:00.930> right

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
wearing wrist wraps it does help right

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.870 
wearing wrist wraps it does help right
it<00:02:01.439> feels<00:02:01.590> more<00:02:01.829> comfortable<00:02:02.040> my<00:02:02.399> back<00:02:02.670> where

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
it feels more comfortable my back where

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.420 
it feels more comfortable my back where
my<00:02:02.969> elbows<00:02:03.210> then<00:02:03.750> are<00:02:03.899> lower<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.530> my<00:02:04.920> chest<00:02:05.310> is

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
my elbows then are lower so my chest is

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.429 
my elbows then are lower so my chest is
more<00:02:05.640> upright<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.390> then<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.840> could<00:02:07.049> sink

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
more upright and then I could sink

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.040 
more upright and then I could sink
straight<00:02:07.829> down<00:02:08.270> finally<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.450> third<00:02:09.750> biggest

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
straight down finally the third biggest

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.390 
straight down finally the third biggest
thing<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.470> got<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.709> make<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.860> video<00:02:11.069> on<00:02:11.190> all
