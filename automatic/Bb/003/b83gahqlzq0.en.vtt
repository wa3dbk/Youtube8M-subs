we've put two line clips on one silver
one<00:00:52.309> one<00:00:53.309> black<00:00:53.579> one<00:00:53.820> now<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> feature

one one black one now this is a feature

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.590 
one one black one now this is a feature
that<00:00:55.559> going<00:00:55.920> forward<00:00:56.250> will<00:00:57.030> be<00:00:57.059> putting<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.570> a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
that going forward will be putting on a

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.410 
that going forward will be putting on a
lot<00:00:57.809> more<00:00:58.050> feeder<00:00:58.379> type<00:00:58.680> reels<00:00:59.039> we<00:01:00.030> think<00:01:00.270> it's

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
lot more feeder type reels we think it's

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.029 
lot more feeder type reels we think it's
quite<00:01:00.629> important<00:01:01.260> especially<00:01:01.469> when<00:01:01.890> you're

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
quite important especially when you're

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.240 
quite important especially when you're
fishing<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.940> open<00:01:03.420> big<00:01:03.750> open<00:01:04.140> waters<00:01:04.559> it

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
fishing in open big open waters it

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.090 
fishing in open big open waters it
enables<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.330> fish<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.380> distances

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
enables you to fish it to distances

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.190 
enables you to fish it to distances
without<00:01:08.820> having<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.180> change<00:01:09.450> your<00:01:09.570> run<00:01:09.840> over

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
without having to change your run over

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.020 
without having to change your run over
and<00:01:10.409> I'll<00:01:10.530> explain<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.010> little<00:01:11.130> bit<00:01:11.460> about<00:01:11.760> that

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
and I'll explain a little bit about that

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.230 
and I'll explain a little bit about that
on<00:01:12.150> your<00:01:12.240> furthest<00:01:12.990> line<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.770> would<00:01:13.920> as

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
on your furthest line you would as

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.350 
on your furthest line you would as
normal<00:01:15.240> clip<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.930> your<00:01:16.049> clip<00:01:16.290> put<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.040> on

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
normal clip up to your clip put it on

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.630 
normal clip up to your clip put it on
then<00:01:18.360> as<00:01:18.689> you're<00:01:19.259> retrieving<00:01:19.770> back<00:01:19.979> wherever

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
then as you're retrieving back wherever

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.469 
then as you're retrieving back wherever
your<00:01:21.509> shorter<00:01:21.930> line<00:01:22.140> will<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:23.119> you<00:01:24.119> will<00:01:24.210> count

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
your shorter line will be you will count

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.380 
your shorter line will be you will count
back<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.930> turns<00:01:25.200> back<00:01:25.939> from<00:01:26.939> whatever<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.360> is

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
back the turns back from whatever it is

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.870 
back the turns back from whatever it is
if<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.990> did<00:01:28.170> hundred<00:01:28.590> turns<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.610> wanted

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
if you did hundred turns and you wanted

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.399 
if you did hundred turns and you wanted
to<00:01:29.909> fish<00:01:30.150> another<00:01:30.540> line<00:01:30.750> at<00:01:30.990> half<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
to fish another line at half the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.160 
to fish another line at half the
distance<00:01:31.770> there<00:01:32.070> 50<00:01:32.430> turns<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.540> count<00:01:33.840> 50

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
distance there 50 turns you count 50

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.710 
distance there 50 turns you count 50
turns<00:01:34.439> back<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.729> put<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> other<00:01:36.479> line

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
turns back you put it in the other line

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.890 
turns back you put it in the other line
clip<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.250> know<00:01:38.460> then<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.720> know<00:01:39.840> you

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
clip so that you know then you know you

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.929 
clip so that you know then you know you
quickly<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.799> want<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> bear<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.369> put<00:01:41.729> some

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
quickly you want a bear to put some

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.090 
quickly you want a bear to put some
feeder<00:01:42.210> falls<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.290> leave<00:01:43.470> your<00:01:43.619> peg<00:01:43.770> along

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
feeder falls in to leave your peg along

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.870 
feeder falls in to leave your peg along
you<00:01:44.610> cook<00:01:44.790> quickly<00:01:45.420> feed<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.930> shorter<00:01:46.380> line

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
you cook quickly feed you shorter line

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.410 
you cook quickly feed you shorter line
ready<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.060> go<00:01:48.210> out<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:49.439> take<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.979> off

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
ready to go out on it then take it off

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.639 
ready to go out on it then take it off
it's<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.600> little<00:01:51.899> bit<00:01:52.020> awkward<00:01:52.140> if<00:01:52.530> you're

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
it's a little bit awkward if you're

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.490 
it's a little bit awkward if you're
doing<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.070> one<00:01:53.310> line<00:01:53.579> clip<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.500> something

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
doing it on one line clip so something

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.230 
doing it on one line clip so something
that<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:55.740> think<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.159> quite<00:01:56.520> important<00:01:57.060> going

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
that we think is quite important going

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.920 
that we think is quite important going
forward<00:01:57.329> we're<00:01:58.049> going<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:59.930> line

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
forward we're going to have to line

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.200 
forward we're going to have to line
clips<00:02:01.259> on<00:02:01.469> our<00:02:01.680> reel

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210
