 Congratulations

 good and without more to say let's start 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.799
 good as you see I have here already 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.799
 prepared all he 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.909
 all the material to use 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.250
 that time I did not buy because I had enough 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.300
 and after doing so many videos with 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.390
 wires 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.130
 I have decided to make one more simpleton very 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.150
 well first let's do this way 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.170
 like a sausage that we're going to 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.240
 fold like this 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.520
 and then we're going to do it like that for 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.490
 flatten it and if we have the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.220
 son goku pants 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.549
 Now let's do a little taking 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.549
 blue 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.229
 a little coin 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.909
 a kind of little coin 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.420
 certainly it's raining I do not know if 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.420
 be heard 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.180
 a while ago it 's sounding like they did 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.690
 popcorn because they hit directly on the 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.690
 window 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.820
 so here we have 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.519
 belt goku 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.180
 and we can for example put here a 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.180
 pellet 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.250
 and then good before the ball we do 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.250
 this 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.180
 and then now if the ball and so is this 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.549
 as the union of the belt 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.180
 now let's take a little more of 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.180
 orange 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.780
 they are going to teach us a trick in case 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.299
 they start to run out of color 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.909
 they want instead of buying more they can 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.950
 do this take some plasticine 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.019
 of another color that they do have a lot of 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.230
 for example rose the pink almost never 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.939
 use only for pig like this so no or 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.160
 example those who do not know how to make color 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:12.450
 meat they use as color 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.100
 the pink color now let's make a 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.940
 tortilla of the orange that is the color that 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.520
 we want and we are going to surround this green and 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.700
 so it seems that we have much more 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:28.280
 orange that we actually have 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.280
 here we are going to place a little blue 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.890
 Now I am in the truth 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.780
 the rain was the only the only weather in 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.500
 the one who had not recorded had already recorded 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.500
 on the sun 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.250
 on sunny days on hot days that 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.250
 they are very common here in mexico 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.489
 he had also recorded at night had 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.080
 engraved with the closed curtains of 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.120
 many ways and I think this was the 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.030
 only way that I was missing so good 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.060
 there is good here we are 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:06.220
 montañita see that it says like a droplet 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.220
 and place it exactly in that place 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.490
 and the torso is not running 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.650
 as you can see this is simpler I did not have 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.650
 desire to make a simpler 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.849
 I should be here my black color for 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:28.360
 some reason is not good we go for the 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:31.330
 time because as you see there and got my 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.180
 black color I forgot to take out the good 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.620
 and I'm making the droplets the droplets 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:41.130
 I made them with the same 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.530
 with the same technique with which I did the 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.650
 cowboy pistols in challenge plasticine 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.720
 1 and as you can see I am making your symbols 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.090
 the symbol of the turtle that in the end does not 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.250
 it was so good but good is one more 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.580
 improvised that the others as they see in 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.310
 his hands that are like two sausages the 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.960
 truth that is that flesh color that I made 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.330
 It was the left over me freddie mercury 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.710
 from the last time it was pretty good 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:10.020
 it's like the exact color of the one he evoked 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:14.130
 there as I see I am doing the symbol 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.479
 bigger by the way while that 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.490
 I would like to thank all of you 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:22.030
 those people who gave their 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:27.130
 recommendations in plasticine challenge to 6 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:30.080
 malice thank you very much because really 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:33.740
 what helped me a lot 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:37.250
 and another thing that is for them to do the 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.710
 recommendations the recommendations if 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:43.340
 is that they make them I suggest it be in 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.439
 the last playmat challenge video not in 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.620
 ego videos or videos 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:51.259
 specials but in the last video made 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:55.400
 of plasticine challenge because for example 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:58.669
 they do them in videos already two months ago 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.500
 or so and well the first one and then the 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:05.780

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:09.830
 alright so that in the last video and 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:13.550
 another thing that if they do it in the p in the 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:17.740
 last video of retro plasticine if 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.740
 they put their recommendation and I do not choose it 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:24.330
 put the other time in the next and so 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.360
 in the next playdoll challenge in the 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:30.570
 I comment box because I come 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.910

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.870
 that are good but since I do not see them anymore 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:39.210
 I do not know who they are anymore so I can not 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:43.350
 I can not give them this 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:48.570
