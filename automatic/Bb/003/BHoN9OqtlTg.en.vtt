 I 've had enough to play but 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.130

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.599
 pretty interesting recorded games 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.070

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.760
 pretty entertaining part that you can 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.500
 see background and good is pretty good 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.949
 I'm playing with the f2000 one of the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.779
 best game jumping rifles according to 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.940
 according to say there according to music 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.350
 at least I said no to the f2000 no 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.700
 they were the truth is not bad told me 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.260
 how to carry such a bad earthquake that is 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.750
 best fusion of game and gea jump 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.160
 ok he said it because he killed so much 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.410
 because if I do not understand it but good 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.809
 You can see it because this one is pretty 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.760
 entertaining and there the cuartes it is 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.530
 pretty good indeed today today 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.860
 and I've left a link on twitter 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.960
 gameplay but in the multiplayer trailer 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.219
 of the new medal of honor and of a 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.079
 tremendously painted or it reminds me 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.609
 very much to the new to the old 'medal of 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.239
 honor 'to the last' medal of honor 'but 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.860
 with battlefield 3 graphics and better 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.820
 I like it, I really like what 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.020
 it looks is 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.570
 obviously everything that has been seen in 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.240
 the trailer is pc but good if 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.650
 we imagine that the conversion of pc is going to 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.090
 be more or less as is the debate 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.030
 filter species like that of battlefield 3 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.930
 of xbox because more or less we know how it goes 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.970
 to be that new medal of honor 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.680
 graphically speaking for good to me 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.420
 I really like what I see and really 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.400
 I will surely end up buying it will be 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.110
 on October 25 so surely 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.580
 have gameplays and gameplays and 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.259
 gameplays depends on what you give me 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.060
 I like the game, you'll see that 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.110
 I started on the channel and see if I like it 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.450
 a lot because I'm getting tired 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.890
 too much of call of duty and I want something 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.450
 that is the game with utility but that 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.890
 be different and that you can get more 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.960
 chicha I want to 'medal of honor' 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.520
 but a tremendous desire I do not know not what 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.830
 imagine but well let's leave everything 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.149
 I'm going there because I did not go up there 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.770
 video out because yesterday I did not upload this 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.899
 good video well as you are reading the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.100
 title and yesterday I went to the a warner to 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.289
 the warner de madrid and a park 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.060
 lifelong attractions like as in 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.190
 France, for example, is Disney 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.050
 good disneyland paris that disney 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.430
 kiko I say so here is the nursery 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.679
 good for the truth is that I had it 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.320
 great and I will say what happened 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.360
 really because I have 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.510
 I have recorded videoblogs from there 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.910
 from my mobile but I do not have the fucking 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.590
 cable that goes from the mobile to the PC 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.000
 so I can not make the videos not 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.070
 I can edit the video and I can not do 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.780
 basically nothing so it bothers me a 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.120
 egg but good now is that the videos 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.130
 they were not for anything either, it 's a couple 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.410
 of things like that with my friends in plan 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.480
 check boxes can not say and the 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.130
 truth is that they are good but they are 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.959
 can do without them and well I'm going 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.550
 to tell what happened to me and everything that 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.510
 Now it 's bad, nothing happens 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.820
 We not had a good time I'm 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.920
 totally burned because he forgot 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.750
 throwing me cream good at the end a friend 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.950
 He left cream but I really still burned 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.810
 because I do like that because I burn myself 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.540
 very much and good because the truth is that 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.820
 I had a great time is that mind more I can 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.640
 say on a Tuesday a Tuesday in July where 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.110
 there is no god on a Tuesday because well he 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.920
 normally in the traction itself is 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.180
 are banned from Friday to Sunday and not 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.040
 there is more and a Tuesday it is 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.380
 practically empty and obviously so 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.640
 the warner that there really is not much 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.200
 people because the ticket is worth a 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.600
 pastón me normal that luckily our 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.560
 we have 50 percent of 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.800
 discount since we could enter paying 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.240
 in theory a reasonable price but a 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.250
 We do not have a great time as I say 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.460
 it cost us to get a lot because 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.920
 they removed the rents heaps mound 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.660
 healthy the theme of renfe the train here is 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.420
 I do not know if it will be called by air in the stove 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.640
 slow in the vicinity of madrid removed 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.010
 the station and we had to do 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.810
 transfer then go by bus a streak 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.180
 tremendous let's go out we left my 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.890
 house at 10 and I got there still so 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.510
 imagine three hours there counted the sun 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.550
 in the face waiting for the bus waiting for the 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.200
 Wow train but well worth it 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.550
 because we really entered and there was not 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.230
 God, that is, we do not wait for a queue 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.440
 enter or be nobody nobody nobody actually 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.820
 we went in we went to if it was what 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.110
 first we went we went to a water 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.850
 that was totally empty 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.680
 good is empty , nothing was expected 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.560
 there were really like boats not 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.700
 a boat passed every 30 seconds more 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.040
 past flight to a few other points 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.760
 we ride directly in a boat and we 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.650
 we really soaked that was brutal I did not 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.150
 I had drenched more in my damn 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.980
 life really but good was 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.780
 pretty good and then we went to the 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.630
 superman good stairs we dress 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.360
 as 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.800
 as it is said we were first in one of 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.210
 water then we dry ourselves on a mountain 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.550
 russian because in the rose mountain then you 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.990
 obviously dry the wind after 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.670
 no water because it is very hot 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.690
 after mountain we resist well all 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.670
 the time and really is that we 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.220
 we went from putísima mother the truth is 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.230
 I had already gone but the warner 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.430
 some way since childhood and I had 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.750
 already mounted on all the 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.370
 attractions but everything is not like that 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.650
 it's wrong to remember what that was like 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.990
 attraction and we really did not get over it 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.640
 putísima mother really superman is 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.170
 they know very well I do not know if surely 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.250
 someone will have gone to the warner because 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.590
 I guess someone will be watching 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.150
 from madrid I would have gone to the warner and 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.190
 will have said that superman is the best 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.380
 amusement park attraction say there's a 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.140
 that I do not know what it's really called 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.910
 that she mountains as a child that is 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.290
 pull first back and then to 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.850
 forward and success the time is in plan 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.160
 roller coaster but small mallet and mallet 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.530
 short and it's pretty good too but 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.940
 Well, the superman seems to me better 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.590
 because it's awesome, I do not know 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.720
 how many lupins are made nine loops or 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.370
 six lupine if really good I have 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.660
 said that de madrid is the best 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.550
 abyss I also like a lot but good 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.080
 superman is more complete so to speak 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.370
 and the truth is that we did not have it 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.060
 putísima mother as I say 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.650
 the boats the river bravo but that 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.169
 also call that you are back and you 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.610
 you soak great heap is the truth that 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.350
 it was great the wait is very good 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.690
 and when it is empty, it is still enjoyed 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.520
 more and that's what we did enjoy it but 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.050
 duly incredibly and we what 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.880

 because I know it's super bad is not the 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.340
 better so they have said that the dragon

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.580
 that the khan dragon is very good and that 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:28.020
