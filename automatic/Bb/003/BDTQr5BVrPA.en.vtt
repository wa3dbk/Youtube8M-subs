00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello everyone how are what I am Wave 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 mario dimension are welcome to the 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.420
 best dimension of youtube good 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.759
 this time I want to talk about a topic that 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.950
 I have thinking for weeks I do not know if I already 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.870
 they realized that the videos of the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.029
 Lego Bob series are no longer there 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.640
 worry they were not deleted 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.980
 just mark them private the reason 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.869
 reason the others forward if you want to see 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.430
 those videos click on the link that you see 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.800
 in playlist screen 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.019
 whenever you want to watch an episode of 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.660
 lego book so just come to this video and give 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.420
 click on the link good the reason why 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.090
 what did I do that is you will see I've realized 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.250
 I do not know how, but he barely makes a few 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.469
 weeks I realized that the series of the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.660
 ego bop is that childish yes as well as 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.030
 they heard it I do not know how it took me so much 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.430
 time to realize but if the videos 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.829
 of the ego are childish and I have proof 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.870
 of the children who watch my videos almost 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.420
 everyone prefers to see lego book that super 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.489
 mario bros so I think the ego 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.530
 bob is a series for children and that super 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.750
 mariobros is for all ages already 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.600
 that in that series I do not do childish things 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.790
 I do not put nice and childish endings of 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.650
 once in a while I use mature humor and it's a 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.000
 less appropriate series than the ego book 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.240
 for young children 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.400
 given the case as they will know youtube is 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.380
 inhabited by many more teenagers than 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.930
 children and teenagers do not 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.270
 would like to see children's videos as lego 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.280
 bob if there is a series that I'm going to 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.619
 offer people my age is super 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.320
 Mario Bros at least is more mature than 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.690
 lego bob so for those people who do not 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.790
 like children's videos will not see 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.310
 the ego videos ' bob on my channel only 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.590
 those of super mario bros obviously the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.560
 people who will see super mario bros are not 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.259
 people of 16 years I imagine that it will be 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.869
 people from 10 to 14 years old and that is very 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.030
 well for me and so the rest of the children 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.119
 little ones who watch my videos can see 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.220
 legowo without worrying apart 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.530
 want to admit it or not super mario bros 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.570
 has been more successful than the ego bot and that 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.940
 that the ego bot had more than 20 videos and 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.670
 super mariobros barely takes 8 to what 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.040
 I mean with this, they will see when 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.660
 was in episode 19 of the ego voice ni 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.590
 He had even reached 100 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.930
 subscribers 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.480
 that I remember and thanks to super mario 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.720
 bros I'm halfway to my goal 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.310
 personal thousand subscribers clear that the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.650
 video that has made you have had more 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.170
 success has been the ego bob episode 20 the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.060
 ego catastrophes part 2 but had a lot 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.340
 success just because it's the last episode 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.920
 of the series when we get to the episode 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.080
 end of Super Mario Bros is likely 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.180
 that is very successful, you have to 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.069
 admit the truth super mario bros is 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.049
 better than govou but I do not want 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.630
 disappoint those because thanks to you 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.700
 I have life here on youtube I was 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.650
 seriously thinking for a while in 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.510
 remove lego ball series from youtube 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.150
 forever but I thought I would lose 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.579
 audience I do not want to lose subscribers 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.040
 thanks to them I live here on youtube 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.500
 a little fame a little do not compare me 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.540
 with is more than there if I die xd but 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.310
 good not to disappoint those who 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.860
 like govou can watch the episodes 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.870
 whenever they want, they just have to come 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.090
 to this video and click on the link that 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.020
 they see on screen that says lego videos 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.540
 book 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.580
 to make a short summary I do not want 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.530
 that the videos of the ego are to simple 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.560
 view as people would come to tell me 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.550
 stupid fagot learns to make videos 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.220
 with real people 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.800
 to me worth me your comments but still 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.140
 well I do not want discomfort would be more 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.090
 difficult to insult super mariobros to 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.040
 who insult legowo since super 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.560
 mariobros does not have as many points to 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.870
 insulting is comedy has humor not 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.910
 childish and do not have beautiful moments 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.770
 children that we say I will give them a 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.710
 example of a quite childish moment 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.170
 delegated voice in episode 8 that of 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.940
 grimy muscular at the end when donkey 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.180
 and lego box go back to making friends 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.340
 happy and live happily ever after 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.590
 curd or when in episode 4 the of 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.220
 christmas leaves a santa animation 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.950
 claus of 'spongebob' xd xd xd xddddd 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.360
 will do at the end of the ego catastrophes when 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.690
 Donkey revive please 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.240
 for donkey should not revive garden or 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.940
 revive serious do not revive diego do not revive 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.190
 mirna does not relive good she does but she 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.609
 it was too epic to die so 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.620
 she has excuse xd in the end I only did 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.720
 what a donkey would revive so as not to get 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.850
 tear all the time plan that 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.040
 died but at the last moment I thought about 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.440
 small children who watch the series and 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.750
 I decided to change the good ending I think 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.240
 that's all thanks for watching this video 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.340
 do not get sad to me sometimes I 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.919
 I like to see him govou my favorite is from 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.840
 then I read catastrophes part 2 I think 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.660
 I stayed well but the end watered 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.640
 good xd you already know click on the link 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.790

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.790
 then
