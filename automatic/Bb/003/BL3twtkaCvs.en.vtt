00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.200
 very good to all boys and girls here 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.969
 inside commenting and in this video 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.530
 I'm going to bring a very good mission to 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.789
 getting rp is really an activity 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.859
 created by a kid called the 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.150
 tarot that you will have with exercises that 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.400
 what has happened here on Skype has 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.230
 I've seen it tested and it 's amazing guy 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.369
 the truth has worked hard enough and 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.380
 well I'll have schÃ¼mann in the inscription 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.449
 in case you want to go and well I'm going to 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.880
 explain what you have to do in 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.260
 this mission is worth the first of all 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.670
 most recommended is that matisse to your 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.310
 friend a few times until you 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.620
 raise a rpp indicator that gives you up 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.809
 by 2.5 valve you will see that it gives you 1 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.210
 then by 1.5 then by 2 then by 2 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.550
 with 5 or something like that and well we have to 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.140
 start killing all these dolls 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.090
 It's worth to all these bald people who come out 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.100
 here and you will have to kill them until 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.350
 you see that they stop giving you that over 25 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.690
 As you can see, there are more 25 plus 25 each time 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.890
 you kill one and well once there 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.940
 we just killed them all 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.550
 you have to do will be picking up 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.199
 briefcases and how you have to play the 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.339
 activity yes or yes with a friend leave 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.840
 your idea here below in the 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.720
 comments to be able to help each other 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.970
 all and well the most important thing is for 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.600
 I'm worth it for you to win the 2 rp so much 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.920
 you as your friend so you can take one 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.380
 to all the briefcases and another that takes 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.700
 all briefcases -1 for example as 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.560
 you see here I in the first round I'm going to 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.850
 take all the briefcases in the second 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.920
 round my friend will take all the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.110
 briefcases and so on you can 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.210
 play up to seven rounds so the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.520
 rp is going to be very vast what you 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.799
 can give that can give you about twelve thousand 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.780
 altogether or twelve thousand per round or something like that 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.850
 because for every briefcase it's fine if bad 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.220

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.479
