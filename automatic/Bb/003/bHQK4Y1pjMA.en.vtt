loading<00:00:57.350> at<00:00:57.500> times<00:00:57.740> I<00:00:57.950> think<00:00:58.160> it's<00:00:58.250> because<00:00:58.610> I

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
loading at times I think it's because I

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.020 
loading at times I think it's because I
consume<00:00:59.270> too<00:00:59.480> much<00:00:59.630> salt<00:01:00.280> but<00:01:01.280> I'm<00:01:01.400> so<00:01:01.640> used<00:01:01.670> to

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
consume too much salt but I'm so used to

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.420

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
eating salt that I just I just need to

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.710 
eating salt that I just I just need to
eat<00:01:04.460> it<00:01:04.640> otherwise<00:01:04.910> my<00:01:05.090> food<00:01:05.300> isn't<00:01:05.420> taste

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
like anything so yeah I definitely have

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.480 
like anything so yeah I definitely have
to<00:01:08.150> learn<00:01:08.390> to<00:01:08.630> stop<00:01:08.810> doing<00:01:09.110> that<00:01:09.230> but<00:01:09.530> yeah<00:01:10.460> I

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
to learn to stop doing that but yeah I

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.280 
to learn to stop doing that but yeah I
definitely<00:01:10.850> feel<00:01:10.970> so<00:01:11.120> it<00:01:11.240> has<00:01:11.420> reduced<00:01:11.810> it<00:01:12.050> but

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
definitely feel so it has reduced it but

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.690 
definitely feel so it has reduced it but
it's<00:01:12.440> really<00:01:12.650> annoying<00:01:12.830> because<00:01:13.310> it's<00:01:13.490> making

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
it's really annoying because it's making

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.800 
it's really annoying because it's making
me<00:01:14.030> pee<00:01:14.590> so<00:01:15.590> much<00:01:16.040> and<00:01:16.580> I'm<00:01:17.150> feeling<00:01:17.600> like

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
me pee so much and I'm feeling like

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.420 
me pee so much and I'm feeling like
maybe<00:01:18.050> I'm<00:01:18.290> just<00:01:18.530> losing<00:01:18.710> a<00:01:18.890> lot<00:01:19.130> of<00:01:19.160> weight

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
maybe I'm just losing a lot of weight

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.460 
maybe I'm just losing a lot of weight
but<00:01:19.790> then<00:01:20.000> maybe<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.450> other<00:01:20.570> end<00:01:20.900> it<00:01:21.080> does

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
but then maybe the other end it does

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.430 
but then maybe the other end it does
work<00:01:21.740> so<00:01:22.040> I<00:01:22.250> have<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.420> see<00:01:23.600> when<00:01:23.750> I<00:01:23.780> finish<00:01:24.230> it

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
and then I have to make math until

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.050 
and then I have to make math until
exercise<00:02:53.510> number<00:02:53.720> 31<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.639> then<00:02:55.639> I<00:02:55.700> have<00:02:55.909> to
