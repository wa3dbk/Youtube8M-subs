00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
good yet but it's getting there so

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.110 
good yet but it's getting there so
overall<00:02:20.160> he<00:02:20.280> just<00:02:20.430> seems<00:02:20.700> like<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.850> better

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120

better at passing termine he's only got

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.070 
better at passing termine he's only got
one<00:02:35.340> assist<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:36.060> know<00:02:36.180> but<00:02:36.450> still<00:02:36.540> he<00:02:36.780> passes

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
pretty well he puts in crosses gets

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.680 
pretty well he puts in crosses gets
around<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.850> edge<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.120> box<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.450> know<00:02:39.480> he's

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
around the edge of the box you know he's

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.780 
around the edge of the box you know he's
doing<00:02:40.440> what<00:02:40.709> you're<00:02:40.800> not<00:02:40.890> acting<00:02:41.250> minded<00:02:41.610> that

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
doing what you're not acting minded that

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.300 
doing what you're not acting minded that
fall<00:02:42.420> back<00:02:42.600> should<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.810> doing<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.590> he's<00:02:44.160> good

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
fall back should be doing so he's good

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.949 
fall back should be doing so he's good
he's<00:02:44.400> not<00:02:44.550> like<00:02:44.700> super<00:02:45.180> great<00:02:45.510> at<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.660> passing

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
he's not like super great at the passing

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.810 
he's not like super great at the passing
he's<00:02:46.050> not<00:02:46.200> world<00:02:46.380> class<00:02:46.440> but<00:02:46.890> it's<00:02:47.280> decent<00:02:47.670> no

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
he's not world class but it's decent no

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.530 
he's not world class but it's decent no
decent<00:02:48.180> enough<00:02:48.300> does<00:02:48.600> what<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.840> needs<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:49.050> do

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
decent enough does what it needs to do

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.390 
decent enough does what it needs to do
finally<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.720> upped<00:02:52.140> his<00:02:52.320> heading<00:02:52.739> stop<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.220> get

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
finally I upped his heading stop and get

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.430 
finally I upped his heading stop and get
another<00:02:53.580> again<00:02:54.030> by<00:02:54.330> three<00:02:54.690> but<00:02:55.170> mainly

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
another again by three but mainly

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.110 
another again by three but mainly
because<00:02:55.560> it's<00:02:56.040> just<00:02:56.160> natural<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.640> upgrade<00:02:56.910> the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
because it's just natural to upgrade the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.880 
because it's just natural to upgrade the
status<00:02:57.450> while<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.750> season<00:02:58.050> go<00:02:58.170> on<00:02:58.350> season

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
status while the season go on season

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.070 
status while the season go on season
goes<00:02:59.010> on<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.489> he<00:02:59.520> plays<00:02:59.970> more<00:03:00.150> games<00:03:00.630> whatnot

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
goes on and he plays more games whatnot

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.900 
goes on and he plays more games whatnot
you<00:03:01.170> know<00:03:01.200> when<00:03:01.860> he's<00:03:01.980> certainly<00:03:02.280> no<00:03:02.430> drug<00:03:02.730> bro

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
you know when he's certainly no drug bro

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.160 
you know when he's certainly no drug bro
someone<00:03:03.269> like<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.420> when<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:03.870> comes<00:03:03.989> to

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
someone like that when it comes to

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.380 
someone like that when it comes to
heading<00:03:04.440> but<00:03:05.190> no<00:03:05.400> he's<00:03:05.549> not<00:03:05.640> terrible<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.239> mean

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
heading but no he's not terrible I mean

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.479 
heading but no he's not terrible I mean
he's<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:06.959> fullback<00:03:07.320> so<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.799> don't<00:03:07.950> need<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.280> do

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
he's a fullback so you don't need to do

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.680 
he's a fullback so you don't need to do
as<00:03:08.580> much<00:03:08.640> heading<00:03:09.030> as<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.150> center<00:03:09.390> backs<00:03:09.570> I

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
as much heading as a center backs I

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.600 
as much heading as a center backs I
don't<00:03:09.840> think<00:03:10.049> really<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:10.620> again<00:03:11.250> this<00:03:11.430> could

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
don't think really so again this could

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.140 
don't think really so again this could
be<00:03:11.670> partially<00:03:12.120> excused<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:13.640> kept<00:03:14.640> his<00:03:14.820> work

have two and a half stars weak foot so I

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.370 
have two and a half stars weak foot so I

thought well I might as well leave it as
it<00:03:46.470> was<00:03:46.500> forgive<00:03:47.040> him<00:03:47.130> a<00:03:47.160> three-star<00:03:47.519> week<00:03:47.640> for

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
it was forgive him a three-star week for

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.000 
it was forgive him a three-star week for
I<00:03:47.850> feel<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.090> bit<00:03:48.540> too<00:03:48.690> much<00:03:48.840> me<00:03:49.019> not<00:03:49.230> crap<00:03:49.560> but

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
I feel a bit too much me not crap but

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.949 
I feel a bit too much me not crap but
it's<00:03:50.280> not<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.820> greatest<00:03:50.940> either<00:03:51.330> so<00:03:51.720> I

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
it's not the greatest either so I

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.509 
it's not the greatest either so I
thought<00:03:52.350> I'd<00:03:52.500> leave<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.830> as<00:03:52.920> leave<00:03:53.070> them<00:03:53.250> as<00:03:53.400> it

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
thought I'd leave it as leave them as it

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.090 
thought I'd leave it as leave them as it
is<00:03:53.610> and<00:03:53.940> also<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:55.049> reason<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.410> changed<00:03:55.890> him

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
is and also the reason I changed him

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.190

from<00:03:56.489> a<00:03:56.640> right<00:03:57.120> back<00:03:57.329> to<00:03:57.570> a<00:03:57.600> left<00:03:57.840> back<00:03:57.959> is

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
from a right back to a left back is

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.530 
from a right back to a left back is

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
because he spent the majority the season

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.390 
because he spent the majority the season
