00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.540
Hi, on the Woodpecker today,I'm pouring concrete

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.260
The exterior of the shop is completed but

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.120
a sheet of plywood in front of the doors looks pretty crappy.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.160
So I ask Renée to dig a hole so

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.120
I can pour a nice concrete slab in front of my doors.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.000
OK after a little while I took pity on her and picked up a shovel to help her.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.860
After a couple of hours

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.120
we have a nice hole where the concrete slab will rest.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.540
But we also need to dig

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.600
in front of the other door.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.040
Renée digs this hole by herself

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.660
because, while she works on it, I start to build the form

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.960
for the front slab.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.560
I begin by ripping some two by eights to seven inches wide.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.580
Then I just need to nail them together.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.720
When it's done, I lay the form in place and check for squareness.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.860
Since it's not square, I have to dig a little again.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.340
When the hole is big enough,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.020
I can pound the pickets near the shop wall.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.880
I pound all of them deeper than the top of the form.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.720
Next I nail the form to those pickets.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.680
Next I can pound the two in the front.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.180
I check that it's leveled

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.180
a and nail the form to them.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.360
OK if I continue to drop my level like that,

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.580
I don't think it will last another twenty years.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.980
Now I can pound all the rest of the pickets.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.280
When they're all in place,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.840
I nail the form to them.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.900
I'm pretty sure that you're asking yourself what is that piece of plywood in the center of the hole doing there.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.100
Well it’s simple; it's a hole to access a drain pipe.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.120
Last year when I installed the drain,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.320
I left a pipe into the ground, just for that reason.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.400
Now I only need to measure the length of the pipe

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.520
that will connect everything together and cut it.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.520
This is the way it will all connect together.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.720
Now we have to fill up around the pipe.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.470
And I compact it as best I can.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.480
Now we have to do the same thing for the back door.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.600
That's the work finished.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.520
But the holes Renée dug up are too deep,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.120
so we fill them up with a couple of inches of gravel.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.720
The gravel is just in the center of the form; we didn't put any near the sides.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.800
We need to do the same thing in front.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.600
Next we install some wire mesh. This will reinforce the concrete.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.620
I had unused ones from last year.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.860
The next morning, the concrete truck is at the rendez-vous

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.460
and we pour the slabs.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.780
We begin with the back one.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.500
When the slab is full, we move to the front one

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.080
Then it's just a question of levelling it.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.840
In the end, I have to remove some concrete and level it all with a trowel.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.300
Then we re-level it, but the concrete is too clear to work it smooth,

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.520
so we start to work on the front slab.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.280
With the technique of using a piece of wood to level a small concrete slab,

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.320
you can level a small structure, like a garden shed for example.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.939
When we're done with this piece of wood,

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.861
I smooth the surface with a trowel.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.160
But while I'm working on the front slab,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.280
missy here, wasn't just enjoying the sun,

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.039
she walked on my back slab.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.880
And I though that this only happened in cartoons...

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.040
To avoid anymore adventure, we just tie down the little princess.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.140
But I still have to finish smoothing the front slab.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.080
When it’s done, I have to do the same thing to the back one.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.320
But I have a little bit more work because of the holes her  paws made.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.240
But I manage to finish it anyway.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.651
And when I look at the result I'm pretty happy.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.520
The next morning, the concrete is hard enough to walk on

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.600
and we remove the forms.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.720
Next I re-fill around the slab.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.800
When the front one is done I move to the back one.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.900
Then to slow the curing of the concrete

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.680
I wet both surfaces.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.420
The next morning, I cut and remove the plastic sheet I left

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.880
between my floor slab and the ones I just poured two days ago.

00:07:44.016 --> 00:07:46.016
This is my new look in front of my shop’s doors.

00:07:46.016 --> 00:07:48.736
It's cleaner and more practical than the old sheet of plywood.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.480
So see you soon for another episode of The Woodpecker
