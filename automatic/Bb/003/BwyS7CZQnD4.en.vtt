 I wonder if you 're a boy who aims to be a guitarist, but someday a guitar 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.990
 it was done 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:13.630

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.860

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.010

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:24.010
 Aiming boots specific there has Kappa rock guitarist

 It was so what do you by Japanese rock band that want to pull the beast 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.260
 Hmmm 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:33.239
 It's a first time playing sore guitar 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:37.550
 I Yappa I'm that Books and duck important but is a delusion 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:42.069
 Run from the other side 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:47.439
 Or rather to imitate carrying a guitar 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:49.590
 I started from a place where I first started copy tourism if it is perfect first 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:53.709
 After all I want to be important- 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:58.840
 Well it's there playing force cormorant a source of even just mind 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:01.069
 Also it is not a great platform if Soviet mentality say path of spirit I grayed 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:07.159
 It looks like a way of life 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:10.310
 That's why it's still the same as it was at that time, so it's aa boyish like that 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:15.950
 Is there a universal problem rather than that world 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:21.060

 In particular, but I am want Yeah mouse Ami ne of the stage 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:49.020
 But the impression of the person who went to this live view says that it is great to listen to private houses after that 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:53.520
 Amazing is the world crabs also fascinated everyone port of Rutteyuu 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:57.380

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.380
 What does it mean ? 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:04.600
 I I'm a much gone by I have a sense of tension cattle Anomasu page nor the audience 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.900
 At that time 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:11.200
 SekiHajime Tteyuu felt that can not be it retaining clips 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.230
 It looks like a classic I have to stop the flash concert with this moisture 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:18.220
 Oh yes 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:24.720
 I have a seat in the earphones that feels so tense 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.720
 After all everyone is so concentrated and listening in , so it's a moment, isn't it too comfortable?
