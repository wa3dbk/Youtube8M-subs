actually 12.1 megapixels but here's

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.049 
actually 12.1 megapixels but here's
where<00:00:56.219> gets<00:00:56.399> really<00:00:56.610> crazy<00:00:56.730> I'm<00:00:56.879> going<00:00:57.000> to

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
where gets really crazy I'm going to

turn this on to show you this thing acts

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:06.020 
turn this on to show you this thing acts
as<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.370> 24<00:00:59.760> x<00:01:00.210> zoom<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.809> watch<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:04.369> Wow<00:01:05.369> now

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
as a 24 x zoom so watch this Wow now

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.660 
as a 24 x zoom so watch this Wow now
this<00:01:06.570> doesn't<00:01:07.200> seem<00:01:07.500> like<00:01:07.680> much<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:07.979> 24<00:01:08.340> x<00:01:08.520> is

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
this doesn't seem like much but 24 x is

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.899 
this doesn't seem like much but 24 x is
a<00:01:08.700> lot<00:01:08.970> if<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.720> was<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> DSLR<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
a lot if this was a DSLR the the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.359 
a lot if this was a DSLR the the
smallest<00:01:12.420> size<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.110> widest<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.650> goes<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.979> 24

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
smallest size the widest it goes is 24

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.230 
smallest size the widest it goes is 24
millimeters<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.909> highest<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.570> would<00:01:15.780> ever<00:01:15.900> go

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
millimeters the highest it would ever go

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.490 
millimeters the highest it would ever go
624<00:01:18.240> millimeters<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.140> will<00:01:19.200> be<00:01:19.320> like<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
624 millimeters so that will be like a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.310 
624 millimeters so that will be like a
lens<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.830> would<00:01:19.920> be<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:21.060> big<00:01:21.360> Alfred's

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
lens it would be like this big Alfred's

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.660 
lens it would be like this big Alfred's
onion<00:01:22.530> paintings<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.890> came<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.130> zoom<00:01:23.310> out<00:01:23.430> but

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
onion paintings I came in zoom out but

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.070 
onion paintings I came in zoom out but
it's<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:24.030> bigger<00:01:24.240> than<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.509> camera<00:01:24.810> zoomed

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
it's it's bigger than the camera zoomed

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.200 
it's it's bigger than the camera zoomed
out<00:01:25.200> right<00:01:25.380> now<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.710> quite<00:01:25.860> impressive

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
out right now so it's quite impressive

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.300 
out right now so it's quite impressive
check<00:01:27.210> out<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.390> display<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.049> back

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
check out that display on the back

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.760 
check out that display on the back
really<00:01:29.310> really<00:01:29.729> nice<00:01:30.000> display<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
really really nice display and it's a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.580 
really really nice display and it's a
one<00:01:32.040> point<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.270> three<00:01:33.570> inch<00:01:33.810> LCD<00:01:34.409> and

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
one point it's a three inch LCD and

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.170 
one point it's a three inch LCD and
what's<00:01:35.250> really<00:01:35.369> cool<00:01:35.490> about<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.030> you

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
what's really cool about it is that you

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.789 
what's really cool about it is that you
can<00:01:36.360> pretty<00:01:36.960> much<00:01:37.049> move<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.470> wherever<00:01:37.650> you

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
can pretty much move it wherever you

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.760 
can pretty much move it wherever you
want<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.100> go<00:01:38.220> down<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.600> go<00:01:39.720> up<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.619> if

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
want you go down you can go up and so if

well you can be a completely blank or

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.130 
well you can be a completely blank or

all the information or grid lines which

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.050 
all the information or grid lines which
is<00:03:34.260> all<00:03:34.500> really<00:03:35.010> cool<00:03:35.340> another<00:03:35.850> thing<00:03:35.940> that's

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
is all really cool another thing that's

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.430 
is all really cool another thing that's
interesting<00:03:36.150> about<00:03:36.420> this<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:37.140> design<00:03:37.410> of

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
interesting about this the design of

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.650 
interesting about this the design of
this<00:03:37.650> actual<00:03:38.280> camera<00:03:38.850> is<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.150> have<00:03:39.300> for

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
this actual camera is that you have for

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.260 
this actual camera is that you have for
wavy<00:03:40.290> our<00:03:40.440> image<00:03:41.250> stabilization<00:03:41.610> so<00:03:42.150> that

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
wavy our image stabilization so that

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.970 
wavy our image stabilization so that
means<00:03:42.450> in<00:03:42.570> case<00:03:42.810> of<00:03:42.960> camera<00:03:43.200> shaking<00:03:43.440> it's

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
means in case of camera shaking it's

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.530 
means in case of camera shaking it's
going<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.190> actually<00:03:44.400> take<00:03:45.000> care<00:03:45.210> of<00:03:45.270> that<00:03:45.390> for

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
going to actually take care of that for

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.790 
going to actually take care of that for
you<00:03:45.630> one<00:03:45.810> of<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:45.990> ways<00:03:46.140> is<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.560> actual

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
you one of the ways is that the actual

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.230 
you one of the ways is that the actual
image<00:03:47.190> sensor<00:03:47.520> that's<00:03:47.580> in<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.820> back<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.180> this

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
image sensor that's in the back of this

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.540 
image sensor that's in the back of this
thing<00:03:48.300> shakes<00:03:49.080> with<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.680> camera<00:03:50.100> so<00:03:50.310> your

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
thing shakes with the camera so your

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.790 
thing shakes with the camera so your
shots<00:03:51.120> don't<00:03:51.330> come<00:03:51.450> out<00:03:51.480> blurry<00:03:51.870> another

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
shots don't come out blurry another

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.290 
shots don't come out blurry another
thing<00:03:53.070> is<00:03:53.100> motion<00:03:53.700> detection<00:03:53.970> if<00:03:54.180> it's

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
thing is motion detection if it's

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.730 
thing is motion detection if it's
actually<00:03:54.570> taking<00:03:54.780> a<00:03:54.840> picture<00:03:55.050> of<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.290> subject

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
actually taking a picture of a subject

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.290 
actually taking a picture of a subject
and<00:03:55.800> it<00:03:56.340> knows<00:03:56.550> that<00:03:56.580> your<00:03:56.850> camera<00:03:57.030> is<00:03:57.180> moving

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
and it knows that your camera is moving

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.300 
and it knows that your camera is moving
to<00:03:57.540> match<00:03:57.990> that<00:03:58.020> subject<00:03:58.740> it's<00:03:59.070> actually

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
to match that subject it's actually

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.620 
to match that subject it's actually
gonna<00:03:59.400> increase<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.820> shutter<00:03:59.970> speed<00:04:00.330> it's

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
gonna increase the shutter speed it's

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.700 
gonna increase the shutter speed it's
going<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:00.780> make<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:01.020> faster<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:01.470> it's<00:04:01.620> also

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
going to make it faster and it's also

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.560 
going to make it faster and it's also
increase<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.070> ISO<00:04:02.580> so<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:02.940> takes<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.180> faster

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
increase the ISO so it takes a faster

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.990 
increase the ISO so it takes a faster
picture<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.080> you<00:04:04.350> don't<00:04:04.530> get<00:04:04.620> any<00:04:04.770> blur<00:04:05.130> it'll

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
picture and you don't get any blur it'll

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.840 
picture and you don't get any blur it'll
go<00:04:06.150> up<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.390> iso<00:04:06.840> 6400<00:04:07.590> if<00:04:08.220> you're<00:04:08.370> under<00:04:08.670> 3

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
go up to iso 6400 if you're under 3

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.730 
go up to iso 6400 if you're under 3
megapixels<00:04:09.390> or<00:04:09.480> below<00:04:09.750> so<00:04:10.530> that's<00:04:10.680> very

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
megapixels or below so that's very

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.280 
megapixels or below so that's very
bright<00:04:11.280> for<00:04:11.490> low-light<00:04:11.790> situations<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.690> it

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
bright for low-light situations and it

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.870 
bright for low-light situations and it
also<00:04:13.410> has<00:04:13.560> something<00:04:13.800> called<00:04:13.920> nikon<00:04:14.370> VSS

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
also has something called nikon VSS

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.030 
also has something called nikon VSS
which<00:04:15.120> is<00:04:15.300> best<00:04:15.600> shot<00:04:15.900> selector<00:04:16.170> so<00:04:16.890> it'll

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
which is best shot selector so it'll

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.800 
which is best shot selector so it'll
take<00:04:17.190> 10<00:04:17.430> photos<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:17.970> pick<00:04:18.120> out<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.390> sharpest

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
take 10 photos and pick out the sharpest

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.289 
take 10 photos and pick out the sharpest
out<00:04:18.989> of<00:04:19.200> those<00:04:19.410> 10<00:04:19.799> it's<00:04:20.370> another<00:04:20.549> really<00:04:20.970> cool
