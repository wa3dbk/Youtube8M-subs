would have been 50 pounds let's discuss
but<00:03:01.130> I'm<00:03:01.430> optimistic<00:03:01.730> i<00:03:02.599> can<00:03:02.780> find<00:03:02.989> something

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
but I'm optimistic i can find something

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:17.400 
but I'm optimistic i can find something
with<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.530> remaining<00:03:03.829> 60<00:03:04.310> pounds<00:03:04.760> let's<00:03:05.209> go

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.509 

they<00:03:18.410> could<00:03:18.620> be<00:03:18.709> quite<00:03:18.920> cool<00:03:19.129> because<00:03:19.310> they're

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
they could be quite cool because they're

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.069 
they could be quite cool because they're
good<00:03:19.700> for<00:03:19.819> daytime<00:03:20.299> but<00:03:20.599> I<00:03:20.660> reckon<00:03:20.959> they'd

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
good for daytime but I reckon they'd

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.400 
good for daytime but I reckon they'd
look<00:03:21.230> white<00:03:21.470> corn

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
look white corn

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.600 
look white corn
but<00:03:23.130> their<00:03:23.250> 85<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:24.390> I've<00:03:24.480> got<00:03:24.950> 60<00:03:25.950> pounds<00:03:26.400> left
