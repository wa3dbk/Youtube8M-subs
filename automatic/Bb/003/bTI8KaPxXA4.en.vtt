00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
pretty I actually didn't know it was a

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.330 
pretty I actually didn't know it was a
water<00:01:44.950> snake<00:01:45.100> when<00:01:45.460> I<00:01:45.520> first<00:01:45.759> saw<00:01:46.000> it<00:01:46.210> um<00:01:47.340> but

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
water snake when I first saw it um but

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.120 
water snake when I first saw it um but
uh<00:01:48.369> I<00:01:48.790> just<00:01:49.750> happened<00:01:50.290> to<00:01:50.380> notice<00:01:50.530> that<00:01:50.800> it<00:01:50.920> was

uh I just happened to notice that it was

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.060 
uh I just happened to notice that it was
but<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.290> coolest<00:01:53.290> thing<00:01:53.410> about<00:01:53.500> this<00:01:53.860> water

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
but the coolest thing about this water

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.790 
but the coolest thing about this water
snake<00:01:54.460> is<00:01:54.610> definitely<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.150> belly<00:01:55.800> because

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
snake is definitely the belly because

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.010 
snake is definitely the belly because
the<00:01:57.700> northern<00:01:57.940> water<00:01:58.300> snakes<00:01:58.660> they<00:01:58.840> have<00:01:58.990> a

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
the northern water snakes they have a

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.169 
the northern water snakes they have a
cool-looking<00:01:59.319> belly<00:01:59.740> but<00:02:00.009> their<00:02:00.220> pattern<00:02:01.030> is

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
cool-looking belly but their pattern is

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.510 
cool-looking belly but their pattern is
just<00:02:01.360> solid<00:02:01.569> black<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:02.920> black<00:02:03.160> and<00:02:03.340> white

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
just solid black just black and white

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.430 
just solid black just black and white

and this one's got more of an orange to
brown<00:02:05.590> with<00:02:06.580> a<00:02:06.610> little<00:02:06.729> tin<00:02:07.149> of<00:02:07.270> yellow<00:02:07.630> going

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
brown with a little tin of yellow going

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.050

all<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.800> way<00:02:08.890> down<00:02:09.069> it<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:09.399> sort<00:02:09.880> of<00:02:09.940> like<00:02:10.030> a

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
all the way down it and sort of like a

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.240 
all the way down it and sort of like a
checkered<00:02:10.479> pattern<00:02:10.770> it's<00:02:11.770> really<00:02:12.069> pretty

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
checkered pattern it's really pretty

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.800 
checkered pattern it's really pretty
this<00:02:12.610> is<00:02:12.670> definitely<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.270> prettiest<00:02:13.630> water

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
this is definitely the prettiest water

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.530 
this is definitely the prettiest water
snake<00:02:14.110> we've<00:02:14.319> caught<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:14.830> far<00:02:15.270> I've<00:02:16.270> never

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
snake we've caught so far I've never

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.230 
snake we've caught so far I've never
caught<00:02:16.990> one<00:02:17.020> with<00:02:17.380> patterns<00:02:17.740> like<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:18.240> so

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
caught one with patterns like this so

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.970 
caught one with patterns like this so
this<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.569> definitely<00:02:19.750> something<00:02:20.290> different

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
this is definitely something different

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.690
