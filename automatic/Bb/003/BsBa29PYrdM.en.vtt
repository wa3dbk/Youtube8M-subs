00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.839 

all<00:00:08.189> right<00:00:08.400> so<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.760> thought<00:00:09.059> I<00:00:09.090> would<00:00:10.670> take<00:00:11.670> on

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
all right so I thought I would take on

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.400 
all right so I thought I would take on
the<00:00:11.940> driving<00:00:12.210> part<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.719> my<00:00:12.809> neighborhood<00:00:13.230> to

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
the driving part of my neighborhood to

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.710 
the driving part of my neighborhood to
her<00:00:13.500> here<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:15.830> you<00:00:16.830> can<00:00:17.070> see<00:00:17.359> there's<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.420> mirror

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
her here so you can see there's a mirror

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.650 
her here so you can see there's a mirror
up<00:00:18.869> there<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.140> gotta<00:00:19.320> check<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:20.240> pretty<00:00:21.240> tight

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
up there you gotta check it pretty tight

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.570 
up there you gotta check it pretty tight
pony<00:00:22.820> watch<00:00:23.820> out<00:00:24.150> for

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.830 

I'm<00:00:28.580> gonna<00:00:28.730> pick<00:00:28.910> this<00:00:29.030> up<00:00:29.240> actually<00:00:29.630> I<00:00:29.690> mean

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
I'm gonna pick this up actually I mean

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.140 
I'm gonna pick this up actually I mean
it's<00:00:29.960> probably<00:00:30.260> easier<00:00:30.640> that<00:00:31.640> light<00:00:31.910> is

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
it's probably easier that light is

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.370 
it's probably easier that light is
killing<00:00:32.930> me<00:00:33.080> so<00:00:34.070> it's<00:00:34.190> pretty<00:00:34.490> narrow<00:00:35.230> I'm<00:00:36.230> in

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
killing me so it's pretty narrow I'm in

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:43.170 
killing me so it's pretty narrow I'm in
my<00:00:36.530> smallish<00:00:37.040> lambda

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.880 

and<00:00:43.420> again<00:00:43.750> if<00:00:43.899> another<00:00:44.110> car<00:00:44.379> were<00:00:44.620> to<00:00:44.710> say

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
and again if another car were to say

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.380 
and again if another car were to say
come<00:00:45.100> up<00:00:45.219> right<00:00:45.399> now

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
come up right now

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.729 
come up right now
I<00:00:47.450> would<00:00:47.750> have<00:00:47.960> to

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.830 

figure<00:00:51.340> something<00:00:51.670> out<00:00:51.760> so<00:00:52.570> there's<00:00:52.750> an

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
figure something out so there's an

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.569 
figure something out so there's an
intersection<00:00:53.079> right<00:00:53.530> here<00:00:53.980> which<00:00:54.430> I<00:00:54.550> just

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
intersection right here which I just

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.180 
intersection right here which I just
know<00:00:54.910> about<00:00:55.149> it's<00:00:55.329> very<00:00:55.390> signed<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.949> gonna

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
know about it's very signed it's gonna

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.889 
know about it's very signed it's gonna
cross<00:00:57.670> by<00:00:57.940> right<00:00:58.180> here<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:01.329> again<00:01:01.629> you<00:01:01.809> just

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
cross by right here so again you just

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.550 
cross by right here so again you just
have<00:01:01.989> to<00:01:02.170> be<00:01:02.260> careful<00:01:02.680> so<00:01:04.229> here's<00:01:05.229> a<00:01:05.320> little

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
have to be careful so here's a little

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.200 
have to be careful so here's a little
bridge<00:01:05.830> across<00:01:06.040> the<00:01:06.250> river<00:01:06.610> I<00:01:06.700> talked<00:01:06.970> about

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
bridge across the river I talked about

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.490 
bridge across the river I talked about
in<00:01:07.300> my<00:01:07.360> other<00:01:07.390> video<00:01:07.810> but<00:01:07.869> I<00:01:08.080> got<00:01:08.259> to<00:01:08.350> make<00:01:08.440> a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
in my other video but I got to make a

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.290 
in my other video but I got to make a
90-degree<00:01:09.369> turn<00:01:11.729> between<00:01:12.729> the<00:01:12.850> pole<00:01:13.030> in<00:01:13.210> the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
90-degree turn between the pole in the

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:22.330 
90-degree turn between the pole in the
fence<00:01:15.869> alright

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.190

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
drop off over there got to be careful

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.520 
drop off over there got to be careful

2/3 row space right here it can be a

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.170 
2/3 row space right here it can be a
little<00:02:27.740> true<00:02:28.160> even<00:02:28.459> a<00:02:28.520> little<00:02:28.640> bit<00:02:28.850> trickier

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
little true even a little bit trickier

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.490 
little true even a little bit trickier
