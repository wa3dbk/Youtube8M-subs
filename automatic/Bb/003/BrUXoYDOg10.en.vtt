00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:26.319 
you know it depends on the section but

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:27.830 
you know it depends on the section but
normally<00:01:26.710> there's<00:01:26.950> there's<00:01:27.580> a<00:01:27.729> couple

difficult section so you push it in hard

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.590 
difficult section so you push it in hard
and<00:01:30.310> you<00:01:30.429> probably<00:01:30.789> have<00:01:30.909> two<00:01:31.450> or<00:01:31.539> three

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
and you probably have two or three

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.200 
and you probably have two or three
really<00:01:31.990> close<00:01:32.380> cause<00:01:32.950> but<00:01:33.640> that's<00:01:33.850> expected

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
really close cause but that's expected

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.890 
really close cause but that's expected
