there's<00:00:33.930> other<00:00:34.050> lenses<00:00:34.410> out<00:00:34.559> there<00:00:34.829> this

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
there's other lenses out there this

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.590 
there's other lenses out there this
would<00:00:35.700> be<00:00:35.820> great<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.180> shooting<00:00:36.329> something

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
would be great for shooting something

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.290 
would be great for shooting something
like<00:00:36.719> rock-and-roll<00:00:37.940> this<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> other

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
like rock-and-roll this on the other

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.720 
like rock-and-roll this on the other
hand<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.870> 70<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.290> 200<00:00:40.469> millimeter<00:00:41.129> lens<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
hand is a 70 to 200 millimeter lens and

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.220 
hand is a 70 to 200 millimeter lens and
this<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.000> better<00:00:42.180> for<00:00:42.239> stuff<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:42.870> fast

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
this is better for stuff like fast

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.029 
this is better for stuff like fast
action<00:00:43.620> sports<00:00:44.000> football<00:00:45.680> now<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.860> all

action sports football now that all

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.950 
action sports football now that all
lenses<00:00:47.309> zoom<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> two<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.600> showed

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
lenses zoom like the two I just showed

lenses zoom like the two I just showed
you<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.350> one<00:00:49.500> over<00:00:49.739> here<00:00:50.120> is<00:00:51.120> just<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.420> fixed

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
you this one over here is just a fixed

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.410 
you this one over here is just a fixed
focal<00:00:52.379> 85<00:00:52.920> millimeter<00:00:53.370> lens<00:00:53.640> really<00:00:54.090> good<00:00:54.239> for

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
focal 85 millimeter lens really good for

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.470 
focal 85 millimeter lens really good for
portrait<00:00:54.780> photography<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.850> vast<00:00:57.149> number

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
portrait photography so this vast number

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.869 
portrait photography so this vast number
of<00:00:57.570> lenses<00:00:57.780> gives<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> lot<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.100> options<00:00:59.309> in

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
of lenses gives you a lot of options in

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.580 
of lenses gives you a lot of options in
terms<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.420> what<00:01:00.539> you're<00:01:00.690> shooting<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.350> get<00:01:01.440> the

terms of what you're shooting to get the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.020 
terms of what you're shooting to get the
kind<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.829> look<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.250> want<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.879> gonna

like<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.320> said<00:01:13.380> all<00:01:13.740> digital<00:01:14.520> SLR<00:01:15.360> cameras<00:01:16.369> need

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
like I said all digital SLR cameras need

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.399 
like I said all digital SLR cameras need
a<00:01:17.400> lens<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.060> take<00:01:18.509> pictures<00:01:18.840> otherwise<00:01:19.170> you

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
just have a mirror and a sensor in there

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.890 
just have a mirror and a sensor in there
simply<00:01:22.460> take<00:01:23.460> your<00:01:23.490> lens<00:01:24.770> remove<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> caps

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
and attach it on and that's one of the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.800 
and attach it on and that's one of the
nice<00:01:29.369> things<00:01:30.150> about<00:01:30.270> digital<00:01:30.750> photography

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
nice things about digital photography

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.630 
nice things about digital photography
with<00:01:31.320> an<00:01:31.409> SLR<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.340> switch<00:01:32.520> your

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
with an SLR is you can switch your

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.880 
with an SLR is you can switch your
lenses<00:01:32.939> out<00:01:33.150> whereas<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.409> are<00:01:34.439> using<00:01:34.710> a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
lenses out whereas if you are using a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.280 
lenses out whereas if you are using a
point-and-shoot<00:01:35.400> camera<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.600> lens<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.900> fixed

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
point-and-shoot camera the lens is fixed

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.109 
point-and-shoot camera the lens is fixed
and<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.470> obviously<00:01:38.250> can't<00:01:38.490> remove<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.850> so

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
and you obviously can't remove it so

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.640 
and you obviously can't remove it so
when<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.780> take<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> picture<00:01:40.140> what<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.500> lens

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
when you take a picture what the lens

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.200 
when you take a picture what the lens
physically<00:01:41.130> does<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.549> there's<00:01:41.759> multiple

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
physically does is there's multiple

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.120 
physically does is there's multiple
elements<00:01:42.720> inside<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.740> those

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
elements inside of this and those

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.490 
elements inside of this and those
elements<00:01:44.579> bring<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> light<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.720> obviously

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
elements bring the light in obviously

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.340 
elements bring the light in obviously
into<00:01:46.799> focus<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.369> direct<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.420> back<00:01:48.600> into<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
into focus and direct it back into the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.960 
into focus and direct it back into the
sensor<00:01:49.680> that's<00:01:49.979> behind<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.399> mirror<00:01:50.640> that's
