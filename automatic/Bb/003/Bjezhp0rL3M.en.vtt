think<00:00:33.360> these<00:00:33.840> things<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.500> thought<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.280> must<00:00:35.460> be

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
think these things I thought it must be

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.069 
think these things I thought it must be
some<00:00:35.820> kind<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.030> construction<00:00:36.660> site<00:00:36.899> accident

some kind of construction site accident

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.130 
some kind of construction site accident
it<00:00:37.469> felt<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.460> very<00:00:39.030> very<00:00:39.450> heavy<00:00:39.809> way<00:00:40.079> to

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
it felt like a very very heavy way to

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.720 
it felt like a very very heavy way to
skip<00:00:40.739> had<00:00:41.010> been<00:00:41.190> dropped<00:00:41.430> from<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.700> great

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
skip had been dropped from a great

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.650 
skip had been dropped from a great
height<00:00:41.940> very<00:00:42.809> near<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.320> me<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:44.660> really

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
height very near to me and really

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.630 
height very near to me and really
thought<00:00:45.870> not<00:00:46.170> much<00:00:46.410> more<00:00:46.680> than<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.430> then

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
thought not much more than that but then

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.029 
thought not much more than that but then
there<00:00:47.910> were<00:00:48.000> two<00:00:48.899> more<00:00:49.140> explosions<00:00:49.440> and

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
in dust and it was at that point that

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.950 
in dust and it was at that point that
the<00:01:29.280> authorities<00:01:29.850> decided<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> whole

of the south of Manhattan needed to be
evacuated

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
evacuated

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.770 
evacuated
now<00:01:34.740> one<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.640> things<00:01:35.880> about<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.150> second

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
now one of the things about that second

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.740 
now one of the things about that second
Syria<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.860> very<00:01:38.490> serious<00:01:38.880> explosion<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.509> big

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
Syria a very serious explosion the big

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.350 
Syria a very serious explosion the big
big<00:01:40.079> explosion<00:01:40.619> much<00:01:40.770> much<00:01:41.009> later<00:01:41.310> was<00:01:42.000> that

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
big explosion much much later was that

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.389 
big explosion much much later was that
the<00:01:42.479> emergency<00:01:43.049> services<00:01:43.590> were<00:01:43.770> already

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
the emergency services were already

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.850 
the emergency services were already
there<00:01:44.820> hundreds<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.869> ambulances<00:01:46.380> had<00:01:46.530> arrived

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
there hundreds of ambulances had arrived

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.789 
there hundreds of ambulances had arrived
at<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:48.030> stage<00:01:48.360> now<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.630> don't<00:01:48.780> know<00:01:49.229> whether

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
at that stage now I don't know whether

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.359 
at that stage now I don't know whether
an<00:01:50.009> assumption<00:01:50.430> was<00:01:50.729> made<00:01:51.060> by<00:01:51.869> everybody

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
an assumption was made by everybody

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.760 
an assumption was made by everybody
including<00:01:53.369> myself<00:01:53.820> perhaps<00:01:54.350> that<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
including myself perhaps that the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.399 
including myself perhaps that the
buildings<00:01:56.189> were<00:01:56.369> then<00:01:56.549> safe<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.960> they<00:01:58.259> then

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
buildings were then safe but they then

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.130 
buildings were then safe but they then
clearly<00:01:58.770> collapsed<00:01:59.579> and<00:02:00.299> with<00:02:00.960> what

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
clearly collapsed and with what

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.340 
clearly collapsed and with what
consequence<00:02:01.680> we<00:02:01.829> don't<00:02:02.070> know
