 mode add minutes we are with this 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.850
 super minio that only has 1 quillo and 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:33.430
 there is also the child who is 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.440
 because it was stolen and was converted into 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.860
 bad minion we also have the other 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.840
 Minion that would be the mini girl 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.239
 good only the suits have been given by 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.629
 one that if not they will not understand me 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.190
 first we have this mini that 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.930
 as they see they also make sounds are 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.540
 singing the song and also because 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.190
 laugh they are finding them in their world is 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.870
 at the same time that they will find them but 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.360
 then when they are not there will be 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.250
 quite fun to have a domain not 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.640
 there are as you see has the normal means that 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:07.630
 have an eye good eyes that says here 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.360
 what is called equal or stuart I think that 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.479
 is the one of the one eye and this one does not erase fire 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.500
 his name here we have to the one who does not 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.960
 this is kevin and this is stuart i think yes 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.970
 not bad in agreement here we have kevin and 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.000
 this later would be because you have the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.680
 little eyes here we have the mini here only 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.380
 says that this guide minion if not what 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.390
 I know it was applied surely of the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.520
 children but then I do not see it so 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.380
 Well, I do not know this girl or 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.420
 surely a child will be a dress 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.760
 girl, we also have the weak 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.970
 millions of malone girls who also 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.060
 it makes sounds and we would have jacob that 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.560
 It's a little dog that they see because they're already 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.509
 domesticated when they find it and it's already 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.540
 be domesticated as hair for 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.550
 want and we have this food as another 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.710
 community here we are 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.410
 has another community that was wanted 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.860
 the bucket like this with bolt and two 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:05.310
 sticks and this would be created with the skate or 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.320
 glycol with wheat sugar and buzz a 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.479
 bottle of water and they can eat it is 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.489
 a small meal that they will give you and 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.230
 well once you have found the 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.569
 minions then they will ask how they are 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.400
 They are going to take 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.200
 they will have to have a simple stick 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.159
 which is created with two planks shafts of 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.159
 wood and you will have to give them as you see 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.159
 domesticated 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:31.909
 from here you will see that there it would already be 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:33.200
 stopped and now I will be doing and what 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.730
 you will have to do so because 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.969
 what would be the minutes are going to have to 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.609
 give him a stick there as they see him not me 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:42.230
 He made a case there and tells me company and he's going 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:45.710
 to come with me the million just that 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.420
 then he got into 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.100
 and here is 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.560
 so they will have to give you just a click 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.560
 they will be able to do different things 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.620
 and there is already a travel mode there is no 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.360
 there is a normal plan and they are going to 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.709
 have to come with your very well they are going to 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.520
 find you are going to click with the 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.770
 Creative stick can be clicked with 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.350
 the stick and then there has not done them 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.959
 case to a line and they can give you another 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.510
 click and here says company there is like 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.120
 speak the minions there is how they talk 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.610
 and as you see by those going to be following 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.450
 can give the second another click and it will be 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.209
 world was this way like that dog no no 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.820
 I understand very well in golf but it is way or 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.470
 something like that can be accepted 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.720
 already when they tell you companies 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.459
 present and stop and then they would stay 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.390
 where you leave them as your 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.280
 already can bring it and the age of 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.010
 next click that is the world 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.610
 hope this I will give you in the next one 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.660
 is the ping pong that should be 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.660
 jumping just that like 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:07.819
 and he was not going to be raising his little hand 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.739
 as if he were happy and the other 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.329
 next would be the bread and that they are 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.519
 scared and is running online 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:16.030
 as if a disaster had happened 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:20.690
 there they give him another 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.039
 click there would be in trip mode that only 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.660
 is going to be there and every now and then 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.240
 walking then we will be stopped not 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.370
 will walk and then be there in mode 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.990
 of normal that he can do what he 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.210
 it pleases him 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.520
 you see already I can not stop to sit and 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.160
 I will not let them go and 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.889
 to be able to give things even though it's not useful 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.479
 nothing to give things because then I do not eat 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.419
 the amount just left us does not have 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.770
 for the moment one use the million of that 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.199
 can fight or can you put a 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.900
 armor as you see there has his sword and 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:53.310
 Well, I do not know how to get rid of their 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.160
 just killing him 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.690
 you do not keep your minions in one click 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.310
 who remember that from a click that is going 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.890
 to be dying his look so then 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.860
 be very careful with him because they are going 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.450
 to be killing if you give a click 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.370
 this only with a tap is going to die 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.970
 and we have stopped them and we are going to give them their 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.760
 back and we can give you anything 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.590
 The sopita transport cures 3 if you heal 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.590
 3 when you do it you are calculating 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.910
 3 pressure of little hearts and good this 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.940
 is the review of the mod 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.460
 they are going to be doing little things also 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.010
 I forgot to tell you that if you take out 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:32.310
 the minions of an eye here as you see is 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.630
 kevin here be careful you can 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.060
 take you educative if it is that 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.430
 they want to find or maybe where 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.960
 may find is this muÃ±equito 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.950
 and they will have to be very careful with the 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.100
 why 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.920
 he likes how they see they have tnt like it 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.740
 your things right now he has not said anything but 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.990
 we have to wait a few seconds and 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:06:00.330
 will see what happens there will be our 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:06:00.330
 Mr. Minion who is capable of shouting 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.190
 and he ran 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:14.140
 exploiting the things that do not leave it 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:17.530
 just do not see it in the auction because it's 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:21.480
 how to go through and in you and in you because 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.480
 he says that and like he stays there 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:28.450
 and can play there's no I'm going to kill him if 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.550
 will not destroy mexico anele but not 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.530
 have a test and you kill it there would be this 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.970
 matter this is the rage of the world 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.350
 similar its like me because if 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.820

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:54.580
 they have in the 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:56.110
 a 81.7 point 10 and 1.8 surely 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.110
 will be in the same investment path 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.360
 If it is there, they will have it in the 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.980
