00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
square knot so I'm going to do that then

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.600 
square knot so I'm going to do that then
another<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.800> ties<00:00:46.980> two<00:00:47.219> ropes<00:00:47.399> together

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
another one that ties two ropes together

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.750 
another one that ties two ropes together
it's<00:00:48.180> basically<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.200> except<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.430> wind

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
it's basically like that except you wind

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.450 
it's basically like that except you wind
one<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.660> ropes<00:00:51.870> around<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.070> other<00:00:53.190> one<00:00:53.430> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
one of the ropes around the other one a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.990 
one of the ropes around the other one a
few<00:00:53.789> times<00:00:54.530> then<00:00:55.530> at<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.920> top<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
few times then at the top you do the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.750 
few times then at the top you do the
same<00:00:57.030> thing<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.280> wrap<00:00:59.280> one<00:00:59.520> rope

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
same thing you like that wrap one rope

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.719 
same thing you like that wrap one rope
around<00:00:59.910> once<00:01:02.059> and<00:01:04.129> pull<00:01:07.130> these<00:01:08.130> are<00:01:08.340> sort<00:01:08.610> of

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
around once and pull these are sort of

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.500 
around once and pull these are sort of
different<00:01:09.060> because<00:01:09.180> there<00:01:09.360> are<00:01:09.420> two

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
different because there are two

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.240 
different because there are two
different<00:01:09.840> kinds<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.200> two<00:01:10.710> different<00:01:10.890> sizes

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
different kinds of two different sizes

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.679 
different kinds of two different sizes
of<00:01:11.549> ropes<00:01:15.950> another<00:01:16.950> not<00:01:17.640> i'll<00:01:18.030> do<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.540> this

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
of ropes another not i'll do it on this

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.410 
of ropes another not i'll do it on this
white<00:01:18.990> throat<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:20.130> really<00:01:20.460> helpful<00:01:20.759> it's

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
white throat it's really helpful it's

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.359 
white throat it's really helpful it's

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.890 

just<00:01:34.770> do<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:34.979> at<00:01:35.250> least<00:01:35.460> five<00:01:35.880> times<00:01:36.360> i<00:01:36.689> would

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
just do it at least five times i would

this and you can make it tight like that

00:01:42.350 --> 00:02:03.960 
this and you can make it tight like that
just<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.470> stop<00:01:43.829> or<00:01:44.070> not<00:01:45.409> so<00:01:46.409> i<00:01:46.439> want<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.799> do<00:01:46.890> that

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.180 

another<00:02:04.970> knot<00:02:05.270> is<00:02:05.630> i<00:02:05.990> call<00:02:06.410> it<00:02:06.440> like<00:02:06.590> a<00:02:06.710> slip

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
another knot is i call it like a slip

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.029 
another knot is i call it like a slip
loop<00:02:07.460> but<00:02:07.880> it's<00:02:08.030> called<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.509> Packers<00:02:09.140> nap<00:02:09.380> so

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
loop but it's called a Packers nap so

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.600 
loop but it's called a Packers nap so
just<00:02:10.220> take<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.640> rope<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:13.010> go<00:02:13.190> like<00:02:13.220> this

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
just take the rope and you go like this

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.110 
just take the rope and you go like this
you<00:02:14.180> put<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.510> over<00:02:14.920> then<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.040> go<00:02:16.220> under<00:02:16.550> and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
you put it over then you go under and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.830 
you put it over then you go under and
you<00:02:17.840> go<00:02:17.960> over<00:02:18.140> on<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.560> side<00:02:18.770> under<00:02:19.460> and<00:02:19.840> then

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
you go over on the side under and then

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.350 
you go over on the side under and then
you<00:02:20.990> go<00:02:21.140> through<00:02:21.530> this<00:02:21.740> hole<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:22.459> then<00:02:22.610> pull

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
you go through this hole and then pull

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.710 
you go through this hole and then pull
these<00:02:23.570> two<00:02:24.130> really<00:02:25.130> tight<00:02:25.490> and<00:02:26.240> then<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.540> can

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
these two really tight and then you can

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.740 
these two really tight and then you can
just<00:02:26.870> see<00:02:27.380> adjust<00:02:28.310> it<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.300> can<00:02:29.450> put<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:29.690> on

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
just see adjust it and you can put it on

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:39.850 
just see adjust it and you can put it on
something<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.740> tightens<00:02:31.010> up<00:02:36.730> yeah<00:02:38.860> and

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
something and it tightens up yeah and

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.760 
something and it tightens up yeah and
then<00:02:39.980> another<00:02:40.310> one<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:43.780> if<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:45.020> if<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.590> don't

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
then another one is if you if you don't

tight then i have a stick here i'm going

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.949 
tight then i have a stick here i'm going
to<00:02:59.150> do<00:02:59.360> some<00:02:59.390> that<00:02:59.900> ties<00:03:00.230> them<00:03:00.770> to<00:03:00.980> trees<00:03:01.959> now

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
to do some that ties them to trees now

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.110 
to do some that ties them to trees now
one<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:03.530> just<00:03:03.560> got<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.070> two<00:03:04.280> ends<00:03:04.880> together

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
one you just got the two ends together

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.440 
one you just got the two ends together
like<00:03:05.600> this<00:03:06.070> you<00:03:07.070> bring<00:03:07.310> it<00:03:07.459> under<00:03:07.970> or<00:03:08.330> you

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
like this you bring it under or you

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.479 
like this you bring it under or you
could<00:03:08.660> do<00:03:08.810> it<00:03:08.930> over<00:03:09.049> I<00:03:09.230> guess<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:10.130> then<00:03:10.370> you

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
could do it over I guess and then you

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.340 
could do it over I guess and then you
put<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:10.730> through<00:03:12.250> like<00:03:13.250> that<00:03:13.900> let's<00:03:14.900> call<00:03:15.140> it<00:03:15.260> a

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
put it through like that let's call it a

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.710 
put it through like that let's call it a
large<00:03:15.650> tab<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:16.790> then<00:03:16.910> you<00:03:17.269> can<00:03:17.420> just<00:03:17.540> do

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
large tab and then you can just do

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.250 
large tab and then you can just do
whatever<00:03:17.810> you<00:03:18.140> want<00:03:18.350> down<00:03:18.590> here<00:03:20.049> do<00:03:21.049> whatever

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
whatever you want down here do whatever

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.580 
whatever you want down here do whatever
you<00:03:21.500> want<00:03:22.660> then<00:03:23.660> another<00:03:23.900> one<00:03:24.110> too<00:03:24.350> attached

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
you want then another one too attached

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.949 
you want then another one too attached
to<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:25.040> pole<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.700> come<00:03:26.000> like<00:03:26.390> this<00:03:26.420> with<00:03:26.810> the

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
to the pole you come like this with the

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.640 
to the pole you come like this with the
rope<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:28.250> go<00:03:28.459> around<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:29.060> back<00:03:29.299> to<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:31.239> front

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
rope you go around the back to the front

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.570 
rope you go around the back to the front
up<00:03:33.650> around<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.810> then<00:03:36.519> behind<00:03:37.519> it<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.900> pull<00:03:39.320> it

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
up around and then behind it and pull it

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.830 
up around and then behind it and pull it
doesn't<00:03:40.580> look<00:03:40.670> like<00:03:40.730> too<00:03:40.970> much<00:03:41.360> but<00:03:41.720> it's

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
doesn't look like too much but it's

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.250 
doesn't look like too much but it's
really<00:03:42.200> really<00:03:43.690> tight<00:03:44.690> you<00:03:44.870> can't<00:03:45.200> get<00:03:45.590> it

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
really really tight you can't get it

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.509 
really really tight you can't get it
then<00:03:48.260> if<00:03:48.380> you<00:03:48.530> want<00:03:48.709> you<00:03:48.799> could<00:03:48.980> put<00:03:49.160> a<00:03:49.190> pretzel

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
then if you want you could put a pretzel

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.310 
then if you want you could put a pretzel
knot<00:03:49.850> or<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.209> stopper<00:03:50.630> knot<00:03:50.780> right<00:03:50.959> at<00:03:51.170> the

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
knot or the stopper knot right at the

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.660 
knot or the stopper knot right at the
end<00:03:51.470> just<00:03:51.739> to<00:03:51.829> make<00:03:52.010> sure<00:03:52.040> it<00:03:52.310> won't<00:03:52.489> come

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
end just to make sure it won't come

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.870 
end just to make sure it won't come
undone<00:03:53.049> then<00:03:54.049> another<00:03:54.350> one<00:03:54.620> I<00:03:54.680> like<00:03:55.070> with<00:03:55.760> the

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
undone then another one I like with the

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.600 
undone then another one I like with the
pole<00:03:56.120> or<00:03:56.360> hanging<00:03:57.019> from<00:03:57.230> a<00:03:57.350> branch<00:03:57.530> just<00:03:58.340> come

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
pole or hanging from a branch just come

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.060 
pole or hanging from a branch just come
like<00:03:58.640> this<00:03:58.790> go<00:03:59.180> from<00:03:59.390> behind<00:03:59.890> you<00:04:00.890> go

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
like this go from behind you go

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.789 
like this go from behind you go
underneath<00:04:02.860> over<00:04:04.299> and<00:04:05.299> through<00:04:05.799> then

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
underneath over and through then

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.479 
underneath over and through then
underneath<00:04:07.250> over<00:04:08.180> and<00:04:08.329> through<00:04:09.459> and<00:04:10.459> just

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
underneath over and through and just

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.990 
underneath over and through and just
pull<00:04:11.269> and<00:04:11.540> then<00:04:11.570> that's<00:04:12.109> another<00:04:12.230> type

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
pull and then that's another type

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:22.100 
pull and then that's another type
once<00:04:13.300> it<00:04:13.480> gets<00:04:13.660> tight<00:04:14.430> for<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.550> pole<00:04:19.590> in<00:04:20.940> that

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
once it gets tight for the pole in that

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.620 
once it gets tight for the pole in that
there's<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.740> figure<00:04:24.190> eight<00:04:24.430> knot<00:04:24.570> for<00:04:25.570> you

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
there's the figure eight knot for you

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:33.950 
there's the figure eight knot for you
just<00:04:25.810> go<00:04:25.990> around<00:04:27.630> you<00:04:28.630> come<00:04:28.870> under<00:04:30.540> like<00:04:31.540> this

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
just go around you come under like this

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.360 
just go around you come under like this
then<00:04:34.960> you<00:04:35.110> go<00:04:35.320> over<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:36.990> under<00:04:38.010> then<00:04:39.010> it's

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
then you go over and under then it's

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.530 
then you go over and under then it's
just<00:04:39.490> like<00:04:40.060> a<00:04:40.090> mini<00:04:40.210> eight<00:04:42.120> then<00:04:43.120> I'll<00:04:43.270> show

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
just like a mini eight then I'll show

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:50.090 
just like a mini eight then I'll show
you<00:04:43.600> a<00:04:43.780> loop<00:04:44.410> in<00:04:44.820> a<00:04:45.820> second<00:04:46.330> that<00:04:47.610> is<00:04:48.610> tight<00:04:49.180> so

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
you a loop in a second that is tight so

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.409 
you a loop in a second that is tight so
you<00:04:51.100> get<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.520> rope<00:04:53.250> just<00:04:54.250> wait<00:04:55.590> get<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:56.770> rope

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
you get the rope just wait get the rope

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:03.230 
you get the rope just wait get the rope
make<00:04:58.419> a<00:04:59.460> tiny<00:05:00.460> loop<00:05:00.910> like<00:05:01.690> this<00:05:01.720> you<00:05:02.410> go<00:05:02.590> over

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
make a tiny loop like this you go over

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:11.990 
make a tiny loop like this you go over
then<00:05:04.240> you<00:05:04.360> come<00:05:07.620> go<00:05:08.620> through<00:05:09.100> the<00:05:09.310> loop<00:05:10.470> come

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
then you come go through the loop come

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.060 
then you come go through the loop come
under<00:05:14.190> over<00:05:15.190> and<00:05:15.520> then<00:05:15.669> do<00:05:16.510> the<00:05:16.660> whole<00:05:17.070> then

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
under over and then do the whole then

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.140 
under over and then do the whole then
you<00:05:18.640> just<00:05:19.000> go<00:05:19.180> like<00:05:19.210> this<00:05:20.490> then<00:05:21.490> you<00:05:21.669> can<00:05:21.880> put

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
you just go like this then you can put

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:29.880 
you just go like this then you can put
it<00:05:22.270> however<00:05:22.479> big<00:05:22.960> you<00:05:22.990> want<00:05:28.530> when<00:05:29.530> you<00:05:29.560> tighten

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
it however big you want when you tighten

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.100 
it however big you want when you tighten
it<00:05:30.100> and<00:05:30.220> this<00:05:30.580> is<00:05:30.760> not<00:05:30.910> a<00:05:30.970> slip<00:05:31.360> loop<00:05:31.630> it's<00:05:31.930> just

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
it and this is not a slip loop it's just

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:38.430 
it and this is not a slip loop it's just
a<00:05:33.210> loop<00:05:34.210> like<00:05:34.240> that<00:05:36.479> gonna<00:05:37.479> try<00:05:37.960> to<00:05:38.020> get<00:05:38.260> the

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
a loop like that gonna try to get the

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.999 
a loop like that gonna try to get the
sound<00:05:38.650> dog<00:05:39.240> for<00:05:40.240> you<00:05:40.390> guys

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:45.009 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:49.659 

and<00:05:46.009> another<00:05:46.340> one<00:05:46.580> too<00:05:46.819> I<00:05:47.030> to<00:05:47.539> a<00:05:47.569> pole<00:05:48.430> you<00:05:49.430> get

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
and another one too I to a pole you get

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:58.839 
and another one too I to a pole you get
the<00:05:49.909> stick<00:05:53.979> and<00:05:54.979> then<00:05:56.949> this<00:05:57.949> is<00:05:58.129> a<00:05:58.159> nice<00:05:58.430> one<00:05:58.610> to

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:58.849 
the stick and then this is a nice one to

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:07.710 
the stick and then this is a nice one to
pull<00:05:59.240> stuff<00:05:59.659> you<00:06:00.560> come<00:06:02.979> around<00:06:04.659> you<00:06:05.659> go<00:06:05.870> under

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
pull stuff you come around you go under

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:16.800 
pull stuff you come around you go under
and<00:06:08.720> then<00:06:08.840> you<00:06:08.960> make<00:06:09.139> a<00:06:09.169> loop<00:06:09.530> again<00:06:15.370> like<00:06:16.370> that

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
and then you make a loop again like that

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.709 
and then you make a loop again like that
then<00:06:17.810> you<00:06:17.840> make<00:06:18.259> another<00:06:18.289> loop<00:06:19.330> I'll<00:06:20.330> just

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:20.719 
then you make another loop I'll just

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:25.119 
then you make another loop I'll just
wait<00:06:22.960> this<00:06:23.960> one's<00:06:24.199> supposed<00:06:24.469> to<00:06:24.650> obey<00:06:24.860> the

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:25.129 
wait this one's supposed to obey the

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:26.920 
wait this one's supposed to obey the
poles<00:06:25.430> up<00:06:25.699> right<00:06:26.060> that's<00:06:26.300> how<00:06:26.449> it's<00:06:26.629> supposed

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
poles up right that's how it's supposed

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.360 
poles up right that's how it's supposed
to<00:06:27.020> be<00:06:27.639> okay<00:06:28.639> so<00:06:28.699> you<00:06:28.849> come<00:06:29.090> like<00:06:29.270> this<00:06:30.159> you<00:06:31.159> go

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
to be okay so you come like this you go

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:39.070 
to be okay so you come like this you go
over<00:06:35.169> then<00:06:36.169> you<00:06:36.469> go<00:06:36.650> under<00:06:37.009> and<00:06:38.050> then<00:06:39.050> over

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
over then you go under and then over

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.839 
over then you go under and then over
this<00:06:39.969> then<00:06:40.969> do<00:06:41.210> another<00:06:41.330> one<00:06:42.520> it's<00:06:43.520> pretty

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:43.849 
this then do another one it's pretty

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:49.059 
this then do another one it's pretty
much<00:06:44.060> like<00:06:44.360> that<00:06:44.900> other<00:06:45.199> not<00:06:47.319> then<00:06:48.319> you<00:06:48.800> pull

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:49.069 
much like that other not then you pull

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:51.309 
much like that other not then you pull
it<00:06:49.190> tight<00:06:49.400> it's<00:06:50.210> pretty<00:06:50.449> much<00:06:50.599> like<00:06:50.659> that<00:06:51.080> one
