00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.000 
it really sticks to your skin really
nicely<00:02:07.550> I<00:02:08.060> should<00:02:08.390> have<00:02:08.480> gone<00:02:08.660> with<00:02:08.990> a<00:02:09.350> darker

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.220 
nicely I should have gone with a darker
shade<00:02:10.220> cuz<00:02:10.460> I<00:02:10.490> have<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.700> tan<00:02:11.030> now<00:02:11.270> but<00:02:11.960> this

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
it is 7:25 so it's pretty early I'm

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.850 
it is 7:25 so it's pretty early I'm
gonna<00:02:35.690> go<00:02:35.810> ahead<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.050> do<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.290> rest<00:02:36.320> of<00:02:36.680> my

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
gonna go ahead and do the rest of my

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:45.310 
gonna go ahead and do the rest of my
face<00:02:37.130> just<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:44.420> see<00:02:44.600> a<00:02:44.630> difference<00:02:45.020> I'm<00:02:45.170> going

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
face just to see a difference I'm going

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.470 
face just to see a difference I'm going
to<00:02:45.380> use<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.650> number<00:02:45.950> 56<00:02:46.520> Sephora<00:02:46.940> airbrush

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
to use the number 56 Sephora airbrush

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.080 
to use the number 56 Sephora airbrush
foundation<00:02:47.690> brush<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:49.370> see<00:02:49.930> how<00:02:50.930> this<00:02:51.260> blends

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
foundation brush to see how this blends

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.720 
foundation brush to see how this blends
so<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.480> blends<00:02:53.870> pretty<00:02:54.170> nicely<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.920> I<00:02:55.880> think

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
so it blends pretty nicely and I think

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.479 
so it blends pretty nicely and I think
that<00:02:58.730> that<00:02:59.090> is<00:02:59.390> my<00:02:59.780> desired<00:03:00.290> coverage<00:03:00.770> that

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
that that is my desired coverage that

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.220 
that that is my desired coverage that

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680

review where I actually went and worked

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.470 
review where I actually went and worked
out<00:04:50.740> if<00:04:51.070> they<00:04:51.160> get<00:04:51.310> a<00:04:51.340> little<00:04:51.580> oily<00:04:51.940> here<00:04:52.300> in

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
out if they get a little oily here in

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.220 
out if they get a little oily here in
this<00:04:52.750> area<00:04:52.960> but<00:04:54.300> overall<00:04:55.300> though<00:04:55.600> I<00:04:55.870> think

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
this area but overall though I think

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.580 
this area but overall though I think
it's<00:04:56.410> pretty<00:04:56.920> good<00:04:57.280> I<00:04:57.340> mean<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:57.880> did<00:04:58.060> stick

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
it's pretty good I mean it did stick

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.870 
it's pretty good I mean it did stick
throughout<00:04:59.590> the<00:04:59.740> day<00:04:59.950> and<00:05:00.190> I<00:05:00.340> haven't<00:05:00.580> put

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.120 
throughout the day and I haven't put
powder<00:05:01.120> I<00:05:01.300> haven't<00:05:01.810> put<00:05:02.080> any<00:05:02.350> more<00:05:02.590> foundation

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
powder I haven't put any more foundation

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.580 
powder I haven't put any more foundation
or<00:05:03.250> concealer<00:05:03.370> on<00:05:03.910> a<00:05:04.180> couple<00:05:04.840> of<00:05:04.960> areas<00:05:05.200> have

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
or concealer on a couple of areas have

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.800 
or concealer on a couple of areas have
rubbed<00:05:05.950> off<00:05:06.160> a<00:05:06.190> guess<00:05:06.520> which<00:05:07.240> is<00:05:07.270> like<00:05:07.630> a

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
rubbed off a guess which is like a

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.600 
rubbed off a guess which is like a
couple<00:05:08.140> pimples<00:05:08.560> there<00:05:08.800> there's<00:05:09.130> a<00:05:09.190> pimple

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
couple pimples there there's a pimple

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.080 
couple pimples there there's a pimple
that's<00:05:09.730> coming<00:05:10.030> out<00:05:10.150> here<00:05:10.770> and<00:05:11.770> other<00:05:12.700> pimples

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
that's coming out here and other pimples

that's coming out here and other pimples
that<00:05:13.120> I<00:05:13.210> already<00:05:13.390> had<00:05:13.750> but<00:05:14.350> I<00:05:14.380> think<00:05:14.710> overall

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
that I already had but I think overall

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.090 
that I already had but I think overall
it<00:05:15.610> really<00:05:16.480> stayed<00:05:16.780> on<00:05:16.990> my<00:05:17.170> skin<00:05:17.530> pretty<00:05:17.560> well

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
it really stayed on my skin pretty well

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.610 
it really stayed on my skin pretty well
there's<00:05:18.460> not<00:05:18.610> a<00:05:18.640> lot<00:05:18.790> of<00:05:18.820> information<00:05:19.420> online

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
there's not a lot of information online

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.650 
there's not a lot of information online
since<00:05:20.620> it's<00:05:21.040> really<00:05:21.490> new<00:05:21.760> to<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.120> u.s.<00:05:22.390> I<00:05:22.600> know

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
since it's really new to the u.s. I know

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.140 
since it's really new to the u.s. I know
that<00:05:22.870> it<00:05:22.960> came<00:05:23.170> out<00:05:23.320> in<00:05:23.590> Australia<00:05:23.890> and<00:05:24.820> the<00:05:25.000> UK

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
that it came out in Australia and the UK

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.000 
that it came out in Australia and the UK
but<00:05:25.450> the<00:05:25.810> packaging<00:05:26.230> is<00:05:26.350> a<00:05:26.410> little<00:05:26.620> different

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
but the packaging is a little different

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.200 
but the packaging is a little different
it<00:05:27.310> does<00:05:27.550> have<00:05:27.760> a<00:05:28.060> weird<00:05:28.330> scent<00:05:29.460> for<00:05:30.460> sure<00:05:30.670> the

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
it does have a weird scent for sure the

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.780 
it does have a weird scent for sure the
concealer<00:05:31.780> I<00:05:31.930> really<00:05:32.320> really<00:05:32.560> loved<00:05:32.830> I<00:05:33.130> feel

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
concealer I really really loved I feel

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.790 
concealer I really really loved I feel
like<00:05:34.060> the<00:05:34.300> coverage<00:05:34.600> is<00:05:34.780> really<00:05:35.020> nice<00:05:35.260> it's

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
like the coverage is really nice it's

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.439 
like the coverage is really nice it's
also<00:05:36.010> moosie<00:05:36.640> and<00:05:36.880> I<00:05:37.210> would

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:37.449 
also moosie and I would

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:39.149 
also moosie and I would
probably<00:05:37.809> say<00:05:38.020> this<00:05:38.229> is<00:05:38.379> not<00:05:38.559> a<00:05:38.800> good

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
probably say this is not a good

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:41.760 
probably say this is not a good
foundation<00:05:39.699> for<00:05:39.729> oily<00:05:40.120> skin<00:05:40.330> because<00:05:41.020> you<00:05:41.620> do

skin<00:06:09.879> and<00:06:09.909> how<00:06:10.330> it<00:06:10.360> blended<00:06:11.020> really<00:06:11.319> nicely<00:06:11.680> so

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
skin and how it blended really nicely so

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.459 
skin and how it blended really nicely so
I<00:06:12.490> do<00:06:12.639> like<00:06:13.060> that<00:06:13.270> about<00:06:13.449> the<00:06:13.629> foundation<00:06:14.259> I

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:14.469 
I do like that about the foundation I

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:17.100 
I do like that about the foundation I
wasn't<00:06:14.830> going<00:06:15.189> to<00:06:15.219> work<00:06:15.789> out<00:06:16.089> but<00:06:16.389> I<00:06:16.659> kind<00:06:17.020> of

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
wasn't going to work out but I kind of

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.320 
wasn't going to work out but I kind of
just<00:06:17.169> had<00:06:17.499> to<00:06:17.710> go<00:06:17.860> work<00:06:18.039> out<00:06:18.159> and<00:06:18.460> it's<00:06:18.999> kind<00:06:19.180> of

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
just had to go work out and it's kind of

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.450 
just had to go work out and it's kind of
hard<00:06:19.479> to<00:06:19.539> do<00:06:19.839> these<00:06:19.960> videos<00:06:20.199> where<00:06:20.770> you<00:06:21.129> start

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
hard to do these videos where you start

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.950 
hard to do these videos where you start
from<00:06:21.520> the<00:06:22.120> morning<00:06:22.569> all<00:06:22.689> the<00:06:22.719> way<00:06:22.839> to

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
from the morning all the way to

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.079 
from the morning all the way to
nighttime<00:06:23.289> they<00:06:23.710> do<00:06:23.830> apologize<00:06:24.310> but<00:06:24.789> I<00:06:24.849> guess

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:25.089 
nighttime they do apologize but I guess

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:26.969 
nighttime they do apologize but I guess
it's<00:06:25.389> good<00:06:25.689> to<00:06:26.050> put<00:06:26.199> the<00:06:26.319> foundation<00:06:26.439> to<00:06:26.860> the

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
it's good to put the foundation to the

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:28.800 
it's good to put the foundation to the
test<00:06:27.219> to<00:06:27.430> see<00:06:27.460> if<00:06:27.639> it<00:06:27.969> works<00:06:28.180> even<00:06:28.539> if<00:06:28.659> you're

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
test to see if it works even if you're

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.679 
test to see if it works even if you're
working<00:06:29.169> out<00:06:29.439> so<00:06:29.939> whatever<00:06:30.939> hope<00:06:31.360> you<00:06:31.539> guys
