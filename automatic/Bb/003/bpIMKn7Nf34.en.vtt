Halva Farsala

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.600
1 cup vegetable oil

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.480
2 cups corn flour

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.740
3 cups sugar

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.620
4 cups water

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.120
Mix the corn flour, water and vegetable oil until dissolved

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.180
Caramelize the sugar, stirring constantly to avoid burning

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.820
Sugar is ready just getting dark

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.680
When prepared pour the dissolved mixture

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.840
Because the mixture is cold the caramelized sugar will tighten, so stir over medium heat until liquid

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.640
If you want you can use almond or walnut

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.940
Stir until thick and ready

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.900
Spread in pan with greaseproof paper

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.460
Leave to cool and ready

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.640
Good luck
