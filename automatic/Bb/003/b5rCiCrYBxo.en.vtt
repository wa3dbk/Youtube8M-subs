00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
actually does not have a DVD player
which<00:04:53.990> is<00:04:54.140> a<00:04:54.169> big<00:04:55.160> with<00:04:55.580> me<00:04:55.930> also<00:04:56.930> you<00:04:57.140> do<00:04:57.560> have

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
which is a big with me also you do have

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.650 
which is a big with me also you do have
rear<00:04:57.919> see<00:04:58.100> audio<00:04:58.520> though<00:04:58.820> but<00:04:59.150> you<00:04:59.240> don't<00:04:59.450> have

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
rear see audio though but you don't have

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.590 
rear see audio though but you don't have
a<00:04:59.960> rear<00:05:00.890> seat<00:05:01.160> DVD<00:05:01.190> so<00:05:02.120> that's<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.419> big

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
a rear seat DVD so that's the big

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.750 
a rear seat DVD so that's the big
difference<00:05:02.930> between<00:05:02.960> the<00:05:03.350> two<00:05:03.550> if<00:05:04.550> you<00:05:04.669> look

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
difference between the two if you look

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.940 
difference between the two if you look
at<00:05:04.880> everything<00:05:05.090> else<00:05:05.330> so<00:05:05.660> it<00:05:05.870> is<00:05:06.350> pretty<00:05:06.860> much

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
at everything else so it is pretty much

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:13.390 
at everything else so it is pretty much
similar<00:05:09.940> but<00:05:11.020> in<00:05:12.020> my<00:05:12.290> opinion<00:05:12.410> the<00:05:12.830> DVD<00:05:13.160> player

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
similar but in my opinion the DVD player

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.500 
similar but in my opinion the DVD player
is<00:05:13.550> a<00:05:13.580> must<00:05:14.200> but<00:05:15.200> this<00:05:15.350> one<00:05:15.530> has<00:05:16.190> around<00:05:16.520> 46,000

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
is a must but this one has around 46,000

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.250 
is a must but this one has around 46,000
miles<00:05:17.660> on<00:05:17.900> it<00:05:17.930> the<00:05:18.080> other<00:05:18.110> one<00:05:18.320> has<00:05:18.440> around<00:05:18.680> 43

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
miles on it the other one has around 43

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.950 
miles on it the other one has around 43
