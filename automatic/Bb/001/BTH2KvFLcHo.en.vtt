00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.370 

and<00:00:00.120> today<00:00:00.390> we're<00:00:00.570> going<00:00:00.690> to<00:00:00.960> do<00:00:01.110> our

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:01.380 
and today we're going to do our

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.350 
and today we're going to do our
practical<00:00:01.979> evaluation<00:00:02.550> for<00:00:02.760> the<00:00:02.850> cerebellum

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
practical evaluation for the cerebellum

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.700 
practical evaluation for the cerebellum
the<00:00:03.389> cerebellum<00:00:03.510> is<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.110> part<00:00:04.319> of<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.470> brain

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
the cerebellum is the part of the brain

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.769 
the cerebellum is the part of the brain
in<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.460> back<00:00:05.730> that<00:00:06.029> coordinates<00:00:06.629> our

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
in the back that coordinates our

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.089 
in the back that coordinates our
movement<00:00:07.200> without<00:00:07.440> our<00:00:07.560> ever<00:00:07.680> having<00:00:07.950> to

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
movement without our ever having to

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:08.839 
movement without our ever having to
think<00:00:08.250> about<00:00:08.400> it

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
think about it

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.509 
think about it
so<00:00:09.210> we've<00:00:09.389> bent<00:00:09.540> over<00:00:09.719> entire<00:00:10.139> shoes<00:00:10.530> we<00:00:11.370> don't

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
so we've bent over entire shoes we don't

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.089 
so we've bent over entire shoes we don't
think<00:00:11.670> about<00:00:11.820> our<00:00:12.090> back<00:00:12.389> muscles<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:13.139> people

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
think about our back muscles and people

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.310 
think about our back muscles and people
who<00:00:14.250> have<00:00:14.639> problems<00:00:15.360> with<00:00:15.630> their<00:00:15.719> cerebellum

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
who have problems with their cerebellum

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.689 
who have problems with their cerebellum
they<00:00:16.470> know<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.859> they<00:00:16.980> have<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.340> think<00:00:17.580> about

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
they know that they have to think about

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.370 
they know that they have to think about
all<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.119> movements<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.720> they<00:00:18.840> do<00:00:18.900> they<00:00:19.230> have

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
all the movements that they do they have

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.630 
all the movements that they do they have
to<00:00:19.500> really<00:00:20.720> be<00:00:21.720> more<00:00:21.900> conscious<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.800> and

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
to really be more conscious of that and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.040 
to really be more conscious of that and
that's<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.910> sign<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.119> there's<00:00:24.449> our<00:00:24.600> bones<00:00:24.779> not

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
that's a sign that there's our bones not

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.439 
that's a sign that there's our bones not
working<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:26.029> let's<00:00:27.029> run<00:00:27.210> through<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
working so let's run through the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.029 
working so let's run through the
practical<00:00:27.779> examination<00:00:28.470> these<00:00:28.650> are<00:00:28.769> tests

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
practical examination these are tests

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.700 
practical examination these are tests
that<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.279> can<00:00:29.429> do<00:00:29.550> at<00:00:29.699> home<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:30.710> evaluate

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
that you can do at home to evaluate

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.350 
that you can do at home to evaluate
whether<00:00:31.890> your<00:00:32.219> cerebellum<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.850> working<00:00:33.149> for

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
whether your cerebellum is working for

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.630 
whether your cerebellum is working for
you<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.290> first<00:00:34.350> test<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.860> do<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.250> put<00:00:35.550> our

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
you so the first test we do is put our

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.240 
you so the first test we do is put our
feet<00:00:35.910> together<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.770> then<00:00:37.770> close<00:00:37.980> our<00:00:38.129> eyes

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
feet together and then close our eyes

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.139 
feet together and then close our eyes
and<00:00:38.730> we're<00:00:39.000> looking<00:00:39.329> for<00:00:40.670> swaying<00:00:41.670> or

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
and we're looking for swaying or

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.100 
and we're looking for swaying or
something<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.930> some<00:00:43.280> on<00:00:44.280> coordination

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
something like that some on coordination

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.569 
something like that some on coordination
from<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.350> position<00:00:46.739> we<00:00:46.860> bring<00:00:47.010> our<00:00:47.129> arms<00:00:47.430> up

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
from this position we bring our arms up

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.900 
from this position we bring our arms up
in<00:00:47.730> front<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.059> us<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.420> we're<00:00:49.020> looking<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.910> any

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
in front of us and we're looking for any

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.049 
in front of us and we're looking for any
deviation<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.289> if<00:00:52.379> they<00:00:52.500> come<00:00:52.710> up<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.129> there

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
deviation so if they come up in there

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.639 
deviation so if they come up in there
like<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.750> know<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
like this we know that that the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.380 
like this we know that that the
cerebellum<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.280> probably<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:56.820> coordinating

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
cerebellum is probably not coordinating

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.439 
cerebellum is probably not coordinating
well<00:00:58.430> from<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.609> position<00:00:59.820> we<00:01:00.180> use<00:01:00.329> our

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
well from this position we use our

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.420 
well from this position we use our
pinkies<00:01:00.899> again<00:01:01.289> with<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> eyes<00:01:01.620> closed<00:01:02.010> and

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
pinkies again with the eyes closed and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.649 
pinkies again with the eyes closed and
we<00:01:02.789> take<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.480> pinky<00:01:03.840> into<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.229> nose<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:06.479> it's

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
we take the pinky into the nose and it's

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.070 
we take the pinky into the nose and it's
a<00:01:06.780> tip<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.170> tip<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.650> like<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:09.630> tip<00:01:09.900> to

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
a tip to tip just like that and tip to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.130 
a tip to tip just like that and tip to
tip<00:01:10.229> on<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.560> other<00:01:10.590> side<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:12.869> there's<00:01:13.080> a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
tip on the other side and if there's a

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.289 
tip on the other side and if there's a
problem<00:01:13.409> with<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> cerebellum<00:01:14.460> we'll<00:01:14.970> notice

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
problem with the cerebellum we'll notice

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.429 
problem with the cerebellum we'll notice
things<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.170> you'll<00:01:16.259> need<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
things like this and you'll need a

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.429 
things like this and you'll need a
somebody<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.460> watch<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:18.110> they'll<00:01:19.110> come<00:01:19.290> in

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
somebody to watch you they'll come in

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.810 
somebody to watch you they'll come in
and<00:01:19.619> they'll<00:01:19.770> be<00:01:21.259> shaky<00:01:22.259> or<00:01:24.439> inaccurate

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
and they'll be shaky or inaccurate

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.940 
and they'll be shaky or inaccurate
depending<00:01:26.820> upon<00:01:26.990> then<00:01:27.990> we<00:01:28.140> open<00:01:28.350> our<00:01:28.439> eyes<00:01:28.470> and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
depending upon then we open our eyes and

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.069 
depending upon then we open our eyes and
now<00:01:29.189> with<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> index<00:01:29.790> fingers<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
now with the index fingers in the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.109 
now with the index fingers in the
examination<00:01:31.680> you'll<00:01:31.829> have<00:01:31.979> somebody<00:01:32.189> put<00:01:33.090> a

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
examination you'll have somebody put a

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.590 
examination you'll have somebody put a
finger<00:01:33.360> out<00:01:33.659> here<00:01:34.909> or<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.090> could<00:01:36.210> use<00:01:36.390> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
finger out here or you could use a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.060 
finger out here or you could use a
target<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.200> wall<00:01:37.409> or<00:01:37.650> something<00:01:37.799> like

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
target on the wall or something like

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.760 
target on the wall or something like
that<00:01:38.390> but<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.540> bring<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.810> index<00:01:40.200> finger<00:01:40.530> into

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
that but you bring the index finger into

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.870 
that but you bring the index finger into
the<00:01:41.130> nose<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.960> then<00:01:43.110> out<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.880> other

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the nose and then out to the other

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.499 
the nose and then out to the other
person's<00:01:45.210> finger<00:01:45.950> into<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> nose<00:01:47.250> up<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.420> you

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
person's finger into the nose up and you

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.539 
person's finger into the nose up and you
can<00:01:48.630> watch<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.259> watch<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:50.189> you'll<00:01:50.340> see

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
can watch you can watch and you'll see

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:58.410 
can watch you can watch and you'll see
things<00:01:50.820> like<00:01:53.000> little<00:01:54.000> shakes<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.770> misses

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.500 

and<00:01:58.570> for<00:01:58.870> the<00:01:58.960> cerebellum<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.910> side<00:02:00.910> that<00:02:01.240> has

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
and for the cerebellum the side that has

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.120 
and for the cerebellum the side that has
the<00:02:01.990> greatest<00:02:02.110> trouble<00:02:02.470> is<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.920> site<00:02:03.100> where

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
the greatest trouble is the site where

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.820 
the greatest trouble is the site where
the<00:02:03.460> cerebellum<00:02:03.940> is<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.210> weakest<00:02:04.540> or<00:02:04.830> sickest

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
the cerebellum is the weakest or sickest

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.520 
the cerebellum is the weakest or sickest
or<00:02:07.649> whatever<00:02:08.649> we<00:02:08.830> might<00:02:08.950> call<00:02:09.160> it<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:11.200> next

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
or whatever we might call it the next

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.910 
or whatever we might call it the next
test<00:02:11.740> we<00:02:12.460> do<00:02:12.610> is<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.420> look<00:02:13.600> at<00:02:13.920> alternative

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
test we do is to look at alternative

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.060 
test we do is to look at alternative
movements<00:02:15.370> so<00:02:15.820> we<00:02:16.510> can<00:02:16.660> do<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.200> fingers<00:02:17.620> like

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
movements so we can do the fingers like

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.310 
movements so we can do the fingers like
playing<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.430> piano<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.930> we're<00:02:20.080> just<00:02:20.170> looking

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
playing the piano and we're just looking

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.040 
playing the piano and we're just looking
for<00:02:20.560> on<00:02:20.770> coordination<00:02:21.400> on<00:02:21.490> one<00:02:21.670> side<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.870> we

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
for on coordination on one side and we

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.870 
for on coordination on one side and we
use<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.400> wrists<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.459> you<00:02:24.580> have<00:02:24.700> somebody

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
use the wrists and you have somebody

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.910 
use the wrists and you have somebody
just<00:02:25.180> watch<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.720> if<00:02:26.380> one<00:02:26.560> hand<00:02:26.770> is

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
just watch you and if one hand is

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.010 
just watch you and if one hand is
flopping<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.970> one<00:02:28.209> hand<00:02:28.390> is<00:02:28.480> going<00:02:28.660> like<00:02:28.870> this

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
flopping and one hand is going like this

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.400 
flopping and one hand is going like this
and<00:02:29.260> this<00:02:29.380> end<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.709> going<00:02:30.520> slower<00:02:31.260> that's<00:02:32.260> a

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
and this end is going slower that's a

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.699 
and this end is going slower that's a
failure<00:02:32.650> of<00:02:33.240> that<00:02:34.240> coordination<00:02:34.690> system<00:02:35.020> and

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
failure of that coordination system and

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.699 
failure of that coordination system and
then<00:02:35.830> we<00:02:35.920> bring<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.190> arms<00:02:36.430> in<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.810> we<00:02:38.020> flop

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
then we bring the arms in and we flop

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.580 
then we bring the arms in and we flop
them<00:02:38.860> like<00:02:39.220> this<00:02:39.370> we<00:02:39.580> wave<00:02:39.730> goodbye<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.590> we're

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
them like this we wave goodbye and we're

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.120 
them like this we wave goodbye and we're
looking<00:02:41.860> again<00:02:41.950> for<00:02:42.340> one<00:02:42.610> side<00:02:42.850> that's<00:02:43.150> not

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
looking again for one side that's not

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.940 
looking again for one side that's not
coordinated<00:02:45.130> coordinating<00:02:46.060> effectively<00:02:46.950> so

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
coordinated coordinating effectively so

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.110 
coordinated coordinating effectively so
that's<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.780> home-based<00:02:49.780> test<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.910> real

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
that's the home-based test and the real

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.640 
that's the home-based test and the real
test<00:02:52.390> that<00:02:52.570> we<00:02:52.660> use<00:02:52.690> in<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.080> office<00:02:53.230> and

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
test that we use in the office and

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.870 
test that we use in the office and
there's<00:02:53.770> some<00:02:53.920> more<00:02:53.950> advanced<00:02:54.430> tests<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:54.760> we

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
there's some more advanced tests that we

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.370 
there's some more advanced tests that we
look<00:02:55.060> at<00:02:55.239> that<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:55.450> have<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.870> observe<00:02:56.140> your<00:02:56.380> eyes

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
look at that I have to observe your eyes

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.620 
look at that I have to observe your eyes
you<00:02:59.430> have<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.459> clinical<00:03:00.880> observation<00:03:01.480> of

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
you have a clinical observation of

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.449 
you have a clinical observation of
what's<00:03:01.810> going<00:03:02.050> on<00:03:02.200> there<00:03:02.440> but<00:03:02.650> those<00:03:03.160> tests

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
what's going on there but those tests

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.240 
what's going on there but those tests
you<00:03:03.519> can<00:03:03.700> do<00:03:03.910> at<00:03:04.030> home<00:03:04.060> you<00:03:04.450> can<00:03:04.630> see<00:03:05.250> pretty

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
you can do at home you can see pretty

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.030 
you can do at home you can see pretty
obviously<00:03:06.959> if<00:03:07.959> something<00:03:08.230> is<00:03:08.470> going<00:03:08.620> on<00:03:08.769> or

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
obviously if something is going on or

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.190 
obviously if something is going on or
not<00:03:09.510> so<00:03:10.560> good<00:03:11.560> luck<00:03:11.680> with<00:03:11.739> your<00:03:11.950> tests
