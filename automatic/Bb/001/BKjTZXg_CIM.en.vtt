let's get on with the video for a first

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:51.290 
let's get on with the video for a first
step<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:47.190> get<00:00:47.339> my<00:00:47.489> jar<00:00:48.379> and<00:00:49.699> Crisco<00:00:50.699> like<00:00:51.059> this

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
step you get my jar and Crisco like this

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.119 
step you get my jar and Crisco like this
you<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.659> use<00:00:51.809> any<00:00:52.140> brand<00:00:52.409> I'm<00:00:52.649> using<00:00:52.920> Crisco

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
you can use any brand I'm using Crisco

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.399 
you can use any brand I'm using Crisco
it<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> shortening<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.870> has<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.379> a

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
it is a shortening and it has to be a

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:59.090 
it is a shortening and it has to be a
solid<00:00:55.739> shortening<00:00:56.339> like<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.670> see<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:58.100> and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
solid shortening like you see here and

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.969 
solid shortening like you see here and
I'm<00:00:59.249> just<00:00:59.460> gonna<00:00:59.609> start<00:00:59.909> getting<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.050> into

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
I'm just gonna start getting this into

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.329 
I'm just gonna start getting this into
my<00:01:02.100> jar<00:01:02.809> so<00:01:03.809> now<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.929> want<00:01:04.110> my<00:01:04.229> candle<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:05.070> all

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
my jar so now I want my candle not all

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.800 
my jar so now I want my candle not all
the<00:01:05.519> way<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.909> top<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.330> want<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.570> about

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
the way to the top and want it about

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.080 
the way to the top and want it about
down<00:01:07.740> here<00:01:09.800> so<00:01:10.800> I<00:01:10.830> think<00:01:10.890> that's<00:01:11.220> enough<00:01:11.549> to

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
down here so I think that's enough to

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.300 
down here so I think that's enough to
start<00:01:12.360> off<00:01:12.570> now<00:01:13.500> what<00:01:13.680> I'm<00:01:13.770> gonna<00:01:13.860> do<00:01:14.040> I'm

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
start off now what I'm gonna do I'm

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.560 
start off now what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna<00:01:14.399> microwave<00:01:15.060> this

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
gonna microwave this

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.050 
gonna microwave this
on<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:16.140> defrost<00:01:16.530> mode<00:01:16.829> until<00:01:17.159> most<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.939> its

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
on the defrost mode until most of its

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.340 
on the defrost mode until most of its
melted<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.540> then<00:01:18.659> I'll<00:01:18.750> come<00:01:18.930> back<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.110> just

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
melted and then I'll come back and just

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.819 
melted and then I'll come back and just
show<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.049> about<00:01:22.350> three<00:01:22.680> minutes

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
show you so this is about three minutes

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:24.770 
show you so this is about three minutes
later<00:01:23.219> on<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.759> defrost<00:01:24.149> mode<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.630> can<00:01:24.750> also

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
later on the defrost mode you can also

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.630 
later on the defrost mode you can also
use<00:01:25.170> regular<00:01:25.469> mode<00:01:25.829> if<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.009> wish<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.520> make

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
use regular mode if you wish that make

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.459 
use regular mode if you wish that make
it<00:01:26.759> go<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> little<00:01:27.119> bit<00:01:27.299> faster<00:01:27.689> but<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.229> want<00:01:28.409> it

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
it go a little bit faster but I want it

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.289 
it go a little bit faster but I want it
to<00:01:28.560> control<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.219> melt<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.610> little<00:01:29.729> bit<00:01:29.969> more<00:01:30.149> so

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
to control the melt a little bit more so

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.600 
to control the melt a little bit more so
I<00:01:30.329> use<00:01:30.539> the<00:01:30.719> frost<00:01:30.990> mode<00:01:31.289> so<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:32.130> see<00:01:32.369> most

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
I use the frost mode so you can see most

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.219 
I use the frost mode so you can see most
of<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.939> has<00:01:33.060> melted<00:01:33.270> I'm<00:01:33.539> just<00:01:33.689> gonna<00:01:33.780> zoom<00:01:34.049> in

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
of it has melted I'm just gonna zoom in

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.569 
of it has melted I'm just gonna zoom in
a<00:01:34.289> little<00:01:34.409> bit<00:01:34.619> just<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.890> show<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.340> lot

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
a little bit just to show you this a lot

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.510 
a little bit just to show you this a lot
closer<00:01:35.820> up<00:01:36.590> now<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.770> I've<00:01:37.890> zoomed<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.369> you

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
closer up now that I've zoomed in you

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.910 
closer up now that I've zoomed in you
can<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> difference<00:01:39.390> between

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
can see the difference between

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.349 
can see the difference between
shortening<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:40.950> has<00:01:41.310> not<00:01:41.609> melted<00:01:42.060> yet<00:01:42.180> you

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:42.359 
shortening that has not melted yet you

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:43.880 
shortening that has not melted yet you
can<00:01:42.509> see<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:42.990> still<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.409> solid<00:01:43.859> form

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
can see that it's still in a solid form

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.310 
can see that it's still in a solid form
here<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.490> then<00:01:45.030> we've<00:01:45.180> got<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.840> liquid<00:01:46.200> at

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
here and then we've got the liquid at

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.999 
here and then we've got the liquid at
the<00:01:46.409> bottom<00:01:48.079> so<00:01:49.079> hopefully<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.530> camera<00:01:49.680> picks

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
the bottom so hopefully the camera picks

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.730 
the bottom so hopefully the camera picks
that<00:01:50.159> up<00:01:50.219> so<00:01:50.939> that's<00:01:51.030> almost<00:01:51.420> done<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.020> can<00:01:52.530> see

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
that up so that's almost done I can see

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.319 
that up so that's almost done I can see

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
bottom now I can just place that where I

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.940 
bottom now I can just place that where I
want<00:03:02.099> it<00:03:03.170> I'm<00:03:04.170> gonna<00:03:04.379> use<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.680> little<00:03:04.950> skewer

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
want it I'm gonna use a little skewer

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.500 
want it I'm gonna use a little skewer
I'm<00:03:07.950> gonna<00:03:08.099> wrap<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.579> around<00:03:08.609> a<00:03:09.090> few<00:03:09.269> times

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.349 

so<00:03:12.510> this<00:03:12.629> is<00:03:12.780> basically<00:03:13.459> candle<00:03:14.459> making<00:03:14.640> 101

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
so this is basically candle making 101

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:22.670 
so this is basically candle making 101
but<00:03:16.319> we're<00:03:16.500> using<00:03:16.709> Crisco<00:03:17.459> shortening<00:03:21.500> once<00:03:22.500> I

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
but we're using Crisco shortening once I

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.460 
but we're using Crisco shortening once I
know<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:24.180> length<00:03:24.419> I'm<00:03:24.780> just<00:03:24.989> gonna<00:03:25.079> cut<00:03:25.349> this

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
know the length I'm just gonna cut this

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.520 
know the length I'm just gonna cut this
piece<00:03:25.709> off<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:28.519> there<00:03:29.519> we<00:03:29.609> have<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:30.530> and

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
piece off and there we have it and

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.890 
piece off and there we have it and
that's<00:03:31.709> basically<00:03:32.130> it

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
that's basically it

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.750 
that's basically it
so<00:03:33.900> what<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.109> want<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.349> do<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:35.250> can<00:03:35.400> leave<00:03:35.639> it

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
so what you want to do you can leave it

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.210 
so what you want to do you can leave it
like<00:03:35.880> this<00:03:35.910> or<00:03:36.389> you<00:03:37.049> can<00:03:37.230> put<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.590> into<00:03:37.889> the

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
like this or you can put it into the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.159 
like this or you can put it into the
fridge<00:03:38.459> if<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.120> leave<00:03:39.329> it<00:03:39.450> on<00:03:39.540> your<00:03:39.750> counter

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
fridge if you leave it on your counter

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.860 
fridge if you leave it on your counter
it's<00:03:40.560> gonna<00:03:40.769> take<00:03:41.069> many<00:03:41.489> many<00:03:41.760> hours<00:03:41.849> if<00:03:42.750> you

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
it's gonna take many many hours if you

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.569 
it's gonna take many many hours if you
take<00:03:43.109> it<00:03:43.260> like<00:03:43.410> this<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.650> put<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.069> either<00:03:44.220> into

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
take it like this and put it either into

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.069 
take it like this and put it either into
your<00:03:44.730> fridge<00:03:45.000> or<00:03:45.269> if<00:03:45.389> you're<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.750> really

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
your fridge or if you're in a really

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.839 
your fridge or if you're in a really
really<00:03:46.410> big<00:03:46.680> rush<00:03:46.919> you<00:03:47.069> can<00:03:47.190> put<00:03:47.340> it<00:03:47.459> into<00:03:47.700> the

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
really big rush you can put it into the

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.970 
really big rush you can put it into the
freezer<00:03:48.180> so<00:03:48.930> at<00:03:49.049> this<00:03:49.169> point<00:03:49.470> I'm<00:03:49.650> gonna<00:03:49.739> pop

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
freezer so at this point I'm gonna pop

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.979 
freezer so at this point I'm gonna pop
this<00:03:50.190> into<00:03:50.489> my<00:03:50.730> freezer<00:03:50.970> until<00:03:51.359> the

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
this into my freezer until the

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.900 
this into my freezer until the
shortening<00:03:52.440> becomes<00:03:52.919> solid<00:03:53.280> again<00:03:53.700> and

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
shortening becomes solid again and

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.120 
shortening becomes solid again and
that's<00:03:54.389> the<00:03:54.599> magic<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:55.079> this<00:03:55.200> that<00:03:55.530> shortening

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
that's the magic of this that shortening

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.659 
that's the magic of this that shortening
becomes<00:03:56.880> solid<00:03:57.540> when<00:03:57.900> it's<00:03:58.049> cold<00:03:58.349> or<00:03:58.889> liquid

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
becomes solid when it's cold or liquid
