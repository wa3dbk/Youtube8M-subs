building<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.269> bluebird<00:00:09.630> house<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.139> really

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
building a bluebird house is really

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.650 
building a bluebird house is really
simple<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:11.070> think<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.030> really<00:00:12.210> need<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.509> get

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
simple I think you really need to get

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.420 
simple I think you really need to get
right<00:00:12.870> as<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.710> whole<00:00:14.540> if<00:00:15.540> it's<00:00:15.690> too<00:00:15.870> big

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
right as the whole if it's too big

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.680 
right as the whole if it's too big
bigger<00:00:17.430> birds<00:00:17.699> are<00:00:17.820> gonna<00:00:17.880> be<00:00:18.060> able<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.270> get<00:00:18.480> in

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
bigger birds are gonna be able to get in

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.050 
bigger birds are gonna be able to get in
and<00:00:19.080> if<00:00:19.199> it's<00:00:19.380> too<00:00:19.740> small<00:00:19.890> but<00:00:20.670> bluebirds

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
and if it's too small but bluebirds

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.090 
and if it's too small but bluebirds
won't<00:00:21.270> be<00:00:21.359> able<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.630> fit<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.800> needs<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.010> be

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
won't be able to fit so it needs to be

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.070 
won't be able to fit so it needs to be
about<00:00:23.250> an<00:00:23.400> inch<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> half<00:00:23.820> wide<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.660> two

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
about an inch and a half wide and two

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.050 
about an inch and a half wide and two
inches<00:00:25.320> tall<00:00:25.619> easiest<00:00:26.400> way<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.490> do<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.760> and

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
inches tall easiest way to do that and

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.540 
inches tall easiest way to do that and
you<00:00:27.150> see<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:28.470> take<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:29.039> one<00:00:29.789> inch<00:00:30.000> bit<00:00:30.269> and

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
you see is to take a one inch bit and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.130 
you see is to take a one inch bit and
just<00:00:32.550> drill<00:00:32.790> two<00:00:32.969> holes<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.480> top<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.989> each

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
just drill two holes on top of each

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.639 
just drill two holes on top of each
other<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.730> that<00:00:35.730> gives<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.149> two<00:00:37.110> inches<00:00:37.380> tall

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
other and that gives you two inches tall

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.790 
other and that gives you two inches tall
an<00:00:37.920> inch<00:00:38.910> wide<00:00:39.149> then<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.809> just<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.350> take<00:00:40.530> a

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
an inch wide then I just like to take a

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.270 
an inch wide then I just like to take a
wood<00:00:41.460> chisel<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.649> make<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.770> size<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> little

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
wood chisel and make the size a little

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.630 
wood chisel and make the size a little
bit<00:00:44.520> wider<00:00:45.469> inch<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.710> quarter<00:00:46.920> inch<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.579> a

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
bit wider inch and a quarter inch and a

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.450 
bit wider inch and a quarter inch and a
half<00:00:47.750> want<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.840> be<00:00:48.899> plenty<00:00:49.289> wide<00:00:50.719> and<00:00:51.719> then<00:00:52.530> you

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
half want to be plenty wide and then you

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.830 
half want to be plenty wide and then you
just<00:00:53.610> need<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.789> smooth<00:00:54.059> out<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.270> little<00:00:54.510> bit<00:00:54.660> it

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.270 
out the rough edges away your chisel and
that<00:01:06.210> should<00:01:06.659> give<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.700> an<00:01:08.700> opening<00:01:10.280> that'll

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
that should give you an opening that'll

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.190 
that should give you an opening that'll
work

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200
