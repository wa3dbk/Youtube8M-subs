00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.830
 hi lee today I'm NEN 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.960
 beautiful breaded cambia on classic 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.269
 so that four came more 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.759
 brought easily in the event he has 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.759
 45 percent fat then I need to 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.510
 breading two wheat flour breadcrumbs 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.340
 and to roast rapeseed oil as a side dish there 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.189
 it wants to be gyroscope so completely 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.480
 I 'll just bring everything from the discount store 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.090
 I'll prepare everything for that now 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.199
 and then shows no parry 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.519
 I have now my pannier place 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.240
 I work from the right 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.340
 to the left 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.469
 first a little bit of flour egg and 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.660
 semmelbrÃ¶sel diekamp once 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.850
 Unpacked the rate I always before 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.590
 not so damp again 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.739
 a lot just that way 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.350
 little book or sometime comes into the sea 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.789
 the outer edges always something with the 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.500
 I just rub that wet 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:58.920
 the flour a bit better sticks like that 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:02.850
 there is a charge 34 times that look 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:08.420
 the edges are well occupied and then 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:12.229
 is it in this size was nice 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.520
 Bit of pushing always knew the 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.710
 this very important because the after 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.990
 usually the first ones are the ones 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.960
 even if they are not right there 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.009
 are made 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.080
 then there is the whole thing again 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.350
 but this time I do it without flour 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:33.420
 I have already my breadcrumbs 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:43.500
 now as adhesion further again 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:45.860
 nice to bridge calm whatsoever on 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.860
 strew 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.799
 so that should be about now 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.840
 appearance 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.220
 here is still known that still needs 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.820
 to be done nicely that always good 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.820
 check 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.409
 now everything is actually to the left 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.600
 Nice tight I do now with 1 4 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.840
 and then I do not show in the pan 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.840
 give 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.540
 so the four cheese pieces are now 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.240
 breaded so it should look like 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.080
 I have plenty of fat so oil in the 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.840
 pan given 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.840
 that is now , stop now 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.140
 small flame and now gives the slow 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.980
 Kram the Rhine should be such a very small 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.980
 bubble a bit 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:34.930
 but since then we go do that if it 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.290
 because now really bubbling on smaller 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.170
 The flame was not enough for the cheese 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:46.270
 very and between the expands and 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:49.690
 bounces plentifully too because of that 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:53.100
 So he should have something over half 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.100
 lying in the oil 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.490
 With it receives on both sides 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.459
 even thought through later 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:04.209
 So that's synonymous with the heat right 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.760
 The cheese is now from both 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.080
 has about five minutes in it 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.360
 a beautiful color is still nothing 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.880
 Burst I take out now and that 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.760
 very carefully and put another 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.390
 bit jerky paper that the tape 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.800
 man is able to drain 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.800
 Of course you do not need that much unnecessarily 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:04:02.640
 so the particles now look like me 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:04:04.110
 I want to give up here now I get this out 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.390
 I can taste it again now 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.130
 radios want to imitate the wishes 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.110
 have fun it is really easy 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.870
 and made quickly and tastes good 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.710
 have classes bought more than ready 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.960
 your day at the sea 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.470
 Good appetite and wishes to 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.470
 next time
