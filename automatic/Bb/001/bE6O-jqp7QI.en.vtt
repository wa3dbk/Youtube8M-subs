why<00:00:23.390> I'm<00:00:23.570> going<00:00:23.750> to<00:00:23.810> demonstrate<00:00:23.990> with<00:00:24.349> two

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
why I'm going to demonstrate with two

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.260 
why I'm going to demonstrate with two
different<00:00:24.590> dogs<00:00:24.890> I<00:00:25.130> have<00:00:25.340> my<00:00:25.490> dog<00:00:25.670> here<00:00:25.970> Cody

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
different dogs I have my dog here Cody

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.210 
different dogs I have my dog here Cody
and<00:00:26.540> I<00:00:27.050> have<00:00:27.080> my<00:00:27.290> sister<00:00:27.590> Labrador<00:00:28.070> here

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
and I have my sister Labrador here

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.120 
and I have my sister Labrador here
Trixie<00:00:28.640> and<00:00:28.910> I'm<00:00:29.599> going<00:00:29.810> to<00:00:29.869> Stros<00:00:30.290> show<00:00:30.980> you

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
Trixie and I'm going to Stros show you

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.670 
Trixie and I'm going to Stros show you
the<00:00:31.220> two<00:00:31.340> different<00:00:31.610> methods<00:00:32.260> they<00:00:33.260> each<00:00:33.440> have

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
the two different methods they each have

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.840 
the two different methods they each have
a<00:00:33.710> different<00:00:33.770> method<00:00:34.220> that<00:00:34.370> works<00:00:34.520> for<00:00:34.700> them

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
a different method that works for them

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.240 
a different method that works for them
so<00:00:35.510> hopefully<00:00:36.140> one<00:00:36.620> of<00:00:36.710> those<00:00:36.800> methods<00:00:37.130> is

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
so hopefully one of those methods is

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.610 
so hopefully one of those methods is
going<00:00:37.550> to<00:00:37.640> work<00:00:37.760> for<00:00:37.970> your<00:00:38.060> dog

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.930 

so<00:00:44.620> then<00:00:44.890> first<00:00:45.130> bus<00:00:45.340> isn't<00:00:45.550> I'm<00:00:45.670> going<00:00:45.850> to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
so then first bus isn't I'm going to

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.780 
so then first bus isn't I'm going to
show<00:00:46.060> you<00:00:46.120> is<00:00:46.360> called<00:00:46.470> muzzle<00:00:47.470> hold<00:00:47.680> and<00:00:47.920> this

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
show you is called muzzle hold and this

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.760 
show you is called muzzle hold and this
works<00:00:49.059> for<00:00:49.270> dogs<00:00:49.450> that<00:00:49.900> like<00:00:50.260> to<00:00:50.410> Tramp<00:00:50.650> on

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770
