00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.129 
right there you can see the metal barrel
right<00:03:03.700> there<00:03:04.739> um<00:03:06.389> you<00:03:07.389> cannot<00:03:07.690> take<00:03:07.989> the

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
right there um you cannot take the

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.440 
right there um you cannot take the
bottom<00:03:08.560> round<00:03:08.709> off<00:03:08.919> the<00:03:09.280> only<00:03:10.180> way<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:10.329> can

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
bottom round off the only way you can

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.059 
bottom round off the only way you can
take<00:03:10.660> it<00:03:10.780> off<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.109> by<00:03:11.230> disassembling<00:03:11.769> the

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
take it off is by disassembling the

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.509 
take it off is by disassembling the
whole<00:03:12.340> gun<00:03:12.930> then<00:03:13.930> you<00:03:14.139> can<00:03:14.319> take<00:03:14.500> bottom<00:03:15.370> roll

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
whole gun then you can take bottom roll

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.069 
whole gun then you can take bottom roll
off<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:15.970> actually<00:03:16.120> think<00:03:16.419> it's<00:03:16.569> one<00:03:16.900> whole

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
off I actually think it's one whole

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.530 
off I actually think it's one whole
piece<00:03:17.109> I'm<00:03:17.680> not<00:03:17.859> sure<00:03:18.160> if<00:03:18.310> it's<00:03:18.540> different

piece or not but um so yeah that's the

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.210 
piece or not but um so yeah that's the
barrel<00:03:22.720> right<00:03:22.930> there<00:03:23.310> um<00:03:25.919> there's<00:03:26.919> really<00:03:27.040> no
