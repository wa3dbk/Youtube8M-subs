review and sort of an unboxing on USB 7
port<00:00:41.679> USB<00:00:42.399> a<00:00:42.729> hub<00:00:43.120> adapter<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:44.260> I<00:00:44.319> ordered

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
port USB a hub adapter that I ordered

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.219 
port USB a hub adapter that I ordered
from<00:00:45.249> eBay<00:00:45.579> again<00:00:47.069> so<00:00:48.839> over<00:00:49.839> here<00:00:49.989> you<00:00:50.109> have

only thing that's on the package is the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.130 
only thing that's on the package is the
USB<00:01:11.140> hub<00:01:11.579> as<00:01:12.579> you<00:01:13.570> can<00:01:13.719> see<00:01:13.930> it's<00:01:14.409> black<00:01:14.619> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
USB hub as you can see it's black and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.770 
USB hub as you can see it's black and
it's<00:01:17.140> about<00:01:17.549> what<00:01:18.689> 20<00:01:19.689> 20<00:01:20.469> centimeters<00:01:20.920> high

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
it's about what 20 20 centimeters high

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.270 
it's about what 20 20 centimeters high
27<00:01:22.780> meters<00:01:23.020> tall<00:01:23.170> centimetres<00:01:23.799> tall<00:01:24.009> has

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
27 meters tall centimetres tall has

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.700 
27 meters tall centimetres tall has
quite<00:01:24.579> a<00:01:24.609> long<00:01:24.820> cable<00:01:25.090> if<00:01:25.719> you<00:01:26.640> untie<00:01:27.640> it<00:01:28.149> here

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
quite a long cable if you untie it here

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.810 
quite a long cable if you untie it here
it<00:01:29.710> gets<00:01:29.859> quite<00:01:30.219> long<00:01:31.469> I'd<00:01:32.469> say<00:01:32.679> about<00:01:32.820> 50

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
it gets quite long I'd say about 50

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.029 
it gets quite long I'd say about 50
centimeters<00:01:34.060> and<00:01:36.119> yes<00:01:37.119> so<00:01:37.810> oh<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.500> know<00:01:38.920> it

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
centimeters and yes so oh you know it

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.620 
centimeters and yes so oh you know it
says<00:01:39.310> 7<00:01:40.179> ports<00:01:40.810> USB<00:01:41.320> 2.0<00:01:41.950> high-speed<00:01:42.460> hub<00:01:42.759> it

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
says 7 ports USB 2.0 high-speed hub it

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.899 
says 7 ports USB 2.0 high-speed hub it
has<00:01:43.960> obviously<00:01:44.590> seven<00:01:45.070> ports<00:01:45.429> I<00:01:45.640> don't<00:01:45.820> know

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
has obviously seven ports I don't know

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.249 
has obviously seven ports I don't know
if<00:01:46.030> I<00:01:46.119> can<00:01:46.299> make<00:01:46.719> that<00:01:46.899> clear<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:49.240> what's<00:01:49.869> fun

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
if I can make that clear and what's fun

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.779 
if I can make that clear and what's fun
about<00:01:50.289> this<00:01:50.560> is<00:01:50.740> that<00:01:50.890> each<00:01:51.100> port<00:01:51.609> is

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
about this is that each port is

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.419 
about this is that each port is
controlled<00:01:52.240> by<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.479> switch<00:01:52.869> so<00:01:53.770> that's<00:01:54.249> fun

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
controlled by a switch so that's fun

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.730 
controlled by a switch so that's fun
because<00:01:54.759> I<00:01:54.850> can<00:01:55.049> individually<00:01:56.049> switch<00:01:56.320> on<00:01:56.560> and

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
because I can individually switch on and

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.870 
because I can individually switch on and
off<00:01:56.799> any<00:01:57.460> ports<00:01:57.909> that<00:01:58.600> I<00:01:58.630> don't<00:01:59.289> want<00:01:59.530> or<00:02:00.039> just

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
off any ports that I don't want or just

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.480 
off any ports that I don't want or just
to<00:02:01.030> temporarily<00:02:01.420> switch<00:02:01.659> off<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:01.990> device<00:02:04.170> and

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
to temporarily switch off a device and

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.499 
to temporarily switch off a device and
yeah<00:02:06.490> that's<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:06.789> and<00:02:06.969> there's<00:02:07.149> also<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.390> a

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
yeah that's it and there's also a a

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.220 
yeah that's it and there's also a a
little<00:02:07.869> plug<00:02:08.770> that<00:02:09.009> appears<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.729> be<00:02:09.910> a<00:02:10.840> plug

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
little plug that appears to be a plug

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.430 
little plug that appears to be a plug
for<00:02:11.470> an<00:02:11.560> external<00:02:11.890> power<00:02:12.190> supply<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:13.540> power<00:02:13.570> up

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
for an external power supply to power up

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.210 
for an external power supply to power up
the

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.730 
the
and<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.430> USB<00:02:15.700> hub<00:02:15.820> but<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.810> tested<00:02:17.380> it<00:02:17.470> then<00:02:17.710> I

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
and the USB hub but I tested it then I

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.890 
and the USB hub but I tested it then I
found<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.310> wasn't<00:02:18.700> necessary<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.510> have<00:02:19.660> one<00:02:19.810> of

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
found it wasn't necessary to have one of

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.740 
found it wasn't necessary to have one of
those<00:02:20.190> power<00:02:21.190> adapter<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:22.860> yeah<00:02:24.030> just<00:02:25.030> I'll<00:02:25.600> go

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
those power adapter so yeah just I'll go

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.350 
those power adapter so yeah just I'll go
and<00:02:25.900> do<00:02:25.960> a<00:02:25.990> test<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.500> I'll<00:02:26.560> show<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:26.710> how<00:02:26.950> it

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
and do a test and I'll show you how it

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.990 
and do a test and I'll show you how it
performs<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.620> over<00:02:29.980> here<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.220> can<00:02:30.460> see<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:30.970> I

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
performs so over here you can see that I

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.070 
performs so over here you can see that I
have<00:02:31.270> some<00:02:32.140> USB<00:02:32.590> devices<00:02:32.860> connected<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.460> the

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
have some USB devices connected to the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.010 
have some USB devices connected to the
USB<00:02:35.080> hub<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:37.150> will<00:02:37.300> now<00:02:37.420> turn<00:02:37.450> these

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
USB hub and I will now turn these

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.850 
USB hub and I will now turn these
devices<00:02:38.860> on<00:02:43.020> you<00:02:44.020> can<00:02:44.200> hear<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.440> computer

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
devices on you can hear the computer

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.240 
devices on you can hear the computer
detecting<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.580> devices<00:02:46.090> now<00:02:46.870> if<00:02:47.050> I<00:02:47.260> turn<00:02:47.740> and

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
detecting the devices now if I turn and

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.280 
detecting the devices now if I turn and
zoom<00:02:48.580> on<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:51.600> computer<00:02:52.600> you<00:02:52.960> should<00:02:52.990> see

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
zoom on to the computer you should see

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.970 
zoom on to the computer you should see
that<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.830> says<00:02:53.980> green<00:02:54.370> USB<00:02:54.820> blue<00:02:55.150> USB<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.980> it

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
that it says green USB blue USB and it

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.760

has<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.000> USB<00:02:58.180> card<00:02:58.690> reader<00:02:58.780> which<00:02:59.550> you<00:03:00.550> can<00:03:00.700> see

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
has a USB card reader which you can see

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:09.180 
has a USB card reader which you can see
over<00:03:02.770> here<00:03:05.070> right<00:03:06.070> there<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.530> when<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:09.010> lights

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190
