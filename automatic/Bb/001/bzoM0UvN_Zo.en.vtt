00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.709
 Hello dear teammates 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.000
 Today the topic will be about a handful of which 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:22.750
 get not recently on the eyes they are offset 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.130
 but they have such a profile 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:30.520
 that is, they have a loop card 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.010
 horizontal did not reach on it 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:38.850
 sweep and very large 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:42.149
 ring that is very beneficial effect on 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.149
 ring selection 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.399
 so that he did not record 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.399
 that is, no need to pick up a ring for 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.219
 say for a certain diameter of this 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:03.730
 so as not to bite in the not cotone dialect 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:09.399
 snacks she goes well there has 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:11.770
 free movement for rotation here to 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:14.080
 but we think we can 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.900
 offer any other tooling 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.020
 Type g we say this is done from ordinary 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.250
 paper clips 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:28.439
 Well, what you find bend so here's 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.439
 such a form 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.119
 pierced through this ring has 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.119
 free movement 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:46.720
 continue to insert any lead or 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:51.429
 loads and put the other side no 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.020
 Cone ahead there is not any other lead 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.590
 or tungsten 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.710
 tungsten rings up can can load 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.929
 be different different forms different 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.299
 glass tungsten content 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:09.509
 lead 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.509
 under different situations under different reservoirs 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:22.219
 then it makes doing such a bend that 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:24.709
 now roam this fixation construction 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:26.049
 the load did not slide off can be any 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.760
 glue 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.129
 bend 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.129
 I ask this star again 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.489
 fix something other subjects 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.129
 there 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:42.220
 it is at your discretion bent 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:44.349
 this cargo has nowhere to bite off 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.190
 here is this long tail or bite off 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:51.329
 itâ€™s like your discretion 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.980
 that it is optional 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:58.239
 additional reference bottom touch 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.890
 or some other surface then 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.890
 it turns out that you have a bait 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.970
 even if it goes between two stones 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:11.980
 then they go we hook axes such a snap 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.659
 has already been tested on small rivers or 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.980
 gave a very positive result 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:19.720
 there is 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:27.780
 detachment was 1 to this to this part we 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:27.780
 Immediately we can attach the palm 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:39.850
 easy addition if you leave here 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.680
 this metal so to speak erased not 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.820
 forget that it is very good when u 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.920
 you rod I mean the back is sensitive 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.260
 the tip is sensitive it bounces off 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.980
 most of the stones you already immediately understand 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.050
 that you are concerned about it 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.210
 obstacles and you need to do 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.400
 next on the net where were about vodka 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:04.060
 opal is already smaller more 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:13.390
 as if to equip rubber float 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:16.710
 how his bait will be when 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.710
 touching one 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:36.060
 means equipped like show water 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:39.770
 Hyde certainly not thicker but you can even 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.770
 get nyusha on the skin here and so 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.730
 it will be such a tapping one 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.690
 tapping afloat the middle always 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:57.970
 will hold on to a colleague and not hook on 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:02.210
 for any obstacles 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:07.070
 You can start this bait any us 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.640
 lead cones even here 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.240
 gully 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:14.060
 we equipped with wire bends 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.030
 either biting 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:25.180
 just float a weight u10 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:28.690
 snacking snap as i said 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.550
 gave the result a positive side by 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:35.930
 do not hook from the shadows of openability 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:38.120
 saving your bait can 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:42.290
 Perhaps to the end remember what 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:45.260
 concentration why to say like 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:49.250
 here is this design than good daoud i 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.060
 right now she explained articulated you can 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.050
 cast 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.810
 when casting step and do not 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.230
 point to produce play bait on 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.960
 cork there 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.820
 prospect a place to that liked well 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.170
 correctly andre became subject if 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.780
 you rubber floating 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.790
 rubber floating you stopped risen 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.760
 starts to rise you barely lived that 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.710
 you hinge worked again the weight fell 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.900
 rubber rises and how will be in place 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:20.360
 such movements sway on she 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.750
 performs as it performs 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.260
 attractive 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:27.840
 such here is the discoverer of her movement and 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.300
 I can literally fished meter 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.570
 meter per meter plot 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:35.550
 here the Italian company produces 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:39.450
 glass ship yes in general. 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:42.510
 almost did not see the invisible they are not 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:47.450
 quite cheap but still can 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:47.450
 occupy popularity in this kind of fishing 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.920
 please love and favor yes very good 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:57.300
 excuse on the picture of these hooks 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:59.150
 drawn 370 will see it all the same 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:02.640
 jigga jigga baking 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:07.880
 not just because all these have brought the Japanese 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:12.020
 But if it is possible to increase the camera 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:16.850
 hook actually very interesting complaints 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:19.590
 from look it from several faces 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:21.690
 triangular is generally very gorgeous 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:24.710
 punches we launch on pike perch I would become 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:28.639
 trail hook will be just great 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:32.270
 so here's what a tour says to say 

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:32.270
 Thanks for attention
