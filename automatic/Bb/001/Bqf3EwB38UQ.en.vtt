something<00:00:50.550> like<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.699> it's<00:00:51.120> not<00:00:51.360> realistic

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
something like that it's not realistic

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.570

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.829 
of six whoo crazy soil suckers the
biggest<00:00:56.400> mistake<00:00:56.729> I<00:00:56.879> see<00:00:56.909> a<00:00:57.089> lot<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.540> beginners

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
biggest mistake I see a lot of beginners

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.630 
biggest mistake I see a lot of beginners
make<00:00:58.229> is<00:00:58.409> that<00:00:58.769> they<00:00:58.860> think<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.250> everything

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
make is that they think that everything

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.820 
make is that they think that everything
is<00:00:59.820> going<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.030> go<00:01:00.180> exactly<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.110> way<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.320> think

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
is going to go exactly the way you think

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.649 
is going to go exactly the way you think
it's<00:01:01.979> going<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.220> go<00:01:02.400> the<00:01:02.760> truth<00:01:02.970> is<00:01:03.150> it<00:01:03.299> usually

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
it's going to go the truth is it usually

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.450 
it's going to go the truth is it usually
falls<00:01:03.900> a<00:01:04.080> little<00:01:04.110> short<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.010> don't<00:01:05.280> want
