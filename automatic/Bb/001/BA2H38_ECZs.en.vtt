well here in Ventura County we have very
good<00:00:41.160> soil<00:00:41.570> but<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.620> very<00:00:43.890> hard<00:00:44.219> especially

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
good soil but it is very hard especially

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.779 
good soil but it is very hard especially
in<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> summertime<00:00:45.829> so<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.890> need<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> way<00:00:47.760> to

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
in the summertime so you need a way to

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.450 
in the summertime so you need a way to
loosen<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.600> soil<00:00:48.930> up<00:00:49.170> which<00:00:49.530> composting<00:00:50.370> I

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
loosen that soil up which composting I

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.069 
loosen that soil up which composting I
know<00:00:50.520> we've<00:00:50.820> talked<00:00:51.059> about<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.449> before<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:52.050> a

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
know we've talked about that before is a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.490 
know we've talked about that before is a
very<00:00:52.410> good<00:00:52.530> way<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.710> loosen<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.250> soil<00:00:54.500> our

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
very good way to loosen that soil our

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.760 
very good way to loosen that soil our
soil<00:00:55.920> here<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.460> little<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.559> basic<00:00:58.559> side

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
soil here is a little on the basic side

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.459 
soil here is a little on the basic side
of<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.980> pH<00:00:59.340> scale<00:00:59.600> so<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.809> grows<00:01:01.020> certain

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
of the pH scale so it grows certain

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.049 
of the pH scale so it grows certain
things<00:01:01.680> really<00:01:02.039> well<00:01:02.309> certain<00:01:02.820> other<00:01:02.969> things

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
things really well certain other things

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.080 
things really well certain other things
it<00:01:03.480> does<00:01:03.690> not<00:01:03.840> grow<00:01:04.140> nearly<00:01:04.500> as<00:01:04.710> well<00:01:04.920> when<00:01:05.850> you

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
it does not grow nearly as well when you

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.320 
it does not grow nearly as well when you
compost<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:07.140> will<00:01:07.320> add<00:01:07.790> acids<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:08.970> soil

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
compost you will add acids to the soil

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.390 
compost you will add acids to the soil
to<00:01:09.450> make<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.900> more<00:01:10.049> neutral<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.860> things<00:01:11.220> will

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
to make it more neutral so things will

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.969 
to make it more neutral so things will
grow<00:01:11.810> when<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.930> compost<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.619> will<00:01:13.740> actually

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
grow when you compost it will actually

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.910 
grow when you compost it will actually
loosen<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> soil<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.500> will<00:01:16.650> make<00:01:16.890> it

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
loosen the soil so that it will make it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.830 
loosen the soil so that it will make it
easier<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> roots<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.360> plants<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
easier for the roots of the plants to

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.600 
easier for the roots of the plants to
get<00:01:19.020> down<00:01:19.259> into<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.799> soil<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.280> get<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
get down into the soil and get the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.179 
get down into the soil and get the
nutrients<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.390> are<00:01:21.450> there<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.740> whenever<00:01:23.040> you

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
nutrients that are there so whenever you

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.560 
nutrients that are there so whenever you
want<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.460> plant<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.790> garden<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.270> need<00:01:24.450> to

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
want to plant a garden you need to

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.899 
want to plant a garden you need to
really<00:01:24.930> chop<00:01:25.170> your<00:01:25.320> soil<00:01:25.619> up<00:01:25.830> fine<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.460> get<00:01:26.759> it

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909

as<00:01:27.060> loose<00:01:27.689> as<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:29.009> can<00:01:29.159> add<00:01:29.369> peat

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
as loose as you can you can add peat

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.420 
as loose as you can you can add peat
moss<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.360> other<00:01:30.479> amendments<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:32.280> make

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
moss and other amendments to it to make

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.249 
moss and other amendments to it to make
it<00:01:32.490> more<00:01:32.610> receptive<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.270> water<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.020> things

best months our October and November

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.590

because<00:02:49.250> you've<00:02:49.549> got<00:02:49.760> both<00:02:49.970> leaves<00:02:50.269> coming

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
because you've got both leaves coming

because you've got both leaves coming
off<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.840> trees<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:51.320> you've<00:02:51.410> got<00:02:51.590> green<00:02:51.890> grass

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
off the trees and you've got green grass

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.640 
off the trees and you've got green grass
still<00:02:52.430> so<00:02:52.700> if<00:02:52.820> you<00:02:52.970> mix<00:02:53.299> it<00:02:53.420> then<00:02:53.600> together<00:02:53.750> let

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
still so if you mix it then together let

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.340 
still so if you mix it then together let
it<00:02:54.769> cook<00:02:54.980> over<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.370> winter<00:02:55.790> months<00:02:55.970> by<00:02:56.350> April

it cook over the winter months by April

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.830 
it cook over the winter months by April
or<00:02:57.500> so<00:02:57.680> you've<00:02:57.920> got<00:02:57.950> compost<00:02:58.730> ready<00:02:59.000> but<00:02:59.570> mulch

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.990 
or so you've got compost ready but mulch
it<00:03:00.440> doesn't<00:03:00.739> really<00:03:00.830> take<00:03:01.190> any<00:03:01.430> you're<00:03:01.820> not

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
it doesn't really take any you're not

it doesn't really take any you're not
growing<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:03.140> you're<00:03:03.320> not<00:03:04.390> making<00:03:05.390> a<00:03:05.480> compost

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
growing it you're not making a compost

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.390 
growing it you're not making a compost
out<00:03:06.200> of<00:03:06.350> it<00:03:06.440> you're<00:03:06.590> just<00:03:06.799> putting<00:03:06.950> it<00:03:07.130> on<00:03:07.280> the

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
out of it you're just putting it on the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.090 
out of it you're just putting it on the
ground<00:03:07.670> as<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:07.910> moisture<00:03:08.420> barrier<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:09.920> keep

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
ground as a moisture barrier and to keep

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.400 
ground as a moisture barrier and to keep
moisture<00:03:10.340> in<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.670> soil<00:03:10.850> so<00:03:11.540> anytime<00:03:12.140> you<00:03:12.290> can

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
get mulch you can put it on it's gonna

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.210 
get mulch you can put it on it's gonna

keep moisture in the ground it's going

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.460 
keep moisture in the ground it's going
to<00:03:16.280> gradually<00:03:17.000> decompose<00:03:17.570> and<00:03:17.810> add<00:03:17.930> some<00:03:18.110> good

benefits<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.250> soil<00:03:19.459> but<00:03:20.239> primarily<00:03:20.450> it's

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
benefits to the soil but primarily it's

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.900 
benefits to the soil but primarily it's
a<00:03:20.959> moisture<00:03:21.440> barrier<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:22.280> keep<00:03:22.430> moisture<00:03:22.700> in

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
a moisture barrier to keep moisture in

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.789 
a moisture barrier to keep moisture in
the<00:03:23.000> soil<00:03:23.150> and<00:03:23.420> because<00:03:23.870> as<00:03:24.049> hard<00:03:24.290> as<00:03:24.440> our<00:03:24.560> soil

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
the soil and because as hard as our soil

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.500 
the soil and because as hard as our soil
is<00:03:25.010> most<00:03:25.310> of<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.519> water<00:03:25.730> will<00:03:25.940> pool<00:03:26.150> right<00:03:26.360> on

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
is most of the water will pool right on

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.150 
is most of the water will pool right on
top<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:26.959> then<00:03:27.110> two-thirds<00:03:27.769> of<00:03:27.890> it<00:03:28.040> will

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.740 
evaporate before it soaks down into the
soil<00:03:30.130> so<00:03:31.130> when<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:31.400> put<00:03:31.610> mulch<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.299> larger

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750

soil so when you put mulch the larger
grains<00:03:33.049> of<00:03:33.410> wood<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:34.100> bark<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:34.610> things<00:03:34.820> on

the<00:03:35.180> soil<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:36.079> water<00:03:36.320> will<00:03:36.560> go<00:03:36.680> down

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
the soil the water will go down

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.130 
the soil the water will go down
underneath<00:03:37.190> it<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.610> it<00:03:37.850> will<00:03:38.030> stay<00:03:38.209> kind<00:03:39.049> of

underneath it and it will stay kind of

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.900 
underneath it and it will stay kind of
on<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.410> surface<00:03:39.769> and<00:03:39.920> work<00:03:40.070> its<00:03:40.250> way<00:03:40.400> down<00:03:40.430> but

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
mean there's no recipe for mulch other

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.260 
mean there's no recipe for mulch other
than<00:05:23.590> making<00:05:23.800> sure<00:05:24.130> that<00:05:24.400> you've<00:05:24.550> got<00:05:24.580> you

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
than making sure that you've got you

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.900 
than making sure that you've got you
know<00:05:25.300> good<00:05:25.889> wood<00:05:26.889> and<00:05:27.190> bark<00:05:27.370> and<00:05:27.610> things<00:05:27.789> like

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
know good wood and bark and things like

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.670 
know good wood and bark and things like
that<00:05:27.970> you<00:05:28.690> may<00:05:28.840> end<00:05:29.020> up<00:05:29.110> with<00:05:29.289> some<00:05:29.410> pine

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
that you may end up with some pine

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.190 
that you may end up with some pine
needles<00:05:30.070> in<00:05:30.220> there<00:05:30.400> and<00:05:30.610> that's<00:05:30.760> fine<00:05:31.200> you

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
needles in there and that's fine you

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.290 
needles in there and that's fine you
know<00:05:32.229> what<00:05:32.470> a<00:05:32.500> lot<00:05:32.740> of<00:05:32.889> them<00:05:33.010> but<00:05:33.910> if<00:05:34.000> you<00:05:34.030> were

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
know what a lot of them but if you were

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.480 
know what a lot of them but if you were
fine<00:05:34.570> they<00:05:34.810> will<00:05:34.960> gradually<00:05:35.380> decompose<00:05:36.070> just

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
fine they will gradually decompose just

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.810 
fine they will gradually decompose just
like<00:05:36.639> they<00:05:37.120> do<00:05:37.180> normally

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
like they do normally

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.880

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
the moisture in the ground and they need

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.400 
the moisture in the ground and they need
to<00:05:43.800> add<00:05:43.980> a<00:05:44.010> little<00:05:44.510> take<00:05:45.510> away<00:05:45.690> the<00:05:45.810> bare<00:05:46.050> spots

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410
