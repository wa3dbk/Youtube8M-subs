so<00:02:57.930> they<00:02:58.080> get<00:02:58.230> well<00:02:58.440> used<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:59.120> they<00:03:00.120> get

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
so they get well used and they get

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.840 
so they get well used and they get
critical<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.230> what<00:03:01.350> we<00:03:01.470> do<00:03:01.620> here<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.550> next
