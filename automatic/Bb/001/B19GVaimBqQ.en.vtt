seems that we have some manner just try
some<00:00:38.410> towers<00:00:38.710> an<00:00:40.079> amplifier

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:52.090

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
seems 3ds is just 50 waves and with some

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.160 
seems 3ds is just 50 waves and with some
manner<00:00:56.899> many<00:00:57.530> shots<00:00:57.800> or<00:00:58.160> maps<00:00:59.089> with<00:00:59.449> many

manner many shots or maps with many
shots<00:01:00.409> are<00:01:00.649> always<00:01:00.680> easy<00:01:01.159> so<00:01:02.739> let's<00:01:03.739> just<00:01:04.100> try

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
shots are always easy so let's just try

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.830 
shots are always easy so let's just try
to<00:01:04.909> make<00:01:05.269> it<00:01:05.299> quick

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
shouldn't be any reason to restart

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.730

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:57.710 

and<00:02:41.540> de-<00:02:42.110> rising<00:02:42.920> straight

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.800 

just<00:02:58.350> try<00:02:58.620> some<00:02:58.890> more<00:02:59.070> not<00:02:59.310> again<00:02:59.580> and<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:03.030> see

so<00:03:34.630> this<00:03:35.630> one<00:03:35.840> seems<00:03:36.200> like<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.530> nice<00:03:36.860> map

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:50.100 

the<00:03:42.790> bosses<00:03:43.230> just<00:03:45.269> 169<00:03:46.269> k<00:03:46.659> it<00:03:46.840> just<00:03:47.319> died<00:03:49.110> with

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
and if I had trouble I could just build

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.480 
and if I had trouble I could just build
ammo<00:04:00.959> and

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
ammo and

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:18.569 
ammo and
kill<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.300> by<00:04:03.540> meaning<00:04:04.460> making<00:04:05.460> normal<00:04:05.910> traps
