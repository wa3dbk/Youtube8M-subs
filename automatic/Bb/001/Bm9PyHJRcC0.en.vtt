00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:26.120 

yeah<00:04:19.739> I<00:04:23.630> don't<00:04:24.630> think<00:04:24.990> this<00:04:25.170> game<00:04:25.410> has<00:04:25.680> weapon

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
yeah I don't think this game has weapon

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.830 
yeah I don't think this game has weapon
durability<00:04:26.850> at<00:04:26.940> least<00:04:27.120> from<00:04:27.240> what<00:04:27.360> I<00:04:27.390> can<00:04:27.630> tell

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
durability at least from what I can tell

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.830 
durability at least from what I can tell
if<00:04:28.680> you<00:04:28.800> take<00:04:28.980> a<00:04:29.010> look<00:04:29.250> here<00:04:29.310> yeah<00:04:30.210> I<00:04:30.540> think<00:04:30.630> the

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
if you take a look here yeah I think the

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.690 
if you take a look here yeah I think the
weapons<00:04:31.170> last<00:04:31.410> forever<00:04:31.680> so<00:04:32.100> unlike<00:04:32.460> Dark

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
weapons last forever so unlike Dark

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.820 
weapons last forever so unlike Dark
Souls<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.150> weapons<00:04:33.450> won't<00:04:33.690> break<00:04:36.680> what<00:04:37.680> do<00:04:37.740> we

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
Souls the weapons won't break what do we

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.190 
Souls the weapons won't break what do we
got<00:04:37.980> here<00:04:38.340> ah

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:49.960

I<00:04:59.480> wonder<00:05:00.480> if<00:05:00.510> the<00:05:00.900> empty<00:05:01.200> bottle<00:05:01.530> lets<00:05:01.650> me

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
I wonder if the empty bottle lets me

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.320 
I wonder if the empty bottle lets me
hold<00:05:01.920> another<00:05:02.130> potion<00:05:02.430> I<00:05:02.820> think<00:05:03.090> it<00:05:03.180> probably

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
hold another potion I think it probably

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
does ah this looped back to where we

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.200 
does ah this looped back to where we
were<00:05:10.440> excellent<00:05:11.100> so<00:05:11.310> there's<00:05:11.460> a<00:05:11.520> shortcut<00:05:11.820> now
