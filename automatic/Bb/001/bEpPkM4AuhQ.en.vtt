00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.029
 in a day 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.850
 the company is managed by the team 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.140
 professionals 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.140
 mister shyshov company coca cola 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.560
 we put together all the available 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.560
 information and knowledge 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.090
 similar system completely 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.370
 mechanical 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.420
 no electronic unit 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.440
 the system uses any water 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.230
 it may be normal 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.510
 tap or rainwater 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.420
 then steam is produced from it 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.180
 which is in the reactor 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.710
 converted to synthetic gas 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.710
 and flow enters the engine duct 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.470
 small five-liter capacity 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.520
 main water device 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.790
 the system is mounted on the exhaust pipe 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.210
 cars per day 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.780
 system improves combustion readings 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.640
 fuel 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.770
 and so we raise 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.700
 engine performance 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.320
 at installation by the scheme does not occur 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.220
 design changes in the engine 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.240
 the car 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.659
 and copra is installed 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.659
 front edition machine parts 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.080
 increased engine thrust 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.090
 becomes more picky mastic 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.080
 that is, when the engine needs 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.100
 more world-class effort will 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.130
 less time to get needed 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.210
 torque 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.260
 but what if we win turnover 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.690
 uah 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.430
 This in turn is beneficially reflected and 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.430
 on fuel consumption 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.219
 re-holding pores here is very 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.170
 well visually presented the whole 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.679
 system 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.189
 gas-vapor mixture transformers 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.369
 gas option prediction reduces non 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:28.919
 bulo vibration and saves 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.919
 fuel 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:50.930
 it is now 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.239
 we will tell the arrangement of systems 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.439
 This is a standard modification to this. 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.120
 the vaporizer enters part of the exhaust gases 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.120
 there is always water 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:05.139
 in the prefecture temperature 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.909
 rises and water evaporates this little with 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.329
 mixed with their exhaust gases 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.189
 moves right in the reactors 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.869
 video efficiency converted to gask 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:18.279
 which in turn comes in 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:20.809
 duct buemi 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:22.829
 it saves fuel 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.669
 reduce no bulo toxicity and 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.230
 exhaust smoke 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.079
 if this is simple 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.539
 and very efficient system 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:35.539
 the president 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.739
 bernard lag in the companies team 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.410
 except those already mentioned 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.630
 economic and that's logically them 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.830
 benefits should be noted that 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.740
 Russian they use for their 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.359
 work 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.609
 Bezhitskaya or and gaseous 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.819
 hydrocarbon fuels i.e. no 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.979
 there is absolutely no risk of fire 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:58.919
 or bang 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.909
 it is a simple effective system 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.389
 for her work you need the usual 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:05.919
 tap water 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:06.909
 but better 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.889
 clean like rain without chemicals 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:11.089
 you see 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:14.089
 I can pour this water a glass and drink it 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:17.899
 when impressive 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.460
 we learned about this system 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.180
 celebrate during the tour de france 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.460
 my friend's honor was working in the reno garage 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.349
 clio district 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.699
 and and when the race was held we stood on 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.240
 roadside organizers 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.240
 handed out a newspaper for free 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.030
 At first we did not notice the advertisement. 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.389
 tobacco and liquor i love reading newspapers 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.470
 decision that time I saw a note about 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.430
 that using this system you can 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.509
 save fuel 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.680
 you know what this system produces 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.180
 only here you have to carry does not carry 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.150
 you specially came here earlier 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.449
 of this system 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.169
 Yes exactly 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.409
 tell me more 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:10.530
 this kind of weather 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.460
 i live in a city more this department 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.939
 areas I often come to the reserve 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:19.370
 I called the phone 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.820
 I was advised to turn to mister 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.949
 Mermaid live who produce it 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:25.620
 equipment 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.440
 I decided to install it on my 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.430
 car 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.820
 while the main thing for me was 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.820
 fuel economy and milk safety 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.289
 wrp 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:04.949
 with 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:18.360
 three food past in defiance of protocols
