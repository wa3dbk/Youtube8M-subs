00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
the color scheme for this blaster

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.560 
the color scheme for this blaster

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.120 
I think the separate printing looks very
nice<00:05:07.990> also<00:05:08.380> there's<00:05:08.590> everything<00:05:08.830> on<00:05:09.070> the

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
much better than the original sweet

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.580 
much better than the original sweet
