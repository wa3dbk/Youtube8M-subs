00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
that I've recently toured an Impala but

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.640 
that I've recently toured an Impala but
the<00:00:19.300> reason<00:00:19.600> why<00:00:19.660> I<00:00:19.690> want<00:00:19.870> to<00:00:19.930> do<00:00:20.050> this<00:00:20.230> one<00:00:20.500> is

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
the reason why I want to do this one is

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.620 
the reason why I want to do this one is
because<00:00:20.800> it's<00:00:21.310> a<00:00:21.460> much<00:00:21.760> better<00:00:22.030> shape<00:00:22.300> and

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
because it's a much better shape and

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.690 
because it's a much better shape and
it's<00:00:22.960> not<00:00:23.110> as<00:00:23.260> squished<00:00:23.680> in<00:00:24.040> between<00:00:24.100> other

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
it's not as squished in between other

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.540 
it's not as squished in between other
cars<00:00:25.030> like<00:00:25.180> that<00:00:25.950> burgundy<00:00:26.950> and<00:00:27.040> power<00:00:27.250> that<00:00:27.520> I
