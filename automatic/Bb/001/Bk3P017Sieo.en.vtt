00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
one it was still in range because I had

the<00:01:18.210> video<00:01:18.360> feed<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.110> number<00:01:20.009> two<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.729> seemed

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
the video feed and number two it seemed

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.999 
the video feed and number two it seemed
to<00:01:21.210> be<00:01:21.330> coming<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.750> where<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.900> was<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.560> then

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
to be coming to where I was and then

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.740 
to be coming to where I was and then
sure<00:01:23.220> enough<00:01:23.250> as<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.850> got<00:01:23.939> closer<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:26.750> you

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
sure enough as it got closer it you

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.539 
sure enough as it got closer it you
could<00:01:27.960> obviously<00:01:28.409> could<00:01:28.799> start<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.159> hear<00:01:29.400> it

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
could obviously could start to hear it

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.609 
could obviously could start to hear it
but<00:01:30.060> what<00:01:30.210> was<00:01:30.390> scary<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.079> was<00:01:31.350> landing

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
the home point so prior to the flight

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.240 
the home point so prior to the flight
you<00:02:32.810> know<00:02:32.930> read<00:02:33.170> my<00:02:33.349> manual<00:02:33.709> went<00:02:33.950> through<00:02:34.069> all

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
on the on the phantom 2 Vision+ are

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.679 
on the on the phantom 2 Vision+ are
doing<00:02:43.040> what<00:02:43.159> they<00:02:43.249> should<00:02:43.459> be<00:02:43.609> doing<00:02:43.639> and<00:02:44.150> that

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
doing what they should be doing and that

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.300 
doing what they should be doing and that
I<00:02:44.959> had<00:02:45.079> set<00:02:45.290> my<00:02:45.439> home<00:02:45.620> point

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
I had set my home point

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.020 
I had set my home point
had<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.239> not<00:02:47.480> set<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.930> home<00:02:48.079> point<00:02:48.909> when<00:02:49.909> this

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
had I not set the home point when this

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.009 
had I not set the home point when this
thing<00:02:50.269> lost<00:02:50.510> signal

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
thing lost signal

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.170 
thing lost signal
it<00:02:51.829> could<00:02:52.040> have<00:02:52.129> tried<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.400> fly<00:02:52.730> somewhere

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
it could have tried to fly somewhere

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.390 
it could have tried to fly somewhere
else<00:02:53.719> which<00:02:54.349> wasn't<00:02:54.620> where<00:02:54.919> it<00:02:54.949> took<00:02:55.159> off<00:02:55.340> from

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
else which wasn't where it took off from

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.449 
else which wasn't where it took off from
unfortunately<00:02:56.299> I<00:02:56.329> set<00:02:56.599> the<00:02:56.719> home<00:02:56.900> point<00:02:57.340> so<00:02:58.340> it

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
unfortunately I set the home point so it

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.789 
unfortunately I set the home point so it
came<00:02:58.639> right<00:02:58.819> back<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.389> me

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
came right back to me

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.800 
came right back to me
but<00:03:01.189> what<00:03:01.430> I<00:03:01.459> didn't<00:03:01.849> know<00:03:01.969> at<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.239> time<00:03:02.419> and

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
but what I didn't know at the time and

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.629 
but what I didn't know at the time and
this<00:03:03.290> is<00:03:03.469> one<00:03:03.709> of<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:03.889> main<00:03:04.040> purposes<00:03:04.250> for

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
this is one of the main purposes for

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.050 
this is one of the main purposes for
posting<00:03:05.030> this<00:03:05.150> video<00:03:05.359> is<00:03:06.049> that<00:03:06.980> if<00:03:07.760> you're<00:03:07.969> in

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
posting this video is that if you're in

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.879 
posting this video is that if you're in
a<00:03:08.120> situation<00:03:08.329> where<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:08.989> initiates<00:03:09.500> returned

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
a situation where it initiates returned

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.089 
a situation where it initiates returned
home<00:03:10.870> at<00:03:11.870> least<00:03:12.079> I<00:03:12.260> couldn't<00:03:12.620> find<00:03:12.769> out<00:03:12.919> how<00:03:13.040> to

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
home at least I couldn't find out how to

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.670 
home at least I couldn't find out how to
do<00:03:13.340> it<00:03:13.489> but<00:03:14.480> I<00:03:14.540> don't<00:03:14.780> think<00:03:14.930> there's<00:03:15.169> a<00:03:15.260> way<00:03:15.409> on

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
do it but I don't think there's a way on

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.879 
do it but I don't think there's a way on
the<00:03:15.799> iPhone<00:03:16.250> app<00:03:16.519> to<00:03:18.189> to<00:03:19.189> regain<00:03:19.609> control<00:03:19.879> of

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
the iPhone app to to regain control of

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.879 
the iPhone app to to regain control of
the<00:03:21.889> DJI<00:03:22.250> phantom<00:03:22.699> 2<00:03:22.729> Vision+<00:03:23.650> because<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.769> was

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
the DJI phantom 2 Vision+ because I was

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:25.899 
the DJI phantom 2 Vision+ because I was
sitting<00:03:25.040> there<00:03:25.159> trying<00:03:25.340> to<00:03:25.489> do<00:03:25.639> that<00:03:25.790> because

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909 
sitting there trying to do that because

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.159 
sitting there trying to do that because
I<00:03:26.060> wanted<00:03:26.239> to<00:03:26.299> land<00:03:26.569> it<00:03:26.750> manually<00:03:27.400> after<00:03:28.400> I<00:03:28.699> had

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
I wanted to land it manually after I had

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.199 
I wanted to land it manually after I had
had<00:03:30.169> regained<00:03:30.530> you<00:03:31.220> know<00:03:31.340> range<00:03:31.639> to<00:03:32.030> where<00:03:32.180> I

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
had regained you know range to where I

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.229 
had regained you know range to where I
could<00:03:32.569> grab<00:03:33.439> it<00:03:33.470> communicate<00:03:34.129> with<00:03:34.280> it<00:03:34.430> but<00:03:35.209> I

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
could grab it communicate with it but I

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.759 
could grab it communicate with it but I
didn't<00:03:35.479> realize<00:03:35.750> at<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:36.019> time<00:03:36.049> that<00:03:36.439> to<00:03:36.590> do

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
didn't realize at the time that to do

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.599 
didn't realize at the time that to do
that<00:03:37.009> you've<00:03:37.790> got<00:03:37.970> a<00:03:38.000> toggle<00:03:38.359> switch<00:03:39.400> on<00:03:40.400> the

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
that you've got a toggle switch on the

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.509 
that you've got a toggle switch on the
controller<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.180> regain<00:03:41.859> to<00:03:42.859> regain<00:03:43.129> manual

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
controller to regain to regain manual

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.270 
controller to regain to regain manual
control<00:03:43.849> so<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.180> result<00:03:44.509> was<00:03:44.750> is<00:03:45.049> that<00:03:45.159> it<00:03:46.159> was

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
control so the result was is that it was

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.740 
control so the result was is that it was
going<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:46.489> land<00:03:46.639> itself<00:03:47.000> whether<00:03:47.269> I<00:03:47.329> liked<00:03:47.599> it

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
going to land itself whether I liked it

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.069 
going to land itself whether I liked it
or<00:03:47.840> not

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
or not

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.259 
or not
because<00:03:48.859> I<00:03:49.009> wasn't<00:03:49.250> familiar<00:03:49.489> enough<00:03:49.909> with<00:03:49.970> it

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
because I wasn't familiar enough with it

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.399 
because I wasn't familiar enough with it
at<00:03:50.359> that<00:03:50.509> point<00:03:50.720> in<00:03:50.840> time<00:03:50.900> to<00:03:51.290> know<00:03:51.849> that<00:03:53.409> that

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
at that point in time to know that that

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.179 
at that point in time to know that that
I<00:03:54.530> could<00:03:54.709> abort<00:03:55.069> the<00:03:55.370> automated<00:03:56.359> return<00:03:56.750> home

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:57.189 
I could abort the automated return home

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:59.259 
I could abort the automated return home
by<00:03:58.189> toggling<00:03:58.699> that<00:03:58.790> switch<00:03:59.030> on<00:03:59.209> the

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
by toggling that switch on the

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.149 
by toggling that switch on the
controller<00:03:59.599> so<00:03:59.810> just<00:04:00.049> another<00:04:00.290> another

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:01.159 
controller so just another another

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:03.159 
controller so just another another
reminder<00:04:01.759> to<00:04:01.879> everyone<00:04:02.269> yeah<00:04:02.479> it<00:04:02.599> works<00:04:02.840> great

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
know should it go into returned home

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.890 
know should it go into returned home
state<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:14.000> maybe<00:04:14.269> you<00:04:14.479> need<00:04:14.629> to<00:04:14.719> land
