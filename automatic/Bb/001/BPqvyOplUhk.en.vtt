so<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.980> lecture<00:02:38.250> shear<00:02:38.520> horn<00:02:38.760> Gil<00:02:39.360> Bros

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
so the lecture shear horn Gil Bros

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.600 
so the lecture shear horn Gil Bros
feature<00:02:40.020> an<00:02:40.440> internal<00:02:40.890> baffle<00:02:41.280> which<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.580> a

Tim shear horn helped a design the sound

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.390 
Tim shear horn helped a design the sound
post<00:02:51.600> design<00:02:51.990> sample<00:02:52.650> design<00:02:52.890> which<00:02:53.100> is<00:02:53.220> very

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
post design sample design which is very

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.850 
post design sample design which is very
similar<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:54.030> violent<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.590> there's

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
similar to a violent and that there's

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.470 
similar to a violent and that there's
sound<00:02:56.040> post<00:02:56.340> kind<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.700> surrounding<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.270> cone

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
sound post kind of surrounding the cone

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.020 
sound post kind of surrounding the cone
that<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.680> linked<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.160> top<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.640> back<00:02:59.820> so

that that linked the top in the back so

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.580 
that that linked the top in the back so
