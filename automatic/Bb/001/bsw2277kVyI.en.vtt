after about 20 minutes of boiling away
you'll<00:01:45.300> notice<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:45.870> lost<00:01:46.080> about<00:01:46.320> half<00:01:46.560> of

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
you'll notice it it's lost about half of

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.780 
you'll notice it it's lost about half of
its<00:01:46.800> liquid<00:01:46.980> I'm<00:01:47.220> going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.400> turn<00:01:47.550> it<00:01:47.640> down<00:01:47.670> to

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
its liquid I'm going to turn it down to

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.610 
its liquid I'm going to turn it down to
a<00:01:47.940> light<00:01:48.090> simmer<00:01:48.360> there<00:01:48.660> and<00:01:48.870> you<00:01:49.170> can<00:01:49.320> see<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
a light simmer there and you can see the

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.410 
a light simmer there and you can see the
line<00:01:49.800> where<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.160> original<00:01:50.550> level<00:01:50.790> was<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.330> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
line where the original level was on the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.150 
line where the original level was on the
liquid<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:52.140> going<00:01:52.380> down<00:01:52.530> about<00:01:52.800> half<00:01:52.980> that

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
liquid it's going down about half that

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.070 
liquid it's going down about half that
amount<00:01:53.220> I'm<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.300> go<00:01:54.390> ahead<00:01:54.480> and<00:01:54.810> give<00:01:54.990> it

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
amount I'm going to go ahead and give it

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.020 
amount I'm going to go ahead and give it
a<00:01:55.140> little<00:01:55.230> stir<00:01:55.650> here<00:01:56.010> the<00:01:56.220> consistency<00:01:56.850> we're

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
a little stir here the consistency we're

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.820 
a little stir here the consistency we're
looking<00:01:57.300> for<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.440> should<00:01:58.560> hold<00:01:58.740> a

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
looking for is that it should hold a

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.200 
looking for is that it should hold a
line<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.310> back<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.700> spoon<00:01:59.820> when<00:02:00.150> you

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
line on the back of a spoon when you

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.270 
line on the back of a spoon when you
draw<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.450> your<00:02:00.660> finger<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.860> that's

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
draw on your finger like that so that's

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.340 
draw on your finger like that so that's
about<00:02:02.460> as<00:02:02.580> thick<00:02:02.730> as<00:02:02.850> we<00:02:03.000> want<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.330> keep<00:02:04.260> in

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
about as thick as we want it keep in

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.410 
about as thick as we want it keep in
mind<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.740> as<00:02:04.830> it<00:02:04.980> cools<00:02:05.220> down<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:06.090> will<00:02:06.240> tend<00:02:06.360> to

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
mind it as it cools down it will tend to

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.120 
mind it as it cools down it will tend to
thicken<00:02:06.660> up<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.930> little<00:02:07.110> bit<00:02:07.260> more<00:02:07.470> it's<00:02:07.770> really

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
thicken up a little bit more it's really

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.040 
thicken up a little bit more it's really
important<00:02:08.520> not<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.700> burn<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.000> at<00:02:09.570> that<00:02:09.780> point

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
important not to burn it at that point

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.930 
important not to burn it at that point
we're<00:02:10.229> ready<00:02:10.380> to<00:02:10.530> take<00:02:10.710> it<00:02:10.860> we<00:02:11.340> put<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.640> into<00:02:11.790> a
