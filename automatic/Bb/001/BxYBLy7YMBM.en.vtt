underneath this skid plate so this one

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.370 
underneath this skid plate so this one
up<00:02:34.310> top<00:02:34.520> it's<00:02:35.270> difficult<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.750> get<00:02:35.930> out<00:02:36.080> if

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
up top it's difficult to get out if

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.250 
up top it's difficult to get out if
you're<00:02:36.530> just<00:02:36.680> using<00:02:37.450> card<00:02:38.450> racks<00:02:38.810> like<00:02:38.990> myself

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
you're just using card racks like myself

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.590 
you're just using card racks like myself
and<00:02:39.770> you<00:02:39.830> don't<00:02:40.010> have<00:02:40.130> your<00:02:40.280> own<00:02:40.600> pneumatic

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
and you don't have your own pneumatic

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.060 
and you don't have your own pneumatic
lift<00:02:41.840> I<00:02:42.490> wish<00:02:43.490> I<00:02:43.700> had<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:43.880> pneumatic<00:02:44.330> lift<00:02:45.070> okay

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
lift I wish I had a pneumatic lift okay

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.010 
lift I wish I had a pneumatic lift okay
anyway<00:02:46.400> I<00:02:46.640> have<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:46.970> fuel<00:02:47.150> filter<00:02:47.480> exposed

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
anyway I have the fuel filter exposed

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.600 
anyway I have the fuel filter exposed
right<00:02:48.410> now<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:50.120> can<00:02:50.300> see<00:02:50.630> up<00:02:50.780> in<00:02:50.960> there<00:02:51.610> that

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
right now you can see up in there that

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.170 
right now you can see up in there that
is<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.270> fuel<00:02:53.540> filter<00:02:54.460> attached<00:02:55.460> it's<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.030> old

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180

one all right so I'm gonna give them a
crack<00:02:59.510> at<00:02:59.750> it<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.100> try<00:03:01.100> to<00:03:01.160> get<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:01.460> out<00:03:01.580> okay

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.210 

here's<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.510> fuel<00:03:05.780> filter<00:03:06.110> clamp<00:03:06.500> this<00:03:06.890> goes

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
here's the fuel filter clamp this goes

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.460 
here's the fuel filter clamp this goes
over<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:07.610> fuel<00:03:07.820> filter<00:03:08.150> over<00:03:08.630> that<00:03:08.750> plastic

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
over the fuel filter over that plastic

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.430 
over the fuel filter over that plastic
band<00:03:10.010> on<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.610> fuel<00:03:10.820> filter<00:03:11.150> just<00:03:12.080> requires

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
band on the fuel filter just requires

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.860 
band on the fuel filter just requires
just<00:03:12.680> one<00:03:12.920> ten<00:03:13.430> millimeter<00:03:13.790> screw<00:03:14.180> right<00:03:14.630> in

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
just one ten millimeter screw right in

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.510 
just one ten millimeter screw right in
there

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
there

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.170 
there
right<00:03:16.520> in<00:03:16.970> there<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.709> I<00:03:19.520> had<00:03:19.730> jiggle<00:03:20.000> it<00:03:20.060> out<00:03:20.150> a

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
right in there and I had jiggle it out a

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.729 
right in there and I had jiggle it out a
little<00:03:20.300> bit<00:03:20.510> because<00:03:20.690> mine<00:03:21.320> was<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.500> little<00:03:21.650> bit

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
little bit because mine was a little bit

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.610 
little bit because mine was a little bit
stuck<00:03:22.209> so<00:03:23.209> I<00:03:23.270> had<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:23.600> it<00:03:23.959> will<00:03:24.080> force<00:03:24.380> and

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
stuck so I had to it will force and

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.979 
stuck so I had to it will force and
jiggle<00:03:24.950> it<00:03:25.070> came<00:03:25.970> right<00:03:26.120> out<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.750> fuel

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
jiggle it came right out the fuel

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.150 
jiggle it came right out the fuel
filters<00:03:27.290> still<00:03:27.500> in<00:03:27.650> there<00:03:27.800> with<00:03:27.830> the<00:03:27.980> line

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.320 
okay I got the fuel filter out and I got
buckets<00:03:39.410> one<00:03:39.680> bugs<00:03:39.890> already<00:03:40.160> full<00:03:40.370> of<00:03:40.520> gas<00:03:40.790> so

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
buckets one bugs already full of gas so

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.170 
buckets one bugs already full of gas so
lots<00:03:42.200> of<00:03:42.320> gas<00:03:42.530> comes<00:03:42.860> out<00:03:43.040> even<00:03:43.940> though<00:03:44.030> I<00:03:44.060> have

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
lots of gas comes out even though I have

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.170 
lots of gas comes out even though I have
cold<00:03:44.540> fuse<00:03:45.050> 54<00:03:45.890> which<00:03:46.190> turned<00:03:46.550> off<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:46.910> fuel

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
cold fuse 54 which turned off the fuel

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.350 
cold fuse 54 which turned off the fuel
pump<00:03:47.709> there's<00:03:48.709> still<00:03:48.890> a<00:03:48.920> lot<00:03:49.370> of<00:03:49.700> fuel<00:03:50.000> I<00:03:50.150> don't

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
pump there's still a lot of fuel I don't

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.610 
pump there's still a lot of fuel I don't
even<00:03:50.450> know<00:03:50.660> why<00:03:50.840> they're<00:03:51.050> still<00:03:51.260> coming<00:03:51.530> out

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
even know why they're still coming out

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.000 
even know why they're still coming out
of<00:03:51.739> there

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
of there

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.680 
of there
hopefully<00:03:52.970> I'll<00:03:53.090> stop<00:03:53.450> because<00:03:54.760> I<00:03:55.760> don't<00:03:56.600> have

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
hopefully I'll stop because I don't have

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.440 
hopefully I'll stop because I don't have
a<00:03:56.810> fuel<00:03:57.019> tank<00:03:57.260> we'll<00:03:57.470> think<00:03:57.650> of<00:03:57.830> gas<00:03:58.450> anyway

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
a fuel tank we'll think of gas anyway

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.449 
a fuel tank we'll think of gas anyway
that's<00:03:59.660> what<00:03:59.780> wasn't<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.110> good<00:04:00.230> idea

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
that's what wasn't a good idea

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.759 
that's what wasn't a good idea
it's<00:04:01.909> fine<00:04:02.150> it's<00:04:02.780> get<00:04:02.989> a<00:04:03.019> little<00:04:03.230> slower<00:04:03.739> I

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
it's fine it's get a little slower I

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.780 
it's fine it's get a little slower I
think<00:04:04.239> it's<00:04:05.239> all<00:04:05.360> gas<00:04:05.510> though<00:04:06.549> okay<00:04:07.549> here's

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
think it's all gas though okay here's

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.839 
think it's all gas though okay here's
the<00:04:07.879> old<00:04:08.030> fuel<00:04:08.269> pump<00:04:08.829> think<00:04:09.829> it's<00:04:10.010> clogged<00:04:10.640> up

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
the old fuel pump think it's clogged up

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.440 
the old fuel pump think it's clogged up
and<00:04:11.120> uh<00:04:11.540> oh<00:04:12.730> it's<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:13.849> new<00:04:14.030> one<00:04:14.180> it's<00:04:14.329> been
