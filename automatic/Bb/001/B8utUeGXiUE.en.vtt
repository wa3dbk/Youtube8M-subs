what you want to do if you're harvesting
these<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:41.009> young<00:01:41.159> look<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.000> going

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
these the young look like this is going

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.590 
these the young look like this is going
to<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> most<00:01:42.689> tender<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:44.180> least<00:01:45.180> prickly

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
to be the most tender and least prickly

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.990 
to be the most tender and least prickly
as<00:01:45.780> they<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.399> gets<00:01:47.549> later<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
as they get as it gets later in the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.350 
as they get as it gets later in the
season<00:01:48.210> they<00:01:48.570> will<00:01:48.780> get<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.140> harsher<00:01:49.710> sting<00:01:50.360> and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
season they will get a harsher sting and

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.149 
season they will get a harsher sting and
it<00:01:51.810> will<00:01:51.930> be<00:01:52.079> more<00:01:52.259> difficult<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.799> handle<00:01:52.950> them

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
it will be more difficult to handle them

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.990 
it will be more difficult to handle them
but<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.759> still<00:01:54.000> recommend<00:01:54.299> gloves<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:56.100> can<00:01:56.130> at

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
but I still recommend gloves you can at

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.749 
but I still recommend gloves you can at
any<00:01:57.270> time<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:58.049> can<00:01:58.259> harvest<00:01:58.530> these<00:01:58.890> just<00:01:59.399> by

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
any time you can harvest these just by

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.550 
any time you can harvest these just by
trimming<00:02:00.060> off<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.420> green<00:02:00.600> growing<00:02:00.840> tops<00:02:01.200> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
trimming off the green growing tops and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.859 
trimming off the green growing tops and
then<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.070> take<00:02:02.310> them<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.420> use<00:02:03.630> them

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
then you take them in and you use them

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.959 
then you take them in and you use them
just<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.740> would<00:02:04.860> any<00:02:05.219> other<00:02:05.310> cook<00:02:05.700> green

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
just like you would any other cook green

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.440 
just like you would any other cook green
like<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> cook<00:02:06.780> spinach<00:02:07.229> or<00:02:07.530> kale<00:02:08.179> you<00:02:09.179> want<00:02:09.360> to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
like a cook spinach or kale you want to

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.869 
like a cook spinach or kale you want to
cook<00:02:09.660> for<00:02:09.959> at<00:02:10.860> least<00:02:11.009> 10<00:02:11.340> minutes<00:02:11.520> till

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
cook for at least 10 minutes till

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.190 
cook for at least 10 minutes till
they're<00:02:12.030> nice<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.239> tender<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.780> that

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
they're nice and tender and that

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.530 
they're nice and tender and that
we'll<00:02:13.290> actually<00:02:13.610> get<00:02:14.610> rid<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:15.090> chemical

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
we'll actually get rid of the chemical

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.330 
we'll actually get rid of the chemical
that<00:02:15.569> causes<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.230> burning<00:02:16.500> sensation<00:02:16.680> so

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
that causes the burning sensation so

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.920 
that causes the burning sensation so
they'll<00:02:17.519> be<00:02:17.640> safer<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.060> eat<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.540> then<00:02:18.750> serve
