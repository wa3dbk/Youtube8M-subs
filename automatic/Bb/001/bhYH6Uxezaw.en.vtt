 hey want and friends of woking monsters 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.029
 droid and we are in a double video review 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:23.349
 good more than anything is a mod that happened to me 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:25.090
 a good companion youtuber model mother 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.419
 subscribers who want to call 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.940
 called rj m c 95 and well it's also 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.850
 topic for which I became a subscriber 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.920
 that 607 nef on twitter here is my 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.990
 system so that the truth is cool and 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.250
 the text from there emerges and well I said that 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.710
 do the review here and well said 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.989
 that we're going to ask you here is the mode is 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.310
 a dispenser and what it does if 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.650
 you remember this is a very similar way 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.080
 at that time in which you after 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.360
 puts an object in the chest and with touching 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.430
 the top part will generate the 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.320
 object infinitely the mod that you 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.600
 suit was like well over a year if not 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.330
 I was wrong it was a long time ago and 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.620
 it was a little less less polished was with 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.239
 a 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.119
 they were different materials that ocher to 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.470
 quartz wood something like that also wore 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.780
 a chest but with is that by touching the 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.869
 part above the dispenser voted 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.369
 voted voted without paying him what 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.530
 he got in like that was like a factory 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.180
 immense that did not stop this one is more more 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.220
 delicate I like it more like that because good 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.110
 you can get as many as you want 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.180
 but with its control simply with 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.009
 touching the glass will come out the glass is 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.070
 as the button now as everything is created 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.100
 this as if nothing else the crafter we are going to 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.900
 need 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.030
 for the dispenser we're going to need a 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.060
 we create it and redstone arch and 7 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.040
 we will also need what is a 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.520
 this glass let's put what you read 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.259
 thinker here where they want to put 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.909
 and we're going to put the glass up that is 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.920
 the button as I say we are a chest 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.720
 also the chest will put it where 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.810
 want the object to come out for example 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.299
 if I put the chest as if I put the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.130
 chest on this side the objects go to 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.450
 leave this side if I put the chest 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.880
 on this side the points will come out of 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.489
 this side then for all to be 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.800
 more ordered to be like they come out 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.960
 of the milestones we are going to put the chest here 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.200
 behind 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.780
 Look, it 's good we check before what 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.630
 we want to multiply the food weapons what 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.790
 make it and a sofa the glass and pon goes to 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.860
 start voting what we want 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.960
 multiplied are very father the mod is a 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.100
 Evolution of the commune that I brought to you 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.710
 a long time already has more than a year 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.210

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.830
 times download this video you want the 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.260

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.240
 quite and also thanks to psuv that 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.040
 my this map you already know to be active 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.110
 the meeting maps sperian law yes 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.500

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.239
 change the chest place 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.569
 can change the take the place I'm 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.090
 breaking with my hand I know fail if I 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.980
 we put here all objects 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.790
 that we put for example in this case 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.760
 let's use this sword 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.239
 everything we put in is going to come out now 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.239
 here look 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.580
 there's how you can see it's coming out 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.200
 on this side it always depends as I say 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.210
 where I put the chest but it works 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.950
 very good and good the map the map 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.930

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.790

 to see this house I liked that more here 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.170

 make me mountain children 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.770

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.760
 that they like that the matter exists here 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.760

 which I have not found 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.530

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.520

 when I go to this place 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.009
 knowing who to sell man 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.389

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.460

 videos for enjoy the mod the link of 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.180
 download goes up in the discussion not 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.300
 requires texture or anything else 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.310
 It gets at point j this blog launcher 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.540
 comfort is taught if you do not know how 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.160

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.170

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.850
 blog launcher completely but same 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.030

 Download folder where they have the mod 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.650

 is 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.449
 here is dispenser they have to check 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:53.999
 that is so if it is deactivated what 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.279
 activate and ready and then nothing I think 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:59.039
