00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello to all and we find ourselves in front of 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.230
 a new shiny so I'm very 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.110
 happy because it was absolutely my 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.370
 target we are in front of a zig zaton janis 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.440
 and the second in the horde and it was 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.940
 really my target because following the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.100
 last live I had done we had 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.320
 did we take a big frenzy by 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.939
 report to zig zaton so that's for sure and 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.560
 some I already know the name I'm going 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.960
 to give he is really very pretty he is 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.019
 defeat really differentiates from the others 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.870
 it is very light brown compared to its 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.960
 willingness of habit is the same the eyes 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.090
 chestnuts short we'll do a little bit the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:45.390
 cleaning up we start with those 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:48.030
 who are all right that's cool 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.920
 I was afraid of falling still sure 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.590
 lee potts good at worst that would not have me 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.920
 really disturbed since I will have to 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.109
 mushrooms and grandpa knox but I would have 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.809
 could also have fallen on low stockings but 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.910
 frankly it would have been nice but 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.280
 this is my target it was true it is 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.619
 good he fell I think I would have 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.420
 hard to trap and frankly it's 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.790
 a bit like a very weak question 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:20.189
 level and he has a big catch rate 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:22.710
 so everything should go for the best I 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.659
 will finally be able to add my saying 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.540
 that's how I'm going to make them famous 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.040
 whose sect of the tao zips 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.540
 in addition it is a woman she falls 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.549
 good because all the people who 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.670
 sent me a screen of the exact time 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.770
 we on euros chagny named hesitant and well 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.320
 it was all males I noticed and 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.590
 well I'll be a little female 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.079
 here we are still going to fall asleep just 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.799
 story of really not breaking the 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.700
 hazelnuts to catch the zig zag 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.450
 we never know he can still 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.799
 stand out and to the standards bowl I saw 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.070
 someone who capture in honor ball 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.170
 6 and and really critical capture I 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.790
 do a lot huh 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.890
 if you look at the other videos of 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.310
 kennel where I capture the at the time of the 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.140
 capture 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.390
 there are a lot of videos where I'm doing 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.910
 critical catches it's amazing and that 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.890
 since pokemon xy and it's even worse 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.920
 sure 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.350
 pokemon x I do even more I know 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.870
 not if it's dying to catch all the 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.880
 pokemon time but in any case we 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.819
 would say of course x I've already landed 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.370
 short question here it is beautiful 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.950
 that's right we humans all brown 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.320
 already have a little thief with his stuff 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.910
 on black eyes it's gone we will 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:47.270
 rhÃ´ne the hectares where are they 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:50.600
 help and no if I forget it's okay 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:55.370
 not do it no it's not there who go there 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.050
 and I hope you 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.910
 pleased to see when I succeeded 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.209
 me too and captured this zig zaton 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.720
 szczesny so let's see by now 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.880
 nature where he has pickup 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.500
 ok I did not even have a pokemon with 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.470
 pickup it can be interesting 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.690
 time anyway for the adventurous or for 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.739
 caen not be bored for the fights well 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.570
 sure and he's modest changes I capture 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.070
 very rarely modest pokemon is 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.660
 maybe not the best on exact one 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:28.610
 put in any case that's super nice 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.850
 we will put him first in the team 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.890
 hold an object like I had not seen 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.200
 so what made him take 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.690
 he has a potion well it's always 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.190
 it's taken 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.010
 that's it for zig zaton I was doing 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.239
 hordes of course i did not hunt exact 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.340
 we had qs but we could 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.430
 as fair as I said to myself good 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.600
 maybe it's going faster in horde 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.269
 then I did not mind falling on 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.530
 caterpillar pole low lignon at the pinch 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.700
 so here I have hordes I know 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.680
 not how much because I do not count 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.160
 especially the hordes but I know 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.230
 nothing 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.080
 I did not do too much either 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.700
 twenties maybe that's what what without 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.940
 pokemon that's pretty much without 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.260
 pokemon met in total to I want 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.410
 look at his opinion of aix to tell you 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.410
 exactly 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:19.010
 attention dictates we go back into the 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:21.019
 fight but here he is super nice 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.690
 I will not change it anyway 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.560
 it's out of the question ict love is 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.230
 victories that's how it does not 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.000
 will never become a guinea at play 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.890
 capture to another exact on for the 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.920
 evolve the see in the entrance of the 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:39.140
 chained pokedex but I will not do 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.500
 evolve this one since it is a 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.840
 female 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.610
 so if I come back to the bugs ah yes 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.630
 still if I look at my opinion of aix 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.530
 and I met a lot of people 1 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.780
 I made 7,107 meetings total of 6 to 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.270
 your game I do not think I did 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.040
 as much my god it must be when I 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.780
 chased chauny potent horde i had to 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.370
 to meet a lot of exact ones at the same 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.260
 time of the blow it had to push up the 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.970
 number and well here it is still 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.530
 a big number but I have not seen 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.410
 to pass unlike navy d'aix 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.540
 when I'm hunting it's going a little bit more 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.030
 long anyway when that goes up too 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.980
 up here I did my backup 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.260
 if you too wish to join 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.750
 the sect of ict years are 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.000
 ciani exams of course you can 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.790
 send me your picture of your zig zaton 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.169
 chenni rename in zik time and I 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.910
 close together all this there are already three 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.590
 people and it seems to me that there is 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.260
 two more people who were sending me 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.340
 their photos of iqt chained there 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
 I have to look at this but in any case 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.669
 it's starting to get bigger and I like 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.490
 this little delirium we had 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.870
 coming from the live well I tell you good 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.680
 luck to all and see you soon 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.680
 go bye bye
