plan it can be something that you're

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.919 
plan it can be something that you're
right<00:00:29.640> down<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:29.970> paper<00:00:30.150> or<00:00:30.539> can<00:00:30.749> you<00:00:30.810> be

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
something that you use a program to do

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.700 
something that you use a program to do
but<00:00:33.090> today<00:00:33.360> like<00:00:33.930> Lindsey<00:00:34.230> mentioned<00:00:34.590> we're

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
but today like Lindsey mentioned we're

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.080 
but today like Lindsey mentioned we're
looking<00:00:34.950> at<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> meal<00:00:35.340> watches<00:00:35.790> you've<00:00:35.940> got

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
looking at the meal watches you've got

the shape and I've got the motiva and
essentially<00:00:38.370> what<00:00:38.399> they<00:00:38.640> do<00:00:38.699> is<00:00:39.120> they<00:00:39.239> allow

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
essentially what they do is they allow

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.209 
essentially what they do is they allow
you<00:00:39.539> to<00:00:39.750> take<00:00:39.930> your<00:00:40.079> heart<00:00:40.350> rate<00:00:40.559> they<00:00:40.980> allow

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
rate of about 80 yeah you're probably

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.650 
rate of about 80 yeah you're probably
clocking<00:01:27.870> in<00:01:27.930> about<00:01:28.200> 140<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.830> was<00:01:29.100> 150<00:01:29.660> well

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
clocking in about 140 I was 150 well

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.000 
clocking in about 140 I was 150 well
what's<00:01:30.780> interesting<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.560> motive<00:01:31.890> or

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
what's interesting is in the motive or

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.200 
what's interesting is in the motive or
watch<00:01:32.160> the<00:01:32.370> one<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.610> I'm<00:01:32.760> looking<00:01:32.910> at

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
watch the one that I'm looking at

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.460 
watch the one that I'm looking at
there's<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.510> number<00:01:33.660> of<00:01:33.780> things<00:01:33.870> you<00:01:34.080> can<00:01:34.230> do

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
there's a number of things you can do

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.080 
there's a number of things you can do
first<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.160> all<00:01:35.250> I'm<00:01:35.400> going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.610> take<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:35.880> off

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
first of all I'm going to take this off

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.490 
first of all I'm going to take this off
just<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.900> little<00:01:37.170> bit<00:01:37.350> easier

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
just so that it is a little bit easier

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.910 
just so that it is a little bit easier
to<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:38.070> but<00:01:38.870> we<00:01:39.870> talked<00:01:40.350> about<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.680> fact<00:01:40.800> that

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
to see but we talked about the fact that

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.200 
to see but we talked about the fact that
it<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.220> measure<00:01:41.370> your<00:01:41.520> heart<00:01:41.760> rate<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.120> you

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
it can measure your heart rate but you

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.910 
it can measure your heart rate but you
can<00:01:42.360> also<00:01:42.570> go<00:01:42.870> in<00:01:43.050> and<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.680> things

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
can also go in and you can do things

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.650 
can also go in and you can do things
like<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.400> example<00:01:44.490> keep<00:01:45.000> track<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
like for example keep track of the

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.240 
like for example keep track of the
different<00:01:45.900> calories<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.770> you're<00:01:46.890> burning

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
different calories that you're burning

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.120 
different calories that you're burning
for<00:01:47.700> example<00:01:48.120> if<00:01:48.300> you<00:01:48.810> eat<00:01:49.260> a<00:01:49.290> meal<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.980> can

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
for example if you eat a meal you can

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.130 
for example if you eat a meal you can
actually<00:01:50.280> enter<00:01:50.580> that<00:01:51.000> into<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.810> device<00:01:52.080> and

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
actually enter that into the device and

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.110 
actually enter that into the device and
it'll<00:01:52.500> keep<00:01:52.620> track<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.920> how<00:01:53.130> many<00:01:53.190> meals<00:01:53.790> I've

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
it'll keep track of how many meals I've

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.640 
it'll keep track of how many meals I've
eaten<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.540> day<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.840> what<00:01:54.930> my<00:01:55.020> calorie<00:01:55.380> count

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
eaten that day and what my calorie count

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.770 
eaten that day and what my calorie count
is<00:01:55.800> up<00:01:55.830> to<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.250> because<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.270> went<00:01:57.540> through<00:01:57.690> it

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
is up to and because I went through it

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.330 
is up to and because I went through it
during<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.170> setup<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.620> the<00:01:58.680> first<00:01:58.890> time<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.310> I

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
during the setup in the first time and I

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.940 
during the setup in the first time and I
put<00:01:59.550> in<00:01:59.670> my<00:01:59.730> age<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.420> put<00:02:00.660> in<00:02:00.750> my<00:02:00.780> weight<00:02:01.140> which<00:02:01.800> i

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
put in my age I put in my weight which i

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.520 
put in my age I put in my weight which i
might<00:02:02.160> not<00:02:02.280> tell<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.670> guys<00:02:03.020> but<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.230> because

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
might not tell you guys but that because

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.080 
might not tell you guys but that because
I<00:02:04.620> put<00:02:04.770> all<00:02:04.800> that<00:02:04.980> information<00:02:05.160> in<00:02:05.610> there<00:02:05.760> it's

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
I put all that information in there it's

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.670 
I put all that information in there it's
sort<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.330> calculated<00:02:06.900> what<00:02:07.050> a<00:02:07.080> healthy<00:02:07.380> amount

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
sort of calculated what a healthy amount

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.770 
sort of calculated what a healthy amount
of<00:02:07.830> calories<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.459> should<00:02:08.940> be<00:02:09.060> consuming<00:02:09.569> each

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
of calories I should be consuming each

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.630 
of calories I should be consuming each
day<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.560> can<00:02:10.679> go<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.009> further<00:02:11.310> tweak

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
day and you can go in and further tweak

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.099 
day and you can go in and further tweak
that<00:02:11.790> with<00:02:11.970> different<00:02:12.270> software<00:02:12.660> or<00:02:12.810> even

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:13.109 
that with different software or even

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:14.959 
that with different software or even
kind<00:02:13.349> of<00:02:13.439> looking<00:02:13.769> at<00:02:14.280> what<00:02:14.519> you<00:02:14.609> should<00:02:14.819> be

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:14.969 
kind of looking at what you should be

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:16.640 
kind of looking at what you should be
taking<00:02:15.120> but<00:02:15.450> does<00:02:15.629> a<00:02:15.659> general<00:02:16.109> calculation

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
taking but does a general calculation

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.920 
taking but does a general calculation
based<00:02:16.769> on<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.159> and<00:02:17.400> then<00:02:17.700> I

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
based on that and then I

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.690 
based on that and then I
tell<00:02:18.109> it<00:02:18.230> how<00:02:18.319> active<00:02:18.799> I<00:02:18.920> am<00:02:19.099> so<00:02:19.340> whether<00:02:19.519> I'm

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
tell it how active I am so whether I'm

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.520 
tell it how active I am so whether I'm
highly<00:02:20.060> active<00:02:20.420> or<00:02:20.599> regularly<00:02:20.959> active<00:02:21.349> and

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
highly active or regularly active and

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.860 
highly active or regularly active and
then<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:21.920> can<00:02:22.129> actually<00:02:22.250> go<00:02:22.519> in<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:22.730> set<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.420> goal

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
then I can actually go in and set a goal

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.839 
then I can actually go in and set a goal
like<00:02:23.930> fur<00:02:24.439> hat<00:02:24.620> perhaps<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.219> want<00:02:25.549> to<00:02:25.640> lose<00:02:25.790> a

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
like fur hat perhaps I want to lose a

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.819 
like fur hat perhaps I want to lose a
pound<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.299> week<00:02:26.480> or<00:02:26.689> maybe<00:02:26.810> gain<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.200> pound<00:02:27.469> per

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
pound a week or maybe gain a pound per

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.890 
pound a week or maybe gain a pound per
week<00:02:28.010> in<00:02:28.459> my<00:02:28.579> case<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:28.879> want<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.090> lose<00:02:29.239> it<00:02:29.269> but<00:02:29.870> I

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
week in my case I want to lose it but I

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.149 
week in my case I want to lose it but I
can<00:02:30.109> actually<00:02:30.230> put<00:02:30.469> that<00:02:30.590> information<00:02:30.829> in

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
can actually put that information in

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.009 
can actually put that information in
there<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.519> from<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:31.969> it<00:02:32.299> allows<00:02:32.510> me<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.840> keep

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
there and from that it allows me to keep

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.170 
there and from that it allows me to keep
track<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:33.560> calories<00:02:33.739> both<00:02:34.549> at<00:02:34.730> I'm<00:02:34.819> taking

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
track of the calories both at I'm taking

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.059 
track of the calories both at I'm taking
in<00:02:35.329> but<00:02:35.719> as<00:02:35.840> well<00:02:36.019> as<00:02:36.200> when<00:02:36.409> I<00:02:36.439> start<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:36.739> do<00:02:36.920> my

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
in but as well as when I start to do my

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.649 
in but as well as when I start to do my
workouts<00:02:37.489> it<00:02:37.790> allows<00:02:38.000> me<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.269> keep<00:02:38.420> track<00:02:38.599> of

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
workouts it allows me to keep track of

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.629 
workouts it allows me to keep track of
how<00:02:38.870> many<00:02:38.930> calories<00:02:39.260> I'm<00:02:39.590> burning<00:02:40.010> therefore

how many calories I'm burning therefore

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.520 
how many calories I'm burning therefore
I've<00:02:40.760> got<00:02:40.939> my<00:02:41.060> plan<00:02:41.329> in<00:02:41.510> place<00:02:41.629> to<00:02:42.170> be<00:02:42.200> able<00:02:42.319> to

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
achieve my goal to lose a couple pounds

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.149 
achieve my goal to lose a couple pounds
it's<00:02:45.019> definitely<00:02:45.230> right<00:02:45.680> one<00:02:45.829> of<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:45.980> things

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
it's definitely right one of the things

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.470 
it's definitely right one of the things
that<00:02:46.219> I<00:02:46.340> like<00:02:46.519> to<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:46.849> it's<00:02:46.969> actually<00:02:47.299> got<00:02:47.450> a

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
that I like to is it's actually got a

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.599 
that I like to is it's actually got a
little<00:02:47.689> monitor<00:02:48.139> on<00:02:48.290> AJ's<00:02:48.889> watch<00:02:49.129> there<00:02:49.459> it's

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
little monitor on AJ's watch there it's

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.849 
little monitor on AJ's watch there it's
got<00:02:49.879> about<00:02:50.510> 10<00:02:50.840> different<00:02:50.989> bars<00:02:51.409> that<00:02:51.709> move

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
got about 10 different bars that move

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.649 
got about 10 different bars that move
across<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.340> front<00:02:52.549> there<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:52.879> gauge<00:02:53.120> how

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
across the front there to gauge how

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.270 
across the front there to gauge how
close<00:02:54.019> or<00:02:54.230> far<00:02:54.260> away<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:54.709> are<00:02:54.829> from<00:02:54.980> your

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
close or far away you are from your

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.520 
close or far away you are from your
target<00:02:55.669> for<00:02:55.849> that<00:02:55.939> day<00:02:56.180> on<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.079> women's<00:02:57.349> watch

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
target for that day on the women's watch

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.599 
target for that day on the women's watch
here<00:02:57.769> it<00:02:57.799> actually<00:02:57.950> breaks<00:02:58.220> it<00:02:58.430> down<00:02:58.549> into

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
here it actually breaks it down into

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.159 
here it actually breaks it down into
three<00:02:59.030> steps<00:02:59.359> so<00:02:59.569> it<00:02:59.720> tells<00:02:59.900> you<00:03:00.019> whether

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.169 
three steps so it tells you whether

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.110 
three steps so it tells you whether
you're<00:03:00.379> a<00:03:00.409> third<00:03:00.739> two<00:03:01.010> thirds<00:03:01.340> or<00:03:01.549> whether<00:03:02.000> or

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
you're a third two thirds or whether or

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.490 
you're a third two thirds or whether or
not<00:03:02.209> you've<00:03:02.359> reached<00:03:02.599> your<00:03:02.719> goal<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.230> one<00:03:03.379> of

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.679 
get on the track point that's true one
of<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:16.669> other<00:03:16.790> things<00:03:16.879> I<00:03:17.209> noticed<00:03:17.540> between

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:17.689 
of the other things I noticed between

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.379 
of the other things I noticed between
the<00:03:17.989> two<00:03:18.139> watches<00:03:18.639> is<00:03:19.639> the<00:03:19.790> women's<00:03:20.060> watch<00:03:20.209> it

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
the two watches is the women's watch it

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.149 
the two watches is the women's watch it
only<00:03:20.510> allows<00:03:20.689> you<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.079> enter<00:03:21.200> three<00:03:21.709> different

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 
only allows you to enter three different

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.890 
only allows you to enter three different
meals<00:03:22.370> per<00:03:22.729> day<00:03:22.760> before<00:03:23.239> it<00:03:23.299> resets<00:03:23.720> itself

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
meals per day before it resets itself

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.559 
meals per day before it resets itself
whereas<00:03:24.560> AJ's<00:03:24.949> yours<00:03:25.220> I<00:03:25.370> believe<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:26.359> allows

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
whereas AJ's yours I believe it allows

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.479 
whereas AJ's yours I believe it allows
you<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.780> track<00:03:27.019> more<00:03:27.290> more<00:03:27.919> meals<00:03:28.099> than<00:03:28.340> that

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
you to track more more meals than that

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:29.800 
you to track more more meals than that
which<00:03:28.639> can<00:03:28.879> come<00:03:29.090> in<00:03:29.209> handy<00:03:29.359> because<00:03:29.599> if

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
which can come in handy because if

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.119 
which can come in handy because if
you're<00:03:29.930> doing<00:03:30.199> weight<00:03:30.349> management<00:03:30.590> they

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
you're doing weight management they

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.159 
you're doing weight management they
often<00:03:31.310> recommend<00:03:31.879> that<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:32.120> eat<00:03:32.239> five<00:03:32.810> small

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
often recommend that you eat five small

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.369 
often recommend that you eat five small
meals<00:03:33.199> a<00:03:33.620> day<00:03:33.909> so<00:03:34.909> this<00:03:35.150> watch<00:03:35.389> may<00:03:35.689> not<00:03:35.870> be<00:03:36.260> the

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
meals a day so this watch may not be the

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.080 
meals a day so this watch may not be the
best<00:03:36.409> for<00:03:37.010> you<00:03:37.159> that<00:03:37.489> one<00:03:37.639> may<00:03:37.790> be<00:03:37.849> a<00:03:37.939> better

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
best for you that one may be a better

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.719 
best for you that one may be a better
option<00:03:38.709> if<00:03:39.709> you're<00:03:39.859> looking<00:03:40.159> to<00:03:40.310> actually<00:03:40.609> eat

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:40.729 
option if you're looking to actually eat

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:42.069 
option if you're looking to actually eat
more<00:03:40.879> than<00:03:41.030> three<00:03:41.209> meals<00:03:41.359> and<00:03:41.629> another<00:03:41.870> mode

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
more than three meals and another mode

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.379 
more than three meals and another mode
that<00:03:42.260> this<00:03:42.439> that<00:03:42.979> the<00:03:43.099> motive<00:03:43.430> i<00:03:43.519> had<00:03:43.699> was

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
that this that the motive i had was

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:45.640 
that this that the motive i had was
something<00:03:44.689> called<00:03:44.840> recovery<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:45.470> I<00:03:45.530> thought

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
something called recovery and I thought

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.050 
something called recovery and I thought
this<00:03:45.769> was<00:03:45.889> quite<00:03:46.099> interesting<00:03:46.609> especially

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
this was quite interesting especially

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.509 
this was quite interesting especially
for<00:03:47.540> people<00:03:47.720> who<00:03:47.930> are<00:03:47.989> quite<00:03:48.199> athletic

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
for people who are quite athletic

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.319 
for people who are quite athletic
basically<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:49.639> idea<00:03:49.669> here<00:03:50.180> is<00:03:50.209> that

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
basically the idea here is that

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.969 
basically the idea here is that
throughout<00:03:50.840> your<00:03:51.049> workout<00:03:51.109> while<00:03:51.769> you've<00:03:51.949> got

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:51.979 
throughout your workout while you've got

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:54.550 
throughout your workout while you've got
the<00:03:52.250> timer<00:03:52.549> set<00:03:52.939> you<00:03:53.419> go<00:03:53.599> and<00:03:53.900> you<00:03:54.079> exercise

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
the timer set you go and you exercise

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.319 
the timer set you go and you exercise
and<00:03:54.829> you<00:03:54.889> get<00:03:55.069> your<00:03:55.220> heart<00:03:55.459> rate<00:03:55.669> up<00:03:55.699> at<00:03:56.030> the

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
and you get your heart rate up at the

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.179 
and you get your heart rate up at the
end<00:03:56.509> of<00:03:56.689> your<00:03:56.840> exercise<00:03:57.349> when<00:03:57.590> you<00:03:57.680> stop<00:03:57.949> that

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:58.189 
end of your exercise when you stop that

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:59.949 
end of your exercise when you stop that
timer<00:03:58.459> you<00:03:58.759> go<00:03:58.909> into<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.239> recovery<00:03:59.659> screen

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
timer you go into the recovery screen

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.899 
timer you go into the recovery screen
and<00:04:00.259> what<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:00.739> does<00:04:00.919> is<00:04:01.220> it'll<00:04:01.489> immediately

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
and what it does is it'll immediately

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.729 
and what it does is it'll immediately
say<00:04:02.389> take<00:04:02.840> your<00:04:02.870> heart<00:04:03.199> rate<00:04:03.349> right<00:04:03.530> now<00:04:03.680> we

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
say take your heart rate right now we

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.649 
say take your heart rate right now we
want<00:04:04.069> to<00:04:04.129> know<00:04:04.280> what<00:04:04.489> your<00:04:04.669> heart<00:04:05.120> rate<00:04:05.269> is<00:04:05.419> at

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.379 
want to know what your heart rate is at
the<00:04:05.750> end<00:04:05.930> of<00:04:06.079> working<00:04:06.470> out<00:04:06.620> then<00:04:07.340> it<00:04:07.909> starts<00:04:08.299> an

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
the end of working out then it starts an

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.719 
the end of working out then it starts an
automatic<00:04:08.959> counter<00:04:09.919> and<00:04:10.129> it<00:04:10.220> counts<00:04:10.519> down<00:04:10.669> a

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:10.729 
automatic counter and it counts down a

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:12.789 
automatic counter and it counts down a
certain<00:04:11.120> amount<00:04:11.269> of<00:04:11.389> time<00:04:11.599> after<00:04:11.900> that<00:04:12.530> time

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
certain amount of time after that time

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.710 
certain amount of time after that time
you<00:04:13.189> take<00:04:13.400> your<00:04:13.549> heart<00:04:13.759> rate<00:04:13.909> again<00:04:14.239> and<00:04:14.540> what

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
you take your heart rate again and what

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.029 
you take your heart rate again and what
it<00:04:14.810> does<00:04:14.930> is<00:04:15.169> it<00:04:15.199> actually<00:04:15.349> tells<00:04:15.709> you<00:04:15.919> how

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
it does is it actually tells you how

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.339 
it does is it actually tells you how
well<00:04:16.280> you're<00:04:16.459> doing<00:04:16.489> the<00:04:17.150> idea<00:04:17.479> is<00:04:17.539> is<00:04:17.989> that

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
well you're doing the idea is is that

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:20.050 
well you're doing the idea is is that
the<00:04:18.470> quicker<00:04:18.769> your<00:04:19.070> heart<00:04:19.310> rate<00:04:19.519> gets<00:04:19.699> from

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
the quicker your heart rate gets from

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.089 
the quicker your heart rate gets from
sort<00:04:20.509> of<00:04:20.570> a<00:04:20.630> high<00:04:20.810> exercise<00:04:21.289> point<00:04:21.650> back<00:04:21.889> to<00:04:21.919> a

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
sort of a high exercise point back to a

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:23.860 
sort of a high exercise point back to a
resting<00:04:22.550> point<00:04:22.729> the<00:04:23.120> better<00:04:23.360> shape<00:04:23.630> you're<00:04:23.840> in

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
resting point the better shape you're in

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.959 
resting point the better shape you're in
if<00:04:24.139> for<00:04:24.440> example<00:04:24.530> you<00:04:25.099> just<00:04:25.400> finish<00:04:25.820> working

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:25.969 
if for example you just finish working

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:27.969 
if for example you just finish working
out<00:04:26.240> and<00:04:26.419> you're<00:04:26.539> like<00:04:26.779> 180<00:04:27.229> and<00:04:27.500> then<00:04:27.770> about

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
out and you're like 180 and then about

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:29.680 
out and you're like 180 and then about
you<00:04:28.340> know<00:04:28.430> a<00:04:28.460> few<00:04:28.669> seconds<00:04:29.150> or<00:04:29.210> a<00:04:29.240> few<00:04:29.419> minutes

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
you know a few seconds or a few minutes

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.660 
you know a few seconds or a few minutes
you're<00:04:29.840> down<00:04:30.020> you're<00:04:30.200> only<00:04:30.380> down<00:04:30.590> to<00:04:30.770> 170

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
you're down you're only down to 170

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.430 
you're down you're only down to 170
you're<00:04:31.790> probably<00:04:32.060> needed<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:33.020> get<00:04:33.170> a<00:04:33.200> little

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
you're probably needed to get a little

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.540 
you're probably needed to get a little
bit<00:04:33.530> further<00:04:33.680> in<00:04:33.860> terms<00:04:33.980> of<00:04:34.130> being<00:04:34.280> in<00:04:34.400> shape

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
bit further in terms of being in shape

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.640 
bit further in terms of being in shape
so<00:04:34.850> this<00:04:35.240> little<00:04:35.570> guy<00:04:35.690> actually<00:04:35.990> acts<00:04:36.350> as<00:04:36.590> a

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
so this little guy actually acts as a

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.010 
so this little guy actually acts as a
coach<00:04:37.130> guiding<00:04:37.880> us<00:04:38.000> along<00:04:38.360> as<00:04:38.690> we're<00:04:38.870> going

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
coach guiding us along as we're going

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.110 
coach guiding us along as we're going
through<00:04:39.170> our<00:04:39.500> cardiovascular<00:04:40.280> activities<00:04:40.970> to

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
through our cardiovascular activities to

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.340 
through our cardiovascular activities to
let<00:04:41.240> us<00:04:41.330> know<00:04:41.360> whether<00:04:41.660> or<00:04:41.810> not<00:04:41.990> we're<00:04:42.200> on

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
let us know whether or not we're on

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.320 
let us know whether or not we're on
track<00:04:42.560> or<00:04:42.860> if<00:04:43.250> we<00:04:43.430> need<00:04:43.460> to<00:04:43.610> be<00:04:43.760> practicing<00:04:44.240> a

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
track or if we need to be practicing a

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.730 
track or if we need to be practicing a
little<00:04:44.450> bit<00:04:44.690> more<00:04:44.870> well<00:04:45.200> you<00:04:45.260> think<00:04:45.380> so<00:04:45.530> i<00:04:45.590> get

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
little bit more well you think so i get

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.500 
little bit more well you think so i get
back<00:04:45.770> up<00:04:46.040> here<00:04:46.070> I<00:04:46.460> think<00:04:46.670> it's<00:04:46.790> your<00:04:46.880> turn<00:04:46.940> okay

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510
