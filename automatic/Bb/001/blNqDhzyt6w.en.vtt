00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
dirt blocks like that okay I'll going to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.910 
dirt blocks like that okay I'll going to
use<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.909> thus<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.509> their<00:02:03.899> place<00:02:04.680> the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
then we'll place this block here that

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.009

one then here we will replace it we're
going<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.630> place<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:55.550> sticky<00:02:56.550> piston<00:02:57.590> I'll<00:02:58.590> show

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
going to place a sticky piston I'll show

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.750 
going to place a sticky piston I'll show
you<00:02:58.950> why<00:02:59.160> here<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.489> second<00:02:59.850> okay<00:03:00.650> now<00:03:01.760> now

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
you why here in a second okay now now

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.420 
you why here in a second okay now now
replace<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.209> block<00:03:03.569> here<00:03:03.600> again<00:03:04.440> any<00:03:04.680> block<00:03:05.160> of

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
replace a block here again any block of

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.750 
replace a block here again any block of
your<00:03:05.640> choice<00:03:05.750> will<00:03:06.750> work<00:03:07.280> then<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.430> break<00:03:08.580> the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
your choice will work then you break the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.790 
your choice will work then you break the
one<00:03:08.940> we<00:03:09.180> use<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.690> build<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.080> mechanism<00:03:10.650> and

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
one we use to build the mechanism and

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.140 
one we use to build the mechanism and
then<00:03:10.980> we're<00:03:11.280> going<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.430> add<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.610> glowstone

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
then we're going to add a glowstone

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.479 
then we're going to add a glowstone
there<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:13.290> wonder<00:03:13.890> you<00:03:14.069> say<00:03:14.280> why

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
there and you wonder you say why

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.040 
there and you wonder you say why
glowstone<00:03:15.030> why<00:03:15.239> can't<00:03:15.450> put<00:03:15.660> anything<00:03:15.810> else

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
glowstone why can't put anything else

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.949 
glowstone why can't put anything else
there<00:03:16.850> it's<00:03:17.850> simple<00:03:18.269> because<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:18.810> need

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
there it's simple because you need

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.080 
there it's simple because you need
glowstone<00:03:19.470> but<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.130> need<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.310> light<00:03:20.579> source<00:03:20.820> to

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
glowstone but you need a light source to

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.210 
glowstone but you need a light source to
help<00:03:21.329> melons<00:03:21.900> grow<00:03:22.459> I<00:03:23.459> don't<00:03:23.970> know<00:03:24.060> how<00:03:24.299> in<00:03:25.220> my

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
help melons grow I don't know how in my

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.370 
help melons grow I don't know how in my
experiences<00:03:26.970> I've<00:03:27.209> had<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.989> have<00:03:28.140> light

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
experiences I've had to have light

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.560 
experiences I've had to have light
sources<00:03:28.799> around<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.280> help<00:03:29.430> them<00:03:29.579> glow<00:03:29.820> so<00:03:30.120> or

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
sources around to help them glow so or

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.060 
sources around to help them glow so or
happen<00:03:30.930> grow<00:03:31.079> so<00:03:31.320> that's<00:03:31.500> how<00:03:31.620> that<00:03:31.680> works<00:03:31.799> out

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
happen grow so that's how that works out

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.729 
happen grow so that's how that works out
like<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:32.420> again<00:03:33.420> that's<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.410> that's<00:03:34.590> the

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
like that again that's the that's the

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.569 
like that again that's the that's the
design<00:03:35.100> it's<00:03:35.549> simple<00:03:36.060> it's<00:03:36.420> compact

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
design it's simple it's compact

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.819 
design it's simple it's compact
literally<00:03:38.579> I<00:03:39.260> can't<00:03:40.260> even<00:03:40.320> tell<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.620> how<00:03:40.709> many

blocks<00:03:43.410> total<00:03:43.890> we<00:03:44.310> can<00:03:44.459> remove<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:44.850> one<00:03:45.030> if

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
blocks total we can remove that one if

you want you don't necessarily
necessarily<00:03:47.430> need<00:03:47.579> that<00:03:48.590> again<00:03:49.590> very<00:03:50.100> simple

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
necessarily need that again very simple

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.920 
necessarily need that again very simple
guys<00:03:50.640> look<00:03:50.880> at<00:03:50.970> that<00:03:51.060> it's<00:03:51.269> very<00:03:51.450> simple<00:03:51.690> now

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
guys look at that it's very simple now

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.199 
guys look at that it's very simple now
let's<00:03:52.109> get<00:03:52.230> into<00:03:52.579> the<00:03:53.579> other<00:03:53.730> stuff<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.000> we
