much anymore but I would hold this as
steady<00:02:49.810> as<00:02:49.900> I<00:02:50.050> can<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.070> get<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.250> look<00:02:51.370> at

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
steady as I can and you get a look at

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.210
