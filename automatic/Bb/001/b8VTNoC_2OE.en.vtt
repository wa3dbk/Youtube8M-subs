HMA near burns Oregon I began by walking

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.370 
HMA near burns Oregon I began by walking
into<00:00:36.860> their<00:00:37.190> pen<00:00:37.430> and<00:00:37.670> following<00:00:38.540> them<00:00:38.900> from

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
into their pen and following them from

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.130 
into their pen and following them from
behind<00:00:39.710> I<00:00:40.270> just<00:00:41.270> walked<00:00:41.480> around<00:00:41.690> to<00:00:41.990> their

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
behind I just walked around to their

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.080 
behind I just walked around to their
blind<00:00:42.440> spot<00:00:42.530> and<00:00:42.770> acted<00:00:43.340> like<00:00:43.370> I<00:00:43.670> was<00:00:43.850> joining

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
blind spot and acted like I was joining

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.020 
blind spot and acted like I was joining
the<00:00:44.360> herd<00:00:45.070> when<00:00:46.070> you<00:00:46.160> stand<00:00:46.430> in<00:00:46.520> a<00:00:46.640> horse's

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
the herd when you stand in a horse's

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.120 
the herd when you stand in a horse's
blind<00:00:47.329> spot<00:00:47.660> they're<00:00:48.020> naturally<00:00:48.560> inclined<00:00:48.680> to

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
blind spot they're naturally inclined to

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.069 
blind spot they're naturally inclined to
turn<00:00:49.310> around<00:00:49.489> and<00:00:49.820> look<00:00:49.970> at<00:00:50.150> you<00:00:50.329> because<00:00:50.780> they

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
turn around and look at you because they

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.190 
turn around and look at you because they
can't<00:00:51.320> see<00:00:51.530> very<00:00:51.560> well<00:00:52.690> when<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:53.780> horse<00:00:53.960> turn

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
can't see very well when the horse turn

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.860 
can't see very well when the horse turn
around<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:54.680> you<00:00:54.739> go<00:00:54.890> what<00:00:55.220> who<00:00:55.700> me<00:00:55.910> and<00:00:56.149> start

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
around so you go what who me and start

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.950 
around so you go what who me and start
walking<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.350> other<00:00:57.470> way<00:00:58.360> this<00:00:59.360> reaction

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
walking the other way this reaction

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.930 
walking the other way this reaction
captures<00:01:00.410> the<00:01:00.559> horses<00:01:00.950> curiosity<00:01:01.760> and

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
captures the horses curiosity and

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.960 
captures the horses curiosity and
they're<00:01:02.450> not<00:01:02.570> really<00:01:02.840> inclined<00:01:03.230> to<00:01:03.440> follow

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
they're not really inclined to follow

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.789 
they're not really inclined to follow
it's<00:01:04.970> counterintuitive<00:01:05.409> but<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:06.560> quicker

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
it's counterintuitive but the quicker

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.620 
it's counterintuitive but the quicker
you<00:01:07.039> retreat<00:01:07.429> the<00:01:07.819> more<00:01:08.030> they'll<00:01:08.240> hurry<00:01:08.450> to

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
you retreat the more they'll hurry to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.809 
you retreat the more they'll hurry to
catch<00:01:08.780> up<00:01:09.049> to<00:01:09.229> you<00:01:09.350> sometimes<00:01:10.340> they'll<00:01:10.549> stop

00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:10.819 
catch up to you sometimes they'll stop

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:12.789 
catch up to you sometimes they'll stop
following<00:01:11.240> because<00:01:11.659> it<00:01:11.840> draws<00:01:12.020> them<00:01:12.319> too<00:01:12.530> far

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
following because it draws them too far

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.800 
following because it draws them too far
away<00:01:12.920> from<00:01:13.069> their<00:01:13.429> friend<00:01:13.700> or<00:01:13.880> too<00:01:14.389> far<00:01:14.659> away

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
away from their friend or too far away

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.629 
away from their friend or too far away
from<00:01:15.200> their<00:01:15.350> gate<00:01:15.560> where<00:01:16.130> they<00:01:16.280> might<00:01:16.490> need

00:01:16.629 --> 00:01:16.639 
from their gate where they might need

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:20.230 
from their gate where they might need
most<00:01:16.939> comfortable<00:01:17.829> if<00:01:18.829> this<00:01:19.100> happens<00:01:19.240> just

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
most comfortable if this happens just

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.639 
most comfortable if this happens just
turn<00:01:20.479> around<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:20.959> start<00:01:21.139> following<00:01:21.380> them

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
turn around and start following them

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.039 
turn around and start following them
again<00:01:22.039> after<00:01:22.850> all<00:01:22.880> this<00:01:23.479> is<00:01:23.689> a<00:01:23.719> game<00:01:24.020> about

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
again after all this is a game about

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.999 
again after all this is a game about
equality<00:01:24.649> as<00:01:26.139> your<00:01:27.139> whore<00:01:27.289> swallows<00:01:27.469> you

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
equality as your whore swallows you

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.539 
equality as your whore swallows you
gradually<00:01:28.850> spiral<00:01:29.299> in<00:01:29.749> as<00:01:29.959> they<00:01:30.770> get<00:01:30.979> close<00:01:31.279> to

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
gradually spiral in as they get close to

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.149 
gradually spiral in as they get close to
you<00:01:31.670> and<00:01:31.850> become<00:01:32.359> inclined<00:01:32.749> to<00:01:32.929> sniff<00:01:33.229> you<00:01:33.499> at

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
you and become inclined to sniff you at

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.429 
you and become inclined to sniff you at
that<00:01:34.340> point<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:34.789> can<00:01:35.090> kneel<00:01:35.329> down<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:35.840> offer

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
that point you can kneel down and offer

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.199 
that point you can kneel down and offer
a<00:01:36.619> treat<00:01:36.950> by<00:01:37.279> holding<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:37.759> on<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:37.909> ground

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:38.209 
a treat by holding it on the ground

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:40.870 
a treat by holding it on the ground
horses<00:01:39.139> who<00:01:39.259> haven't<00:01:39.590> had<00:01:39.740> treats<00:01:40.039> before<00:01:40.520> or

horses who haven't had treats before or
don't<00:01:41.209> really<00:01:41.539> trust<00:01:41.779> you<00:01:42.109> are<00:01:42.380> very<00:01:42.920> unlikely

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
don't really trust you are very unlikely

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.669 
don't really trust you are very unlikely
to<00:01:43.579> take<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.060> treat<00:01:44.270> from<00:01:44.479> your<00:01:44.659> hand<00:01:44.929> your

hand is in an odd position and smells
funny<00:01:47.899> but<00:01:48.649> if<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:48.859> hold<00:01:49.069> the<00:01:49.249> treat<00:01:49.459> on<00:01:49.609> the
