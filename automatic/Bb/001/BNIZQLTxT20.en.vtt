basically<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.910> helicopter<00:00:31.099> got<00:00:32.099> little

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
basically it's a helicopter got little

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.940 
basically it's a helicopter got little
guns<00:00:32.579> here<00:00:32.880> at<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.000> front<00:00:33.710> missiles<00:00:34.710> on<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
guns here at the front missiles on the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.910 
guns here at the front missiles on the
side<00:00:35.190> just<00:00:35.219> here<00:00:36.020> they<00:00:37.020> rotate<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:39.920> propeller

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
side just here they rotate the propeller

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:49.510 
side just here they rotate the propeller
rotates<00:00:42.140> cockpit<00:00:43.520> tail<00:00:44.520> out<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> back<00:00:48.410> and

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
rotates cockpit tail out the back and

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.130 
rotates cockpit tail out the back and
underneath<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.700> has<00:00:51.949> this<00:00:52.949> little<00:00:53.809> thing<00:00:54.809> just

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
here and that comes off as like little

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.760 
here and that comes off as like little
robot<00:01:00.690> thing<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.320> see<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> head

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
robot thing and you can see the head

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:10.969 
robot thing and you can see the head
just<00:01:02.129> there<00:01:05.689> yes<00:01:08.390> I'll<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:10.740> into

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
just there yes I'll just get into

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.410 
just there yes I'll just get into
transforming<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:14.030> basically<00:01:15.030> what<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.240> is

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
transforming it so basically what it is

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.270 
transforming it so basically what it is
your<00:01:15.840> turn<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.770> upside<00:01:17.040> down<00:01:18.799> unclip<00:01:19.799> legs

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
your turn it upside down unclip legs

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.390 
your turn it upside down unclip legs
from<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> cockpit<00:01:22.040> you<00:01:23.040> bring<00:01:23.310> them

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
from in the cockpit you bring them

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:32.480 
from in the cockpit you bring them
around<00:01:25.490> twist<00:01:26.490> them<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:27.450> way<00:01:31.159> put<00:01:32.159> feet

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
around twist them that way put feet

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.630 
around twist them that way put feet
forward<00:01:34.009> yeah<00:01:35.720> unclip<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> hands<00:01:37.549> take<00:01:38.549> this

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
forward yeah unclip the hands take this

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.980 
forward yeah unclip the hands take this
little<00:01:38.790> black<00:01:39.570> thing<00:01:39.930> off<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:41.130> can

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
little robot you just spin that around

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.220 
little robot you just spin that around
and<00:02:06.869> it's<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.729> cannon<00:02:08.729> on<00:02:08.849> top

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:19.330 

and<00:02:12.230> then<00:02:12.410> turn<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.340> this<00:02:13.520> way<00:02:15.760> push<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:18.340> so

oh and then that's like his weapon and
you<00:02:32.060> actually<00:02:32.410> briefly<00:02:34.210> unclip<00:02:35.210> the

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
you actually briefly unclip the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.320 
you actually briefly unclip the
shoulders<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.610> click<00:02:37.610> them<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:38.060> they're

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
shoulders and click them so that they're

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.110 
shoulders and click them so that they're
hooked<00:02:38.570> on<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.780> little<00:02:39.610> axle<00:02:40.610> piece<00:02:40.790> just

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
hooked on the little axle piece just

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.210 
hooked on the little axle piece just
there<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:45.980> his<00:02:46.100> arms<00:02:46.490> are<00:02:47.480> up<00:02:47.540> like<00:02:47.930> that

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
there so the his arms are up like that

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.090 
there so the his arms are up like that
and<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:50.120> may<00:02:50.360> restrict<00:02:50.870> movement<00:02:51.230> that<00:02:51.800> it

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
and it may restrict movement that it

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.310 
and it may restrict movement that it
makes<00:02:52.280> him<00:02:52.489> look<00:02:52.580> a<00:02:52.700> lot<00:02:52.880> better<00:02:56.140> then<00:02:57.140> you

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
makes him look a lot better then you

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.640 
makes him look a lot better then you
spin<00:02:57.739> his<00:02:57.890> head<00:02:58.070> around<00:02:58.280> you<00:03:02.410> get<00:03:03.410> the

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
spin his head around you get the

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.930 
spin his head around you get the
propeller<00:03:05.350> stick<00:03:06.350> in<00:03:06.500> that<00:03:06.770> hand<00:03:07.610> just<00:03:08.000> there

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
propeller stick in that hand just there

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:17.400
