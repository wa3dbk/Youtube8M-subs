00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.560
 in the face of declining investment 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.429
 dollar resource yes of course and on 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.130
 really pretty serious odds 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.420
 some of them may become global 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.240
 Eurasian 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.180
 chinese can latin american stop 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.140
 there is just a lot of opportunity but even 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.350
 local 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.150
 in terms of reducing dollars 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.830
 investment resource even local 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.710
 currencies can play their positive 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.410
 in the republic novorosii now acute 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.140
 lack of funds for people with nothing 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.670
 pay what you think you need there 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.590
 own currency system 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.379
 Well, currency systems are strong 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.110
 We express even in Russia there is no currency 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.199
 There is only one real system 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.949
 currency system this can dollar 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:00.989
 be the euro everything about him is not even 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:05.780
 convertible currency in that sense 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.520
 need to of course do your calculated 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.150
 unit how or do it separate 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.040
 just that there are a lot of different options well 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.430
 and then you need to follow it to work 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:24.840
 lest it evolve completely in general 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:29.060
 I think the situation is possible introduction 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.900
 ruble in amusing Russia there is 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.900
 problems because 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.150
 two russians are in many ways black vases with 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.000
 in terms of legislation and here 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.440
 possible problems 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.910
 besides there are all sorts of 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.500
 all sorts of foreign factors 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.980
 so do not stop believe that 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.880
 the best is emission k to k to k to 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.220
 it can connect and will 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.260
 several strongly call currencies but 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:02.390
 no less enter racks 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.610
 some say you can even 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.030
 the hryvnia is calculated there in the conditions 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.790
 of war 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.090
 is it possible well if you have 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.400
 the possibility of hryvnia is why 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.500
 no, this is just a working situation 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.400
 on food on bayonets in the effort 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.400
 to this bit
