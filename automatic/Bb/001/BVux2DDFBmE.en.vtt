00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:11.959
 more than a year 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.579
 When they told me about the first measure of coffee, I'm not interested 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:19.689

 joaquin cowboy highly successful turcios to the arrest of day 9 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.349
 I remember when I saw him this medium was shortened with a business scheme the 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.989
 coffee 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:29.529
 ms very well 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.670
 of it and that they were denied their concern took coffee 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.050
 pnc I do not understand how a business person can not be that I have a 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.050
 friend tells me he has a dog food business I assure you that he never 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.270

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.460
 food to earn money 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.710
 God no 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.750
 mexico sos what you are telling me north america there are more than 255 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.210
 millions of people 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.640
 who drink three to four cups of coffee every day, you do not have to try it 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.800
 to earn money 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.100
 but I remember that he gave him half the jobs 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.860
 and I tried the capea and I liked it now and ovation coffee tumor because as no 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.750
 I can be 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.860
 what you say that since I started giving the emp 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.800
 and I gave that day to six people coffee everything I said 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.810
 I need your help I need you to do me a favor for a hundred we are not 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.430
 they are talking about a coffee business 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.980
 the three who could approve this coffee and choose me for what you think if 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.330
 perhaps he does not like that what was served as liked for nothing 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.609
 and if you like it too 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:27.770
 the interesting thing about this was 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.630
 that of six people that I gave 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.850
 five loved the cafe benidorm is ordering a jail box every 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.750
 one 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.610
 ferrari for me was something impressive when I did not take that when I did not 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.790
 I knew I had the coffee I do not know how much it costs that we ordered exactly 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.810
 no coffee 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.659
 but I could tell that it was a simple business that anyone could 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:48.170
 do 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.400
 nowadays there are more than 30 million people screaming in some company of 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.460
 marketing online 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.300
 and the most 3% of the riva of 100 thousand dollars per year and most of the 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.760
 people do not make money 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.300
 now because he does not make money 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.670
 because outside is that there are many products 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.720
 but the products so that people can sell them have to do are 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.899
 very good they have to learn a lot if they are vitamins 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.370
 they have to do is to let almost become a nutritionist to be able to sell them 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.520
 but most people do not like to lose 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.460
 for what I realized with the coffee is that it was something simple because what 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.799
 had to do was to give in all 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.819
 to start negotiations one month that the first meeting had five people 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.040
 and it is impressive growth that we have had 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.309
 the number of people that my group has making money 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:34.989
 right now my group has spread to much more than two thousand people in different 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.519
 parts of the united states 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.680
 we are opening puerto rico and different places and being a president 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.619
 now because that growth so fast 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:47.199
 because it's easy it's simple it's coffee is the simplest business I've ever 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.749
 known in my life your escapes 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:52.070
 now we are involved encounters 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.840
 the first in health and well-being health and well-being is about 3 600 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.960
 billions of dollars how much weight loss 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:01.159
 that such weight loss 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.970
 60% of the population is overweight and there are many people who want to lose 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.099
 of weight many many many people who want to lose weight 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.489
 August the home 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.090
 leo is the home now every day starts in 70 thousand new businesses of 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.839
 place 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:17.769
 every day they continue giving jet 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.510
 it is focused lifting the home guaros base 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.329
 they are overturned - the home 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.530
 that's awesome what the internet drug business 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.579
 and coffee 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.609
 Now the difference is that coffee covers 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.659
 the five industries 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.169
 let's talk a little about the coffee business 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:35.189
 I did not know 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:38.260
 how big the coffee business I knew there was money because I did not 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.539
 I knew how big the coffee business 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:44.829
 I did not know that coffee is the second consumer product in the world 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.119
 the first is oil 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:50.119
 and the second one is 

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:52.489
 it's something impressive 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.059
 what is most traded in the stock market is oil and 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:00.859
 is what is most marketed that is above 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.950
 of gold diamonds 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.460
 a very small company team aspar max 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.570
 never pulled commercial and that multi-billion dollar company 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.240
 I wanted to leave maldonado 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.549
 burke cynthia who gives peace donkin donuts 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.989
 they are involved in the coffee business because 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.680
 because it leaves a lot of money 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.980
 it's more I was surprised the English wrote my united group that has a 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:22.960
 fuel station 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.689
 and he was telling me 

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:27.719
 querÃ©taro is getting much more profit in coffee 

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:31.990
 what in the gasoline that your gas station sell because 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.090
 followed him as it may be that tells me what's going on the scheme tells me 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.969
 hagen gasoline 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:41.820
 he earns it if little and in coffee the profit is a lot that's why 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.719
 that is only extremely large 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:47.090
 I am the first component of the second component coffee is ganoderma 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.040
 Derma won is the name of a mushroom that used in China for more than four 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.850
 thousand years the third component of Mr. Brown 8 that day a permit from 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.050
 our founder 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.889
 the when you see that he won by hand used for more than four thousand years and 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.159
 what's so much scientific studies 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:04.919
 In total it says what would be the way of how to carry 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.000
 the ganoderma to millions and millions and millions of people 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.460
 he says we propose the case more 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.650
 perel you start the study realizes that most people do not have 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.180
 habit of taking gates 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.039
 Many people checked vitamins but people will not take them 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.360
 so he does not care how good it is but if he does not take them at all 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.370
 They served for him says that we propose in juices 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.340
 people also have no habit of taking juices pilots do not have habits 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.719
 the hardest thing to change a human being are addicts 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:37.150
 hello what if we put it in smoothies 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.210
 people do not people have high take you know many companies outside 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.330
 they have ready to lose weight and it turns out that people do not lose weight 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.330
 because the shakes are not good but because people not only this 

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:52.789
 he says that if we put him in addictions he started to check that 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:56.699
 the most consumed in the world are addictions like what alcohol is 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:58.150
 beer the cigar 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.400
 but he realized that of all the selections the most consumed salt 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.729
 coffee the second consumer drink in the world the first is water the 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.479
 second is he 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:12.210
 people already have the habit people first thing they do in the morning is 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.319
 drink a coffee 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:15.669
 and it is impressive 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:19.999
 driver choirs that says that in the patients doctor probiomed everything that 

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:24.680
 want - the coffee, that is, the people who, although they are forbidden 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.919
 they continue to consume it 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.529
 for something very important 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:30.800
 is that we are the pioneers for what it means to be the pioneers
