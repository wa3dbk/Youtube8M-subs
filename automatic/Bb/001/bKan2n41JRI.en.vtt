money to to buy those things instead of

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.979 
money to to buy those things instead of
assembling<00:00:34.460> your<00:00:34.520> own<00:00:34.730> miters<00:00:35.090> as<00:00:35.570> I<00:00:35.780> showed

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
case of downspout straps they're so

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.540 
case of downspout straps they're so
cheap<00:00:44.180> and<00:00:44.390> easy<00:00:44.540> to<00:00:44.780> do<00:00:45.040> this<00:00:46.040> is<00:00:46.220> just<00:00:46.400> a

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
cheap and easy to do this is just a

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
cheap and easy to do this is just a
section<00:00:47.300> of<00:00:48.550> regular<00:00:49.550> gutter<00:00:49.760> coil<00:00:50.120> for<00:00:50.360> five

is 11 and 7/8 inch wide standard 5 inch
gutter<00:01:00.350> coil<00:01:00.850> so<00:01:02.020> that<00:01:03.020> turns<00:01:03.290> out<00:01:03.440> to<00:01:03.500> be<00:01:03.620> the

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
gutter coil so that turns out to be the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.800 
gutter coil so that turns out to be the
perfect<00:01:04.309> width<00:01:04.790> for<00:01:05.750> downspout<00:01:06.259> straps<00:01:06.619> so

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
perfect width for downspout straps so

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.390 
perfect width for downspout straps so
imagine<00:01:08.810> that<00:01:08.930> this<00:01:09.050> is<00:01:09.110> the<00:01:09.409> coil<00:01:09.950> here<00:01:10.280> if

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
imagine that this is the coil here if

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:20.980 
imagine that this is the coil here if
you<00:01:10.490> just<00:01:10.700> run<00:01:11.710> one-inch<00:01:16.120> thick<00:01:19.360> straps<00:01:20.360> along

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
you just run one-inch thick straps along

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.450 
you just run one-inch thick straps along
with<00:01:21.920> this<00:01:22.280> is<00:01:22.430> just<00:01:22.640> a<00:01:22.760> standard<00:01:23.890> square<00:01:24.890> that

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
with this is just a standard square that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.100 
with this is just a standard square that
I've<00:01:25.580> just<00:01:25.729> taken<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.090> square<00:01:26.630> part<00:01:26.930> off

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
I've just taken the square part off

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.340 
I've just taken the square part off
which<00:01:27.890> is<00:01:28.040> one<00:01:28.220> inch<00:01:28.400> thick<00:01:28.900> just<00:01:29.900> mark<00:01:30.170> them

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
which is one inch thick just mark them

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.899 
which is one inch thick just mark them
off<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:30.770> out<00:01:34.420> and<00:01:35.420> then<00:01:35.750> just<00:01:35.780> cut<00:01:36.229> them

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
off and out and then just cut them

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.140 
off and out and then just cut them
straight<00:01:37.909> across<00:01:39.340> one<00:01:40.340> thing<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:40.640> do<00:01:40.790> when

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
straight across one thing to do when

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.219 
straight across one thing to do when
you're<00:01:41.240> cutting<00:01:41.510> these<00:01:41.810> is<00:01:43.479> don't<00:01:44.479> snip<00:01:44.990> all

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
you're cutting these is don't snip all

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.160 
you're cutting these is don't snip all
the<00:01:45.440> way<00:01:45.530> through<00:01:45.890> like<00:01:46.369> this<00:01:47.020> because<00:01:48.020> it

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
the way through like this because it

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.660 
the way through like this because it
leaves<00:01:48.320> a<00:01:48.470> little<00:01:48.590> bit<00:01:48.770> of<00:01:48.860> a<00:01:48.920> kink<00:01:49.250> in<00:01:49.490> the

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
leaves a little bit of a kink in the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.800 
leaves a little bit of a kink in the
metal<00:01:49.960> don't<00:01:50.960> you<00:01:51.140> just<00:01:52.299> partially<00:01:53.299> close<00:01:53.600> the

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
metal don't you just partially close the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.289 
metal don't you just partially close the
sniffs<00:01:54.140> as<00:01:54.320> you're<00:01:54.470> going<00:01:54.619> along<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.340> that

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
sniffs as you're going along and that

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.870 
sniffs as you're going along and that
gives<00:01:56.540> a<00:01:56.630> nice<00:01:56.750> clean<00:01:57.170> edge

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.140 

so<00:02:01.880> there<00:02:02.060> you<00:02:02.090> have<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:03.369> strap<00:02:04.369> that<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:04.970> has

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
so there you have a strap that it has

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.789 
so there you have a strap that it has
the<00:02:05.299> exact<00:02:05.630> same<00:02:05.659> finish<00:02:06.259> that<00:02:06.470> your<00:02:06.590> gutter

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
the exact same finish that your gutter

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.990 
the exact same finish that your gutter
does<00:02:07.070> in<00:02:08.060> your<00:02:08.209> downspout<00:02:09.190> for<00:02:10.190> next<00:02:10.910> to

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
does in your downspout for next to

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.130 
does in your downspout for next to
nothing<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:11.780> can<00:02:11.930> get<00:02:13.690> literally<00:02:14.690> you<00:02:14.930> can

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
nothing you can get literally you can

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.070 
nothing you can get literally you can
pay<00:02:15.349> about<00:02:15.680> $1<00:02:16.010> foot<00:02:16.459> for<00:02:17.180> roughly<00:02:17.780> here<00:02:17.959> in

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
pay about $1 foot for roughly here in

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.740 
pay about $1 foot for roughly here in
Denver<00:02:18.380> anyway<00:02:18.650> for<00:02:19.340> steel<00:02:19.640> gutter<00:02:19.940> coil<00:02:20.270> so

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
Denver anyway for steel gutter coil so

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.080 
Denver anyway for steel gutter coil so
you<00:02:20.840> can<00:02:21.020> get<00:02:21.459> each<00:02:22.459> of<00:02:22.819> these<00:02:22.910> costs<00:02:25.030> is<00:02:26.030> that

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
you can get each of these costs is that

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.130 
you can get each of these costs is that
nice<00:02:26.480> fence<00:02:26.810> something<00:02:27.470> like<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.800> which<00:02:28.160> is

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
nice fence something like that which is

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.570 
nice fence something like that which is
pretty<00:02:30.140> good<00:02:30.319> especially<00:02:30.890> because<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.459> have

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
pretty good especially because you have

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.300 
pretty good especially because you have
excess<00:02:32.480> coil<00:02:32.810> all<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.260> time<00:02:33.500> usually<00:02:33.860> when

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
excess coil all the time usually when

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.009 
excess coil all the time usually when
you're<00:02:34.430> ordering<00:02:34.640> materials<00:02:35.120> for<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.780> jobs

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
you're ordering materials for the jobs

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.550 
you're ordering materials for the jobs
you<00:02:36.500> add<00:02:36.769> on<00:02:36.980> five<00:02:37.400> or<00:02:37.610> ten<00:02:37.790> feet<00:02:38.230> per<00:02:39.230> job

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
you add on five or ten feet per job

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.460 
you add on five or ten feet per job
