we have more of a standard ap room page
which<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.200> again<00:00:46.649> better<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.309> if<00:00:47.430> you're<00:00:47.550> not

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
which is again better for if you're not

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.069 
which is again better for if you're not
as<00:00:47.879> familiar<00:00:48.000> with<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.480> champion<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:48.989> when

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
as familiar with the champion and when

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.360 
as familiar with the champion and when
you<00:00:49.320> want<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.590> learn<00:00:49.710> more<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> little

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
you want to learn more and be a little

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.250 
you want to learn more and be a little
bit<00:00:50.610> more<00:00:50.730> safe<00:00:50.969> because<00:00:51.719> if<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.050> use<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
bit more safe because if you use the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.799 
bit more safe because if you use the
offensive<00:00:52.770> set<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.250> your<00:00:53.670> incredibly<00:00:54.360> strong

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
offensive set up your incredibly strong

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.740 
offensive set up your incredibly strong
but<00:00:55.379> you're<00:00:55.530> also<00:00:55.649> incredibly<00:00:55.949> fragile<00:00:56.750> so

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
but you're also incredibly fragile so

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.490 
but you're also incredibly fragile so
let's<00:00:57.930> get<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.829> build<00:00:59.129> path<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.850> Fitz

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
let's get on to the build path for Fitz

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.470 
let's get on to the build path for Fitz
core<00:01:01.500> items<00:01:01.859> are<00:01:02.070> pretty<00:01:02.370> simple<00:01:02.760> for<00:01:02.789> phys<00:01:03.210> in

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
core items are pretty simple for phys in

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.359 
core items are pretty simple for phys in
fact<00:01:03.780> once<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.290> get<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.589> sheen<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.189> get<00:01:05.339> a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
fact once you get the sheen you get a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.219 
fact once you get the sheen you get a
huge<00:01:05.670> power<00:01:05.909> boost<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.689> once<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.990> get<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
huge power boost and once you get the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.870 
huge power boost and once you get the
lich<00:01:07.409> bane<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.830> get<00:01:07.950> an<00:01:08.040> even<00:01:08.280> larger<00:01:08.430> power

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
lich bane you get an even larger power

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.539 
lich bane you get an even larger power
boost<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.689> that's<00:01:09.900> your<00:01:10.080> core<00:01:10.350> item<00:01:10.650> i<00:01:10.830> do

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
boost so that's your core item i do

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.510 
boost so that's your core item i do
recommend<00:01:11.850> rushing<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.630> if<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.900> can<00:01:13.170> um<00:01:13.520> but

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
recommend rushing it if you can um but

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.859 
recommend rushing it if you can um but
you<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.790> definitely<00:01:15.000> deviate<00:01:15.570> from<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
you can definitely deviate from the

they're not they're full tank and you

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.389 
they're not they're full tank and you

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
fight 5on5 teamfight and so the reason I

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.990 
fight 5on5 teamfight and so the reason I
tase<00:02:01.799> an<00:02:01.950> initiator<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.520> because<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.880> can

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
tase an initiator is because you can

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.700 
tase an initiator is because you can
throw<00:02:03.210> your<00:02:03.329> shark<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.869> mark<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.200> target<00:02:04.590> for

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
throw your shark to mark a target for

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.889 
throw your shark to mark a target for
your<00:02:04.829> team<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.040> then<00:02:05.399> they<00:02:05.579> can<00:02:05.790> they<00:02:06.600> can<00:02:06.630> go

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
your team and then they can they can go

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.150 
your team and then they can they can go
in<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.320> can<00:02:07.439> kind<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.680> take<00:02:07.860> off<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
in and you can kind of take off the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.919 
in and you can kind of take off the
stragglers<00:02:08.399> one<00:02:08.910> mistake<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.390> see<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.660> lot<00:02:09.869> of
