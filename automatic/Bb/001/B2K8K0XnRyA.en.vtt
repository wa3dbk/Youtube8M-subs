 be teaching how to retouch your photos 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.559
 for facebook twitter or any network 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.110
 social in which you want then 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.670
 obviously retouch what is your face 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.680
 so that you do not see so many hooks 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.080
 time to upload it to facebook no 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.600
 well we can see that in this photo 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.160
 we have brown eyes is good coffees 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.160
 obviously I'm not this guy 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.510
 we have here what the guy is 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.879
 the brown eyes and we have a great 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.190
 variety of grains of it from this side of 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.530
 this side and then this one of this part 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.570
 no not so on this side and well then 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.190
 let's see this is the original photo and 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.070
 well after the process of photoshop 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.080
 this is going to look like we can see the 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.430
 eye color may change that 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.140
 It's up to you if you want to change the 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.150
 eye color or retouch them a little 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.950
 so that you do not see so many hooks because 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.619
 sometimes here they look like consummate 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.659
 with the red veins have not been seen 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.110
 the others as those who took a 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.420
 good jet of marijuana and have 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.060
 well let's put pictures 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.010
 stroll we will be able to touch up what is 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.870
 the photos so that we improve a little bit 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.730
 look to the world if you in any 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.890
 social network let's see that the presence of 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.750
 grains not already and no presence 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.430
 of grains in what is the face and therefore 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.840
 let's see how it's good 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.310
 first we have to have what 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.530
 our photo and here I already have in what 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.390
 is the photo which I will use and 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.490
 good since we have our picture we go 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.830
 to do what we're going to do a copy 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.690
 from this photo we are going to give you right click 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.610
 we will drag the photo to this 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.190
 piece of paper and the background will come out 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.950
 copy to the background copy is what we are going to 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.690
 edit the color that what the color of 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.490
 eyes we can not put with any 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.479
 color let's put it in a blue color 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.430
 with the blue color it seems 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.560
 now let's load what is the brush 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.470
 that we have here the brush tool 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.659
 ok and we are going to give what is to retouch the 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.360
 little eyes here what we can do is 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:24.670
 grab the pen tool and then 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.250
 increase so that we stay more accurate 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.200
 what are the eyes we are going to increase the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.060
 part of the eyes and we're going to give our 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.840
 brush and let's start painting what 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.480
 is what is the eye of this guy of this 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.370
 chabÃ³n this equation you want black 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.120
 put good good skewer good now 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.120
 let's put the other 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:48.970
 this and here we are going to touch up the other what 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.370
 retouching little by little so that we 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.590
 look good like that, handsome guy and they could 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.910
 can you chulear on facebook 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.590
 now let's give lace fit 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:04.180
 screen and we can see that there we have 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:06.519
 there is our eye color and now 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.109
 since we have already done this 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.410
 let's go where it says normal of this 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.050
 part of the part 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.600
 and we're going to click on it and we're going to put it 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.390
 in superimpose as you can see changes the 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.760
 eye color you can see it is like 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.500
 greenish blue but it looks very 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.210
 bright in the photo there is not a very lip 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.490
 bright so can they can 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.220
 superimpose of slope is here or in 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.630
 light without negotiating it smooth as you can see 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.790
 there you can see the eyes as green 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.990
 The eye or eyes are very good 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.510
 so 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.000
 now to change or remove what 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.870
 you have it that we have there we're going to go 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.420
 to the bottom to the bottom that we have merit and 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.980
 we are going to click on it and there, since 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.060
 we have clicked let's go to where 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.570
 is this patch 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.460
 we give you right click and we will go to 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.140
 the concealer brush tool that 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.720
 we click on the brush tool 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.970
 corrector and well then we're going to have to 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.040
 grab a part of everything from all the 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.770
 face obviously we are going to give a part 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.960
 which there is no presence of grains or 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.880
 more clear and good because I think to grab 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.240
 the part of attacks because we are going to give 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.400
 alt and we're going to give you left click that 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.500
 since we saw that the alt and left click 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.140
 Well let's start to click 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.600
 from click to click ok I suggest you 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.790
 be a click by click to go painting what 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.470
 which is the presence of grains in what 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.020
 is the face as you can see they are going 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.090
 removing the grains the spots that 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.710
 have on your face etcetera etcetera 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.090
 as you can see and here we remove the 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.710
 beads now let's go here 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.350
 As you can see, the 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.140
 grains and you'll see a little bit 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.540
 Obviously the ugly nobody take it from you or 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.460
 production if sometimes you get to 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.530
 happen sometimes you can spend you 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.010
 they step back and they are already returning to 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:55.190
 the normal way those that do not try 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:57.680
 use it or things so close to 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.000
 ok colors always try to 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.010
 use it only on your clients 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.020
 this tool then let's start 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.800
 clarify a little what is the area the 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.600

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.700

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.890

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.710
 Someone who is the most handsome is handsome 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:19.850
 people already know, you know, like the fart 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.650
 and then let's put it as you can 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:26.510
 see but let's clarify a little bit 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:28.940

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.040
 We remove grains sometimes can 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.170
 put red like here but you have to 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.060
