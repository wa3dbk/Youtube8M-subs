better like it's really really cool and
it<00:00:58.320> lets<00:00:58.559> some<00:00:58.829> pretty<00:00:59.010> epic<00:00:59.160> games<00:00:59.520> which<00:00:59.940> I'm

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
it lets some pretty epic games which I'm

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.010 
it lets some pretty epic games which I'm
excited<00:01:00.149> about<00:01:00.480> because<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.690> seems<00:01:00.960> like

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
excited about because it seems like

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.470 
excited about because it seems like
domination<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:02.579> kind<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.910> been<00:01:03.059> losing

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
domination it's kind of been losing

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.880 
domination it's kind of been losing
traction<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:04.080> seems<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.379> less<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.830> less

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
traction it seems like less and less

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.219 
traction it seems like less and less

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
obviously we didn't have domination in

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.770

well<00:01:14.820> with<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.420> three-lane<00:01:15.930> maps<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:16.500> anyway

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
well with the three-lane maps but anyway

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.370 
well with the three-lane maps but anyway
what<00:01:17.490> they<00:01:17.640> changed<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:19.080> still<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
what they changed is it's still a

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.469 
what they changed is it's still a
two-round<00:01:19.890> game<00:01:20.220> type<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.759> start<00:01:21.119> off<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
two-round game type so you start off the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.060 
two-round game type so you start off the
first<00:01:21.720> half<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.200> start<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:22.650> side<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
first half you start on one side of the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.800 
first half you start on one side of the
mat<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.490> second<00:01:23.759> half<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:23.939> flip<00:01:24.479> spawns

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
mat in the second half you flip spawns

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.940 
mat in the second half you flip spawns
and<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.170> start<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.500> other<00:01:25.619> side<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
and you start on the other side of the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.710 
and you start on the other side of the
map<00:01:26.130> that's<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.880> make<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.060> even<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.600> that

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
map that's just to make it even so that

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.850 
map that's just to make it even so that
one<00:01:27.869> team<00:01:28.140> doesn't<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
one team doesn't have like the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.230 
one team doesn't have like the
advantageous<00:01:29.280> side<00:01:29.640> or<00:01:29.820> something<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.180> that

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
advantageous side or something like that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.929 
advantageous side or something like that
and<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.770> know<00:01:31.799> how<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.250> works<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
and and you know how it works is the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.999 
and and you know how it works is the
first<00:01:33.210> half<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.290> first<00:01:34.470> team<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.829> a

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
first half it's the first team to a

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.800 
first half it's the first team to a
hundred<00:01:35.250> points<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.909> then<00:01:36.270> there's<00:01:36.450> also<00:01:36.630> a

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
hundred points and then there's also a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.660 
hundred points and then there's also a
time<00:01:37.110> limit<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:37.979> there's<00:01:38.400> like<00:01:38.549> you

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
time limit on that so there's like you

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.980 
time limit on that so there's like you
know<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.790> don't<00:01:38.880> know<00:01:39.060> what<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.450> like<00:01:39.479> six

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
know I don't know what it is like six

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.179 
know I don't know what it is like six
minutes<00:01:40.200> eight<00:01:40.530> minutes<00:01:40.560> 10<00:01:41.070> minutes

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
minutes eight minutes 10 minutes

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.499 
minutes eight minutes 10 minutes
something<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.270> case<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
something like that so in case the

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.749 
something like that so in case the
game's<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:42.869> really<00:01:43.079> slow<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:44.310> won't<00:01:44.579> take

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
game's going really slow it won't take

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.490 
game's going really slow it won't take
forever<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.899> first<00:01:46.110> team<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.290> 100

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
forever so it's the first team to 100

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.469 
forever so it's the first team to 100
points<00:01:46.799> or<00:01:47.100> until<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.369> timer<00:01:47.579> runs<00:01:47.700> out<00:01:47.970> but

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
points or until the timer runs out but

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.149 
points or until the timer runs out but
then<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.720> second<00:01:49.140> half<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.439> domination<00:01:49.979> is

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
then the second half of domination is

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.700 
then the second half of domination is
solely<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.240> first<00:01:51.479> team<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.810> 200<00:01:52.380> points

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
solely the first team to 200 points

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.649 
solely the first team to 200 points
there's<00:01:52.950> no<00:01:53.250> timer<00:01:53.640> there's<00:01:54.000> no<00:01:54.240> running<00:01:54.509> out

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
there's no timer there's no running out

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.480 
there's no timer there's no running out
of<00:01:54.689> time<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.079> game<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.409> go<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.680> for<00:01:56.159> as<00:01:56.250> long

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
of time the game can go on for as long

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.700 
of time the game can go on for as long
as<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.790> needs<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.030> go<00:01:57.210> on<00:01:57.240> which<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.140> really

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
as it needs to go on which is really

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.310 
as it needs to go on which is really
really<00:01:58.950> interesting<00:01:59.430> so<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.329> like<00:02:00.719> before

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
really interesting so like a like before

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.499 
really interesting so like a like before
what<00:02:01.590> would<00:02:01.770> happen<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.310> if<00:02:02.729> your<00:02:02.939> team<00:02:03.270> had<00:02:03.479> a

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
what would happen is if your team had a

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.780 
what would happen is if your team had a
bad<00:02:03.840> side<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.740> first<00:02:04.950> side<00:02:05.280> like<00:02:05.520> guys

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
bad side on the first side like guys

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.310 
bad side on the first side like guys
didn't<00:02:06.149> play<00:02:06.299> well<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.899> like<00:02:07.020> kind<00:02:07.229> of

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
didn't play well you can like kind of

didn't play well you can like kind of
got<00:02:07.469> outscored<00:02:07.799> pretty<00:02:08.190> badly<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.610> stuff

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
got outscored pretty badly and stuff

got outscored pretty badly and stuff
like<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.319> then<00:02:10.319> by<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.590> time<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.979> second

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
like that then by the time the second

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.010 
like that then by the time the second
half<00:02:11.370> came<00:02:11.550> around<00:02:11.790> unless<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.599> were<00:02:12.690> triple

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
starting to mount a comeback they

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.140 
starting to mount a comeback they
couldn't<00:02:24.040> get<00:02:24.190> enough<00:02:24.370> points<00:02:24.580> fast<00:02:24.910> enough

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
couldn't get enough points fast enough

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.490 
couldn't get enough points fast enough
because<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.569> timer's<00:02:25.900> gonna<00:02:26.050> run<00:02:26.200> out<00:02:26.319> well

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
because the timer's gonna run out well

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.830 
because the timer's gonna run out well
now<00:02:26.950> that's<00:02:27.190> not<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.550> case<00:02:27.730> now<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:28.660> have

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
now that's not the case now you have

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.170 
now that's not the case now you have
unlimited<00:02:29.110> time<00:02:29.860> in<00:02:30.100> that<00:02:30.280> second<00:02:30.610> half<00:02:30.790> it's

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
unlimited time in that second half it's

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.790 
unlimited time in that second half it's
all<00:02:31.480> about<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.959> points<00:02:32.290> which<00:02:32.440> is<00:02:32.560> kind<00:02:32.770> of

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
all about the points which is kind of

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.320 
all about the points which is kind of
cool<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.070> it<00:02:33.160> lets<00:02:33.370> some<00:02:33.580> really<00:02:33.940> really<00:02:34.060> epic

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
cool and it lets some really really epic

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.000 
cool and it lets some really really epic
comebacks<00:02:34.990> we're<00:02:35.200> like<00:02:35.320> normally<00:02:35.740> they<00:02:35.800> would

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
comebacks we're like normally they would

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.860 
comebacks we're like normally they would
have<00:02:36.100> no<00:02:36.370> chance<00:02:36.640> of<00:02:36.850> coming<00:02:37.060> back<00:02:37.150> but<00:02:37.750> you

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
have no chance of coming back but you

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.900 
have no chance of coming back but you
could<00:02:38.080> now<00:02:38.260> because<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.890> weren't<00:02:39.040> limited<00:02:39.280> to

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
could now because you weren't limited to

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.640 
could now because you weren't limited to
a<00:02:39.940> specific<00:02:40.150> timer<00:02:40.780> which<00:02:41.020> i<00:02:41.200> think<00:02:41.260> is<00:02:41.500> really

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
a specific timer which i think is really

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.410 
a specific timer which i think is really
really<00:02:41.860> cool<00:02:42.040> now<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.459> one<00:02:42.880> thing<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:43.270> I<00:02:43.300> did

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
really cool now a one thing that I did

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.930 
really cool now a one thing that I did
notice<00:02:43.930> in<00:02:44.319> this<00:02:45.250> first<00:02:45.520> in<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.700> game<00:02:45.820> and

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
notice in this first in the game and

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.040 
notice in this first in the game and
this<00:02:46.000> is<00:02:46.120> probably<00:02:46.330> going<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.570> change<00:02:46.810> by<00:02:46.989> the

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
this is probably going to change by the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.840 
this is probably going to change by the
time<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.470> factual<00:02:47.800> like<00:02:48.250> launch<00:02:48.520> comes

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
time the factual like launch comes

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.070 
time the factual like launch comes
around<00:02:49.090> this<00:02:49.209> is<00:02:49.360> like<00:02:49.510> one<00:02:49.630> of<00:02:49.660> those<00:02:49.810> minor

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
around this is like one of those minor

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.330 
around this is like one of those minor
things<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.709> they<00:02:50.800> haven't<00:02:50.950> even<00:02:51.100> really

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
things that they haven't even really

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.580 
things that they haven't even really
thought<00:02:51.550> of<00:02:51.580> now<00:02:51.880> but<00:02:52.420> as<00:02:52.720> of<00:02:52.900> this<00:02:53.080> version<00:02:53.470> of

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
thought of now but as of this version of

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.800 
thought of now but as of this version of
the<00:02:53.680> game<00:02:53.830> there<00:02:54.310> was<00:02:54.580> no<00:02:54.820> neutral<00:02:55.300> in<00:02:55.450> flags

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
the game there was no neutral in flags

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.650 
the game there was no neutral in flags
it<00:02:56.200> was<00:02:56.320> either<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:57.010> owned<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.489> flag<00:02:57.760> or<00:02:58.060> you

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
it was either you owned the flag or you

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.210 
it was either you owned the flag or you
didn't<00:02:59.110> own<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.380> flag<00:02:59.590> in<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.830> enemy<00:03:00.070> team

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
didn't own the flag in the enemy team

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.220 
didn't own the flag in the enemy team
donut<00:03:00.550> there<00:03:00.670> was<00:03:00.790> no<00:03:00.970> like<00:03:01.269> nobody<00:03:01.750> owns<00:03:02.019> it

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
donut there was no like nobody owns it

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.660 
donut there was no like nobody owns it
and<00:03:02.260> somebody<00:03:02.650> has<00:03:02.769> to<00:03:02.890> go<00:03:02.920> capture<00:03:03.220> it<00:03:03.459> kind

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
and somebody has to go capture it kind

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.520 
and somebody has to go capture it kind
of<00:03:03.700> deal<00:03:03.910> like<00:03:04.840> we've<00:03:05.080> been<00:03:05.200> seeing<00:03:05.440> recently

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
of deal like we've been seeing recently

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.650 
of deal like we've been seeing recently
and<00:03:06.370> ghosts<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:06.820> advanced<00:03:07.239> warfare<00:03:07.570> and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
and ghosts and advanced warfare and

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.390 
and ghosts and advanced warfare and
stuff<00:03:07.870> like<00:03:07.989> that<00:03:08.050> so<00:03:08.230> I'm<00:03:08.680> hoping<00:03:09.130> that<00:03:09.280> they

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
stuff like that so I'm hoping that they

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.130 
stuff like that so I'm hoping that they
add<00:03:09.550> that<00:03:09.760> in<00:03:09.910> i<00:03:10.030> think<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.330> neutral<00:03:10.720> aspect

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
add that in i think the neutral aspect

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.020 
add that in i think the neutral aspect
of<00:03:11.290> flags<00:03:11.560> is<00:03:11.830> really<00:03:12.489> really<00:03:12.640> cool<00:03:12.850> because

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
of flags is really really cool because

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.670 
of flags is really really cool because
if<00:03:13.239> you<00:03:13.300> get<00:03:13.420> killed<00:03:13.660> off<00:03:13.930> it<00:03:14.200> if<00:03:14.350> you<00:03:14.440> didn't

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
if you get killed off it if you didn't

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.780 
if you get killed off it if you didn't
capture<00:03:14.860> all<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.190> way<00:03:15.280> at<00:03:15.430> least<00:03:15.580> you

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
capture all the way at least you

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.310 
capture all the way at least you
neutralized<00:03:16.330> it's<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.660> enemy<00:03:16.870> team<00:03:16.989> stops

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
neutralized it's the enemy team stops

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.840 
neutralized it's the enemy team stops
getting<00:03:17.530> points<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.160> i<00:03:18.340> think<00:03:18.519> that's<00:03:18.670> kind

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
getting points and i think that's kind

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.340 
getting points and i think that's kind
of<00:03:18.880> like<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.060> really<00:03:19.690> cool<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:20.049> know<00:03:20.079> kind<00:03:20.320> of

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
of like a really cool you know kind of

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.110 
of like a really cool you know kind of
like<00:03:20.410> meta<00:03:20.680> game<00:03:20.860> that<00:03:21.040> goes<00:03:21.160> on<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.489> game<00:03:21.640> but

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
like meta game that goes on the game but

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.819 
like meta game that goes on the game but
