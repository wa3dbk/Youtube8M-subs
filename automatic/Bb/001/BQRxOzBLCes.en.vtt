00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:22.579 
something that was completely out of my

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.240 
something that was completely out of my
head<00:00:22.849> that<00:00:23.390> was<00:00:23.540> completely<00:00:23.779> my<00:00:24.140> design<00:00:24.800> my

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
thought it should be done and there was

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.139 
thought it should be done and there was
nothing<00:00:31.910> like<00:00:32.329> it<00:00:34.930> so<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.850> penetrator<00:00:37.850> was
