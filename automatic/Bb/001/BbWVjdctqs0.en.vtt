00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
videos I've watched so far considered

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.620 
videos I've watched so far considered
that<00:03:03.519> the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
that the

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.100 
that the
and<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.980> do<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.130> in<00:03:06.220> two<00:03:07.030> steps<00:03:07.240> basically<00:03:07.570> so

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
and to do it in two steps basically so

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.990 
and to do it in two steps basically so
first<00:03:08.470> you<00:03:08.650> just<00:03:08.830> apply<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.460> very<00:03:09.640> tips

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
first you just apply to the very tips

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.910 
first you just apply to the very tips
and<00:03:10.270> then<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:10.810> do<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:10.960> second<00:03:11.350> phase<00:03:11.530> where<00:03:11.800> you

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
and then you do a second phase where you

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.740 
and then you do a second phase where you
just<00:03:12.250> go<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.460> little<00:03:12.640> higher<00:03:12.880> so<00:03:13.210> you<00:03:13.270> have<00:03:13.540> this

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
just go a little higher so you have this

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.980 
just go a little higher so you have this
really<00:03:14.140> nicely<00:03:14.350> fate<00:03:14.770> of<00:03:14.920> effect<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:15.970> um<00:03:16.390> I'll

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
really nicely fate of effect so um I'll

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:23.380 
really nicely fate of effect so um I'll
keep<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:17.350> updated<00:03:17.730> all<00:03:19.590> right

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.860 

I<00:03:23.420> look<00:03:24.230> really<00:03:24.590> shattered<00:03:24.860> right<00:03:25.250> now<00:03:25.550> um<00:03:26.060> I

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.350 
see it's already actually you can't see
anything

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
anything

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.260 
anything
it's<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:33.080> little<00:03:33.350> lighter<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.920> I'm<00:03:34.880> just<00:03:35.090> going

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
it's a little lighter and I'm just going

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.620 
it's a little lighter and I'm just going
to<00:03:35.330> apply<00:03:35.420> a<00:03:35.600> second<00:03:36.050> layer<00:03:36.080> now

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.760 

this<00:03:40.990> is<00:03:41.400> umbrellas<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:43.290> this<00:03:44.290> is<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.590> result

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
this is umbrellas of this is the result

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.390 
this is umbrellas of this is the result
and<00:03:45.270> I'm<00:03:46.270> pretty<00:03:46.930> happy<00:03:47.200> with<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:47.860> didn't

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
and I'm pretty happy with it I didn't

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.180 
and I'm pretty happy with it I didn't
think<00:03:48.550> it<00:03:48.730> would<00:03:48.850> turn<00:03:49.180> out<00:03:49.240> that<00:03:49.390> well<00:03:49.780> and

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
think it would turn out that well and

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.730 
think it would turn out that well and
it's<00:03:51.190> kind<00:03:51.490> of<00:03:51.580> orange<00:03:51.850> and<00:03:52.720> kind<00:03:52.930> of<00:03:53.050> bright

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
it's kind of orange and kind of bright

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.470 
it's kind of orange and kind of bright
but<00:03:54.220> I'm<00:03:54.880> really<00:03:55.180> happy<00:03:55.450> how<00:03:55.930> it<00:03:57.120> faded<00:03:58.120> really

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
but I'm really happy how it faded really

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.330 
but I'm really happy how it faded really
nicely<00:03:59.400> so<00:04:00.400> basically<00:04:00.760> what<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.030> did<00:04:01.390> is<00:04:02.010> that<00:04:03.010> I

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
nicely so basically what I did is that I

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.690 
nicely so basically what I did is that I
applied<00:04:03.730> a<00:04:04.630> lot<00:04:05.080> of<00:04:05.200> color<00:04:05.440> to<00:04:05.800> the<00:04:06.220> ends<00:04:06.580> and

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
applied a lot of color to the ends and

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.510 
applied a lot of color to the ends and
then<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.330> wrapped<00:04:07.870> it<00:04:08.020> into<00:04:08.320> London<00:04:08.800> foil<00:04:09.070> and<00:04:10.500> I

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
then I wrapped it into London foil and I

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.450 
then I wrapped it into London foil and I
waited<00:04:12.520> for<00:04:12.640> like<00:04:12.970> 15<00:04:13.660> to<00:04:13.840> 20<00:04:14.290> minutes

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
waited for like 15 to 20 minutes

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.849 
waited for like 15 to 20 minutes
it<00:04:15.730> said<00:04:16.030> 45<00:04:16.810> in<00:04:17.050> the

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
it said 45 in the

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.300 
it said 45 in the
in<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.669> instructions<00:04:20.120> but<00:04:20.810> I<00:04:21.680> kind<00:04:22.039> of<00:04:22.069> looked

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
in the instructions but I kind of looked

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.980 
in the instructions but I kind of looked
at<00:04:22.430> it<00:04:22.490> and<00:04:22.729> realized<00:04:22.939> that<00:04:23.300> it<00:04:23.479> got<00:04:23.599> really

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
at it and realized that it got really

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.589 
at it and realized that it got really
really<00:04:24.379> blonde<00:04:24.710> so<00:04:25.400> I<00:04:25.460> washed<00:04:25.939> it<00:04:26.150> out<00:04:26.270> and

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
really blonde so I washed it out and

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.980 
really blonde so I washed it out and
then<00:04:27.020> I<00:04:27.259> applied<00:04:27.590> another<00:04:27.620> layer<00:04:28.569> going<00:04:29.569> up<00:04:29.840> a

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
then I applied another layer going up a

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.170 
then I applied another layer going up a
little<00:04:30.110> higher<00:04:30.469> as<00:04:30.919> you<00:04:31.189> can<00:04:31.490> see<00:04:31.729> like<00:04:31.939> up<00:04:32.150> to

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
little higher as you can see like up to

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.529 
little higher as you can see like up to
here<00:04:32.389> I<00:04:32.900> like<00:04:33.889> to<00:04:34.099> touch<00:04:34.370> my<00:04:34.639> hair<00:04:34.879> while<00:04:35.509> I

again and waited for I guess 10 to 15
minutes<00:04:44.930> and<00:04:45.169> then<00:04:45.229> I<00:04:45.919> just<00:04:46.189> washed<00:04:46.370> it<00:04:46.520> out

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669

so<00:05:08.880> much<00:05:09.000> because<00:05:09.270> it<00:05:09.480> made<00:05:09.660> my<00:05:09.840> hair<00:05:10.050> really

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
so much because it made my hair really

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.230 
so much because it made my hair really
heavy<00:05:10.590> but<00:05:11.220> right<00:05:11.400> now<00:05:11.580> I<00:05:11.610> really<00:05:12.030> need<00:05:12.180> that
