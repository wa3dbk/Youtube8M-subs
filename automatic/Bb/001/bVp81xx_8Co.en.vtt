00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
the back but I do have to add that it

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.069 
the back but I do have to add that it
does<00:01:46.979> not<00:01:47.310> feel<00:01:47.579> cheap<00:01:47.939> at<00:01:48.149> all<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.810> just

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
does not feel cheap at all and just

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.109 
does not feel cheap at all and just
before<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.500> get<00:01:49.619> into<00:01:50.040> sound<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.640> do<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:51.000> to

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
before we get into sound I do have to

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.850 
before we get into sound I do have to
say<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.630> does<00:01:51.840> make<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> bit<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.710> noise

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
say that it does make a bit of a noise

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.370 
say that it does make a bit of a noise
when<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.369> turned<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.149> there's<00:01:54.750> no<00:01:54.960> music

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
when it's turned on and there's no music

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.350 
when it's turned on and there's no music
plane<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.950> doesn't<00:01:56.520> make<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> bit<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.090> hissing

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
plane it doesn't make a bit of a hissing

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.200 
plane it doesn't make a bit of a hissing
noise<00:01:57.799> so<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.890> might<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.549> annoying<00:01:59.759> if<00:02:00.060> you

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
noise so it might be annoying if you

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.450 
noise so it might be annoying if you
want<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.020> turned<00:02:01.259> on<00:02:01.439> all<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.219> time

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
want to have it turned on all the time

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.039 
want to have it turned on all the time
in<00:02:02.700> your<00:02:02.729> room<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.240> probably<00:02:03.420> don't<00:02:03.810> want<00:02:03.960> to

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
in your room you probably don't want to

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.070 
in your room you probably don't want to
do<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.680> probably<00:02:04.710> just<00:02:05.310> have<00:02:05.490> a

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
do that you probably just have a

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.930 
do that you probably just have a
have<00:02:06.440> it<00:02:06.590> turned<00:02:07.100> on<00:02:07.340> when<00:02:07.640> you're<00:02:07.760> actually

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
have it turned on when you're actually

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.790 
have it turned on when you're actually
playing<00:02:08.300> music<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:08.990> when<00:02:09.259> you're<00:02:09.380> not<00:02:09.560> you

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
playing music and when you're not you

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.740 
playing music and when you're not you
probably<00:02:10.100> wanna<00:02:10.310> turn<00:02:10.580> it<00:02:10.759> off<00:02:10.880> because<00:02:11.300> of

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
probably wanna turn it off because of

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.990 
probably wanna turn it off because of
the<00:02:11.930> hissing<00:02:12.350> noise<00:02:12.710> and<00:02:13.130> now<00:02:13.340> we<00:02:13.400> can<00:02:13.640> get<00:02:13.820> to

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
the hissing noise and now we can get to

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.970 
the hissing noise and now we can get to
the<00:02:14.120> most<00:02:14.330> important<00:02:14.930> part<00:02:15.170> of<00:02:15.320> any<00:02:15.560> speaker

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
the most important part of any speaker

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.520 
the most important part of any speaker
by<00:02:16.190> far<00:02:16.490> and<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.510> sound<00:02:17.810> quality<00:02:18.410> and

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
by far and that is the sound quality and

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.710 
by far and that is the sound quality and
I<00:02:18.650> am<00:02:18.830> disappointed<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:19.670> say<00:02:19.850> that<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:20.180> did<00:02:20.420> find

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
I am disappointed to say that I did find

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.530

lows<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.290> overcome<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.100> overpower<00:02:22.670> mids<00:02:23.330> and

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
lows to overcome and overpower mids and

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.960 
lows to overcome and overpower mids and
highs<00:02:23.630> but<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.650> does<00:02:24.890> ensure<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:25.400> for<00:02:25.670> great

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970
