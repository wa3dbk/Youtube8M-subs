wire is on the backside now this is just
gonna<00:02:57.099> make<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.340> look<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.670> little<00:02:57.790> nicer<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.420> a

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
gonna make it look a little nicer and a

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.910 
gonna make it look a little nicer and a
little<00:02:58.750> cleaner<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.260> just<00:02:59.290> really<00:02:59.680> put<00:02:59.709> the

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
little cleaner and just really put the

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.949 
little cleaner and just really put the
focus<00:03:00.069> on<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.459> bead<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.880> not<00:03:01.360> kind<00:03:01.630> of<00:03:01.720> the

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
focus on the bead and not kind of the

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.900 
focus on the bead and not kind of the
mechanism<00:03:02.890> of<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.099> wire<00:03:03.310> that's<00:03:03.579> holding

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
mechanism of the wire that's holding

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.800 
mechanism of the wire that's holding
everything<00:03:04.000> in<00:03:04.420> place<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:07.360> now<00:03:07.510> we're<00:03:07.690> ready

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
everything in place and now we're ready

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.620 
everything in place and now we're ready
to<00:03:07.930> add<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.170> contrasting<00:03:08.980> color<00:03:09.480> using<00:03:10.480> the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
to add the contrasting color using the

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.120 
to add the contrasting color using the
smaller<00:03:10.930> bead<00:03:11.170> here<00:03:11.380> this<00:03:11.560> one<00:03:11.709> happens<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.040> be

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
smaller bead here this one happens to be

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.430 
smaller bead here this one happens to be
a<00:03:12.220> teardrop<00:03:12.549> size<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:13.840> I<00:03:13.900> drive<00:03:14.140> it<00:03:14.290> through

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
a teardrop size and I drive it through

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.410 
a teardrop size and I drive it through
and<00:03:14.829> same<00:03:15.250> technique<00:03:15.760> where<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.030> drive<00:03:16.269> it

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
and same technique where I drive it

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.509 
and same technique where I drive it
towards<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.720> center<00:03:16.900> fold<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:17.980> wire<00:03:18.130> over

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
towards the center fold the wire over

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.699 
towards the center fold the wire over
and<00:03:18.700> twist<00:03:19.120> some<00:03:19.420> more<00:03:19.600> I<00:03:22.290> do<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.470> same<00:03:23.650> thing

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
and twist some more I do the same thing

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.400 
and twist some more I do the same thing
with<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.310> remaining<00:03:24.519> beads

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
with the remaining beads

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.479 
with the remaining beads
now<00:03:26.410> when<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:26.650> finished<00:03:26.920> adding<00:03:27.190> your<00:03:27.280> beads

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
now when you finished adding your beads

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:28.860 
now when you finished adding your beads
you<00:03:27.609> want<00:03:27.639> to<00:03:27.819> do<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:27.970> same<00:03:28.180> thing<00:03:28.450> where<00:03:28.810> you

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
you want to do the same thing where you

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.289 
you want to do the same thing where you
hide<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.200> wire<00:03:29.350> underneath<00:03:30.069> a<00:03:30.430> good<00:03:31.150> thing

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
hide the wire underneath a good thing

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.270 
hide the wire underneath a good thing
about<00:03:31.420> wire<00:03:31.870> is<00:03:32.019> that<00:03:32.049> it's<00:03:32.260> forgiving<00:03:32.769> except

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
about wire is that it's forgiving except

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.680 
about wire is that it's forgiving except
if<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.489> tighten<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:33.819> too<00:03:34.060> much<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.480> want<00:03:34.630> to

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
if you tighten it too much you want to

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.270 
if you tighten it too much you want to
make<00:03:34.810> sure<00:03:34.840> that<00:03:35.079> you<00:03:35.139> don't<00:03:35.230> twist<00:03:35.709> too<00:03:36.100> many

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
make sure that you don't twist too many

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.500 
make sure that you don't twist too many
times<00:03:36.489> otherwise<00:03:36.790> there's<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.150> chance<00:03:37.209> that

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
times otherwise there's a chance that

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.750 
times otherwise there's a chance that
the<00:03:37.569> wire<00:03:37.750> might<00:03:37.989> break<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:39.489> then<00:03:39.609> what<00:03:39.730> I

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
the wire might break and then what I

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.000 
the wire might break and then what I
like<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:40.060> do<00:03:40.359> is<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.079> take<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:41.410> wire<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.920> just

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
like to do is to take this wire and just

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.530 
like to do is to take this wire and just
wrap<00:03:42.220> it<00:03:42.370> a<00:03:42.430> couple<00:03:42.459> times<00:03:42.880> it<00:03:43.090> secures<00:03:43.420> the

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
wrap it a couple times it secures the

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.259 
wrap it a couple times it secures the
beads<00:03:43.750> in<00:03:43.900> place<00:03:44.819> kind<00:03:45.819> of<00:03:45.910> separates

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
beads in place kind of separates

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.210 
beads in place kind of separates
everything<00:03:46.420> a<00:03:46.720> little<00:03:46.810> bit<00:03:46.930> -<00:03:47.200> and<00:03:47.980> at<00:03:48.100> the

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
everything a little bit - and at the

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.190 
everything a little bit - and at the
bottom<00:03:48.609> of<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:48.970> flower<00:03:49.180> it<00:03:49.540> twists<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.049> two

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
bottom of the flower it twists the two

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.970 
bottom of the flower it twists the two
wires<00:03:50.410> together<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:52.380> then<00:03:53.380> just<00:03:53.530> using<00:03:53.739> my

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
wires together and then just using my

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.559 
wires together and then just using my
cutters<00:03:54.370> I<00:03:54.609> cut<00:03:54.940> off<00:03:55.030> any<00:03:55.209> excess<00:03:55.299> and<00:03:55.959> that<00:03:57.569> is

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
cutters I cut off any excess and that is

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.629 
cutters I cut off any excess and that is
how<00:03:58.810> you<00:03:58.870> make<00:03:59.109> this<00:03:59.769> really<00:04:00.489> beautiful

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639

foundation for the necklace this is a

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:08.370 
foundation for the necklace this is a
pattern<00:04:07.660> that<00:04:07.690> I've<00:04:07.870> made<00:04:08.019> on<00:04:08.079> the<00:04:08.260> computer

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
pattern that I've made on the computer

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.809 
pattern that I've made on the computer
and<00:04:08.799> this<00:04:08.859> is<00:04:09.010> going<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.250> serve<00:04:09.459> as<00:04:09.760> the

and this is going to serve as the
foundation<00:04:10.919> for<00:04:11.919> my<00:04:12.069> stiff<00:04:12.639> felt<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.299> I<00:04:13.569> just

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
foundation for my stiff felt and I just

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.629 
foundation for my stiff felt and I just
made<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.049> pattern<00:04:14.230> printed<00:04:14.680> it<00:04:14.769> out<00:04:14.919> and<00:04:14.980> then

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
made the pattern printed it out and then

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.360 
made the pattern printed it out and then
use<00:04:15.849> a<00:04:15.880> utility<00:04:16.479> knife<00:04:16.510> to<00:04:17.019> cut<00:04:18.010> around<00:04:18.130> the

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
use a utility knife to cut around the

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.060 
use a utility knife to cut around the
stiff<00:04:18.609> felt

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
stiff felt

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.380 
stiff felt
now<00:04:20.280> it's<00:04:20.430> time<00:04:20.610> to<00:04:20.670> arrange<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.180> this<00:04:21.270> is

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
now it's time to arrange and this is

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.030 
now it's time to arrange and this is
kind<00:04:21.600> of<00:04:21.660> where<00:04:21.810> that<00:04:21.930> our<00:04:22.020> teeth<00:04:22.350> stimu<00:04:22.740> comes

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
kind of where that our teeth stimu comes

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.520 
kind of where that our teeth stimu comes
out<00:04:23.250> we<00:04:23.760> take<00:04:23.970> our<00:04:24.180> flowers<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:25.170> start<00:04:25.440> to

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
out we take our flowers and start to

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.000 
out we take our flowers and start to
move<00:04:25.740> them<00:04:25.980> around<00:04:26.100> I<00:04:26.610> like<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.410> anchor<00:04:28.410> up<00:04:28.560> here

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
move them around I like a anchor up here

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.110 
move them around I like a anchor up here
maybe<00:04:29.730> another<00:04:29.940> anchor<00:04:30.600> down<00:04:31.500> here<00:04:32.120> we'll

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
maybe another anchor down here we'll

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.450 
maybe another anchor down here we'll
play<00:04:33.300> add<00:04:33.600> the<00:04:33.780> metal<00:04:34.050> in<00:04:34.170> last<00:04:34.470> we'll<00:04:35.190> take

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
play add the metal in last we'll take

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.670 
play add the metal in last we'll take
our<00:04:35.610> largest<00:04:36.120> pieces<00:04:36.600> first<00:04:36.840> and<00:04:37.230> then<00:04:37.560> we'll

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
our largest pieces first and then we'll

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.790 
our largest pieces first and then we'll
start<00:04:37.950> to<00:04:38.070> work<00:04:38.190> around<00:04:38.580> them<00:04:39.560> so<00:04:40.560> you<00:04:40.650> just

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
start to work around them so you just

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.440 
start to work around them so you just
add<00:04:40.980> them<00:04:41.100> in<00:04:41.250> different<00:04:41.370> places<00:04:41.640> until<00:04:42.150> we've

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
add them in different places until we've

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.700 
add them in different places until we've
occupied<00:04:42.990> all<00:04:43.320> space<00:04:45.200> there's<00:04:46.200> really<00:04:46.470> no

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
occupied all space there's really no

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.500 
occupied all space there's really no
science<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.400> this<00:04:47.520> it's<00:04:47.850> just<00:04:47.940> where<00:04:48.420> you

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
science to this it's just where you

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.080 
science to this it's just where you
think<00:04:48.780> things<00:04:49.020> look<00:04:49.230> the<00:04:49.440> best<00:04:49.730> keep<00:04:50.730> adding

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
think things look the best keep adding

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.460 
think things look the best keep adding
them<00:04:51.270> in<00:04:52.220> where<00:04:53.220> you<00:04:53.280> think<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.550> best<00:04:53.730> spot<00:04:54.030> is

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
them in where you think the best spot is

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.830 
them in where you think the best spot is
and<00:04:55.470> one<00:04:55.680> by<00:04:55.860> one<00:04:56.160> your<00:04:56.790> foundation<00:04:57.420> starts<00:04:57.720> to

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
and one by one your foundation starts to

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.390 
and one by one your foundation starts to
get<00:04:57.990> covered<00:04:58.290> up<00:04:58.410> now<00:04:58.950> don't<00:04:59.160> worry<00:04:59.250> if

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
get covered up now don't worry if

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.590 
get covered up now don't worry if
there's<00:04:59.580> a<00:04:59.640> little<00:04:59.820> bit<00:05:00.030> showing<00:05:00.390> and<00:05:00.540> I've

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
there's a little bit showing and I've

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.240 
there's a little bit showing and I've
used<00:05:00.840> kind<00:05:01.110> of<00:05:01.200> a<00:05:01.260> neutral<00:05:01.620> color<00:05:01.830> back<00:05:02.040> here

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
used kind of a neutral color back here

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.620 
used kind of a neutral color back here
that<00:05:02.400> way<00:05:02.490> it<00:05:02.580> shows<00:05:02.760> a<00:05:02.820> little<00:05:03.180> less<00:05:03.360> but

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
that way it shows a little less but

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.630 
that way it shows a little less but
don't<00:05:03.900> worry<00:05:04.110> too<00:05:04.410> much<00:05:04.440> if<00:05:04.920> you<00:05:05.310> think<00:05:05.520> it's

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
don't worry too much if you think it's

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.010 
don't worry too much if you think it's
showing<00:05:05.880> because<00:05:06.270> you<00:05:06.360> can<00:05:06.510> trim<00:05:06.750> it<00:05:06.810> away

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
showing because you can trim it away

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.820 
showing because you can trim it away
later<00:05:07.640> so<00:05:08.640> we<00:05:08.730> keep<00:05:08.910> adding<00:05:09.330> pieces<00:05:09.800> use<00:05:10.800> a

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
later so we keep adding pieces use a

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.470 
later so we keep adding pieces use a
silver<00:05:11.220> focal<00:05:11.700> point<00:05:11.910> here<00:05:12.120> because<00:05:12.270> it'll

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
silver focal point here because it'll

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.120 
silver focal point here because it'll
contrast<00:05:13.050> against<00:05:13.410> all<00:05:13.530> the<00:05:13.650> colors<00:05:13.920> that

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
contrast against all the colors that

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.510 
contrast against all the colors that
we're<00:05:14.250> using<00:05:14.460> in<00:05:14.730> this<00:05:15.500> add<00:05:16.500> this<00:05:16.710> one<00:05:16.950> in<00:05:17.100> here

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
we're using in this add this one in here

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.360 
we're using in this add this one in here
and<00:05:18.030> keep<00:05:18.270> moving<00:05:18.630> things<00:05:18.840> around<00:05:19.370> more

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
and keep moving things around more

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.070 
and keep moving things around more
silver<00:05:20.820> we<00:05:20.970> need<00:05:21.120> more<00:05:21.330> silver<00:05:21.810> to<00:05:21.930> tie

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
silver we need more silver to tie

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.940 
silver we need more silver to tie
everything<00:05:22.320> in<00:05:24.320> and<00:05:25.320> then<00:05:25.500> we<00:05:25.560> can<00:05:25.710> kind<00:05:25.890> of

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
everything in and then we can kind of

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.560 
everything in and then we can kind of
place<00:05:26.280> some<00:05:26.580> beads<00:05:26.820> around<00:05:27.120> to<00:05:27.270> see<00:05:27.420> where

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
place some beads around to see where

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:33.140 
place some beads around to see where
they're<00:05:27.720> gonna<00:05:27.810> look<00:05:28.500> best<00:05:31.820> now<00:05:32.820> once<00:05:33.000> you're

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
they're gonna look best now once you're

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.340 
they're gonna look best now once you're
happy<00:05:33.300> with<00:05:33.510> the<00:05:33.780> pattern<00:05:34.110> that<00:05:34.230> you've

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
happy with the pattern that you've

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.140 
happy with the pattern that you've
chosen<00:05:34.620> we're<00:05:34.980> ready<00:05:35.160> to<00:05:35.370> attach<00:05:35.670> them<00:05:35.940> to<00:05:36.060> the

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
chosen we're ready to attach them to the

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.080 
chosen we're ready to attach them to the
backing<00:05:37.250> now<00:05:38.250> that<00:05:38.460> we've<00:05:38.580> had<00:05:38.730> the<00:05:38.880> pattern

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
backing now that we've had the pattern

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.450 
backing now that we've had the pattern
all<00:05:39.630> laid<00:05:39.960> out<00:05:40.110> exactly<00:05:40.380> the<00:05:40.860> way<00:05:40.980> we<00:05:41.130> want<00:05:41.340> it

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
all laid out exactly the way we want it

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.670 
all laid out exactly the way we want it
on<00:05:41.670> our<00:05:42.030> backing<00:05:42.480> we<00:05:42.900> need<00:05:43.020> to<00:05:43.140> mark<00:05:43.440> the

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
on our backing we need to mark the

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.500 
on our backing we need to mark the
places<00:05:44.130> each<00:05:44.460> one<00:05:44.790> of<00:05:44.880> these<00:05:45.000> is<00:05:45.150> going<00:05:45.270> to<00:05:45.330> get

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
places each one of these is going to get

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.420 
places each one of these is going to get
stitched<00:05:45.840> in<00:05:46.080> just<00:05:46.470> using<00:05:46.590> some<00:05:46.860> fishing<00:05:47.250> line

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
stitched in just using some fishing line

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.920 
stitched in just using some fishing line
so<00:05:47.670> we<00:05:48.030> need<00:05:48.150> to<00:05:48.240> mark<00:05:48.420> where<00:05:48.600> we<00:05:48.630> want<00:05:48.840> it<00:05:48.870> to

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
so we need to mark where we want it to

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.180 
so we need to mark where we want it to
go<00:05:49.080> because<00:05:49.230> we're<00:05:49.440> gonna<00:05:49.530> move<00:05:49.710> remove<00:05:50.070> the

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
go because we're gonna move remove the

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.560 
go because we're gonna move remove the
pieces<00:05:50.400> and<00:05:50.610> then<00:05:50.730> add<00:05:50.940> them<00:05:51.120> one<00:05:51.330> at<00:05:51.450> a<00:05:51.480> time

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
pieces and then add them one at a time

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.320 
pieces and then add them one at a time
so<00:05:52.350> we<00:05:52.440> just<00:05:52.470> lift<00:05:52.800> it<00:05:52.920> up<00:05:53.040> use<00:05:53.610> a<00:05:53.640> marker<00:05:54.120> to

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
so we just lift it up use a marker to

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.560 
so we just lift it up use a marker to
add<00:05:55.140> a<00:05:55.170> little<00:05:55.410> dot<00:05:55.880> to<00:05:56.880> indicate<00:05:57.240> where<00:05:57.450> each

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
add a little dot to indicate where each

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.030 
add a little dot to indicate where each
one<00:05:57.810> goes<00:05:59.690> now<00:06:00.690> once<00:06:00.870> you've<00:06:01.020> done<00:06:01.260> that<00:06:01.320> this

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
one goes now once you've done that this

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.970 
one goes now once you've done that this
is<00:06:02.220> my<00:06:02.370> tip<00:06:02.610> take<00:06:03.300> a<00:06:03.330> picture<00:06:03.750> of<00:06:03.780> it<00:06:04.050> print<00:06:04.920> out

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980 
is my tip take a picture of it print out

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.200 
is my tip take a picture of it print out
the<00:06:05.130> picture<00:06:05.250> when<00:06:05.700> you're<00:06:05.790> putting<00:06:06.030> it<00:06:06.120> all

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
the picture when you're putting it all

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.690 
the picture when you're putting it all
back<00:06:06.360> together<00:06:06.570> it'll<00:06:07.050> really<00:06:07.470> help<00:06:08.040> and<00:06:08.250> save

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
back together it'll really help and save

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.160 
back together it'll really help and save
a<00:06:08.730> lot<00:06:08.970> of<00:06:09.030> headache<00:06:11.780> so<00:06:12.780> now<00:06:12.900> that<00:06:12.960> we've

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.170 
a lot of headache so now that we've

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.750 
a lot of headache so now that we've
marked<00:06:13.380> for<00:06:13.590> our<00:06:13.650> flowers<00:06:14.040> go<00:06:14.160> we're<00:06:14.340> ready<00:06:14.490> to

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
marked for our flowers go we're ready to

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.430 
marked for our flowers go we're ready to
attach<00:06:15.060> them<00:06:15.360> we're<00:06:15.810> doing<00:06:16.050> so<00:06:16.200> put<00:06:16.350> the

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
attach them we're doing so put the

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.410 
attach them we're doing so put the
fishing<00:06:16.740> line<00:06:16.770> and<00:06:17.490> we<00:06:17.610> clear<00:06:17.850> off<00:06:17.970> our<00:06:18.150> space

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:18.420 
fishing line and we clear off our space

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.270 
fishing line and we clear off our space
and<00:06:18.750> we<00:06:18.840> add<00:06:18.960> them<00:06:19.200> one<00:06:19.350> at<00:06:19.410> a<00:06:19.560> time<00:06:19.590> so<00:06:20.070> here's

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
and we add them one at a time so here's

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.040 
and we add them one at a time so here's
one<00:06:20.520> flower<00:06:20.790> I've<00:06:21.030> added<00:06:21.270> it<00:06:21.480> on<00:06:21.570> to<00:06:21.720> the<00:06:21.840> spot

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
one flower I've added it on to the spot

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.000 
one flower I've added it on to the spot
that<00:06:22.200> I've<00:06:22.290> pre-marked

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010
