hello I'm Kevin s Moore the inventor of

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.339 
hello I'm Kevin s Moore the inventor of
the<00:00:07.220> KSM<00:00:07.729> foundation<00:00:08.360> bridge<00:00:08.599> system<00:00:08.900> and

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:09.349 
the KSM foundation bridge system and

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:10.720 
the KSM foundation bridge system and
today<00:00:09.650> I'd<00:00:09.860> like<00:00:09.889> to<00:00:10.070> talk<00:00:10.340> about<00:00:10.490> the

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
today I'd like to talk about the

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.470 
today I'd like to talk about the
elevation<00:00:11.179> system<00:00:11.870> that<00:00:12.349> is<00:00:12.500> utilized<00:00:12.830> on<00:00:13.480> 99%

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
elevation system that is utilized on 99%

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.930 
elevation system that is utilized on 99%
of<00:00:14.660> the<00:00:14.839> guitars<00:00:15.230> and<00:00:15.410> basses<00:00:15.799> out<00:00:16.340> there<00:00:16.670> and

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
of the guitars and basses out there and

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.390 
of the guitars and basses out there and
why<00:00:17.510> the<00:00:17.570> foundation<00:00:18.110> bridge<00:00:18.680> system<00:00:19.130> is<00:00:19.369> a

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
why the foundation bridge system is a

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.260 
why the foundation bridge system is a
better<00:00:19.700> option<00:00:20.440> in<00:00:21.440> 1950<00:00:22.220> Leo<00:00:22.460> fender<00:00:22.730> started

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
better option in 1950 Leo fender started

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.540 
better option in 1950 Leo fender started
using<00:00:23.480> this<00:00:23.780> common<00:00:24.200> screw<00:00:24.440> elevation<00:00:25.160> system

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
using this common screw elevation system

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.360 
using this common screw elevation system
on<00:00:25.700> his<00:00:25.880> broadcaster<00:00:26.570> and<00:00:26.720> guitar<00:00:27.190> notice<00:00:28.190> the

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.370 
on his broadcaster and guitar notice the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.799 
on his broadcaster and guitar notice the
screw<00:00:28.670> slots<00:00:29.030> and<00:00:29.480> the<00:00:29.630> picture<00:00:31.660> that<00:00:32.660> was

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
screw slots and the picture that was

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.540 
screw slots and the picture that was
about<00:00:33.020> the<00:00:33.170> same<00:00:33.379> time<00:00:33.710> this<00:00:34.010> phone<00:00:34.250> right

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
about the same time this phone right

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.389 
about the same time this phone right
here<00:00:34.820> was<00:00:35.329> being<00:00:35.690> used<00:00:35.960> our<00:00:36.620> mock-up<00:00:36.920> right

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
here was being used our mock-up right

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.090 
here was being used our mock-up right
here<00:00:37.699> utilizes<00:00:38.629> the<00:00:38.719> same<00:00:38.989> screw<00:00:39.379> system<00:00:39.920> that

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
here utilizes the same screw system that

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.180 
here utilizes the same screw system that
was<00:00:40.249> utilized<00:00:40.460> from<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:41.210> 1950s<00:00:42.199> up<00:00:42.800> until

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
was utilized from the 1950s up until

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.149 
was utilized from the 1950s up until
today<00:00:44.079> so<00:00:45.079> what's<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:45.499> problems

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:46.159 
today so what's the problems

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.180 
today so what's the problems
well<00:00:46.969> the<00:00:47.300> screws<00:00:47.659> are<00:00:47.989> evenly<00:00:48.440> elevated

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
well the screws are evenly elevated

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.040 
well the screws are evenly elevated
watch<00:00:49.699> what<00:00:49.940> happens<00:00:50.390> when<00:00:50.569> we<00:00:50.659> pluck<00:00:50.929> the

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
watch what happens when we pluck the

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.529 
watch what happens when we pluck the
string<00:00:53.800> it<00:00:54.800> walks<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:55.760> it<00:00:55.940> will<00:00:56.089> bump<00:00:56.329> and

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
string it walks and it will bump and

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.380 
string it walks and it will bump and
rattle<00:00:56.929> into<00:00:57.229> the<00:00:57.319> adjoining<00:00:57.710> saddle<00:00:58.399> now<00:00:58.909> if

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
rattle into the adjoining saddle now if

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.049 
rattle into the adjoining saddle now if
the<00:00:59.510> screws<00:00:59.839> are<00:01:00.109> unevenly<00:01:00.890> adjusted<00:01:01.670> the

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
the screws are unevenly adjusted the

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.540 
the screws are unevenly adjusted the
saddle<00:01:02.539> rattles<00:01:03.050> on<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.589> base<00:01:03.800> plate<00:01:04.010> because

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
saddle rattles on the base plate because

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:12.550 
saddle rattles on the base plate because
of<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:04.879> uneven<00:01:05.360> pressure<00:01:10.840> these<00:01:11.840> screws<00:01:12.200> also

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
of the uneven pressure these screws also

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.679 
of the uneven pressure these screws also
like<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.070> move<00:01:13.219> on<00:01:13.430> their<00:01:13.610> own<00:01:13.759> all<00:01:14.329> you<00:01:14.540> need

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
like to move on their own all you need

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.300 
like to move on their own all you need
to<00:01:14.810> do<00:01:14.930> is<00:01:15.079> to<00:01:15.200> talk<00:01:15.350> to<00:01:15.409> somebody<00:01:15.920> that<00:01:16.159> has

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
to do is to talk to somebody that has

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.429 
to do is to talk to somebody that has
super<00:01:16.700> glued<00:01:16.939> them<00:01:17.210> down<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:17.750> find<00:01:17.990> that<00:01:18.140> out

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
super glued them down to find that out

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.260 
super glued them down to find that out
so<00:01:19.280> not<00:01:19.549> only<00:01:19.579> are<00:01:19.969> these<00:01:20.329> screws<00:01:20.719> unstable

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
so not only are these screws unstable

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.060 
so not only are these screws unstable
but<00:01:23.270> look<00:01:23.450> at<00:01:23.539> the<00:01:23.659> amount<00:01:23.810> of<00:01:24.049> contact<00:01:24.619> to

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
but look at the amount of contact to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.190 
but look at the amount of contact to
transfer<00:01:25.579> the<00:01:25.729> string<00:01:26.060> energy<00:01:26.600> into<00:01:27.110> the

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
transfer the string energy into the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.319 
transfer the string energy into the
instrument<00:01:27.710> just<00:01:28.189> these<00:01:28.399> little<00:01:28.729> points<00:01:28.939> on

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
instrument just these little points on

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.929 
instrument just these little points on
the<00:01:29.479> base<00:01:29.659> of<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:29.930> screws<00:01:30.289> a<00:01:30.729> solid<00:01:31.729> body

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
the base of the screws a solid body

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.969 
the base of the screws a solid body
instrument<00:01:32.630> is<00:01:32.780> all<00:01:33.049> about<00:01:33.320> connection<00:01:33.859> and

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
instrument is all about connection and

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.929 
instrument is all about connection and
sound<00:01:34.310> transfers<00:01:35.000> a<00:01:35.710> hollow<00:01:36.710> body<00:01:37.039> guitar<00:01:37.130> is

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
sound transfers a hollow body guitar is

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.639 
sound transfers a hollow body guitar is
all<00:01:38.270> about<00:01:38.570> moving<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.140> top<00:01:39.350> of<00:01:39.560> the

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
all about moving the top of the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.840 
all about moving the top of the
