00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.230
 play stalker he's boring at times 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.690
 bothers then you stumbled on need 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.650
 you a video and I hope you will see it 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.710
 video to the end 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.960
 have a nice view and hello to all 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.100
 dear friends with you danil to today i 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.910
 would like to show you a map or how 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.369
 You can say so to the assembly to the assembly 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:31.800
 stalker on the other she called became 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:35.280
 Mine here if he is tired of the usual stalker 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.920
 that is, well, as you saw my intro in 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.969
 I think the beginning of any pathos 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.489
 a little there now I think you hit 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.460
 it is here who does not want already in normal 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.780
 stalker play who is sick okay now 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.239
 I will explain here some mods are inserted 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.430
 fashion and these will not show because 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.340
 he will have to go to the main menu in 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.289
 main menu and I don't want to go out 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.960
 than minecraft won't fly because 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.210
 me mine craft on fullscreen 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.750
 that is, nothing is visible at all 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.570
 okay let's get down to the very fashion 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.610
 that is, there is a texture pack first. 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.290
 queue as you can notice the text 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.510
 pack and sound 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.740
 Sun Roof here is revealed as both 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.630
 the door I think that this is a bug I think 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.210
 that this is a bug because at this place 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.360
 stood at all 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.310
 four such drawer shelves such or 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.010
 booths as they can be called which 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.200
 opened blue and here and right 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.900
 what is it well here it is minus how 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.720
 since I understand the door normally 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.020
 It opens but you need it yourself 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.270
 Well, too, lan and I'm not talking about that right now and 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.190
 there is a golden currency here 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.479
 coin and there is still silver that is 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.180
 come to sidorovich 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.060
 by the way here and right here they clearly did how 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.380
 he always says not to wild 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.450
 although okay okay, this may be possible 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.930
 put here gold coins and buy 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.899
 anything you can buy everything 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.730
 here but where is on the left side 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.590
 gold coin well, I think many people know 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.270
 many played many don't play at all i 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.790
 Here's how to explain for those who like 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.739
 I not played even once so I think I will 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.110
 I will help with this for example, let's 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.110
 let's buy something at all 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.480
 example this and to him patron also 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.239
 here you can have bolts that is so 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.459
 same as in main game in minecraft game 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.530
 the stalker game is also not needed and 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.870
 I do n’t think that there is radiation here 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.560
 maybe there is truth well maybe I don’t 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.060
 noticed 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.200
 honestly tell you okay now is not about that 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.980
 there are two gold coins left 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.980
 can spend 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.540
 let's see what sounds 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.989
 they do not stack apparently this 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.909
 if i'm not mistaken snow i'm not going 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.099
 pass this card I do it at all 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:06.700
 going but not given this moment I like 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:10.120
 would review the assembly here next 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.920
 There is a rule here but bargain 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.220
 Quest look for 9 diamonds one by one 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.030
 each location survive in the zone that is 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.790
 there are only 9 locations present 9 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.409
 locations and on them this goal to find 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.010
 great diamonds case 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:30.879
 as you can see here the map but it changes 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.329
 then efficiency and compass compass that's fine so 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:37.840
 how was he here in principle here by the way 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:40.139
 it's all by the way by the way about the fashion I'm 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.819
 he left at all he adds 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:46.840
 several new rut it is so manna sapphire 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:51.489
 bronze bar 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:54.120
 amethyst cut and so and something else but yes 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.609
 and he adds all sorts of 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.359
 weapons so gadgets so armor yes here 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:04.239
 armor new adds in general here but from 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:08.440
 notice textures old at the same time he 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:12.639
 by the way changes the developer of this card 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.489
 or assembly I do not know how to explain it 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:17.530
 you principle will be in the description fail 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:23.240
 hurt and look at his channel so 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:25.780
 let's check this armor then 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.780
 somehow she looks like this pathetic 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.780
 principle 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.689
 so here now just say the principle 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:37.080
 here the plot is the same as in the game 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:39.360
 stalker but some locations here need 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.129
 walk not like in the game itself it 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.210
 I think in the shadow of Chernobyl by the way 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:49.580
 some heroes are changed here that is 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.580
 creeper like it in my 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.280
 my groin 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.990
 exploded here I don't remember 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.790
 creepers are changed on the shelf 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.310
 exactly and remember what they changed to 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:13.710
 blood suckers and even the sound that you hear 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:16.530
 if it's a little louder now zombies are 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:21.030
 like a zombie mulch 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:25.410
 so need to be quieter do what else 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:27.750
 can I tell you there are 2 tabs where 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.660
 he actually adds a lot a lot 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.390
 many weapons here basically made fashion 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.820
 very very very high quality i you 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.610
 I advise you to download it to play on this 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.520
 You can even assemble the collection 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.310
 Here I think there is half YouTube 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.380
 probably knows about him 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.840
 you know how to find in minecraft 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.120
 all sorts of artifacts bring them si 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.600
 motivated to perform all tasks 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:59.370
 look for anyway 9 diamonds and think 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:02.670
 you will pass this assembly here I hope you 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:05.130
 at least he somehow helped thinking 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.110
 ok explained to judge it already you 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.210
 they told me and you were danilka
