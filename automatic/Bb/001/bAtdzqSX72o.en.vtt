00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.879
 Hello 

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:04.069
 with you again romanchenko anton and 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.210
 how to learn to run 15 kilometers in one 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.210
 month I train one by one 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:14.019
 many of my followers ask me 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.880
 what time of day is best to run 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.089
 I will say right away 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:21.320
 during this time, 17 hours to 19 hours 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.119
 why exactly this time 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.499
 the fact is that there is such a science studying 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:27.140
 human biorhythms 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.109
 and scientists have concluded 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:30.720
 what's the optimal time for 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.280
 physical exertion 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.050
 is time 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.380
 all this is Beijing until seven o'clock in the evening 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.160
 from my own experience I will tell you 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.970
 it really is 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.010
 my best results i 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.790
 showed it in this interval 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.000
 premium 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.600
 but understandably that 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.600
 many of you work 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.630
 work ends at 6-7 pm and 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.010
 far from all of you can train in 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.500
 this period of time 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.000
 so i will say 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.760
 when the best does not matter 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.180
 better not to run 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.200
 within two hours after getting up and in 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.320
 within two hours before bedtime 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.320
 why exactly 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.250
 when you woke up 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.250
 your body is still not fully awake 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.620
 there is a so-called 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.420
 transition period 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.460
 and if you are in this period of two hours 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.710
 after waking up turn on high 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.330
 physical exertion 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330
 it will be traffic for him 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.000
 further during the day it may 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.070
 put it increased 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.000
 fatigue and from england height 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Besides 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.100
 immediately after waking our 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.970

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.690
