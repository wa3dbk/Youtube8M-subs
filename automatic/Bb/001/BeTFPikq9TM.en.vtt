00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.020
 hello how about you guys welcome to this 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.290
 new video and good you will already know that 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.660
 I'm going to talk about the current one if it falls 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.369
 eye of alcón my son good this 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.970
 character is one of the most mysterious 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:31.110
 of wampis we only know some of his 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.690
 things one does not have two crew that 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.690
 he lives alone in a castle and good to his 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.360
 surroundings may have those unique 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.250
 humanoid monkeys and good your boat is 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.280
 small has one of the best two of 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.430
 the best swords that can exist and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.910
 that we know is a pirate obviously 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.750
 his guy and some would say and wampis a 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.930
 government dog in addition to this for 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.229
 I'm not clear about the intention of this 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.909
 character for which there is no buccal 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.939
 seen that he comments on some activities 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.619
 criminals in a one piece does not have a 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.070
 people that defend neither a goal that 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.310
 let's know to see 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.079
 and above all what worries me is that 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.250
 this character 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:27.080
 has a credibility about the honor and 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.560
 Well, I do not think 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.860
 I do not think it is given to become 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.220
 a gay guy maybe you use this 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.910
 method for besides being recognized for 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.130
 be able to fight freely as a hobby or 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.370
 to forge new pirates as we can 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:50.600
 see with just this character really 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:53.270
 she only gave her fight to my daughter but 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.790
 he really was as disappointed and 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.950
 thanks to this disappointment, it has only been 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.720
 got stronger and trained 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:06.500
 hard to such an extent that good more 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.820
 further we find that during the 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.910
 times that my son could train the deaf 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.100
 in a better way so that then of 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.620
 certain way it betrays you that having 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.160
 mentioned this I also think that my son 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.190
 in a certain way is helping the 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.500
 movie war or good at least they are 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:32.040
 encouraging since 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.670
 and we all know that he is a great friend of 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.660
 Shanxi and then at the same time it's like a 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.640
 rival and well I can mention that in the 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.160
 battle of marín fort my son 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.450
 gave me and wanted to measure the skills of 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.550
 lutfi and how much potential this had 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.550
 character and how much influence he had 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.850
 this character along with those who were 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.290
 participating in that war I have seen 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.320
 some comments that have said that 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.080
 this guy that maybe it's a 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.239
 bounty hunter and you like the big 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.209
 challenges for which also of certain 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.920
 form forges some pirates that 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.580
 can really take their place or 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.310
 try at least to take your place 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.340
 in a certain way with the honor that is 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.750
 very important to him very good as 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.790
 I mentioned about his honor 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.230
 which also has some codes of 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.660
 moral or something like swordsman 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.370
 just like it's gold 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.680
 As I told you, it could be that this 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.739
 character until in the past be one 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.269
 the rewards and that reminds me 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.790
 that only before joining the 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.500
 crew of lutfi was one then 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.840
 maybe see how 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.420
 some form of representation of it 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.410
 when I was young and then I can get there 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:56.300
 to feel that he is someone worth the 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.280
 I'm sorry I'm talking about just 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.440
 and good even though I already gave them 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.290
 enough information about this and good 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.430
 some speculations that I have up to 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:13.100
 it could be that that pirate does not have 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:17.269
 to see something beyond with a something about 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.549
 sea ​​and sea inform old here grief and 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.400
 Well, maybe it's really a lot 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.460
 then have an alliance with some 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.550
 character can already do with a band 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.130
 also with a book award I do not know if I can 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.250
 really participate in what he 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.830
 you need and want to do something against 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.900
 marina that is most appropriate that if I 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.450
 fills the mind for a future of this 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.710
 character and good guys up here the 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.450
