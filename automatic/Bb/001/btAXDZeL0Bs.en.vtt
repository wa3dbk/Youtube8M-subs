don't<00:01:16.220> have<00:01:16.280> to<00:01:16.430> resolve<00:01:16.850> back<00:01:17.060> into<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.540> cord

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
don't have to resolve back into the cord

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.130 
don't have to resolve back into the cord
but<00:01:18.160> usually<00:01:19.160> that<00:01:19.490> is<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:20.150> case<00:01:20.330> oh<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:21.050> you

I'd like to talk about are called

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.010 
I'd like to talk about are called
half-step<00:01:34.220> slides<00:01:34.640> anytime<00:01:35.540> you're<00:01:35.720> moving

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
from one chord to another look for

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.540 
from one chord to another look for
opportunities<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.380> do<00:01:39.680> half<00:01:39.920> steps<00:01:40.250> lights

F chord okay well what's a half step

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.410 
F chord okay well what's a half step
above<00:01:49.820> f<00:01:50.530> it's<00:01:51.530> F<00:01:51.740> sharp<00:01:52.010> so<00:01:52.970> I<00:01:53.000> should<00:01:53.240> look

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
above f it's F sharp so I should look

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.840 
above f it's F sharp so I should look
for<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.690> opportunity<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.410> play<00:01:55.040> an<00:01:55.460> F<00:01:55.640> sharp

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
chord right before go to if and usually

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.250 
chord right before go to if and usually
you<00:02:04.370> can<00:02:04.520> use<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.790> seventh<00:02:05.270> if<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.140> use<00:02:06.230> the

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
you can use the seventh if you use the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260 
you can use the seventh if you use the
seventh<00:02:06.800> that<00:02:06.920> makes<00:02:07.220> it<00:02:07.370> smoother<00:02:08.119> for

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
seventh that makes it smoother for

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.199 
seventh that makes it smoother for
example<00:02:08.720> let's<00:02:08.750> say<00:02:09.050> I'm<00:02:09.140> on<00:02:09.320> see<00:02:09.850> I'm<00:02:10.850> going

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
example let's say I'm on see I'm going

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.199 
example let's say I'm on see I'm going
to<00:02:11.270> have<00:02:13.030> there's<00:02:14.030> there's<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.780> G<00:02:15.200> flat<00:02:15.470> seventh

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
to have there's there's a G flat seventh

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.660 
to have there's there's a G flat seventh
that's<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:17.390> half<00:02:17.540> step<00:02:17.810> above<00:02:18.260> FC<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.459> just

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
that's a half step above FC and I just

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.230 
that's a half step above FC and I just
slide<00:02:19.970> out

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.910 

let's<00:02:23.020> say<00:02:23.200> I'm<00:02:23.410> us<00:02:23.650> on<00:02:24.610> g7<00:02:25.210> I'm<00:02:26.170> going<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.680> see

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
let's say I'm us on g7 I'm going to see

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.300 
let's say I'm us on g7 I'm going to see
what's<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.490> half<00:02:27.640> step<00:02:27.850> above<00:02:28.000> see<00:02:28.800> it's<00:02:29.800> D<00:02:30.040> flat

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
what's a half step above see it's D flat

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.540 
what's a half step above see it's D flat
it's<00:02:30.730> 00<00:02:31.180> d<00:02:31.690> flat<00:02:31.930> seventh<00:02:32.380> chord<00:02:32.650> watch

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.060 

and<00:02:36.900> again<00:02:37.900> if<00:02:38.020> you<00:02:38.140> use<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.380> seventh<00:02:38.920> or

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
and again if you use the seventh or

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.220 
and again if you use the seventh or
ninth<00:02:39.370> it's<00:02:39.880> smoother<00:02:40.270> but<00:02:40.570> even<00:02:41.020> if<00:02:41.110> you

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
ninth it's smoother but even if you

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.480 
ninth it's smoother but even if you
don't<00:02:41.520> it's<00:02:42.520> still<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.850> good<00:02:43.120> personal<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:44.080> shun

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.880 

okay<00:02:47.630> let's<00:02:48.630> do<00:02:48.750> one<00:02:48.900> more<00:02:48.930> than<00:02:49.290> will<00:02:49.470> call<00:02:49.710> it

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
okay let's do one more than will call it

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.520 
okay let's do one more than will call it
if<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.640> have<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:50.880> let's<00:02:51.780> say<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:52.110> we're<00:02:52.320> going

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
if you have a let's say that we're going

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.720 
if you have a let's say that we're going
from<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.310> F<00:02:53.910> chord<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.320> B<00:02:55.740> flat<00:02:55.770> chord<00:02:56.430> what's

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
from a F chord to a B flat chord what's

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.160 
from a F chord to a B flat chord what's
a<00:02:57.000> half<00:02:57.180> step<00:02:57.420> below<00:02:57.830> be<00:02:58.830> B<00:02:59.460> flat<00:02:59.730> it's<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.840> isn't

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
a half step below be B flat it's a isn't

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.320 
a half step below be B flat it's a isn't
it<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.740> you<00:03:01.800> play<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.190> seventh<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.090> slight

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
it so you play a seventh and slight

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.440 
it so you play a seventh and slight
update<00:03:03.570> be<00:03:04.020> flood<00:03:04.610> or<00:03:05.610> we<00:03:05.790> could<00:03:05.940> play<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.270> B

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
update be flood or we could play the B

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.890 
update be flood or we could play the B
chord<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.950> slide<00:03:08.340> down<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.610> be<00:03:08.880> flood<00:03:09.180> let<00:03:09.780> me

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
chord and slide down to be flood let me

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.250 
chord and slide down to be flood let me
do<00:03:10.020> that<00:03:10.140> in<00:03:10.200> context

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.870
