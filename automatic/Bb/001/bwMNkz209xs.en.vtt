00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
good approach in landing right now we're

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.419 
good approach in landing right now we're
in<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.040> cessna<00:00:08.460> 172<00:00:08.639> Skyhawk<00:00:09.510> right<00:00:10.050> here<00:00:10.429> we

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
in a cessna 172 Skyhawk right here we

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.700 
in a cessna 172 Skyhawk right here we
are<00:00:11.460> on<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.880> final<00:00:12.540> approach<00:00:13.019> right<00:00:13.290> now<00:00:13.500> for

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
are on a final approach right now for

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.080 
are on a final approach right now for
only<00:00:13.830> 3/5<00:00:14.610> right<00:00:14.969> at<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.590> Centennial<00:00:16.590> Airport

right<00:00:42.059> now<00:00:42.210> I'm<00:00:42.300> going<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.510> explain<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.989> you

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
right now I'm going to explain to you

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.209 
right now I'm going to explain to you
how<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.350> get<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.829> good<00:00:44.489> approach<00:00:45.210> descent<00:00:45.809> path

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
how to get a good approach descent path

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:52.760 
how to get a good approach descent path
established<00:00:47.750> at<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:49.250> at<00:00:50.250> an<00:00:50.430> airport<00:00:51.620> first<00:00:52.620> of

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
established at a at an airport first of

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.740 
established at a at an airport first of
all<00:00:52.860> let's<00:00:53.070> start<00:00:53.160> out<00:00:53.430> by<00:00:53.460> these<00:00:53.910> lights<00:00:54.420> out

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
all let's start out by these lights out

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.410 
all let's start out by these lights out
here<00:00:55.520> they're<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> little<00:00:56.879> bit<00:00:57.000> hard<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.300> see

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
here they're a little bit hard to see

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.360 
here they're a little bit hard to see
but<00:00:57.719> there<00:00:58.199> are<00:00:59.809> these<00:01:00.809> lights<00:01:01.469> out<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
but there are these lights out here and

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.230 
but there are these lights out here and
these<00:01:02.760> are<00:01:03.680> called<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:05.010> Vasi<00:01:05.820> which<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.210> a

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
these are called a Vasi which is a

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.570 
these are called a Vasi which is a
visual<00:01:06.869> approach<00:01:07.290> slope<00:01:07.950> indicator<00:01:08.400> and

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
visual approach slope indicator and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.280 
visual approach slope indicator and
they're<00:01:08.700> shown<00:01:08.970> about<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> three<00:01:10.020> degrees

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
they're shown about a three degrees

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.960 
they're shown about a three degrees
descending<00:01:13.290> slope<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.010> right<00:01:14.280> now<00:01:14.520> we're

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
descending slope so right now we're

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.450 
descending slope so right now we're
showing<00:01:15.290> two<00:01:16.290> red<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.920> white<00:01:16.950> which<00:01:17.430> means

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
showing two red to white which means

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.899 
showing two red to white which means
we're<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.299> descent<00:01:18.750> path<00:01:18.960> perfect<00:01:19.909> we're

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
we're on the descent path perfect we're

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.910 
we're on the descent path perfect we're
on<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.210> path<00:01:21.479> perfectly<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.470> we<00:01:22.560> don't<00:01:22.770> need

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
on the path perfectly and we don't need

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.100 
on the path perfectly and we don't need
to<00:01:24.619> climb<00:01:25.619> or<00:01:25.860> descend<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.810> shown<00:01:27.810> over<00:01:27.990> here

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
to climb or descend and shown over here

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.289 
to climb or descend and shown over here
to<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> precision<00:01:29.670> approach<00:01:30.270> path

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
to this is a precision approach path

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.810 
to this is a precision approach path
indicator<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.619> real<00:01:31.829> life

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
indicator but in real life

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.899 
indicator but in real life
both<00:01:33.270> these<00:01:33.509> runways<00:01:33.869> do<00:01:34.619> have<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.400> precision

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
both these runways do have a precision

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.910 
both these runways do have a precision
approach<00:01:36.210> path<00:01:36.450> indicator<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.530> reason<00:01:37.829> I

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
approach path indicator and the reason I

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.649 
approach path indicator and the reason I
know<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.579> because<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.939> fly<00:01:39.210> out<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.479> this

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
know this is because I fly out of this

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.020 
know this is because I fly out of this
Airport<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.320> real<00:01:40.530> world<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.970> is

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
Airport in the real world so this is

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.020 
Airport in the real world so this is
what<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.630> should<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:43.079> seeing<00:01:43.649> on<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.759> runway

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
what you should be seeing on this runway

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.260 
what you should be seeing on this runway
but<00:01:45.450> right<00:01:46.020> now<00:01:46.290> I'm<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:47.130> fsx<00:01:47.790> has<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.149> up

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
but right now I'm just fsx has it up

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.440 
but right now I'm just fsx has it up
where<00:01:48.450> they<00:01:48.540> have<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> Vasi<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:49.560> as<00:01:50.450> precision

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
where they have a Vasi but as precision

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.120 
where they have a Vasi but as precision
approach<00:01:51.720> path<00:01:51.750> indicator<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.710> used<00:01:52.740> for

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
approach path indicator is used for

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.270 
approach path indicator is used for
instruments<00:01:53.880> landings<00:01:54.390> as<00:01:54.630> well<00:01:55.219> they<00:01:56.219> are

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
instruments landings as well they are

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.609 
instruments landings as well they are
also<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.880> same<00:01:57.119> three<00:01:57.689> degree<00:01:57.990> descending

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
also the same three degree descending

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.030 
also the same three degree descending
slope<00:01:59.430> into<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.000> runway<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:01.380> right<00:02:01.619> now<00:02:01.860> we're

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
slope into the runway so right now we're

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.740 
slope into the runway so right now we're
showing<00:02:02.250> like<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.579> said<00:02:02.909> our<00:02:03.090> red<00:02:03.299> over<00:02:03.570> white

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
showing like I said our red over white

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.380 
showing like I said our red over white
sand<00:02:04.079> that's<00:02:04.200> perfect<00:02:04.770> if<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.189> get<00:02:05.399> both

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
sand that's perfect if you get both

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.290 
sand that's perfect if you get both
white<00:02:06.780> lights<00:02:07.560> on<00:02:07.860> there<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.819> should<00:02:09.090> you're

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
white lights on there you should you're

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.809 
white lights on there you should you're
above<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.170> glide<00:02:10.410> slope<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:10.979> you're<00:02:11.220> too<00:02:11.520> high

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
above the glide slope so you're too high

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.620 
above the glide slope so you're too high
and<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.239> should<00:02:12.450> reduce<00:02:12.599> your<00:02:12.989> throttle

is<00:04:19.579> if<00:04:20.120> you<00:04:20.979> put<00:04:21.979> the<00:04:22.130> flaps<00:04:22.430> in<00:04:24.759> before<00:04:25.759> that

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
is if you put the flaps in before that

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.279 
is if you put the flaps in before that
wide<00:04:26.240> arc<00:04:26.509> you<00:04:27.169> could<00:04:27.380> crap<00:04:27.710> your<00:04:28.009> as<00:04:28.490> not<00:04:28.849> crap

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
wide arc you could crap your as not crap

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.290 
wide arc you could crap your as not crap
cracking<00:04:30.289> your<00:04:30.620> flaps<00:04:31.120> unfortunately<00:04:32.120> and

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
cracking your flaps unfortunately and

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.089 
cracking your flaps unfortunately and
that's<00:04:32.419> a<00:04:32.690> not<00:04:33.139> a<00:04:33.169> good<00:04:33.380> thing<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:33.710> do<00:04:33.860> it's

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
that's a not a good thing to do it's

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.060 
that's a not a good thing to do it's
very<00:04:34.340> costly<00:04:34.729> repairs<00:04:35.210> and<00:04:35.539> just<00:04:35.900> just<00:04:36.889> keep

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
very costly repairs and just just keep

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.249 
very costly repairs and just just keep
an<00:04:37.190> eye<00:04:37.310> on<00:04:37.340> that<00:04:37.610> speed<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.210> I<00:04:38.330> just<00:04:38.630> inserted

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
an eye on that speed and I just inserted

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.370 
an eye on that speed and I just inserted
flaps<00:04:39.560> 10<00:04:40.060> so<00:04:41.060> we're<00:04:41.509> doing<00:04:41.660> all<00:04:41.900> right

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
flaps 10 so we're doing all right

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.140 
flaps 10 so we're doing all right
we're<00:04:42.590> showing<00:04:42.860> red<00:04:43.310> over<00:04:43.580> a<00:04:43.610> wide<00:04:43.849> again

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
we're showing red over a wide again

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.570 
we're showing red over a wide again
which<00:04:44.389> is<00:04:44.570> good<00:04:44.810> now<00:04:45.710> let's<00:04:45.889> keep<00:04:46.430> your

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
which is good now let's keep your

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.969 
which is good now let's keep your
approach<00:04:46.940> speed<00:04:47.330> about<00:04:47.690> 80<00:04:48.110> knots<00:04:48.470> at<00:04:48.770> this

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
approach speed about 80 knots at this

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.909 
approach speed about 80 knots at this
point<00:04:49.280> we<00:04:49.460> are<00:04:49.490> probably<00:04:49.940> on<00:04:50.210> a<00:04:50.240> 2<00:04:51.110> mile<00:04:51.349> 3<00:04:51.740> mile

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
point we are probably on a 2 mile 3 mile

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.510 
point we are probably on a 2 mile 3 mile
final<00:04:52.460> right<00:04:52.669> now<00:04:53.020> so<00:04:54.020> that<00:04:54.500> is<00:04:54.530> good<00:04:54.949> just

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
final right now so that is good just

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.219 
final right now so that is good just
keep<00:04:55.729> once<00:04:56.060> again<00:04:56.360> keep<00:04:56.690> those<00:04:56.870> small

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
keep once again keep those small

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.450 
keep once again keep those small
adjustments<00:04:58.039> up<00:04:58.610> down<00:04:59.030> and<00:04:59.690> um<00:05:00.280> you<00:05:01.280> could

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
adjustments up down and um you could

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.820 
adjustments up down and um you could
trim<00:05:01.760> it<00:05:01.909> too<00:05:02.120> with<00:05:02.419> the<00:05:02.449> trim<00:05:03.229> wheels<00:05:03.470> so<00:05:03.710> you

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
trim it too with the trim wheels so you

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.790 
trim it too with the trim wheels so you
don't<00:05:04.039> have<00:05:04.220> to<00:05:04.430> really<00:05:04.760> make<00:05:04.940> super<00:05:05.800> big

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
don't have to really make super big

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.219 
don't have to really make super big
adjustments<00:05:07.550> so<00:05:07.789> that's<00:05:08.060> what<00:05:08.270> I<00:05:08.300> have<00:05:08.990> done

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
adjustments so that's what I have done

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.100 
adjustments so that's what I have done
up<00:05:10.270> previously<00:05:11.270> starting<00:05:11.720> the<00:05:11.810> video<00:05:11.960> I

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
up previously starting the video I

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.600 
up previously starting the video I
trimmed<00:05:12.530> her<00:05:12.650> out<00:05:12.830> so<00:05:13.159> everything's<00:05:13.669> good<00:05:14.380> so

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
trimmed her out so everything's good so

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.520 
trimmed her out so everything's good so
once<00:05:16.610> again<00:05:16.820> try<00:05:17.360> not<00:05:17.389> to<00:05:17.750> use<00:05:17.930> your<00:05:17.960> throttle

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
once again try not to use your throttle

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.700 
once again try not to use your throttle
a<00:05:18.560> lot<00:05:18.909> don't<00:05:19.909> be<00:05:20.180> a<00:05:20.210> throttle<00:05:20.690> jockey<00:05:20.720> and<00:05:21.560> I

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
a lot don't be a throttle jockey and I

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.280 
a lot don't be a throttle jockey and I
am<00:05:21.830> going<00:05:21.979> to<00:05:22.099> put<00:05:22.220> in<00:05:22.340> flaps<00:05:22.610> 20<00:05:23.030> right<00:05:23.240> now

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
am going to put in flaps 20 right now

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.400 
am going to put in flaps 20 right now
so<00:05:24.920> in<00:05:25.430> a<00:05:25.790> way<00:05:26.000> you<00:05:26.060> have<00:05:26.150> flap<00:05:26.570> stirs<00:05:26.870> but<00:05:27.200> you

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
so in a way you have flap stirs but you

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.240 
so in a way you have flap stirs but you
could<00:05:27.800> go<00:05:27.980> into<00:05:28.190> the<00:05:29.140> options<00:05:30.140> settings<00:05:30.770> and

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
could go into the options settings and

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.300 
could go into the options settings and
then<00:05:31.370> control<00:05:31.880> Tunney<00:05:32.300> could<00:05:32.480> set<00:05:32.780> whatever

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
then control Tunney could set whatever

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.370 
then control Tunney could set whatever
button<00:05:34.310> you<00:05:34.370> ups<00:05:34.580> or<00:05:34.820> flaps<00:05:35.240> extend<00:05:35.840> and<00:05:36.110> flaps

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
button you ups or flaps extend and flaps

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.260 
button you ups or flaps extend and flaps
up

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
up

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.200 
up
retract<00:05:38.270> so<00:05:39.140> right<00:05:39.350> now<00:05:39.560> we're<00:05:39.800> showing

really good you know I already have it
set<00:05:42.860> up<00:05:42.980> on<00:05:43.130> my<00:05:43.190> joystick<00:05:43.850> so<00:05:44.450> that's<00:05:44.690> really

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
set up on my joystick so that's really

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.310 
set up on my joystick so that's really
nice<00:05:45.940> we're<00:05:46.940> showing<00:05:47.120> about<00:05:47.240> 70<00:05:47.840> knots<00:05:48.050> now

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
nice we're showing about 70 knots now

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
so we're shown its we're shown once

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.850 
so we're shown its we're shown once
again<00:06:00.680> that<00:06:00.830> red<00:06:01.070> over<00:06:01.340> white<00:06:01.550> and<00:06:01.910> uh<00:06:02.860> just

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
again that red over white and uh just

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.590 
again that red over white and uh just
keep<00:06:04.040> it<00:06:04.250> going<00:06:04.640> down<00:06:04.790> really<00:06:05.120> nice<00:06:05.360> and

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 
keep it going down really nice and

keep it going down really nice and
smooth<00:06:05.960> once<00:06:06.290> again<00:06:06.650> add<00:06:07.250> powers<00:06:07.850> need<00:06:08.210> to<00:06:08.330> try

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
smooth once again add powers need to try

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.040 
smooth once again add powers need to try
not<00:06:08.810> to<00:06:09.280> be<00:06:10.280> a<00:06:10.310> throttle<00:06:10.850> jockey<00:06:11.150> by<00:06:11.600> moving<00:06:11.840> it

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
not to be a throttle jockey by moving it

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.050 
not to be a throttle jockey by moving it
in<00:06:12.230> and<00:06:12.410> out<00:06:12.590> just<00:06:13.100> try<00:06:13.340> to<00:06:13.400> control<00:06:13.850> your

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
in and out just try to control your

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.740 
in and out just try to control your
airspeed<00:06:14.570> with<00:06:14.720> your<00:06:14.990> descending<00:06:15.770> and<00:06:16.750> climb

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
airspeed with your descending and climb

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.650 
airspeed with your descending and climb
rate<00:06:17.990> that<00:06:18.350> really<00:06:18.740> helps<00:06:19.070> out<00:06:19.330> so<00:06:20.330> what<00:06:20.510> we're

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
rate that really helps out so what we're

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.600 
rate that really helps out so what we're
going<00:06:20.780> to<00:06:20.840> do<00:06:21.080> once<00:06:21.410> you<00:06:21.560> reach<00:06:21.800> these<00:06:22.070> numbers

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
going to do once you reach these numbers

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.910 
going to do once you reach these numbers
right<00:06:22.850> here<00:06:23.120> so<00:06:23.360> that's<00:06:23.450> that<00:06:23.840> these<00:06:24.680> things

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:24.920 
right here so that's that these things

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.250 
right here so that's that these things
are<00:06:25.190> called<00:06:25.490> the<00:06:25.580> numbers<00:06:26.080> you're<00:06:27.080> going<00:06:27.200> to

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
are called the numbers you're going to

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.770 
are called the numbers you're going to
pull<00:06:27.530> your<00:06:27.710> throttle<00:06:28.250> back<00:06:28.520> to<00:06:28.850> idle<00:06:29.450> so

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
pull your throttle back to idle so

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.120 
pull your throttle back to idle so
you're<00:06:29.990> going<00:06:30.110> to<00:06:30.140> pull<00:06:30.350> your<00:06:30.530> throttle<00:06:30.980> all

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
you're going to pull your throttle all

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.820 
you're going to pull your throttle all
the<00:06:31.250> way<00:06:31.370> back<00:06:31.640> and<00:06:31.940> then<00:06:32.150> you're<00:06:32.420> going<00:06:32.570> to

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
the way back and then you're going to

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.620 
the way back and then you're going to
set<00:06:33.830> the<00:06:33.860> aircraft<00:06:34.550> into<00:06:35.060> what<00:06:35.240> they<00:06:35.360> call<00:06:35.600> a

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
set the aircraft into what they call a

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.590 
set the aircraft into what they call a
flare<00:06:36.020> and<00:06:36.350> you<00:06:36.410> just<00:06:37.070> keep<00:06:37.640> pulling<00:06:37.940> back<00:06:38.330> on

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
flare and you just keep pulling back on

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.410 
flare and you just keep pulling back on
the<00:06:38.780> stick<00:06:39.080> until<00:06:39.410> your<00:06:39.890> main<00:06:40.730> wheels<00:06:41.060> touch

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:41.420 
the stick until your main wheels touch

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.150 
the stick until your main wheels touch
down<00:06:41.450> first<00:06:42.020> you<00:06:42.260> never<00:06:42.470> want<00:06:42.710> to<00:06:42.770> put<00:06:42.980> your

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
down first you never want to put your

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.610 
down first you never want to put your
nose<00:06:43.460> wheel<00:06:43.700> into<00:06:44.060> the<00:06:44.150> ground<00:06:44.420> because<00:06:44.870> you

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
nose wheel into the ground because you

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.500 
nose wheel into the ground because you
get<00:06:45.800> what<00:06:45.980> they<00:06:46.100> call<00:06:46.340> it<00:06:46.460> prop<00:06:46.730> strike<00:06:47.150> and

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:47.510 
get what they call it prop strike and

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.220 
get what they call it prop strike and
it's<00:06:48.170> a<00:06:48.650> pretty<00:06:49.130> costly<00:06:49.940> repair<00:06:50.450> so<00:06:51.050> once

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.230 
it's a pretty costly repair so once

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.080 
it's a pretty costly repair so once
again<00:06:51.380> keep<00:06:51.950> pulling

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090 
again keep pulling

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.110 
again keep pulling
never<00:06:53.660> push<00:06:54.020> over<00:06:54.440> just<00:06:55.190> a<00:06:55.310> wise<00:06:55.490> thing<00:06:55.760> to<00:06:55.790> do

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 
never push over just a wise thing to do

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.320 
never push over just a wise thing to do
and<00:06:57.080> as<00:06:57.500> you<00:06:57.680> see<00:06:57.890> we<00:06:57.920> just<00:06:58.070> touched<00:06:58.550> down<00:06:58.700> so

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
and as you see we just touched down so

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.290 
and as you see we just touched down so
you<00:07:00.260> can<00:07:00.410> actually<00:07:00.590> go<00:07:00.860> to<00:07:00.940> replay<00:07:01.940> and<00:07:02.150> see

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:02.300 
you can actually go to replay and see

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.390 
you can actually go to replay and see
how<00:07:02.390> good<00:07:02.600> my<00:07:02.660> landing<00:07:03.230> was<00:07:03.440> but<00:07:03.860> I<00:07:03.890> felt<00:07:04.340> that

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
how good my landing was but I felt that

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.640 
how good my landing was but I felt that
was<00:07:04.640> pretty<00:07:04.850> good<00:07:05.150> so<00:07:05.570> hold<00:07:05.990> on<00:07:06.140> one<00:07:06.320> second

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:07.650 
was pretty good so hold on one second

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.499 
was pretty good so hold on one second
Shen's<00:07:08.550> its<00:07:09.360> replay<00:07:09.960> will<00:07:10.410> do<00:07:10.759> 60<00:07:11.759> seconds<00:07:12.300> so

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:12.509 
Shen's its replay will do 60 seconds so

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:15.469 
Shen's its replay will do 60 seconds so
here<00:07:12.780> we<00:07:12.930> are<00:07:13.220> around<00:07:14.220> finals<00:07:14.729> we<00:07:14.910> got<00:07:15.090> all<00:07:15.300> our

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.479 
here we are around finals we got all our

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:19.330 
here we are around finals we got all our
flaps<00:07:15.810> down<00:07:16.169> and<00:07:16.560> making<00:07:17.190> those<00:07:17.490> small<00:07:17.669> minor

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:19.340 
flaps down and making those small minor

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.520 
flaps down and making those small minor
tunes<00:07:20.340> as<00:07:20.699> you<00:07:20.850> can<00:07:21.000> see<00:07:21.210> right<00:07:21.419> there<00:07:21.530> just

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:22.530 
tunes as you can see right there just

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:23.960 
tunes as you can see right there just
keep<00:07:22.680> it<00:07:22.800> really<00:07:22.979> nice<00:07:23.220> and<00:07:23.280> you'll<00:07:23.610> see<00:07:23.820> what

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:23.970 
keep it really nice and you'll see what

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.700 
keep it really nice and you'll see what
I<00:07:24.000> mean<00:07:24.060> by<00:07:24.389> the<00:07:24.449> flare<00:07:24.810> whenever<00:07:25.229> we<00:07:25.410> start

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:25.710 
I mean by the flare whenever we start

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.010 
I mean by the flare whenever we start
pitching<00:07:26.070> the<00:07:26.190> aircraft<00:07:26.639> up<00:07:26.910> and<00:07:27.630> that's<00:07:27.780> when

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 
pitching the aircraft up and that's when

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.080 
pitching the aircraft up and that's when
you're<00:07:28.169> over<00:07:28.590> the<00:07:28.860> runway<00:07:29.220> you<00:07:29.280> do<00:07:29.580> not<00:07:29.729> pull

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.090 
you're over the runway you do not pull

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.150 
you're over the runway you do not pull
throttle<00:07:30.570> before<00:07:31.020> the<00:07:31.199> numbers<00:07:31.560> until<00:07:31.830> you

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 
throttle before the numbers until you

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.070 
throttle before the numbers until you
have<00:07:32.310> reached<00:07:32.580> that<00:07:32.759> threshold<00:07:32.880> you<00:07:33.690> do<00:07:33.870> that

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 
have reached that threshold you do that

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.219 
have reached that threshold you do that
so<00:07:34.919> here<00:07:35.190> we<00:07:35.310> go<00:07:35.550> we<00:07:35.820> just<00:07:35.850> ballooned<00:07:36.720> a<00:07:36.930> slight

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:37.229 
so here we go we just ballooned a slight

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:38.990 
so here we go we just ballooned a slight
bit<00:07:37.500> because<00:07:38.009> we<00:07:38.160> had<00:07:38.250> a<00:07:38.280> little<00:07:38.460> bit<00:07:38.639> too<00:07:38.850> much

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 
bit because we had a little bit too much

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.469 
bit because we had a little bit too much
hair<00:07:39.210> speed<00:07:39.509> and<00:07:39.830> there<00:07:40.830> you<00:07:40.979> go<00:07:41.220> once<00:07:42.150> again

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 
hair speed and there you go once again

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:44.719 
hair speed and there you go once again
