00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.200
 fateful of chicken side dishes 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.200
 baked 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:17.070

 spectacular 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.029
 the onion and the morrón this 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.220
 maybe you have a little less than 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.220
 cooking but paranormality the same 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.520
 olive oil for cooking 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.180
 d 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:01:00.820
 there is a little bit more worth too 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.820
 I left her with the cut in the 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.290
 advice and there is another thing that is 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.890
 making frames there 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.890
 frames 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.920
 this mainly for what you have 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.730
 starches so we're talking about 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.520
 the potato of the sweet potato 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.830
 noting the carrot but also what 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.190
 that explains all this well 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.930
 as you see it had 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.000
 untill there 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.330
 I already have another seasoning when I leave 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.980
 what is a hell by parts what 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.600
 you can enter the same oven or the 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.360
 power with the normal arrival since I have 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.730
 here in a roaster this case a scissors 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.500
 he has to make a noise but how does he 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.400
 what to do when you are going to do for example 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.400
 in the baked potatoes 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.170
 in that little noise this is important 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.850
 is key then so it's not going to hit 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.340
 this as we were being a cook 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.110
 direct line is not going to stick I'm not going 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.680
 to leave every time as well as I was not at 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.440
 oven 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.259
 it was clear this point where tasty there 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.090
 It was clear that this is how we are going to put it 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.390
 oven and on the other hand in a costadito 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.600
 permission why not 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.160
 of color because I put the rest of this 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.620
 because I'm going to take it out before going to 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.470
 cook for that now after girl that 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.110
 there's no way my love is not that 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.510
 already avoided the misfortune of 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.400
 find me the peace happens to shoot 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.390
 exact machine that were highly of 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.400
 cooking is all right this is going to 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.880
 result much easier because before 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.880
 catchy 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.969
 baked 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.720
 and I'm going to make chicken last 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.160
 moment we are taking out first we have 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.870
 what to do is turn the table because 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.879
 there was something 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.629
 raw and now we want to work on 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.010
 cooked from having taken it out of the oven 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:03.099
 how long had been quantum 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.680
 I had been 50 minutes to an hour 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.140
 attentive and with this 50 minutes to a 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.659
 moderate oven time and remember that the 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:16.150
 breasts we had covered with paper 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:18.760
 little piece we take the aluminum foil 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.370
 put the oven to maximum so that no 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.360
 you stay with the breasts and we gave him 15 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.120
 more minutes 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.120
 more or less then 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.060
 and how am I doing in hot 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.349
 me because being a hot recontra 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.319
 just came out what I'm discovering 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.690
 and it's good to say it apart from water there 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.700
 two areas of little things that generate a 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.700
 Very important flavor 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.460
 so that this chicken was not enough 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.990
 It is very rich that it has all its 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.990
 butter and golden 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.690
 how to get this out of me what I'm going to 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.760
 put on top when serving 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.760
 this is amazing 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.070
 tremendous to take out the thread so that 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.850
 no one gets confused and then this is very 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.270
 simple 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.900
 I do not have a harbor 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.900
 I have 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.840
 since 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:39.740
 that's how I won the scholarship 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:42.320
 5 spoons of fresh lemon juice 1 - 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.660
 also grated and 5 tablespoons of 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.620
 vinegar 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:51.310
 and alcohol or wine it was clear this 55 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:54.480
 and this you add 5 olive oil 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.480
 it became clear they want me to repeat it 

00:04:56.769 --> 00:05:03.919
 hook it then again is 5 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:06.619
 spoonful of lemon juice 5 of vinegar 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.899
 of wine or white green line a touch of 

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:12.880
 salt a touch of pepper a good 

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:15.640
 spoonful of fresh thyme 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.810
 5 tablespoons of olive oil and if 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.450
 you want to add a little bit of 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.730
 lemon zest a finish of the 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.920
 static another seasoning let's say it 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.810
 by season and you half skulk the 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.030
 dialogue a plane was in confidence 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.040
 We are family and did not start at 11 in 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.380
 point like us juan bracelli is 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.120
 being a classic of always and is a 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.940
 version of a baked chicken that 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.420
 really to recommend tremendous cala 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:43.990
 and had it put on the subcutaneous level 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:46.420
 between meat and skin a mixture that 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.180
 had thyme butter and in grams of 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.710

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.410
 of chopped thyme as the fresh can 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.470
 to be dry salt pepper the zest of a 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.350
 lemon 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.630
 One or two pieces of garlic is already fed 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:03.910
 they said yes sir and red paprika 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.910
 put the likes that you want 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.930
 I mixed all that and that paste I put it 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.900
 between the skin and the flesh by 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.490
 costs for the lack thighs by the 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.980
 color nothing happens with that 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.500
 enumeration that was left me finished of 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.510
 give a adif massage outdoors to everything 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.430
 this for the tremendous chicken that we are 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.470
 making baked chicken and that says 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.620
 then instead of putting them to bed and that we 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:33.440
 has cost and make it like any ball 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:35.090
 teacher and I put him in a can that 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.380
 It may be a note that you have left over 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.700
 beer so we put water and if 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.950
 you want you can put some teeth 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.360
 of garlic so that it aromatizes everything where 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.980
 we sat there because we put water 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.470
 that we do not fall to which this 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:51.270
 just as it is we upload it to a what 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.340
 we stuck between a hip 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.080
 so that it does not dry on the breasts 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.780
 breasts with double paper 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:00.870
 aluminum well covered and we send it 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:03.090
 between 50 minutes and an hour to oven 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.670
 moderate we take the aluminum foil 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:08.070
 we raise the oven to the maximum 15 minutes 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:11.000
 the more it got brown and we wrap it like that now 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.000
 with all this 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.260
 you put all the vegetables and the guard 

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.760
 when you cut the potatoes the sweet potatoes 

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:29.550
 in babies with olive oil and with 

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:32.100
 the aroma or flavor that you put the 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.630
 seasoning and you go the salt where you go 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.400
 to make it heats up the 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.530
 burner or inside the oven to heat 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.210
 well you throw all the potatoes there you have to 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.100
 making noise to her is not going to hit you 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.690
 accommodates them and sends them to classrooms 

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.340
 quiet kitchens that are cooked Navarre 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.840
 to turn from the middle to prove that 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.960
 I had a pocket 

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:51.160
