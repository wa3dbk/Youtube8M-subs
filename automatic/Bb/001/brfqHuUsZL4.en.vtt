00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
the custom content I think right now I

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.510 
the custom content I think right now I
have<00:02:20.640> way<00:02:21.640> more<00:02:22.620> custom<00:02:23.620> content<00:02:24.070> than<00:02:24.370> the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
actual size of the game which is really

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.010 
actual size of the game which is really
weird<00:02:27.250> I'm<00:02:27.430> surprised<00:02:27.850> it's<00:02:28.090> running<00:02:28.630> as<00:02:28.810> well

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
weird I'm surprised it's running as well

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.010 
weird I'm surprised it's running as well
as<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.620> just<00:02:30.100> because<00:02:30.280> I<00:02:30.880> have<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.690> much

room<00:04:01.660> like<00:04:02.019> that's<00:04:02.290> what<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.560> house<00:04:02.709> would<00:04:02.739> be

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
so by looking at the living room you can

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.190 
so by looking at the living room you can
tell<00:04:05.470> that<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.799> house<00:04:05.980> would<00:04:06.250> be<00:04:06.400> really<00:04:06.549> open

with<00:04:11.680> lighter<00:04:12.010> floors<00:04:12.970> just<00:04:13.360> because<00:04:13.600> I

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
with lighter floors just because I

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.480 
with lighter floors just because I
always<00:04:13.900> go<00:04:14.290> for<00:04:14.590> a<00:04:14.620> dark<00:04:14.920> dark<00:04:15.130> wood<00:04:15.459> floor

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
always go for a dark dark wood floor

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.599 
always go for a dark dark wood floor
just

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.849 
just
of<00:04:16.669> you<00:04:16.789> this<00:04:16.969> might<00:04:17.269> be<00:04:17.719> like<00:04:17.959> a<00:04:18.139> really<00:04:18.469> dark

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.540 
of you this might be like a really dark
floor<00:04:19.430> but<00:04:20.019> for<00:04:21.019> me<00:04:21.229> this<00:04:21.949> is<00:04:22.159> a<00:04:22.189> light

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
floor but for me this is a light

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.189 
floor but for me this is a light
compared<00:04:23.090> to<00:04:23.150> what<00:04:23.270> i<00:04:23.300> usually<00:04:23.569> do<00:04:23.960> which<00:04:24.169> is

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
compared to what i usually do which is

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.760 
compared to what i usually do which is
like<00:04:24.530> almost<00:04:24.830> black<00:04:25.460> on<00:04:25.879> the<00:04:25.939> floor<00:04:26.389> and<00:04:27.199> I

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
like almost black on the floor and I

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.860 
like almost black on the floor and I
knew<00:04:27.979> that<00:04:28.009> I<00:04:28.250> wanted<00:04:28.490> everything<00:04:29.030> else<00:04:29.419> to<00:04:29.689> be

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
knew that I wanted everything else to be

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.170 
knew that I wanted everything else to be
white<00:04:30.229> when<00:04:30.680> it<00:04:30.770> came<00:04:31.039> to<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.400> built-ins<00:04:31.849> that

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
white when it came to the built-ins that

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.659 
white when it came to the built-ins that
I<00:04:32.210> wanted<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.439> shelving<00:04:34.069> and<00:04:34.400> I<00:04:34.460> knew<00:04:34.639> I

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
I wanted the shelving and I knew I

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.839 
I wanted the shelving and I knew I
wanted<00:04:35.210> to<00:04:35.270> accent<00:04:35.990> walls<00:04:36.259> well<00:04:37.159> I<00:04:37.370> guess<00:04:37.669> a

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
wanted to accent walls well I guess a

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:39.700 
wanted to accent walls well I guess a
showpiece<00:04:38.330> wall<00:04:38.629> and<00:04:38.900> then<00:04:39.050> an<00:04:39.199> accent<00:04:39.620> wall

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
showpiece wall and then an accent wall

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.300 
showpiece wall and then an accent wall
so<00:04:40.069> like<00:04:40.219> the<00:04:40.370> black<00:04:40.699> is<00:04:40.939> the<00:04:40.969> accent<00:04:41.539> wall

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
so like the black is the accent wall

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.309 
so like the black is the accent wall
then<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.460> other<00:04:43.639> wall<00:04:43.969> is<00:04:44.300> going<00:04:45.020> to<00:04:45.139> have

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:45.319 
then the other wall is going to have

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:48.369 
then the other wall is going to have
built-ins<00:04:45.919> and<00:04:46.310> then<00:04:46.639> I<00:04:47.180> wanted<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:48.020> floor

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:48.379 
built-ins and then I wanted the floor

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:50.350 
built-ins and then I wanted the floor
again<00:04:49.069> like<00:04:49.219> I<00:04:49.340> said<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.699> be<00:04:49.819> lighter<00:04:50.240> than

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
again like I said to be lighter than

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.869 
again like I said to be lighter than
what<00:04:50.779> I<00:04:50.810> usually<00:04:50.870> choose<00:04:51.469> and<00:04:51.860> then<00:04:52.039> look<00:04:52.759> a

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:52.879 
what I usually choose and then look a

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:55.990 
what I usually choose and then look a
little<00:04:53.090> rugged<00:04:53.659> and<00:04:54.229> used<00:04:54.800> and<00:04:55.129> worn<00:04:55.340> out<00:04:55.610> just

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
little rugged and used and worn out just

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.809 
little rugged and used and worn out just
because<00:04:56.150> but<00:04:56.689> not<00:04:56.900> be<00:04:57.080> worn<00:04:57.319> out<00:04:57.620> but<00:04:58.490> look

00:04:58.809 --> 00:04:58.819 
because but not be worn out but look

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:01.480 
because but not be worn out but look
like<00:04:59.029> it<00:04:59.180> is<00:04:59.330> and<00:04:59.810> I<00:05:00.529> think<00:05:00.740> I<00:05:01.039> pulled<00:05:01.279> that<00:05:01.430> off

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
like it is and I think I pulled that off

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:09.450 
like it is and I think I pulled that off
and<00:05:02.379> I<00:05:03.400> also<00:05:04.400> wanted<00:05:04.729> to<00:05:06.099> play<00:05:07.099> around<00:05:07.279> with

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
and I also wanted to play around with

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.480 
and I also wanted to play around with
the<00:05:10.460> accents<00:05:11.449> I<00:05:11.659> guess<00:05:11.990> this<00:05:12.800> room<00:05:13.099> doesn't

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
the accents I guess this room doesn't

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.059 
the accents I guess this room doesn't
have<00:05:13.699> a<00:05:13.879> lot<00:05:14.210> of<00:05:14.240> color<00:05:14.719> in<00:05:14.990> it<00:05:15.139> but<00:05:15.469> it<00:05:15.650> looks

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:16.069 
have a lot of color in it but it looks

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:18.580 
have a lot of color in it but it looks
very<00:05:16.400> lived-in<00:05:16.969> at<00:05:17.270> least<00:05:17.479> to<00:05:17.750> me<00:05:17.930> it<00:05:17.960> looks

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
very lived-in at least to me it looks

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.980 
very lived-in at least to me it looks
clean<00:05:18.889> there's<00:05:19.370> a<00:05:19.430> lot<00:05:19.550> of<00:05:19.580> clean<00:05:19.879> lines<00:05:20.150> but

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
clean there's a lot of clean lines but

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.649 
clean there's a lot of clean lines but
there<00:05:21.800> it<00:05:22.069> also<00:05:22.400> looks<00:05:22.610> lived<00:05:22.969> in<00:05:23.150> a<00:05:23.360> little

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:23.659 
there it also looks lived in a little

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:30.369 
there it also looks lived in a little
bit<00:05:23.960> and<00:05:24.669> I<00:05:26.110> have<00:05:27.110> a<00:05:27.770> shelving<00:05:28.400> unit<00:05:28.430> and<00:05:29.379> then

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:30.379 
bit and I have a shelving unit and then

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:33.100 
bit and I have a shelving unit and then
I<00:05:30.440> also<00:05:30.620> have<00:05:31.159> those<00:05:31.370> cabinets<00:05:32.180> by<00:05:32.449> the<00:05:32.509> window

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
I also have those cabinets by the window

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.219 
I also have those cabinets by the window
that<00:05:33.919> I<00:05:33.949> wanted<00:05:34.430> to<00:05:34.490> look<00:05:34.789> like<00:05:35.060> a<00:05:35.389> half<00:05:35.870> ball

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
that I wanted to look like a half ball

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.619 
that I wanted to look like a half ball
but<00:05:37.039> since<00:05:37.310> we<00:05:37.490> don't<00:05:37.520> have<00:05:37.729> that<00:05:37.940> in<00:05:38.300> the<00:05:38.389> sims

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:38.629 
but since we don't have that in the sims

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:41.079 
but since we don't have that in the sims
4<00:05:38.750> with<00:05:39.139> no<00:05:39.289> constraint<00:05:39.830> elevation<00:05:40.430> cheat<00:05:40.759> yet

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:41.089 
4 with no constraint elevation cheat yet

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:44.550 
4 with no constraint elevation cheat yet
I<00:05:41.389> just<00:05:42.349> put<00:05:42.620> in<00:05:42.889> white<00:05:43.250> counters<00:05:43.759> you<00:05:43.969> know<00:05:44.089> to

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
I just put in white counters you know to

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.740 
I just put in white counters you know to
give<00:05:45.560> that<00:05:45.740> sort<00:05:45.979> of<00:05:46.099> feel<00:05:46.310> by<00:05:46.550> the<00:05:46.610> window<00:05:47.120> and

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
give that sort of feel by the window and

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.230 
give that sort of feel by the window and
I<00:05:48.500> thought<00:05:48.740> then<00:05:49.310> it<00:05:49.490> turned<00:05:49.789> out<00:05:49.909> really<00:05:50.120> well

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
I thought then it turned out really well

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.029 
I thought then it turned out really well
and<00:05:51.039> I<00:05:52.039> hope<00:05:52.250> you<00:05:52.610> guys<00:05:52.819> like<00:05:53.360> this<00:05:53.779> room<00:05:54.379> it's

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
and I hope you guys like this room it's

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.269 
and I hope you guys like this room it's
I<00:05:55.849> think<00:05:56.389> it's<00:05:56.509> a<00:05:56.659> 6<00:05:56.960> by<00:05:57.169> 12<00:05:57.229> so<00:05:57.800> it's<00:05:58.039> really

00:05:58.269 --> 00:05:58.279 
I think it's a 6 by 12 so it's really

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:01.869 
I think it's a 6 by 12 so it's really
long<00:05:58.719> but<00:05:59.719> it's<00:05:59.990> not<00:06:00.169> too<00:06:00.740> big<00:06:01.069> and<00:06:01.490> i<00:06:01.550> think<00:06:01.729> it

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:01.879 
long but it's not too big and i think it

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:05.140 
long but it's not too big and i think it
could<00:06:02.029> fit<00:06:02.210> in<00:06:02.330> a<00:06:02.389> really<00:06:02.839> nice<00:06:03.610> starter<00:06:04.610> like

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
could fit in a really nice starter like

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.899
