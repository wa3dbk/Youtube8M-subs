00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.480 

trace<00:02:55.910> along<00:02:56.120> this<00:02:56.860> this<00:02:57.860> is<00:02:58.010> just<00:02:58.190> how<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.340> do

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
trace along this this is just how I do

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:05.130 
trace along this this is just how I do
it<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.730> can<00:02:58.910> do<00:02:59.030> how<00:02:59.150> you<00:02:59.210> want<00:02:59.360> though<00:03:02.770> I

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
it you can do how you want though I

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.440 
it you can do how you want though I
accidentally<00:03:06.140> right<00:03:06.290> clicked<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:07.330> did<00:03:08.330> it

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
accidentally right clicked I did it

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:18.980 
accidentally right clicked I did it
again

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:28.190 

so<00:03:19.950> this<00:03:20.130> way<00:03:20.810> you<00:03:21.810> have<00:03:22.520> closed<00:03:23.520> images<00:03:27.200> I'll

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
so this way you have closed images I'll

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.170 
so this way you have closed images I'll
get<00:03:28.590> more<00:03:28.800> into<00:03:28.860> detail<00:03:29.400> with<00:03:29.550> coloring<00:03:29.850> later

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
get more into detail with coloring later

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.020 
get more into detail with coloring later
but<00:03:30.740> the<00:03:31.740> reason<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.130> make<00:03:32.280> closed<00:03:32.550> images<00:03:32.910> is

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
but the reason I make closed images is

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.480 
but the reason I make closed images is
because<00:03:33.360> when<00:03:34.230> I'm<00:03:34.350> lazy<00:03:34.560> I<00:03:35.010> just<00:03:35.250> paint

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
because when I'm lazy I just paint

00:03:35.490 --> 00:04:08.590 
because when I'm lazy I just paint
bucket

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.229 

that<00:04:09.200> adds<00:04:09.380> a<00:04:09.500> little<00:04:09.590> bit<00:04:09.740> of<00:04:09.890> a<00:04:09.950> dimension

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.680
