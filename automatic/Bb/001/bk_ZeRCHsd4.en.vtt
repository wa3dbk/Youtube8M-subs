00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
 over here for the study the doctor p well 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.930
 what are we going 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.930
 the crown 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.630
 Y 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.630
 and 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.060
 ah 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.150
 in this program 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.060
 we take the steps are wonderful are 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.980
 precious the only thing I do not like about 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.780
 the ducks is that if you have to have it 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.170
 a place encircled so that there not 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.170
 math 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.140
 but if you have a big place I 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.790
 I would love to live on a farm for 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.920
 example someday when I'm 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.690
 retired and old lady would be happy living 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.660
 in some stores and small packages 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.430
 well in a small windy and compact 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.810
 the cows with all the animals the 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.860
 mosquitoes and mosquitoes also that 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.390
 important and good today we're going to talk about 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.160
 the nutrition of animals is very 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.410
 important to talk not to speak it to know 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.790
 true if it is convenient I think that 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.820
 it is always convenient to launch the 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.650
 balanced because it is already proven that 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.020
 that we know that the same base is like 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.720
 the people do not if the basis of health 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.869
 if it is nutrition is nutrition 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.240
 then it is not enough to feed or 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.040
 you have to feed yes then it is 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.810
 important that we have the 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.550
 requirements that decide our 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.500
 Our puppy's pet let's talk 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.000
 specifically of penalties if we want 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.590
 talk about the puppy specifically in 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.880
 this occasion not to deviate because 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.009
 there are certain 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.479
 good differences with kittens or with 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.580
 other species then let's talk 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.690
 exactly the puppies good is 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.849
 important to know that we have the same 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.019
 Same type of requirement need 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:22.090
 in what is carbohydrate proteins what 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.160
 what are fats vitamins 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.819
 minerals and water the water that is 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.380
 works as a nutrient is that 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.630
 fundamental if those good that's already 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.450
 totally apart from always being 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.769
 generates water at will if not just one 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.769
 medium dose at will 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.819
 cool water 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:01.840
 the specialty is the nutritional part 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.850
 in pet 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.880
 we need to know what 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.880
 the beginning of how we are going to nurture it from 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.370
 puppy is going to be the reflection but let's go 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.910
 to have an adult puppy if then yes 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.400
 we have power is efficient in 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.470
 the puppy we are going to have problems of 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.720
 deficiency in adults yes because in the 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.850
 moment where the organs are formed 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.190
 they form the muscles they form the bone 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.400
 then we need to have a food 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.820
 complete and balanced for this stage of 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.150
 life and if there are also excesses because 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:40.680
 sometimes one relates healthy chubby 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.680
 when it is small even of children 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.880
 also in the puppies we need 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.640
 keep 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.350
 line the line so definitely 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.450
 because their bones are fragile 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.300
 then we are overloading 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.160
 that structure if we are going to have 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.380
 Joint problems or deformations 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.360
 bone then very important that no 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.970
 We need to be chubby sometimes like 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.670
 doctors we have to convince of 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.040
 fall in love with the idea of ​​exaggerating what you put 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.859
 chubby because people love it 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.959
 that they eat and that does not happen to you that of 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.850
 a supercharging is that there are 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.320
 feeders the super practical feeders 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.000
 that one leaves and the food and the 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.620
 puppy well and with my comic so is 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.960
 plaza works well because there are several 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.560
 several troops that you commit but if you have 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.630
 only one animal then and have there 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.400
 at free demand the food is died of 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.289
 one of the causes is very important 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.840
 What is it that you have a guide for a 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:40.080
 veterinarian to know what 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.120
 is the nutritional need of you from 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.150
 your puppy in this case because it depends 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.960
 much of the physiological situation of the 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.960
 activity 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.460
 to be able to arrive the requirement 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.020
 energy you need and why not 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.370
 we just have to see the food in 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.370
 base to the energy that you are going to spend 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.440
 how many kilocalories that more accounts 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.860
 You need how many to keep in 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.960
 this way in animals is a calculation 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.030
 energetic to be able to say message is 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.530
 that ration but it's very easy it 's very 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.550
 easy to catch and it was has been fill it 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.290
 exactly we are not giving ourselves the 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.660
 adequate work to be able to feed 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.100
 well they have that we are going to make a 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.990
 pause in what we were and 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.860
 we have a concern we are going to receive the 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.860
 call hello good morning 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.340

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.340

 animal lover I assume myself and I want 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.820

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.740

 in favor of the animals and first aid 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.600
 a wounded or sick Aztec animal 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.580
 a human because they are in any 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.110
 number of people helping the human that 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.800
 it's okay to do it but the animal 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.750
 nobody pays any attention too little too little and 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.300
 then he seeks home and it will seek 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.070
