the<00:01:44.810> field<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.320> I<00:01:45.590> think<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.189> second<00:01:46.520> half<00:01:46.670> we

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
the field and I think the second half we

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.899 
the field and I think the second half we
came<00:01:47.420> back<00:01:47.600> we<00:01:47.960> pressured<00:01:48.500> them<00:01:48.649> more<00:01:48.950> we're<00:01:49.880> a

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
came back we pressured them more we're a

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.300 
came back we pressured them more we're a
little<00:01:50.180> unlucky<00:01:50.869> hitting<00:01:51.350> some<00:01:51.829> balls<00:01:51.950> some

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
little unlucky hitting some balls some

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.069 
little unlucky hitting some balls some
shots<00:01:52.549> off<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:52.880> post<00:01:53.119> but<00:01:53.479> I<00:01:53.539> think<00:01:53.810> overall

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
shots off the post but I think overall

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.170 
shots off the post but I think overall
second<00:01:54.619> half<00:01:54.770> we<00:01:55.009> we<00:01:55.280> definitely<00:01:55.729> had<00:01:56.060> the

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
second half we we definitely had the

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.179

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
momentum we tactically did what we

momentum we tactically did what we
needed<00:01:58.219> to<00:01:58.549> do<00:01:58.759> and<00:01:58.789> we<00:01:59.090> came<00:01:59.270> out<00:01:59.450> ready<00:01:59.479> and

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
needed to do and we came out ready and

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.349 
needed to do and we came out ready and
we<00:02:00.799> came<00:02:01.039> away<00:02:01.130> with<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.340> win<00:02:01.490> now<00:02:02.090> on<00:02:02.240> your

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
we came away with the win now on your

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:04.359 
we came away with the win now on your
goal<00:02:02.570> there<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.229> assist<00:02:03.530> goes<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.890> Abby<00:02:04.219> it

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369

just<00:02:04.579> seems<00:02:04.759> like<00:02:04.969> that<00:02:05.179> familiarity<00:02:05.689> is

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
just seems like that familiarity is

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.800 
just seems like that familiarity is
there<00:02:06.229> with<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.500> too<00:02:06.679> it<00:02:07.549> does<00:02:07.820> you<00:02:08.119> know<00:02:08.210> it's

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810

there with you too it does you know it's
funny<00:02:08.899> I<00:02:09.679> think<00:02:10.190> Abby's<00:02:10.520> assisted<00:02:11.060> most<00:02:11.330> of<00:02:11.480> my

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
funny I think Abby's assisted most of my

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.820 
funny I think Abby's assisted most of my
goals<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.230> it's<00:02:12.350> kind<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.530> funny<00:02:12.740> because

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830

transition<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.120> defensive<00:03:04.870> back<00:03:05.200> instead<00:03:05.680> of

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
transition to defensive back instead of

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.800 
transition to defensive back instead of
galaxies<00:03:06.910> out<00:03:07.000> there<00:03:07.030> how's<00:03:07.390> that<00:03:07.420> been<00:03:07.780> for

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
galaxies out there how's that been for

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.520 
galaxies out there how's that been for
you<00:03:08.049> yeah<00:03:08.590> I<00:03:08.620> mean<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.220> think<00:03:09.250> I'm<00:03:09.760> learning<00:03:09.970> I

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
you yeah I mean I think I'm learning I

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.080 
you yeah I mean I think I'm learning I
play<00:03:11.530> it<00:03:11.590> sort<00:03:11.890> of<00:03:11.950> like<00:03:12.099> a<00:03:12.129> midfielder<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:13.000> i

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
play it sort of like a midfielder and i

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.630 
play it sort of like a midfielder and i
think<00:03:13.329> that<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:14.500> defenders<00:03:14.890> around<00:03:15.190> me<00:03:15.340> can

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
think that the defenders around me can

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.039 
think that the defenders around me can
kind<00:03:15.879> of<00:03:15.940> help<00:03:16.090> me<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:16.420> tell<00:03:16.450> me<00:03:16.599> where<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:16.930> be

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
kind of help me and tell me where to be

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.199 
kind of help me and tell me where to be
but<00:03:17.530> i<00:03:17.769> like<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.340> run<00:03:18.519> up<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:18.760> down<00:03:18.849> the<00:03:18.940> line

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
but i like to run up and down the line

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.080 
but i like to run up and down the line
so<00:03:19.540> i<00:03:19.569> think<00:03:19.840> that<00:03:19.989> place<00:03:20.319> to<00:03:20.819> my<00:03:21.819> advantage

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
so i think that place to my advantage

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.750 
so i think that place to my advantage
and<00:03:22.569> i<00:03:22.930> might<00:03:23.410> make<00:03:23.620> some<00:03:23.829> errors<00:03:24.099> but<00:03:24.340> i<00:03:24.370> just

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
and i might make some errors but i just

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.120 
and i might make some errors but i just
try<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.030> make<00:03:25.389> up<00:03:25.419> for<00:03:25.569> it<00:03:25.870> with<00:03:26.019> recovery<00:03:26.739> huh

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
try and make up for it with recovery huh

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.420
