say a day or two ago the only thing
about<00:02:17.230> this<00:02:17.620> hair<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.520> feel<00:02:18.940> like<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.150> have<00:02:19.300> to

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
about this hair is I feel like I have to

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.920 
about this hair is I feel like I have to
literally<00:02:20.410> wash<00:02:20.770> it<00:02:21.060> every<00:02:22.060> two<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.810> three

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
literally wash it every two to three

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.380 
literally wash it every two to three
days<00:02:23.080> which<00:02:23.770> is<00:02:23.800> not<00:02:24.100> a<00:02:24.310> bad<00:02:24.340> thing<00:02:24.550> because<00:02:25.030> I

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
days which is not a bad thing because I

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.010 
days which is not a bad thing because I
mean<00:02:25.600> I<00:02:25.780> wash<00:02:26.050> my<00:02:26.230> hair<00:02:26.580> almost<00:02:27.580> like<00:02:28.120> every

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
mean I wash my hair almost like every

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.920 
mean I wash my hair almost like every
week<00:02:29.200> probably<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:31.000> it's<00:02:31.120> not<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.240> big<00:02:31.300> deal<00:02:31.420> if

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
week probably so it's not a big deal if

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.380 
week probably so it's not a big deal if
I<00:02:32.020> don't<00:02:32.230> wash<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.860> or<00:02:33.130> if<00:02:33.250> I<00:02:33.310> don't<00:02:33.490> put<00:02:33.790> like<00:02:34.360> a

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
I don't wash it or if I don't put like a

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.220 
I don't wash it or if I don't put like a
serum<00:02:34.960> in<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.350> it<00:02:35.560> gets<00:02:35.770> kind<00:02:36.070> of<00:02:37.020> stiff<00:02:38.020> a

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230
