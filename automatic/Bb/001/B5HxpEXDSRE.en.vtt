00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:09.760
 Is burner i Hi er come dimension 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:13.070
 This time I want to say that 26 death matches by stryper 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:18.170
 Aix was pr often sweat and let us each 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:23.320
 Or Anan If you do not nor of its popularity I do not know quite Hey Ekushi pr or why 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:27.300
 Do a little Kedomo is not seen so much I who are using I do not know I 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:32.509
 The I in the amount to me also I actually xpr 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:37.660
 xpr Please do not poke it with a special sniper. 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.660
 Softening it a little devil painful and I'm I'm not straight fly soul Oh 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:50.130
 There is also a hand that is a bit difficult since I'm excluding well, but also because it is beauty and beauty 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:55.110
 I think'm not Ya the kana relatively easy to beat and well out Remove 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:57.190
 Well , I would like to take care of private staff, but every time that kind of little one 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.329
 Even if I remove it 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:05.019
 Well there are occasions when you hit a few shots 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:10.090
 Well Sniper Nea base up 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:13.950
 It varistors course it over there for it also is I think that I wonder if I easy to use 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:17.369
 It is yeah that well are over there by've stumbled it a little 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.630
 If the net swears one translation after a, a 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.409
 It's easy and will be valet 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.390
 I think it's okay 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:31.700
 Park is n't hard to say if it's malt stage late 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:38.090
 And you do or say is toughness number take 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:42.009
 I know color Nde wonder if not Well Jan-sur-say and I wonder if the earlier is good I'd think 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.009
 I think lightweight is essential 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:52.159
 Racers are everyone but they are abundant 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:55.390
 The color of the lens is changed to match something is a expr midnight Meisa variously 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.390
 It is a little cool It is amazing 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:09.039
 8 long 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:10.690
 It means also Well my little mind I'm not a child 2 to use lightning xpr there is 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.180
 Well two people 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.530
 If there two people at the time, for example, look into the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.530
 a this told 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:31.230
 After hitting with a booger, the hit rate for Tiga is uh-but in the case of xpr already 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:37.580
 Yes, except 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:41.210
 It is easier to beat the one in the middle of 10 o'clock slide 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:45.850
 It's great if you kill one person and the other person in the scope meters 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.850
 I think that it is the quickest thing to shift and beat 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:55.920
 So I'm on the way 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:59.240
 In want to beat really I Nde want to beat the guy above to a little this Bottari 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:03.470
 I'm thinking that I can't reach 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.120
 If you think that you are jealousy, hey you'll hit a headshot 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.510
 Case 4 nj 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:12.390
 As it is attached, it is attachment that does not come to the local town association though 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.630
 Heating to say if fnj 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.990
 Well xpr hey hey compared to other sniper 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.010
 Five 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:24.940
 As selling is 5 times larger than lens gray 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:28.450
 I would recommend it by all means or hey 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.629
 We get along good'm also wearing wear Laser Sight 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.629
 Hmm 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.360
 It's a bit frustrating that you're out now 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.150
 Appointed such as abduction 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.680
 Have 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:54.890
 8 Neh sniper ne vt sr and use xpr 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.110
 I hit on that a little Kedomo Well Is not it a little tips Fu 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.880
 Well Newa 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:03.880
 Because no matter how But slow Never restart the peek still N sniper enemy Sangane 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.810
 I very shoot lose it is if it was a varistor 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.420
 Many 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:13.319
 Momentum of much are beginning another month be predicted whether or not there are Eemaa enemy because it is 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.280
 It is often defeated with 9 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.359
 Would club arwa 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.479
 I wonder if it will blow 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:28.020
 After turning the corner of the main part of a part of 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:35.090
 Because if you touch the l size slightly lightly it will be a bit faster 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.090
 It never is if you use it the motion at any time by placing the finger sleep one who is Well 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.409
 Spar streak of order to team deathmatch to after 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.390
 Follow 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:48.790
 Though we think that it is minister 100 quite 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.790
 'M when you are dealing with the last of the beach 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.540
 Light ring strike 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:59.970
 Type 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:02.660
 Sentry and Kedomo I had to put a quick orbital beauty known my ideal now 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:07.670
 I think the score streak is the best 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:09.800
 uav say b is probably not alright that team death match surprisingly 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:13.970
 There are few people who use ghosts 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.080
 Oh yes finger comparison is valid and a 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.530
 This is this 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:24.160
 Well sound quite reasonable in team death match 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:28.360
 I think that does not go well # 29 or you were and I are ordinary game or can not kill 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:34.120
 Because it depends greatly on that 1 kill money accounting 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:36.320
 So you can live Well almost certainly's Akira Haneda As you aim it 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.960
 In in light rim stripe 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.960
 I think I should know about 3 people in manners 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:01.500
 I think that there is little appearance of Buber 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.950
 A little 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:11.750
 I also there by all means enjoy in I want because introduced 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:13.590
 You say it's 36 and you're in the microphone and it's pr 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:18.000
 It was easy to defeat 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:20.040
 So I will see you again in the next video Sniper video grand still 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.940
 Theft Auto 5 in action 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.630

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.140
