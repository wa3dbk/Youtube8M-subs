00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:06.660
 in which is assisted by the team 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.330
 Season the sensations are good 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.120
 let's also say a little time 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.879
 work and we are assimilating the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.430
 concepts that ask us said and I think that 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.590
 little by little we will be improving which 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.970
 depression of the signings that has 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.740
 made the club some we have what 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.070
 arrested for his quality in six training 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.800
 good games in general I think they are 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.650
 good players who have experience and 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.629
 I think maybe it was something missing us 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.760
 last year and good are some players 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.740
 hired with a lot of quality and that we 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.240
 they are going to contribute a lot that is that with these 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.620
 additions and with the possibility of 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.390
 make a pre-season better than the year 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.640
 past the goal is not to spend so many 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.290
 trouble if the goal is not to be in a hurry 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.840
 so planning the 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.390
 preseason this year has been a little 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.610
 better and this also can equal us 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.370
 help a little more and well I think that 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.000
 know also the fact of coming the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.890
 signings 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.190
 with a little ahead of time and not at 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.890
 final as last year better than us 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.860
 will help and that is the idea does not happen 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.790
 in case you can throw something else 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.770
 the only real goal and I remember that 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.380
 there is the one of salvation 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.570
 how are your physical samples well 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.360
 well perfect that every day I meet 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.180
 better than this I had to go through 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.220
 my partner is putting the best way 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.990
 possible 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.020
 until the time and still without the sport 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.140
 assured its continuity here yes I think that 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.780
 one more year here an example of that 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.580
 these stockings are here many more years and 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.160
 for now I hope that if there is any 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.770
 Novelty in your resigned is not everything 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.660
 so that these negotiations 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.630
 renew can affect you at the time of 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.720
 play not for nothing I have one more year and 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.570
 I'm happy with him with the contract 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.840
 that I have and a minimum objective in my 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.940
 Only desire to be able to work quietly 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.430
 like them always and enjoy what 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.130
 I can never have dinner with my partner 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.319
 and I gave up on training for 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.049
 can play 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.730
 owner would not be the biggest mistake that 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.129
 I could commit 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.129
 also template that a year ago these 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:25.489
 I do not know why I think there are 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:28.430
 players and more signings than these 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.400
 heights that last year and on the 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.780
 time will tell if there are more templates to help 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.420
 to optimize before the right performance 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.130
 that the group is almost defined yes 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.770
 I think if you do not go especially when d 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.570
 for the new ones to catch the ideas that 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.720
 asks the mister has not gone knows the 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:49.260
 colleagues I think it helps when it comes to 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.230
 train and compete I think it helps you 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.360
 much more to know the comrades who 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.430
 have next and create costume and 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.630
 knowing people is also 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.960
 doing the preseason especially 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.410
 productive physically and technically yes I think 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.490
 that if not because we still have a gift 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.700
 one week 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.160
 after making the league and yes I think so 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.600
 that we want to be productive and that 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.340
 lead us to have a good start to 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.990
 law as your working conditions here 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.630
 england first more jokes after 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.930
 in English and ballads that do not look very good 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.120
 good fields our is great a 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.520
 good weather and good we thought it was going to 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.490
 be but we are more afraid we are afraid 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.150
 more fearful about the food and it was the ones that 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.150
 everything is great
