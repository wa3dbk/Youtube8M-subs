00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.280
 hello dear hungry no matter if he has to 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.740
 potato porridge mashed potato 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.050
 with mashed potatoes or as I'm in 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.360
 Saxony has heard highway mark 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.220
 to say that we have a delicious 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.860
 add to that even further 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.270
 process the potato porridge on 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.490
 I want to commit myself to this concept 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.190
 be prepared in many ways 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.320
 can be mixed with different spices 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.660
 with sweet potatoes or with others 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.120
 Colored vegetables is completely clear to me 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.739
 but that would be the task of a patch and 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.230
 this video should be the basic variant 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.090
 show how we can easily and with 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.160
 a few steps a loose 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.250
 prepare creamy potato porridge 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.050
 of course we need that 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.480
 potatoes and because of the high 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.280
 starchy content are floury cooking 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.379
 the best there could also be predominantly 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.350
 we use firm-cooking 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.690
 milk or and so I milk it and milk 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.510
 cream to equal share some butter 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.860
 and seasons salt and more or 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.170
 less optional 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.600
 I also recommend pepper and 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.619
 some nutmeg 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.930
 First , the peeled potatoes 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.579
 cut into pieces of about the same size 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.860
 and in a pot of cold water 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.189
 given so that they are covered by these 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.049
 are 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.299
 Alternatively, the preparation as 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.220
 Potatoes possible but I recommend 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.229
 this variant of the pot on one 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.210
 put the stove plate and closed 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.590
 Cover the potatoes briefly 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.149
 then add some salt to lid 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.119
 back on it and the potatoes at 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.369
 low heat previously in 20 to 25 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.409
 minutes soft then come the potatoes 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.960
 Drain back onto the stove top 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.670
 set and allow to evaporate briefly so 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.950
 so that the rest of the water is still 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.969
 the still hot potatoes evaporate 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.100
 now to press 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.960
 either with a potato press or 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.539
 so I think it better with one 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.670
 No matter what form the potato has 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:04.479
 and the finer the potatoes clog 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.450
 the better the cream we enter now 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.039
 heat a pot all the milk and 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.280
 then take the mixture if you want to 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.350
 cologne starts from the hearth and these lead 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.300
 We now with a whisk 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.670
 the pound potatoes 1 and please 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.620
 no blender and if possible 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.170
 not even the whisk of the device 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.570
 because they are especially the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.700
 blender destroy the strength of the counter 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.950
 the stronger exit and the 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.260
 Mashed potatoes are rather tough and sticky 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.660
 Now we give the little piece and 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.780
 distributed butter to season with 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.060
 pepper salt and something meaner 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.400
 Nutmeg also like freshly grated and 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.230
 stir everything again and that way 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.270
 long until they are all good ingredients 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.190
 but also mixed together 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.050
 beat too long by otherwise 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.060
 again the danger exists that everything too 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.440
 Count if it's not creamy enough 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.600
 should be a little then 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.490
 Stir in the milk from the milk 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.620
 By the way, boiling potatoes are needed 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.690
 a little more liquid than firming 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.600
 I think the potato porridge is like him 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.440
 now it is creamy and tasty everything 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.480
 very easily 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.370
 Nevertheless, you or woman must know how 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.370
 it is done i wish you a lot 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.320
 fun in the preparation and then right 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.330
 Enjoy your meal 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.150
 and if you are interested in other b6 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.430
 Eg cooked as white asparagus or that 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.890
 is cooked to perfection then look 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.390
 just go into these videos and 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.250
 if not done yet 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.770
 Of course, I am very happy about yours 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.550
 Abo I still have to say until 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.540

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.540
