Pandaria<00:00:17.910> come<00:00:18.119> out<00:00:18.240> but<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.449> believe<00:00:18.840> this

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
Pandaria come out but I believe this

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.050 
Pandaria come out but I believe this
will<00:00:19.260> be<00:00:19.380> very<00:00:19.710> similar<00:00:20.039> for<00:00:20.189> wind<00:00:20.580> mists

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
will be very similar for wind mists

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.460 
will be very similar for wind mists
actually<00:00:21.449> comes<00:00:21.689> out<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:22.080> if<00:00:22.170> you're<00:00:22.289> watching

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
actually comes out so if you're watching

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.519 
actually comes out so if you're watching
it<00:00:22.740> then<00:00:22.890> or<00:00:22.920> an<00:00:23.130> hour<00:00:23.250> before<00:00:23.960> just<00:00:24.960> take<00:00:25.439> it

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
it then or an hour before just take it

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.740 
it then or an hour before just take it
all<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.830> consideration<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:27.180> here<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.599> a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
all in the consideration this here is a

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.330 
all in the consideration this here is a
losing<00:00:28.080> match<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.859> what<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.070> was

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
but mages by far are the worst as far as

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.770

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
quick and that's a good thing about

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.219

his gear was but I noticed he was
squishy<00:03:44.850> so<00:03:45.269> sometimes<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.260> just<00:03:46.380> got<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.590> pop

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
squishy so sometimes you just got to pop

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.520 
squishy so sometimes you just got to pop
