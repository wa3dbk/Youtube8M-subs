00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.410
 to me 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.170
 I will try to explain a little 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.020
 what is the use of polis shocks demos 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.060
 as a matter of fact they are composed here in 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.939
 the cannon is worth I will be removing one 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.609
 and there are usually four types of 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.180
 police that over to see four types of 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:34.020
 policho that is that they are usually from a 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:36.370
 star of a star of two of three 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.090
 of zero stars 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.090
 against more stars the more the shot escapes 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.040
 and less away for example that does not lead 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.219
 no star, I use it for 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.339
 the rabbit for areas that is 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:53.800
 butt vegetation wants to be a very shot 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.780
 fast gripped then I need something 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.149
 let me open quickly because it will come out 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.030
 close then I need you to open 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.909
 fast after this des stars 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.940
 the same I also used it for the 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.550
 rabbit but it's already a longer shot and 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.950
 there are people who with this can also 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.050
 You can use it to lose depending 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.880
 of the land if it does not go very far and 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.970
 also at the same time that control and shock 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.880
 then play with the ammunition the two 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.550
 stars because that's when a hunt is 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.070
 it goes quite long 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.820
 exceptionally so 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.490
 exceptional 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.590
 I like to use it for the pigeon 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.180
 torcaz also for when I go to a 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.060
 land that the partridges are very 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.970
 chanted and go away as well 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.740
 I use and that of a star would already be 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.930
 well for too far I the truth 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.780
 is that this type of cartridge or this 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.230
 kind of policy I do not use it in any 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.530
 other 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:54.750
 they are very easy to change I said is 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.290
 here at the tip wearing all carry 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.290
 a key 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.890
 the key faster 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:18.340
 a rosquita the canyon 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.340
 which is caught 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.970
 let's go hunt hi and such as we are going to 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.120
 go playing both for the opening as 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.460
 with that to place good I'm going 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.500
 to place the same wrong done to me I do not 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.940
 like to do it with the key because the 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.970
 truth is that you do not have much 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.020
 sensitivity and you can go from thread 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:47.420
 so I usually do what I do 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.420
 I give him a little window 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.650
 when I noticed a little bit of force what 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.580
 loose and with my own finger I give half 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.800
 back and I have it ready the good ones 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.930
