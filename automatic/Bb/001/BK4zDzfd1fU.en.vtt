Rises kick that but like you just go for

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.419 
Rises kick that but like you just go for
it<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:31.690> it'll<00:01:32.690> probably<00:01:32.899> work<00:01:33.050> out<00:01:33.380> if<00:01:33.710> you

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
it and it'll probably work out if you

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.800 
it and it'll probably work out if you
watch<00:01:34.640> this<00:01:34.850> first<00:01:36.819> boys<00:01:37.819> side<00:01:38.119> switch<00:01:38.539> from

watch this first boys side switch from

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.660 
watch this first boys side switch from
Kirk<00:01:40.240> rolling<00:01:41.240> up<00:01:41.390> feet<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:41.960> Ollie<00:01:42.080> position

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
Kirk rolling up feet and Ollie position

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.980 
Kirk rolling up feet and Ollie position
ollie<00:01:43.670> up<00:01:45.490> then<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:46.549> pop<00:01:46.759> out<00:01:46.970> if<00:01:47.569> you<00:01:47.720> slide

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
ollie up then you pop out if you slide

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.899 
ollie up then you pop out if you slide
like<00:01:48.170> really<00:01:48.590> far<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:49.039> makes<00:01:49.310> it<00:01:49.460> easier<00:01:49.880> to

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
like really far it makes it easier to

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.930 
like really far it makes it easier to
get<00:01:50.149> you<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:50.560> if<00:01:51.560> you<00:01:51.709> slide<00:01:52.039> really<00:01:52.280> far<00:01:52.610> it

get you and if you slide really far it

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.999 
get you and if you slide really far it
makes<00:01:53.360> it<00:01:53.509> easier<00:01:53.750> to<00:01:53.780> get<00:01:53.929> an<00:01:54.049> end<00:01:54.409> you<00:01:54.830> can

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
makes it easier to get an end you can

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.580 
makes it easier to get an end you can
grind<00:01:55.280> really<00:01:55.459> far<00:01:55.819> too<00:01:56.060> but<00:01:57.020> this<00:01:57.140> leg<00:01:57.350> up<00:01:57.470> why

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
grind really far too but this leg up why

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.520 
grind really far too but this leg up why
just<00:01:57.770> go<00:01:57.890> half<00:01:58.039> and<00:01:58.190> half<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.580> know<00:01:58.700> thing

don't<00:02:04.580> you<00:02:04.729> just<00:02:04.849> stay<00:02:05.060> like<00:02:05.149> you'd<00:02:05.330> do<00:02:05.450> a

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
don't you just stay like you'd do a

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.300 
don't you just stay like you'd do a

boardslide like the same like momentum
that<00:02:07.459> you<00:02:07.520> keep<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.789> boardslide<00:02:08.060> but<00:02:08.720> your<00:02:08.840> nose

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
that you keep a boardslide but your nose

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.110 
that you keep a boardslide but your nose
basically<00:02:09.349> just<00:02:09.739> your<00:02:09.890> leg<00:02:10.069> is<00:02:10.250> pushing<00:02:10.729> it<00:02:10.849> to

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
basically just your leg is pushing it to

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.900 
basically just your leg is pushing it to
turn<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:12.260> get<00:02:12.440> into<00:02:12.620> those<00:02:12.860> ground<00:02:13.160> once

turn it to get into those ground once

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.190 
turn it to get into those ground once
you<00:02:14.000> get<00:02:14.150> into<00:02:14.360> that<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.660> just<00:02:14.810> tweak<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.170> to

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
you get into that you just tweak it to

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.280 
you get into that you just tweak it to
the<00:02:15.349> side<00:02:15.560> hold<00:02:16.220> it<00:02:16.519> sideways<00:02:16.879> then<00:02:17.690> nudge<00:02:18.140> it

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
the side hold it sideways then nudge it

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.190 
the side hold it sideways then nudge it
out<00:02:18.410> of<00:02:18.530> there<00:02:18.680> like<00:02:18.890> me<00:02:19.129> thank<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.760> ollie<00:02:20.200> you
