00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 Hello everyone guys in general wanted to do 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.389
 I did not go to the reviewer on lenovo a800 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.599
 Santa's acting with her like he is ours 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.429
 situations will he really behave 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.910
 will survive after scratching whether 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.890
 scratches and if there is a gorilla voice in general 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.010
 let's go and see what we have 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:28.560
 is an example to start legs 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.640
 show the phone is fully working here 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.910
 if 7 you can see everything is scrolling everything is fine 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.120
 if you take a closer look 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.820
 not even yours is visible from such seals 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.850
 Finge have fingerprints 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.850
 let's get started in a simple way 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:01.760
 see scratches completely unnoticed now I 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:05.850
 wipe it for a second see something 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.070
 no scratches likely lenovo 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.229
 us the sky over this target on the railing of the eyes 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:17.509
 worth most likely the first generation not 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.509
 2 on 1 someone does not believe something else here 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.970
 ordinary stationery 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.460
 Well, as we see here there is no one film 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.479
 real touch 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:39.780
 Well, as we see, we are waiting for nothing, scissors too 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:44.070
 a sharp object right so scratch 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:50.490
 by the way disconnected so it's interesting that he 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:52.820
 still working you really stated 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.820
 shine 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.719
 now turn off see shakes me 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.899
 scratch that is scratch and see it i 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:14.130
 I do not see personally found the hour is not on the fireplace 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:18.810
 of course I do not see and scratches honestly say 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.890
 although lenovo bad himself from acute 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:27.090
 screwdriver in your case, try this 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:32.489
 the keys were not at hand and so take 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:35.840
 card appears on the display of divorce 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.840
 everything else 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.680
 maleho now trying on camera 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:53.790
 appear but our case is nothing 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:57.209
 the launcher works fine now but 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:02.250
 nothing to work and some here say 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:04.530
 that supposedly now say that no one here 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.079
 this silicone bumper that goes into 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.100
 bundled mostly but I will delay it 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.870
 bribed nobody saved at home 2 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.620
 source of the rest 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.560
 that is, already repeatedly on the phone 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.239
 but everything works perfectly for me 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.989

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:27.569
