00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
the problem is and I've gone off a bit

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.999 
the problem is and I've gone off a bit
of<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:57.060> tangent<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.570> problem<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.009> they've

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
of a tangent the problem is that they've

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.859 
of a tangent the problem is that they've
done<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.610> without<00:01:59.729> releasing<00:02:00.509> anything

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
done this without releasing anything

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.179 
done this without releasing anything
that<00:02:01.350> they<00:02:01.469> are<00:02:01.590> saying<00:02:01.860> whether<00:02:02.040> they're

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
that they are saying whether they're

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.219 
that they are saying whether they're
gonna<00:02:02.310> have<00:02:02.490> new<00:02:02.670> staff<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.840> cover<00:02:04.049> these

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
gonna have new staff in to cover these

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.399 
gonna have new staff in to cover these
because<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.100> end<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.310> day<00:02:05.430> really<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.659> can't

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
because the end the day really I can't

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.830 
because the end the day really I can't
see<00:02:07.590> how<00:02:07.680> quitting<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.190> staff<00:02:08.429> will<00:02:09.119> speed<00:02:09.690> up

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
see how quitting a staff will speed up

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.760 
see how quitting a staff will speed up
the<00:02:09.959> development<00:02:10.080> process<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:11.540> plus<00:02:12.540> i<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.780> is

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
the development process and plus i to is

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.440 
the development process and plus i to is
in<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.980> great<00:02:14.100> state<00:02:14.400> at<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.610> moment<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:15.120> as<00:02:15.420> a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
in a great state at the moment and as a

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.940 
in a great state at the moment and as a
European<00:02:15.660> player<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.140> can't<00:02:16.410> actually<00:02:16.530> really

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
European player I can't actually really

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.190 
European player I can't actually really
play<00:02:17.160> at<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.370> moment<00:02:17.670> very<00:02:17.790> well<00:02:18.060> because<00:02:18.900> the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
play at the moment very well because the

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.160 
play at the moment very well because the
pings<00:02:19.620> are<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:19.950> high<00:02:20.130> still<00:02:20.460> I<00:02:20.810> think<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:22.110> is

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
pings are so high still I think this is

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.840 
pings are so high still I think this is
a<00:02:22.350> very<00:02:22.500> similar<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.250> mistake<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.640> they

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
a very similar to the mistake that they

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.910 
a very similar to the mistake that they
made<00:02:24.090> when<00:02:24.360> they<00:02:24.540> first<00:02:24.840> release<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.350> h1z1

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
made when they first release the h1z1

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.060 
made when they first release the h1z1
build<00:02:26.570> with<00:02:27.570> basically<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.260> Luke<00:02:28.530> rates<00:02:28.830> even

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
build with basically the Luke rates even

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.100 
build with basically the Luke rates even
though<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.670> Luke<00:02:29.820> rates<00:02:30.030> aren't<00:02:30.330> too<00:02:30.600> bad<00:02:30.810> and

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
though the Luke rates aren't too bad and

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.280 
though the Luke rates aren't too bad and
in<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.550> actual<00:02:32.820> in<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.510> actual<00:02:33.750> game<00:02:33.810> they're

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
in the actual in the actual game they're

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.470 
in the actual in the actual game they're
not<00:02:34.440> they're<00:02:34.620> really<00:02:34.920> not<00:02:35.040> pay-to-win<00:02:35.490> but

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
not they're really not pay-to-win but

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.390 
not they're really not pay-to-win but
it's<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.810> massive<00:02:37.320> massive<00:02:37.500> blow<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.100> the

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
it's a massive massive blow to the

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.280 
it's a massive massive blow to the
community<00:02:38.880> because<00:02:39.090> they've<00:02:39.780> just<00:02:39.960> not<00:02:40.110> said

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
community because they've just not said

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.900 
community because they've just not said
anything<00:02:40.320> they've<00:02:40.680> cut<00:02:40.860> quiet<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.430> they've

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
anything they've cut quiet and they've

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.450 
anything they've cut quiet and they've
done<00:02:42.120> something<00:02:42.680> without<00:02:43.680> being<00:02:44.070> transparent

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
done something without being transparent

done something without being transparent
and<00:02:44.730> being<00:02:45.330> honest<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:46.020> think<00:02:46.350> that's<00:02:46.560> what

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
and being honest and I think that's what

and being honest and I think that's what
a<00:02:46.980> lot<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.280> our<00:02:47.460> communities<00:02:47.880> come<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.330> expect

worst thing you can do as a community to

game what you need to do is carry on as
normal<00:03:54.900> but<00:03:55.380> I<00:03:55.440> think<00:03:55.830> that<00:03:56.580> this<00:03:56.760> is<00:03:56.820> just<00:03:56.970> a

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
normal but I think that this is just a

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.780 
normal but I think that this is just a
big<00:03:57.630> knock<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.320> the<00:03:58.410> confidence<00:03:58.770> and<00:03:59.100> without

there<00:03:59.970> being<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.240> information<00:04:00.660> out<00:04:00.750> there<00:04:00.810> I

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
there being the information out there I

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.870 
there being the information out there I
think<00:04:01.860> it's<00:04:01.980> just<00:04:02.100> going<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.280> keep<00:04:02.430> being

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
think it's just going to keep being

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.060 
think it's just going to keep being
damaging<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.690> game<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.200> community

I'd like to say that and de Carre also
brings<00:04:08.340> us<00:04:08.490> up<00:04:08.610> with<00:04:08.760> that<00:04:09.350> señor<00:04:10.350> de<00:04:10.530> break

brings us up with that señor de break

now<00:04:10.980> weren't<00:04:11.280> making<00:04:11.520> money<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.150> bottom<00:04:12.450> line

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
now weren't making money the bottom line

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.900 
now weren't making money the bottom line
was<00:04:12.870> that<00:04:12.900> they<00:04:13.290> weren't<00:04:13.470> profitable<00:04:14.040> or<00:04:14.370> well

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
was that they weren't profitable or well

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.310 
was that they weren't profitable or well
we<00:04:15.030> don't<00:04:15.180> really<00:04:15.300> know<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.720> figures<00:04:16.020> but<00:04:16.260> I

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
we don't really know the figures but I

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.789 
we don't really know the figures but I
guess<00:04:16.650> that<00:04:17.010> it<00:04:17.549> must<00:04:17.760> be<00:04:17.880> so<00:04:18.060> true<00:04:18.299> to<00:04:18.450> some

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
guess that it must be so true to some

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.130 
guess that it must be so true to some
extent<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:20.100> they<00:04:20.700> needed<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.180> trim<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:21.900> fat

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
extent and they needed to trim the fat

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.960 
extent and they needed to trim the fat
in<00:04:22.470> quotation<00:04:23.040> marks<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.340> that's<00:04:23.520> what<00:04:23.700> other

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
in quotation marks and that's what other

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.670 
in quotation marks and that's what other
people<00:04:24.360> have<00:04:24.450> said<00:04:24.479> and<00:04:24.900> there's<00:04:25.590> actually

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
people have said and there's actually

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.200 
people have said and there's actually
been<00:04:25.860> a<00:04:25.950> bit<00:04:26.130> of<00:04:26.220> falling<00:04:26.550> out<00:04:26.640> between<00:04:26.760> X

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.060

like<00:04:27.810> Milan<00:04:28.140> and<00:04:28.350> some<00:04:28.710> of<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.860> other<00:04:28.980> guys

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
like Milan and some of the other guys

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.750 
like Milan and some of the other guys
but<00:04:29.580> and<00:04:29.820> it<00:04:30.660> seems<00:04:30.930> they've<00:04:31.170> merged<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:32.580> the

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
but and it seems they've merged to the

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.340 
but and it seems they've merged to the
studios<00:04:33.090> together<00:04:33.390> and<00:04:33.660> I'm<00:04:33.900> not<00:04:34.080> exactly

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
studios together and I'm not exactly

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.830 
studios together and I'm not exactly
sure<00:04:34.530> on<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.980> Geographics<00:04:35.610> of<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:36.330> daybreak

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.780 
sure on the Geographics of the daybreak
campuses<00:04:37.470> but<00:04:37.770> it<00:04:37.920> seems<00:04:38.340> like<00:04:38.520> they<00:04:38.640> were<00:04:38.700> in

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
campuses but it seems like they were in

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:39.740 
campuses but it seems like they were in
different<00:04:39.090> cities<00:04:39.300> and<00:04:39.420> they've<00:04:39.720> just

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
different cities and they've just

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.030 
different cities and they've just
wanting<00:04:40.290> one<00:04:40.500> office<00:04:41.040> now<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:42.680> but<00:04:43.680> they

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
wanting one office now and but they

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.890 
wanting one office now and but they
haven't<00:04:44.250> but<00:04:44.700> the<00:04:44.820> problem<00:04:45.150> is<00:04:45.240> even<00:04:45.450> if<00:04:45.720> they

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
haven't but the problem is even if they

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.330 
haven't but the problem is even if they
were<00:04:45.960> doing<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.440> right<00:04:46.590> thing<00:04:46.830> and<00:04:47.010> having

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
were doing the right thing and having

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.730 
were doing the right thing and having
trying<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.330> streamline<00:04:48.600> their<00:04:49.230> developers

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
trying to streamline their developers

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.820 
trying to streamline their developers
and<00:04:49.980> that's<00:04:50.760> but<00:04:51.180> I<00:04:51.420> mean<00:04:51.450> even<00:04:52.080> though<00:04:52.230> we've

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
and that's but I mean even though we've

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.290 
and that's but I mean even though we've
lost<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:53.130> level<00:04:53.370> designers<00:04:53.760> which<00:04:53.910> is<00:04:54.060> very

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
lost the level designers which is very

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.120 
lost the level designers which is very
which<00:04:55.080> doesn't<00:04:55.410> give<00:04:55.470> you<00:04:55.680> much<00:04:55.710> confidence

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
which doesn't give you much confidence

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.100 
which doesn't give you much confidence
at<00:04:56.400> all<00:04:56.550> but<00:04:57.120> they<00:04:57.240> didn't<00:04:57.540> mention<00:04:57.690> it<00:04:57.990> they

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
at all but they didn't mention it they

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.810 
at all but they didn't mention it they
hadn't<00:04:58.320> said<00:04:58.560> that<00:04:58.590> they're<00:04:58.920> going<00:04:59.160> to<00:04:59.340> push

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820

plat side too much Annie I mean I can't
very<00:05:28.440> much<00:05:28.650> anyway<00:05:28.890> because<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.490> servers<00:05:30.030> are

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
very much anyway because the servers are

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.600 
very much anyway because the servers are
still<00:05:30.300> a<00:05:30.330> bit<00:05:30.480> dodgy<00:05:31.110> and<00:05:31.620> I<00:05:31.770> hope<00:05:32.280> that's<00:05:32.430> not

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
still a bit dodgy and I hope that's not

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.580 
still a bit dodgy and I hope that's not
gonna<00:05:32.820> I<00:05:33.060> mean<00:05:33.419> even<00:05:33.720> that<00:05:34.050> issue<00:05:34.230> might<00:05:34.560> be

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
gonna I mean even that issue might be

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.850 
gonna I mean even that issue might be
extended<00:05:35.520> by<00:05:35.669> losing<00:05:35.910> developments<00:05:36.600> but<00:05:36.990> who
