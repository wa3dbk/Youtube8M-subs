00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
to talk about the weather so first let's

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.569 
to talk about the weather so first let's
look<00:00:30.689> at<00:00:30.900> temperature<00:00:32.540> temperature<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:34.579> how

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
look at temperature temperature is how

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.970 
look at temperature temperature is how
hot<00:00:36.510> how<00:00:37.500> hot<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.510> so<00:00:39.510> number<00:00:40.379> one<00:00:40.620> in

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
hot how hot is it so number one in

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.650 
hot how hot is it so number one in
America<00:00:41.610> we<00:00:42.360> use<00:00:42.600> F<00:00:42.870> degrees<00:00:43.770> which<00:00:44.489> is

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
America we use F degrees which is

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.630 
America we use F degrees which is
Fahrenheit<00:00:47.180> Fahrenheit<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.920> number<00:00:50.250> one<00:00:50.460> is

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
Fahrenheit Fahrenheit so number one is

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.380 
Fahrenheit Fahrenheit so number one is
Fahrenheit<00:00:52.100> so<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.190> can<00:00:53.370> see<00:00:53.579> for<00:00:53.850> us<00:00:54.030> in

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
Fahrenheit so you can see for us in

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.619 
Fahrenheit so you can see for us in
United<00:00:55.140> States<00:00:55.350> if<00:00:55.980> we<00:00:56.309> say<00:00:56.550> Fahrenheit<00:00:57.360> and

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
United States if we say Fahrenheit and

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.010 
United States if we say Fahrenheit and
is<00:00:57.750> hot<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.649> might<00:00:58.800> be<00:00:58.980> ninety<00:00:59.430> degrees<00:01:00.020> okay

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
is hot it might be ninety degrees okay

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.039 
is hot it might be ninety degrees okay
ninety<00:01:01.379> degrees<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.859> hot

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
ninety degrees is hot

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.350 
ninety degrees is hot
70<00:01:04.049> degrees<00:01:04.080> 70<00:01:05.040> degrees<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.790> 80<00:01:05.939> degrees<00:01:06.240> is

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
70 degrees 70 degrees to 80 degrees is

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.380 
70 degrees 70 degrees to 80 degrees is
like<00:01:06.510> warm<00:01:07.130> okay<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.490> starts<00:01:08.820> getting<00:01:09.060> cooler

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
like warm okay it starts getting cooler

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.320 
like warm okay it starts getting cooler
when<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:09.840> around<00:01:10.049> 60s<00:01:10.590> 50s<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:11.760> really

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
when it's around 60s 50s it's really

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.700 
when it's around 60s 50s it's really
cold<00:01:12.630> when<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.020> gets<00:01:13.200> down<00:01:13.549> to<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:15.840> 40's<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
cold when it gets down to the 40's the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.350 
cold when it gets down to the 40's the
thirties<00:01:17.390> okay<00:01:19.430> so<00:01:20.430> that's<00:01:21.270> Fahrenheit

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
thirties okay so that's Fahrenheit

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.670 
thirties okay so that's Fahrenheit
number<00:01:24.360> two<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.840> Celsius<00:01:26.150> Celsius<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.680> America

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
number two is Celsius Celsius in America

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.590 
number two is Celsius Celsius in America
we<00:01:28.890> don't<00:01:29.130> use<00:01:29.280> Celsius<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.420> other

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
we don't use Celsius but in other

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.530 
we don't use Celsius but in other
countries<00:01:31.170> they<00:01:31.500> use<00:01:31.530> Celsius<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.549> Asia<00:01:33.119> that

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
countries they use Celsius in Asia that

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.999 
countries they use Celsius in Asia that
use<00:01:33.659> Celsius<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.560> Europe<00:01:35.369> they<00:01:35.579> use<00:01:35.759> Celsius

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
use Celsius in Europe they use Celsius

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.300 
use Celsius in Europe they use Celsius
so<00:01:38.060> Celsius<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.240> easy<00:01:39.570> because<00:01:39.950> we<00:01:40.950> all<00:01:41.100> know

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
so Celsius is easy because we all know

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.730 
so Celsius is easy because we all know
water<00:01:41.610> boils<00:01:42.150> at<00:01:42.299> 100<00:01:42.509> degrees<00:01:43.020> Celsius<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
water boils at 100 degrees Celsius and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.410 
water boils at 100 degrees Celsius and
water<00:01:43.950> freezes<00:01:44.369> at<00:01:44.399> zero<00:01:44.820> degrees<00:01:45.210> Celsius

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
water freezes at zero degrees Celsius

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.560 
water freezes at zero degrees Celsius
but<00:01:46.460> Fahrenheit<00:01:47.460> I've<00:01:47.700> already<00:01:47.970> forgotten<00:01:48.360> I

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
but Fahrenheit I've already forgotten I

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.810 
but Fahrenheit I've already forgotten I
think<00:01:48.810> water<00:01:49.290> freezes<00:01:49.770> at<00:01:51.890> something<00:01:52.890> like<00:01:53.009> 30

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
think water freezes at something like 30

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.230 
think water freezes at something like 30
I<00:01:54.409> don't<00:01:55.409> know<00:01:55.470> 32<00:01:56.009> degrees<00:01:56.340> Fahrenheit<00:01:56.969> or

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
I don't know 32 degrees Fahrenheit or

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.920 
I don't know 32 degrees Fahrenheit or
something<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.200> boils<00:01:58.500> at<00:01:58.619> 200

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.450 

212<00:02:03.930> degrees<00:02:04.380> or<00:02:04.619> something<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.219> can't

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
212 degrees or something I can't

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.020 
212 degrees or something I can't
remember

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
remember

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.730 
remember
this<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.509> Fahrenheit<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.140> not<00:02:07.320> easy<00:02:07.560> to

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
this is Fahrenheit is not easy to

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.919 
this is Fahrenheit is not easy to
remember<00:02:08.270> okay<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.330> number<00:02:09.599> one<00:02:09.840> is

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
remember okay so number one is

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.420 
remember okay so number one is
Fahrenheit<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.739> number<00:02:11.069> two<00:02:11.900> Celsius

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
Fahrenheit and number two Celsius

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.130 
Fahrenheit and number two Celsius
so<00:02:14.430> number<00:02:14.730> three<00:02:15.000> number<00:02:15.900> three<00:02:16.050> hot<00:02:16.670> hot

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
so number three number three hot hot

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.949 
so number three number three hot hot
okay<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.500> in<00:02:19.800> Hawaii<00:02:20.010> it's<00:02:20.580> very<00:02:20.910> hot<00:02:21.209> right

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
okay so in Hawaii it's very hot right

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:28.729 
okay so in Hawaii it's very hot right
hot<00:02:22.260> hot<00:02:23.160> okay<00:02:24.090> warm<00:02:25.040> warm<00:02:26.040> is<00:02:26.930> warm<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:28.319> better

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
hot hot okay warm warm is warm is better

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.550 
hot hot okay warm warm is warm is better
than<00:02:29.010> hot<00:02:29.250> hot<00:02:29.640> it's<00:02:29.670> like<00:02:30.060> oh<00:02:30.270> so<00:02:30.720> hot<00:02:30.930> warm<00:02:31.319> is

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560

warm

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.720 
warm
number<00:02:38.730> five<00:02:38.910> cool<00:02:39.269> cool<00:02:40.260> means<00:02:40.709> it's<00:02:41.130> not<00:02:41.370> hot

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
number five cool cool means it's not hot

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.820 
number five cool cool means it's not hot
it's<00:02:41.760> not<00:02:42.060> warm<00:02:42.360> it's<00:02:42.480> cool

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.840

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
would be like if you were on mainland in

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.710 
would be like if you were on mainland in
Boston<00:03:00.299> or<00:03:00.510> New<00:03:00.540> York<00:03:00.900> or<00:03:01.260> in<00:03:01.410> Canada<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:03.540> would

number<00:03:06.450> seven<00:03:06.810> is<00:03:06.900> freezing<00:03:07.769> freezing<00:03:08.100> is

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
number seven is freezing freezing is

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.900 
number seven is freezing freezing is
really<00:03:09.330> really<00:03:09.930> cold<00:03:10.200> freezing<00:03:10.709> means<00:03:11.100> water

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
really really cold freezing means water

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.490 
really really cold freezing means water
is<00:03:12.269> turning<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:12.900> ice<00:03:14.360> water<00:03:15.360> is<00:03:15.750> becoming<00:03:16.200> ice

that's freezing okay number eight is
degrees<00:03:21.329> degrees<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:23.220> degrees<00:03:23.579> is<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.790> little

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
degrees degrees so degrees is a little

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.240 
degrees degrees so degrees is a little
circle<00:03:24.989> as<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:25.980> say<00:03:26.250> zero<00:03:26.630> degrees<00:03:28.250> 10

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
circle as you say zero degrees 10

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.360 
circle as you say zero degrees 10
degrees<00:03:29.900> so<00:03:30.900> degrees<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.470> little<00:03:31.829> circle
