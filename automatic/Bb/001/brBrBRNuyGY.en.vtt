00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:07.630
 hello very good everyone I'm other lots 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:10.839
 the other friend of the channel the avengers and 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:14.580
 today I bring you a gameplay of 2 light a 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:16.120
 game that is very similar to the devil 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.940
 Y 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.860
 It was created in 2009 and despite this 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.900
 As you can see, it has very graphic 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.460
 similar to push-ups 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.460
 and good what you are 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.950
 in this mine we will go down plants 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.500
 while we go completing missions 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.170
 killing monsters getting armor 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.430
 new and typical of the games of 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.949
 these and well I had thought that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.150
 while they go up and still some 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.250
 videos of 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.520
 of this one 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.230
 and well I will not record all the videos 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.570
 because it's going to make us heavy to arrive 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.110
 until the end of good the 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:03.950
 goal is to get to or be everything 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.590
 the game good more things about the game 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:10.850
 this game as you see looks a lot like 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.310
 devil and this is because the devil 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.730
 the oscillators of devil 1 and 2 was 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.940
 created 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.730
 its creators I do not know if they expelled them from 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.320
 use what happened that they founded a 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.140
 company and they started with these elbows 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.280
 and well they are pretty good to me they have 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.549
 liked quite 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.720
 and well then if a doing the game 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.720
 It's in English but hey 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.650
 and now wait because I do not remember 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.510
 Where is this mission and has played the 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.900
 first missions although there is not very 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.900
 far 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.799
 do not 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.520
 is that I do not remember if I was here in 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.520
 other site 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.750
 so then there's a town where 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.330
 there you can go to sell and buy 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.240
 and you also have your pet is the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.740
 dog this while you're doing 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.920
 missions you can send him sell the 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.540
 village and so empty the inventory and 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.540
 they also attack 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.210
 in the 2 there will be more pets there will be mode 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.210
 cooperative that is online 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:35.530
 better graphics obviously and for me the 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.990
 2 it seems almost the same as the devil 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.150
 and on top of the devil in 20 years in 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.030
 wish to develop it 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.379
 and this in turn only took two 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.299
 I think it is and it is practically the same 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.880
 I'll buy myself two sides instead of the devil 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.220
 why 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.650
 I save thirty euros for the same 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.810
 game practically 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.640
 and I like more this the roll of 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.640
 have the pet and all this 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.319
 now completed the first mission I'm going to 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.549
 see the second 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.549
 we will take these chests 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.390
 and well more or less knowing how is the 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.390
 fire also has 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.280
 kind of class in this there are only three 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.260
 lessons 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.170
 they will see box 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.270
 and these are destroyer that is like the 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.120
 Warrior 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.530
 vanquish he is like a marksman and 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.290
 alchemist who is like a magician 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.510
 and well I 'm using the destroyer 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.610
 but the one I like the most because of the roll 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:48.670
 from body to body and sack 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.190
 and I'm going to see how far I can go and 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.610
 I hope you can complete the game 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.390
 before starting the week although I think 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.290
 that I will also continue playing 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.290
 and also 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.510
 I'm going to buy the minecraft on the xbox 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:11.570
 I 'm not going to be able to record because 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.570
 I have capturing but good 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.950
 of this that is the attack 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.650
 strength the most basic and an advocacy of 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.650
 the neighbors 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.860
 Well I think you have seen how it is 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.860
 the video 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.300
 I do not know when he arrived because the truth 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.090
 is that when you play and you learn 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.840
 action 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.840
 with the plant 2 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:46.629
 and we already ended up like subscribing 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.249
 it helps a lot and it costs us a lot and 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:50.499
 good ya 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:53.349
 so you can already recommend the channel to 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:56.650
 your friends and that's good we hope 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:58.200
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.660
 Y 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.630
 and well you can always suggest more 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.910
 games for those who want us to play 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.830
 and we will do everything possible to be able 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.850
 play them buy them or whatever is good 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.850
 until another
