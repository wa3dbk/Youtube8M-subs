00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.030
 I started to do the same with young people my age address 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.400
 because I can not in mechanics 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.479
 it's a huge, continuous dream 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:02.179
 but in 1946 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.090
 I left feathers but carlos checa models of carousel 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.100
 and that's how it starts so I do not have mont blanc 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.950
 in 1946 to 1948 for the time two years 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.430
 the page is followed I made the world knew 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.430
 49 year old man 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.200
 my name is lucien bouchard 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.859
 I am year in the 14th arrondissement in Paris in 1923 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:51.859
 I am 85 years old 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.410
 I'm not a headband hours I agree that their bed 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.940
 which means they should reject to chip production that jesus 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.469
 like that it's a carousel 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:07.349
 I should have been fought m I took the jura at the party I had my 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:08.819
 moncayo paper 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.819
 he stressed that the management maintains 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.299
 I am very surprised 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.609
 perfection 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:37.560
 if the fed focused on some rides while he worked from 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:38.789
 postcards 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:41.159
 so the ride is difficult 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.409
 he made philharmonic reenactments a hidden side of a 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.409
 accuracy 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:47.690
 his approach is really good 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.029
 it's really the standard of living 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.029
 it took a madness of grandeur 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:02.319
 classified clubs but three years for the ps because the first shot 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.710
 the car was good 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.870
 but well for the course I had problems rolling summer 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.009
 it's obvious that the right 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.459
 especially as the planet I stroked them so that the car my p 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.949
 then to rentals of what too on the car then j -m where the blue ones 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.509
 were a little too heavy to which museums 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:23.509
 for carl carmoni to customers 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.549
 not happy 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.269
 it's very interesting to see through its cliffs 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.839
 art forms 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:02.419
 who have been qualified 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.389
 on their time 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.169
 we have rides 10 916 billion 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.539
 we have rides of 220 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:13.669
 the appearance and floral begin to watch chieti 225 with flowers 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.169
 stylized 1930 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.169
 but at that time very linear and then percent and fifty 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.310
 you have to know that at each war against stops producing so there is no 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.310
 nothing that comes out carousel during the two years of war 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.660
 our workstations 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.260
 over a year compared to 2007 for the carnival 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.140
 no I do not have a lot of dams were themselves so aqmi has more 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.650
 more 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.759
 as soon as we can go 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.439
 client 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:49.740
 there is but there I go in banias 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.710
 in his referral 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.710
 on road development 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:02.039
 if this deadline the African Indians this is what counts 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.510
 my wife I admired her a lot and posts 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.350
 the first rides I'm doing 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.660
 he was not decorated 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.860
 adobe she did the painting 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.150
 and then the bigger little characters than the Koreans and helped me to 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.819
 term the manach 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.199
 all packaging on the toilet and by the m 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.650
 as I call them at age 60 the world this year as the reference to 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.120
 the anc 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.409
 in this war be with the merry-go-round 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:33.929
 it's a fusion it's a single character in all these are the chances 

00:05:33.929 --> 00:05:36.929
 one person 

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:06.539
 but this is not possible written in England 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.129
 do not be surprised 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:11.770
 what can they help from this Anglo-Saxon country on the other hand to the music hall 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.369
 in the same period of time we want to quote the names of the artists 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:18.330
 in order to be 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.450
 more interesting 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.740
 tactics 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.050
 it was a good French biggest embarrassment that was not able 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.650
 I had to make prints in France and in Europe which is decided to 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.500
 give the name of horns because the water and the united states there were there 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.229
 was going to kill her 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:38.290
 there are the beasts and all the sports that was the most 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.919
 the best known of China 

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:49.219
 like art 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:52.569
 it changed from 10 946 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:55.119
 poetry start to float a little 

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:56.710
 later plastic turns 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.490
 that is to say the sculpture the painting that we used I did not have anymore 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.349
 really time to make the effort at this coming 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:05.509
 plastic or resin 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:08.520
 such polychrome were much more expeditious 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.539
 p 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:12.479
 much more mechanical and technical malaise 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:16.150
 and he has ford raised but above all an art of light is a sound and light 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.150
 the funfair 

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:45.659
 bouazza 

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.169
 the skin the planet is not 

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:52.599
 launched to the world to revolve around 1 to 1 

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:58.010
 I told myself that there will be 

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.010
 in the red at -1 16% 

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.559
 the pop the net loss is passed to the world 

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.949
 to turn around 1 to 1
