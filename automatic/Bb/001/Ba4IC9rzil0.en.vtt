00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:13.720
 the first step is to cast a hardener 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.180
 of nails I always use it under 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.000
 any drawing you make is very 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.740
 important so that the nail does not yellow and 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.650
 so that the drawing that lasts longer 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.830
 put and use this one of a glass is of 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.380
 pharmacy lasts a lot because still 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.150
 you see what I have left and I bought it will 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.180
 a year not, well, I'm doing very well 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.790
 hardens and makes you stay 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.640
 plus the drawings that you put the second 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.890
 step is to use the base color of the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.300
 French manicure I am already left 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:49.480
 Kiko inch I really like how it goes 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.750
 It leaves a very nice finish we take it 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.910
 over the entire surface of the nail 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.010
 It depends if you like it more intense or not 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.470
 you can give a hand or two hands I 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.769
 I give one we think is enough 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.769
 colour 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.159
 to make the petals I will use 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.960
 this brush that yesterday we showed it is 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.990
 maybe the middle between the finite and this 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.990
 more chubby is to make petals that 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.060
 be more finite or with one more nail 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.850
 small good first thing we're going to 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.380
 do we throw in the cde a droplet of 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.390
 white enamel 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.390
 make it a big droplet because 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.840
 before and I caught very little 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.070
 and in the end you always have to finish 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.100
 throwing more 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:50.990
 we put a droplet we take with the brush 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:55.369
 we remove the excess if it were 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.650
 and we make the first petal stuck to this 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.840
 part of the nail 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.060
 it's about doing so 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.130
 and so it is with a natural form of a 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.440
 petal 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.410
 first it does is one edge then the other and 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.790
 If you have left the means , fill it 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.740
 we make the second one in the second petal 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.100
 also stuck in this part below 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.100
 a part 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.260
 the other part and there is nothing left over 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.250
 you do not even need to fill or fill 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.870
 and we masters and we do another in the middle 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.530
 a part 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.930
 and the other part 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.810
 As you can see this is very easy to do 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.910
 let it dry 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.080
 and then we do the dot 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.080
 we use agricultural 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.870
 Well now we have the silver and the 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.400
 I work this astor that I like a lot 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.740
 I had another that I had bought in the 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.660
 Chinese and it also works very well 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.210
 that is to say with glazes the Chinese when 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.040
 I started buying a lot to try for 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.100
 if I was not good at it or what 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.020
 out and still it is I love you and still 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.180
 they paint and they are not dry or anything by 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.180
 style let's be a drop here 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.160
 and with the pointer that I spoke to you yesterday 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.950
 we take a little 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.250
 how is it to make the center of the flower 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.330
 we try to catch a little more and what 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.390
 we put here 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.310
 that we think is unlikely not 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.220
 you fill in again and we put back 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.460
 as big as you want 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.100
 It is good to clean the pointer because 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.220
 when it dries it does not look the same, we throw a 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.020
 little more product 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.770
 that's why I told you that I always have to 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.770
 finish throwing more 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.190
 and we make the top dots this 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.989
 it's like we do not want them to look so 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.800
 we take less products and a little dot 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:59.260
 another dot 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:02.130
 another following everything that is 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.340
 the white of the nail 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.489
 another and another 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.740
 and it is determined I do not know if it is appreciated 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.730
 very well 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.720
 The only thing left to do is take 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.600
 a 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.920
 a protector that is this I have this 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.100
 which is mercadona which is a 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.050
 secant treatment that says dry 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.480
 first and it has a brighter finish 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.910
 that for me it is not true what I had 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:32.950
 It was another of him and I think it's from NYC 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.420
 and it works much better it takes a little longer 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.850
 in drying but that gives a more bright 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.750
 nice and it takes longer to remove good 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.750
 well this is all
