ruled out that leaves the Israelites and
the<00:02:51.040> Sea<00:02:51.220> Peoples<00:02:51.670> now<00:02:51.850> bent<00:02:52.300> or<00:02:52.510> wants<00:02:53.020> likes

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
the Sea Peoples now bent or wants likes

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.750 
the Sea Peoples now bent or wants likes
the<00:02:54.280> Israelites<00:02:54.820> I<00:02:56.160> suggest<00:02:57.160> that<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.550> could

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
the Israelites I suggest that it could

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.360 
the Israelites I suggest that it could
just<00:02:57.790> as<00:02:58.209> easily<00:02:58.360> be<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.840> Sea<00:02:59.200> Peoples<00:02:59.680> this

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
just as easily be the Sea Peoples this

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.330 
just as easily be the Sea Peoples this
group<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:00.910> came<00:03:01.030> from<00:03:01.950> Italy<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.160> Greece

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
group that came from Italy and Greece

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.920 
group that came from Italy and Greece
and<00:03:03.610> went<00:03:03.760> all<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:03.940> way<00:03:04.060> across<00:03:04.209> ended<00:03:04.840> the

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
and went all the way across ended the

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.560 
and went all the way across ended the
Late<00:03:05.080> Bronze<00:03:05.110> Age<00:03:05.560> essentially<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.570> you

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
Late Bronze Age essentially and you

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.810 
Late Bronze Age essentially and you
can't<00:03:08.230> rule<00:03:08.500> them<00:03:08.680> out<00:03:08.800> so<00:03:09.010> what<00:03:09.160> I<00:03:09.190> suggest<00:03:09.280> is

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
can't rule them out so what I suggest is

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.640 
can't rule them out so what I suggest is
okay<00:03:10.060> maybe<00:03:10.180> it's<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.540> Israelites<00:03:10.930> it<00:03:11.350> could

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
okay maybe it's the Israelites it could

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.900 
okay maybe it's the Israelites it could
be<00:03:11.800> the<00:03:11.950> Sea<00:03:12.130> Peoples<00:03:12.489> and<00:03:12.610> then<00:03:12.820> the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
be the Sea Peoples and then the

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.930 
be the Sea Peoples and then the
Israelites<00:03:13.150> claim<00:03:13.540> credit<00:03:13.900> for<00:03:13.930> it<00:03:14.730> until<00:03:15.730> we

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
Israelites claim credit for it until we

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.270 
Israelites claim credit for it until we
find<00:03:16.239> definite<00:03:17.080> evidence<00:03:17.590> for<00:03:17.830> who<00:03:17.980> did<00:03:18.160> the

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
find definite evidence for who did the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.310 
find definite evidence for who did the
destruction<00:03:18.790> it's<00:03:19.209> still<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.570> what<00:03:19.840> if<00:03:19.989> even

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
destruction it's still a what if even

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.020 
destruction it's still a what if even
though<00:03:20.440> it's<00:03:20.620> a<00:03:20.739> gorgeous<00:03:21.010> site<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.580> it's

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
though it's a gorgeous site and it's

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.310 
though it's a gorgeous site and it's
definitely<00:03:22.330> destroyed<00:03:22.750> at<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:22.959> right<00:03:23.110> time

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
definitely destroyed at the right time

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.590 
definitely destroyed at the right time
period<00:03:23.530> but<00:03:24.190> who<00:03:24.340> done<00:03:24.550> it<00:03:24.580> we're<00:03:25.209> not<00:03:25.330> sure

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
period but who done it we're not sure

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.990 
period but who done it we're not sure
yet<00:03:28.320> okay<00:03:29.320> so<00:03:29.980> you<00:03:30.100> don't<00:03:30.310> have<00:03:30.459> any<00:03:30.670> direct

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
yet okay so you don't have any direct

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.910 
yet okay so you don't have any direct
evidence<00:03:31.150> or<00:03:31.989> you<00:03:32.140> don't<00:03:32.290> have<00:03:32.410> any<00:03:32.530> textual

evidence or you don't have any textual

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.310 
evidence or you don't have any textual
evidence<00:03:33.040> that<00:03:33.459> sea<00:03:33.670> peoples<00:03:34.060> did<00:03:34.299> it<00:03:34.450> so<00:03:35.140> it's

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
evidence that sea peoples did it so it's

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.449 
evidence that sea peoples did it so it's
not<00:03:35.410> kind<00:03:35.709> of<00:03:35.769> a<00:03:35.920> toss<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:38.530> wasn't<00:03:39.160> sure<00:03:39.280> if<00:03:39.370> the

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
not kind of a toss I wasn't sure if the

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:40.590 
not kind of a toss I wasn't sure if the
question<00:03:39.820> was<00:03:39.880> maybe<00:03:40.120> even<00:03:40.330> heading<00:03:40.540> a

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
question was maybe even heading a

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.580 
question was maybe even heading a
slightly<00:03:40.840> different<00:03:40.989> direction<00:03:41.380> you<00:03:41.500> know

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
slightly different direction you know

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.199 
slightly different direction you know
one<00:03:41.709> thing<00:03:41.860> Eric's<00:03:42.100> book<00:03:42.310> does<00:03:42.519> is<00:03:42.670> it<00:03:42.850> hits

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
one thing Eric's book does is it hits

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.030 
one thing Eric's book does is it hits

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
claims of biblical archaeology know the

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.300

Covenant but I your questions seem to be
a<00:03:50.620> little<00:03:50.709> bit<00:03:50.860> more<00:03:50.980> general<00:03:51.430> you<00:03:51.549> know<00:03:51.640> does

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
a little bit more general you know does

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.370 
a little bit more general you know does
archaeology<00:03:51.970> help<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.510> Bible<00:03:52.840> at<00:03:52.900> all<00:03:53.019> maybe

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
archaeology help the Bible at all maybe

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.860 
archaeology help the Bible at all maybe
and<00:03:53.680> I<00:03:54.130> would<00:03:54.280> respond<00:03:54.640> yes<00:03:54.850> I<00:03:55.000> think<00:03:55.060> in<00:03:55.390> a<00:03:55.480> low

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
and I would respond yes I think in a low

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.360 
and I would respond yes I think in a low
level<00:03:56.019> it's<00:03:56.230> not<00:03:56.320> as<00:03:56.440> sensational<00:03:57.070> but<00:03:57.220> if<00:03:57.310> you

level it's not as sensational but if you

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.770 
level it's not as sensational but if you
go<00:03:57.489> back<00:03:57.700> to<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:57.940> beginnings<00:03:58.360> of<00:03:58.450> Biblical

nowadays this doesn't you know this
doesn't<00:04:21.009> surprise<00:04:21.400> it<00:04:21.880> all<00:04:21.940> it's<00:04:22.030> not

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
doesn't surprise it all it's not

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.670 
doesn't surprise it all it's not
particularly<00:04:22.509> interesting<00:04:22.990> but<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.500> early

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
particularly interesting but the early

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.200 
particularly interesting but the early
days<00:04:23.919> are<00:04:24.130> all<00:04:24.220> sorts<00:04:24.550> of<00:04:24.610> little<00:04:24.699> discoveries

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
days are all sorts of little discoveries

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.879 
days are all sorts of little discoveries
like<00:04:25.389> that<00:04:25.539> so<00:04:25.660> at<00:04:25.720> a<00:04:25.780> low-level<00:04:26.259> basis

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
like that so at a low-level basis

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.790 
like that so at a low-level basis
archaeology<00:04:27.460> has<00:04:27.639> very<00:04:28.800> powerfully

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
archaeology has very powerfully

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.670 
archaeology has very powerfully
confirmed<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.430> basic<00:04:30.880> historicity<00:04:31.240> of
