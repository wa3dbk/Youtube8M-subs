00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.190
 very good to all people how about how 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.710
 we are here black with the new champion 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.330
 that is about to arrive with lisandra a 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.570
 champion that the truth is that he is 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.210
 liking enough is a champion ap that 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.560
 He is very mobile and apart from me 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.650
 very much cc let's go see now 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.789
 little by little all your skills 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.160
 tell you that this is the skin 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.940
 secondary now let's see the normal 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.620
 what my partner has 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.090
 and well, speaking a little bit of the 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.090
 skills will get you started 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.730
 let's start seeing the passive of 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.950
 lisandra is a skill really 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.110
 good what it does is that every 18 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.660
 seconds our next skill does not 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.180
 it's going to cost any kind of mana apart 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.290
 of it the cedÃ© will be reduced 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.379
 whenever we use one of our 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.360
 skills against an enemy champion and 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.370
 in this way we harm you for 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.050
 say so your movement speed 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.820
 which means that if one of 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.489
 our skills slows you down 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.290
 immobilize or tune them the cd this 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.830
 ability is reduced by one second 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.770
 that is also to say that this ability 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.300
 Passive is not affected by items 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.190
 suppose we have some milestone in that 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.630
 can slow down and so on so you can not see 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.520
 affected by him 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.369
 there we see the cds I use some 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.649
 skill that as I say it hurts your 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.290
 movement speed since the cde is 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:27.170
 see reduced 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.170
 ay take me a jiffy and now another 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.429
 let's take a look at the q 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.719
 stability is a corner that does not have 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:34.520
 a lot of range as we are seeing here 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.950
 but it's a skill basically it's 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.869
 to speak to me has little yields what 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.509
 does stability is that it does magical damage 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.770
 to all the units in which of both 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.420
 to the first as to the second 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.719
 remember that many of these skills 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.130
 many times it hurts the first 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.829
 goal and the next thing makes it less 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.569
 stability does everyone equally and 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.959
 apart from that it will also slow down 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:55.959
 to the objective 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.820
 as we have little by little given and 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.820
 basically stable 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.500
 let's see now the stability w as 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.300
 we are seeing is in area when using 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.800
 automatically will use it is not 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.540
 no type of skiing are there and you have to 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.070
 point to nowhere 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.020
 what stability does is magic damage 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.430
 in area as we said and apart from 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.410
 this will immobilize all 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.010
 objectives during a short period of 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.080
 time what we know as 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.030
 routing to ras ruth is all a 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.580
 similarity would be the effect exactly 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.580
 same as for example the cage of rise w 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.840
 let's move now with stability as 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.510
 are looking at the template is another is 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.630
 he also wanted to lisandra throw to a claw 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.820
 and it will magically damage all the 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.920
 units apart from them and before they 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.600
 finish the effect of the skill 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.400
 we return to reactivate the we are going to 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.740
 have transport where is the 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.090
 claw is a really good skill 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.520
 for a given moment to play a 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.750
 more aggressive way to use 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.490
 our skills also to be able 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.500
 escape since through walls and so on 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.130
 let's see the normal effect and then 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.130
 activating the 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.730
 as I say softness that in a moment 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.660
 given if we want to be able to escape 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.660
 and that also comes in handy 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.560
 It's really good 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.640
 finally we are left to the air the ultimate 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.980
 stability has two forms of 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.400
 punish the first one is in a champion 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.900
 enemy to which we will study the other 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.970
 it is in ourselves 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.349
 lisandra will be immune during a 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.569
 short period of time and it's going to be 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.250
 also inter gta bleu we can not do 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.200
 neither any kind of skill nor anything 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.629
 this reminds a lot who has played 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.940
 something for example the typical the ulna of 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.860
 magician because it works exactly the 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.680
 same way just here, you are 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.690
 also smart talk apart from it 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.940
 when we use stability in both 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.549
 an enemy unit like ourselves 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.680
 we are going to create a damage in area which 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.390
 it does magical damage of course and apart 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.160
 of it will slow down for a brief 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.160
 period of time to all units 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:14.120
 I'll use it first on myself 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.120
 so we can see what's immune 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.979
 let's see now the castle in a unit 

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:24.139
 enemy as I have already told you I will be 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.670
 here we are seeing the first rank 15 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.140
 seconds 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.880
 tell them to come back that we have not 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.280
 seen before and the question itself as 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.970
 we have seen it hurts nobody also to 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.970
 all the objectives 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.490
 and that would be the ultimate one trip is 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.770
 really quite a wide area 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.540
 as we have seen we are going to comment on some 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.100
 kind of how not how good he has and 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.250
 Sandra for her skills as we have 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.070
 seen has a lot of mobility and all 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.940
 his skills except for the have 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.380
 cc or this is the ccc and cc and this is 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.210
 an escape route or how are we 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.480
 seeing a lot of mobility and apart from 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.400
 it a great cc 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.200
 one of the combos that we can use 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.580
 of many because I here the truth is 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.650
 I see quite a lot of potential in general 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.870
 now when it comes to throwing your skills 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.550
 is not the typical champion that you have to 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.410
 follow a specific order for example 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.510
 one of them 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:22.240
 would use the double bassinet guarantees 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.210
 lae castle to put yourself at your rank 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.980
 on routes with the w and then the 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.990
 ultimate let's see it 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.520
 quickly to see how it is is a combo 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.470
 which I think is quite lethal and very 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.470
 good with a lot of tc in between 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.870
 and finally another that does is a damage 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.850
 quite acceptable you already know that this 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.040
 has a little cde so for that 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:51.310
 of pulling the rope towards him slows down 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.690
 I know what's pretty good, let's suppose 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.250
 we are in danger or maybe 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.470
 some champion that is the melee 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.950
 another one of the things we could use 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.450
 would be the double vee followed by in this 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.420
 case from the cv to in this way 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.520
 slow down 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.920
 you put this in and this way you can 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.860
 escape basically because the uncle was 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.990
 routed and then slowed down by 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.520
 put an example I want to say the 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.010
 champion has a lot very much 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.770
 potential and for example if we are in your 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:22.440
 melee you can slow down 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.030
 route I do not know what ultimate you have 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.970
 lots of possibilities with the champion 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:30.650
 and it's really fine let's see now 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.650
 like palm our little friend to lisandra 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.490
 thence 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.560
 Well, no people, I hope that I have 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.780
 liked the new champion as I say 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.120
 has a lot of personal potential 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.700
 I will say that I liked quite a 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.200
 champion who has a lot of game going to 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.180
 require hands to get all the 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.950
 potential what is really cool 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.600
 of these champions as for example 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.450
 when oriana leaves also without drag 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.100
 etcetera and little more remember that 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.080
 you can support the video with the typical me 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.850
 like and as always I invite you to me 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.400
 So leave your opinion what you 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:16.730
 it seems the champion the corner etc we 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.730
 we see people
