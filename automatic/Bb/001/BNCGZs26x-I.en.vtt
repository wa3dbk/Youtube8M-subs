your wireless network is connected
you'll<00:02:38.980> come<00:02:39.220> up<00:02:39.250> with<00:02:39.610> some<00:02:40.330> different

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
you'll come up with some different

innovations<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:46.630> looks<00:02:46.930> like<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.290> correct

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
innovations it looks like the correct

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.890 
innovations it looks like the correct
sign<00:02:47.830> so<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.220> got<00:02:48.430> my<00:02:48.670> security<00:02:49.540> mode<00:02:49.750> and

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
sign so I got my security mode and

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.380 
sign so I got my security mode and
everything<00:02:50.260> now<00:02:50.830> here<00:02:51.820> we're<00:02:52.000> talking<00:02:52.120> about
