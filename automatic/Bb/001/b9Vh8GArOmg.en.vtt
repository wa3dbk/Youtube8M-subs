 call themselves strong for putting together four saxophonists who together 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.430

 the poems are so but we do it is always nice 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.870
 we do this by chair masseurs arguing that it is so nice to be happy 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.870
 but yes you are going to have a check by the fire department 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.690
 well you do music all over the world 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.440
 then we do that is the nicest thing there is and then you are among his quartet 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.280
 and then you throw a poem through a rounded one over and then you go indie music 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.000
 sit and they are 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.850
 elevate truffles a whole CD and you also get adv 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:44.799
 these truffles 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.430
 it was going to give a blackberry further information there sl 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.630
 what is that 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.020
 I even convinced it 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.450
 they said they still have music there 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.950
 in the beginning it is true that all those very everything is no, not at all 9 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.840
 say no it is so beautiful and kind they make this scene 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.510
 so walking constantly listening one after the other and that is how nice she was 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.609
 our teeth are broken 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:11.819
 The state shouldn't be too bad to just listen and respond 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.459
 the and then the four of you should try yes and what they could to it 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.310
 essence of the piece and to get upstairs 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.509
 and we are so incredibly good at that 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:24.229
 this week all of them close themselves up and then they go all the pieces they go 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.849
 to do 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.310
 eventually it comes out is occasionally it's his basement this goes from 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.569
 unfortunately in vain 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.679
 because of that kees van kooten stood up so no that was a burglar 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:37.379
 the building man it is a nice Christmas to see Kees van Kooten play against 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.789
 close up 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:42.469
 and read from his own work and luckily his trombone always happens 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:46.129
 taken along so who were allowed to drive who were allowed to play a song 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.689
 that it was incredibly nice it was only for the plates presentation 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:54.700
 but it would not be wrong that pigs are to do concerts with 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.319
 van kooten the abdominal wall has been sold 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:58.549
