gonna be doing a tutorial but also do
maybe<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.650> third<00:00:16.859> few<00:00:17.130> seconds<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.970> explain<00:00:18.029> it

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449

maybe a third few seconds to explain it
all<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.080> did<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.859> so<00:00:20.070> simple<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.520> just

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
all I did this is so simple I just

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.220 
all I did this is so simple I just
drilled<00:00:21.090> out<00:00:21.270> all<00:00:21.480> eight<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.109> air

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
drilled out all eight of the air

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.950 
drilled out all eight of the air
stickers<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.070> what<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.150> causes<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.720> all

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
stickers and what this causes is all

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.960 
stickers and what this causes is all
darts<00:00:25.350> will<00:00:25.500> fire<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.859> once<00:00:26.039> firing<00:00:26.519> all<00:00:26.699> eight

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
darts will fire it once firing all eight

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.630 
darts will fire it once firing all eight
darts<00:00:27.390> yes<00:00:27.689> all<00:00:27.960> darts<00:00:28.769> well<00:00:29.250> it's<00:00:29.369> not<00:00:29.460> gonna

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
darts yes all darts well it's not gonna

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.519 
darts yes all darts well it's not gonna
be<00:00:29.730> an<00:00:29.820> extreme<00:00:30.240> ranges<00:00:30.599> but<00:00:30.810> fires<00:00:31.080> some<00:00:31.380> are

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
be an extreme ranges but fires some are

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.830 
be an extreme ranges but fires some are
around<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.520> can<00:00:32.669> fire<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.239> farthest<00:00:33.660> one

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
around it can fire the farthest one

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.920 
around it can fire the farthest one
about<00:00:34.079> 45<00:00:34.680> feet<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.969> shortest<00:00:36.360> one<00:00:36.600> from

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
about 45 feet and the shortest one from

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.680 
about 45 feet and the shortest one from
15<00:00:37.620> feet<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.100> obviously<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.059> sentence<00:00:39.510> this

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
15 feet and obviously in a sentence this

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.080 
15 feet and obviously in a sentence this
goes<00:00:39.899> probably<00:00:40.200> about<00:00:40.440> 45<00:00:40.860> feet<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.850> one

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
goes probably about 45 feet this one

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.590 
goes probably about 45 feet this one
probably<00:00:42.329> goes<00:00:42.739> 28<00:00:43.739> maybe<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.670> row<00:00:44.879> then<00:00:45.480> it

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
probably goes 28 maybe this row then it

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.810 
probably goes 28 maybe this row then it
goes<00:00:45.780> about<00:00:46.140> 20<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.980> then<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.190> one<00:00:47.399> probably

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
goes about 20 and then this one probably

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.290 
goes about 20 and then this one probably
15<00:00:48.629> or<00:00:49.289> maybe<00:00:49.950> higher<00:00:50.280> generally<00:00:50.850> about<00:00:51.059> 5

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
15 or maybe higher generally about 5

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.910 
15 or maybe higher generally about 5
feet<00:00:51.510> each<00:00:51.750> one<00:00:52.050> but<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.379> one's<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.800> either

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
feet each one but this one's it either

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.080 
feet each one but this one's it either
either<00:00:53.370> goes<00:00:53.670> 40<00:00:54.210> 28<00:00:54.890> 2015<00:00:55.890> that's<00:00:56.760> usually

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
either goes 40 28 2015 that's usually

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.810 
either goes 40 28 2015 that's usually
how<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.079> without<00:00:58.559> explain<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.399> did

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
how it is so without explain I did

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.310 
how it is so without explain I did
pretty<00:01:00.000> much<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.480> was<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> broken<00:01:01.140> rough

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
pretty much it this was a broken rough

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.410 
pretty much it this was a broken rough
cut<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.649> about<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.309> your<00:01:02.730> trigger<00:01:03.059> my

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
cut on about you but your trigger my

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.969 
cut on about you but your trigger my
triggers<00:01:03.840> started<00:01:04.140> wearing<00:01:04.290> outside<00:01:04.680> cut<00:01:04.920> it

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
triggers started wearing outside cut it

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.070 
triggers started wearing outside cut it
off<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.610> then<00:01:05.760> realize<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.240> way<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.659> release

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
off and then realize the way to release

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.929 
off and then realize the way to release
the<00:01:07.320> plunger<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.189> pulled<00:01:08.430> out<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> little

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the plunger is you pulled out a little

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.230 
the plunger is you pulled out a little
white<00:01:09.150> piece<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.600> here<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.700> just<00:01:11.700> what<00:01:12.090> I'm

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
white piece in here and just what I'm

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.000 
white piece in here and just what I'm
really<00:01:12.479> quick<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.500> releases<00:01:13.710> both

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
really quick and it releases both

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:24.070 
really quick and it releases both
plungers<00:01:14.520> at<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.850> same<00:01:15.030> time<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:16.490> it's<00:01:17.490> normal

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.810 

so<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.380> doesn't<00:01:25.650> wash<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:26.130> far<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:26.670> if

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
so it doesn't wash that far but if

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
so it doesn't wash that far but if
you're<00:01:26.939> really<00:01:27.060> just<00:01:27.270> trying<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.570> get

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
you're really just trying to get

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.249 
you're really just trying to get
something<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.470> cheesy<00:01:28.829> or<00:01:28.950> something<00:01:30.259> it'll

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
something on a cheesy or something it'll

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.679 
something on a cheesy or something it'll
work<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:32.520> really<00:01:32.549> kind<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:32.970> big<00:01:33.210> waste<00:01:33.509> of

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
work it's really kind of big waste of

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.109 
work it's really kind of big waste of
darts<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.740> had<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.009> fire<00:01:35.280> both<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
darts but you had to fire both the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.840 
darts but you had to fire both the
barrels<00:01:36.570> at<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.590> same<00:01:37.860> time<00:01:38.189> rails<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.700> not

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
barrels at the same time rails it's not

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.810 
barrels at the same time rails it's not
gonna<00:01:38.970> work<00:01:39.770> but<00:01:40.770> otherwise<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.400> works<00:01:41.520> just

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
gonna work but otherwise it works just

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.630 
gonna work but otherwise it works just
like<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.119> rough<00:01:42.329> cut<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.720> terms<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.229> priming<00:01:43.649> but

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
like a rough cut in terms of priming but

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.160 
like a rough cut in terms of priming but
everything<00:01:45.030> else<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.329> practically<00:01:45.750> much

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
everything else is practically much

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.319 
everything else is practically much
different<00:01:49.820> so<00:01:50.820> pretty<00:01:51.030> much<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.299> just

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
different so pretty much it just

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.330 
different so pretty much it just
obliterates<00:01:52.020> what's<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.470> front<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.829> but

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
obliterates what's in front of it but

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.830 
obliterates what's in front of it but
that's<00:01:53.640> pretty<00:01:53.759> much<00:01:54.060> just<00:01:54.119> showing<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.750> guys

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
that's pretty much just showing you guys

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.819 
that's pretty much just showing you guys
a<00:01:54.899> firing<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.740> my<00:01:56.479> shotgun<00:01:57.479> modded<00:01:57.930> their<00:01:58.500> prop

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
a firing of my shotgun modded their prop
