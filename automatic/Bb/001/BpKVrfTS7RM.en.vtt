morning<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.720> boy<00:01:30.900> with<00:01:31.110> extrasensory<00:01:31.710> powers

awoke in bed transformed into a cadaver

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.800 
awoke in bed transformed into a cadaver
so<00:01:36.740> it's<00:01:37.740> hard<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.159> me<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.820> take<00:01:39.000> my<00:01:39.450> evidence

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
so it's hard for me to take my evidence

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.249 
so it's hard for me to take my evidence
from<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> game<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.799> use<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.430> anime<00:01:41.909> as

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
from the game and use the anime as

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.899 
from the game and use the anime as
partial<00:01:43.259> evidence<00:01:43.649> because<00:01:44.009> they<00:01:44.520> do<00:01:44.670> not

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
partial evidence because they do not

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.510 
partial evidence because they do not
coincide<00:01:45.329> at<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.110> same<00:01:46.320> time<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:47.159> if<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.460> do

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
coincide at the same time but if I do

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.249 
coincide at the same time but if I do
recall<00:01:47.729> there<00:01:48.210> was<00:01:48.299> an<00:01:48.450> episode<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.780> Pokemon

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
recall there was an episode of Pokemon

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.770 
recall there was an episode of Pokemon
in<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> anime<00:01:49.860> where<00:01:50.340> Ash<00:01:50.670> was<00:01:51.119> turned<00:01:51.420> into<00:01:51.600> a

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
in the anime where Ash was turned into a

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.980 
in the anime where Ash was turned into a
Pikachu<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.680> short<00:01:52.979> time<00:01:53.159> with<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.180> magic

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
Pikachu for a short time with a magic

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.719 
Pikachu for a short time with a magic
spell<00:01:55.340> so<00:01:56.750> again<00:01:57.799> not<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.009> most<00:01:59.189> concrete

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
spell so again not the most concrete

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.300 
spell so again not the most concrete
evidence<00:02:00.170> but<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.320> does<00:02:01.530> support<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.100> fact

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
evidence but it does support the fact

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.440 
evidence but it does support the fact
that<00:02:02.570> humans<00:02:03.570> can<00:02:03.899> become<00:02:04.290> Pokemon<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:06.060> while

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
that humans can become Pokemon so while

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.650 
that humans can become Pokemon so while
ash<00:02:06.659> was<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.259> Pikachu<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:08.160> suppose<00:02:08.759> Pikachu<00:02:09.360> was

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
ash was a Pikachu I suppose Pikachu was

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.660 
ash was a Pikachu I suppose Pikachu was
ash

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
ash

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.970 
ash
whether<00:02:11.120> body<00:02:11.480> switched<00:02:11.960> something<00:02:12.410> similar

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
whether body switched something similar

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.050 
whether body switched something similar
to<00:02:13.100> that<00:02:13.130> so<00:02:13.970> why<00:02:14.510> wouldn't<00:02:15.550> Pokemon<00:02:16.550> that

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
to that so why wouldn't Pokemon that

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.880 
to that so why wouldn't Pokemon that
could<00:02:17.300> cast<00:02:17.600> these<00:02:17.870> type<00:02:18.110> of<00:02:18.140> spells<00:02:18.470> do<00:02:18.770> the

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
could cast these type of spells do the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.670 
could cast these type of spells do the
same<00:02:19.100> thing<00:02:19.370> or<00:02:20.240> why<00:02:20.569> couldn't<00:02:20.630> humans<00:02:21.260> do<00:02:21.560> the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
same thing or why couldn't humans do the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.900 
same thing or why couldn't humans do the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
same thing as well so more or less this

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.970 
same thing as well so more or less this
may<00:02:26.270> or<00:02:26.420> may<00:02:26.569> not<00:02:26.600> actually<00:02:26.780> be<00:02:27.380> true<00:02:27.770> as

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
may or may not actually be true as

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.120 
may or may not actually be true as
ridiculous<00:02:28.880> as<00:02:29.209> it<00:02:29.270> may<00:02:29.480> seem<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:30.650> weirdest

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
ridiculous as it may seem the weirdest

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.490 
ridiculous as it may seem the weirdest
part<00:02:31.370> about<00:02:31.490> this<00:02:31.790> is<00:02:32.060> though<00:02:32.360> is<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.260> fact

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
part about this is though is the fact

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.120 
part about this is though is the fact
that<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:34.250> was<00:02:34.959> Kadabra<00:02:35.959> not<00:02:36.380> Avril<00:02:36.890> or

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
that it was Kadabra not Avril or

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.570 
that it was Kadabra not Avril or
Alakazam<00:02:37.760> why<00:02:38.270> did<00:02:38.480> they<00:02:38.600> choose<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:39.580> Kadabra

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
Alakazam why did they choose a Kadabra

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.600 
Alakazam why did they choose a Kadabra
to<00:02:40.700> do<00:02:40.819> this<00:02:41.030> whenever<00:02:41.270> was<00:02:41.780> obviously<00:02:42.610> the

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
to do this whenever was obviously the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.560 
to do this whenever was obviously the
first<00:02:43.850> in<00:02:44.590> Alakazam<00:02:45.590> was<00:02:45.770> less<00:02:46.070> so<00:02:46.820> for

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
first in Alakazam was less so for

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.560 
first in Alakazam was less so for
