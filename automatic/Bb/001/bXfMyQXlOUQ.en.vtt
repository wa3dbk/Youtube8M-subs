00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
you a nice clean edge and you really

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.410 
you a nice clean edge and you really
need<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.250> watch<00:02:35.579> for<00:02:35.909> that<00:02:35.939> on<00:02:36.269> these

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
need to watch for that on these

because<00:02:37.959> it's<00:02:38.170> possible<00:02:38.709> that<00:02:38.950> you're<00:02:39.879> not

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
because it's possible that you're not

because it's possible that you're not
going<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.330> see<00:02:40.659> that<00:02:41.230> hard<00:02:41.530> edge<00:02:41.769> until<00:02:42.099> it

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
going to see that hard edge until it

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.850 
going to see that hard edge until it
goes<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:43.000> print<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.510> then<00:02:43.720> you<00:02:43.840> see<00:02:44.079> it<00:02:44.230> so

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
goes to print and then you see it so

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.710 
goes to print and then you see it so

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
just to be on the safe side you might

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.300 
just to be on the safe side you might
want<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:46.959> go<00:02:47.079> ahead<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.379> just<00:02:47.560> add<00:02:47.739> a<00:02:47.799> soft

image cover everything pressing shift
and<00:05:23.550> if<00:05:24.550> this<00:05:24.669> fit<00:05:25.060> perfectly<00:05:25.930> you<00:05:26.500> could

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
and if this fit perfectly you could

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.409 
and if this fit perfectly you could
actually<00:05:26.830> leave<00:05:27.219> it<00:05:27.250> like<00:05:27.430> that<00:05:27.639> or<00:05:28.029> you<00:05:28.120> can

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
actually leave it like that or you can

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.010 
actually leave it like that or you can
move<00:05:28.599> it<00:05:28.719> down<00:05:28.750> to<00:05:29.590> our<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:30.039> design<00:05:30.370> will<00:05:30.550> show

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
move it down to our the design will show

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:37.100 
move it down to our the design will show
your<00:05:32.020> stuff<00:05:32.229> around<00:05:32.409> wherever<00:05:32.949> you<00:05:33.189> want<00:05:33.370> it

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
properties the bevel the satin the

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:57.570 
properties the bevel the satin the
stroke<00:05:53.129> changed<00:05:54.129> the<00:05:54.340> size<00:05:54.610> of<00:05:54.789> the<00:05:54.879> stroke<00:05:56.580> so
