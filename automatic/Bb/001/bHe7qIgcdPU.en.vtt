00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.030 

one<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.840> great<00:00:10.050> things<00:00:10.290> about<00:00:10.380> American

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
one of the great things about American

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.340 
one of the great things about American
Smooth<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.969> fact<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.600> can<00:00:12.780> do<00:00:12.930> open

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:13.350 
Smooth is the fact that you can do open

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.990 
Smooth is the fact that you can do open
movements<00:00:13.740> which<00:00:13.860> means<00:00:14.129> your<00:00:14.280> arms<00:00:14.670> are<00:00:14.820> free

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
movements which means your arms are free

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.930 
movements which means your arms are free
now<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.809> arm<00:00:16.139> styling<00:00:16.770> should<00:00:17.490> reflect

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
now the arm styling should reflect

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.430 
now the arm styling should reflect
what's<00:00:18.150> happening<00:00:18.210> through<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.750> base<00:00:18.930> which

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
what's happening through the base which

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.050 
what's happening through the base which
is<00:00:19.470> why<00:00:19.830> we've<00:00:20.160> taken<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.640> through<00:00:20.850> all<00:00:20.940> these

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
is why we've taken you through all these

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.400 
is why we've taken you through all these
fundamentals<00:00:21.720> again<00:00:21.990> because<00:00:22.200> you're<00:00:22.320> going

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
fundamentals again because you're going

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.960 
fundamentals again because you're going
to<00:00:22.530> be<00:00:22.620> seeing<00:00:22.860> now<00:00:23.160> we're<00:00:23.730> going<00:00:23.880> to

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
to be seeing now we're going to

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.760 
to be seeing now we're going to
demonstrate<00:00:24.180> how<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.810> action<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
demonstrate how the action of the

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.520 
demonstrate how the action of the
fundamentals<00:00:26.490> creates<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.570> arm<00:00:27.720> styling<00:00:28.080> for

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:28.530 
fundamentals creates the arm styling for

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.080 
fundamentals creates the arm styling for
you<00:00:28.880> okay

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
you okay

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.080 
you okay
so<00:00:30.450> we've<00:00:30.690> gone<00:00:30.870> through<00:00:30.950> swing<00:00:31.950> rotation<00:00:32.910> and

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
so we've gone through swing rotation and

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.660 
so we've gone through swing rotation and
sway<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:34.140> these<00:00:34.379> three<00:00:34.680> elements<00:00:34.829> are<00:00:35.399> really

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
sway so these three elements are really

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.000 
sway so these three elements are really
important<00:00:36.539> in<00:00:36.660> our<00:00:36.809> walls<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.440> they're<00:00:37.829> also

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
important in our walls and they're also

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.950 
important in our walls and they're also
important<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:38.730> how<00:00:38.880> we<00:00:38.940> go<00:00:39.210> into<00:00:39.360> style<00:00:39.750> and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
important for how we go into style and

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.170 
important for how we go into style and
characterize<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.710> walls<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.579> these<00:00:41.940> are<00:00:42.090> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
characterize the walls so these are the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.120 
characterize the walls so these are the
tools<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.570> we're<00:00:42.780> going<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.990> talk<00:00:43.200> about<00:00:43.380> we

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
tools that we're going to talk about we

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.580 
tools that we're going to talk about we
have<00:00:44.400> circles<00:00:45.060> that<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:45.960> create<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.530> our

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
have circles that we can create with our

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.250 
have circles that we can create with our
arms<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.250> have<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.640> circle<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.540> can<00:00:48.750> go<00:00:48.870> beside

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
arms we have a circle that can go beside

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.310 
arms we have a circle that can go beside
our<00:00:49.500> body<00:00:50.090> okay<00:00:51.090> that's<00:00:51.600> going<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.930> be<00:00:52.110> with

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
our body okay that's going to be with

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.550 
our body okay that's going to be with
swing<00:00:52.950> we<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> circle<00:00:54.810> that<00:00:55.110> can<00:00:55.230> be<00:00:55.380> like

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
swing we have a circle that can be like

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.460 
swing we have a circle that can be like
a<00:00:55.590> hula<00:00:55.920> hoop<00:00:56.250> around<00:00:56.700> in<00:00:57.600> front<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.110> our<00:00:58.260> body

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
a hula hoop around in front of our body

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.160 
a hula hoop around in front of our body
so<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:58.800> can<00:00:59.070> swing<00:00:59.520> like<00:00:59.970> a<00:01:00.000> hula<00:01:00.329> hoop<00:01:00.630> around

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
so we can swing like a hula hoop around

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.990 
so we can swing like a hula hoop around
our<00:01:01.500> body<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:01.980> that's<00:01:02.070> parallel<00:01:02.670> with<00:01:02.880> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
our body so that's parallel with the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.329 
our body so that's parallel with the
floor<00:01:03.120> yeah<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.199> that's<00:01:04.439> our<00:01:04.619> rotation

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
floor yeah so that that's our rotation

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.539 
floor yeah so that that's our rotation
circle<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.570> then<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.500> sway<00:01:07.950> circle

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
circle and then we have a sway circle

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.880 
circle and then we have a sway circle
which<00:01:09.180> will<00:01:09.390> go<00:01:09.570> around<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.380> front<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.740> our

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
which will go around in front of our

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.680 
which will go around in front of our
face<00:01:11.190> and<00:01:11.460> we'll<00:01:11.549> explain<00:01:11.880> how<00:01:11.940> we<00:01:12.180> get<00:01:12.450> this

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
face and we'll explain how we get this

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.320 
face and we'll explain how we get this
so<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.140> have<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> circle<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.460> go<00:01:14.640> up<00:01:14.850> and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
so we have a circle that can go up and

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.570 
so we have a circle that can go up and
around<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.810> face<00:01:16.049> that's<00:01:16.440> more<00:01:16.680> sideways<00:01:17.280> so

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
around the face that's more sideways so

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.340 
around the face that's more sideways so
it's<00:01:17.760> a<00:01:17.850> sideways<00:01:18.390> circle<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.229> go

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
it's a sideways circle so it can go

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.250 
it's a sideways circle so it can go
around<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.280> out<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.909> other<00:01:20.940> side<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.110> can

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
around and out the other side or it can

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.380 
around and out the other side or it can
go<00:01:22.409> up<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.040> stop<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:23.640> come<00:01:23.940> back<00:01:24.180> around

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
go up and stop and then come back around

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.990 
go up and stop and then come back around
to<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> other<00:01:25.049> side<00:01:25.440> okay<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.760> can<00:01:26.970> see

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
to the other side okay so you can see

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.149 
to the other side okay so you can see
we've<00:01:27.390> drawn<00:01:27.750> these<00:01:28.170> big<00:01:28.470> circles<00:01:28.710> one<00:01:29.130> for

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
we've drawn these big circles one for

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.300 
we've drawn these big circles one for
sway<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:30.720> rotation<00:01:31.440> around<00:01:31.740> us<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:32.159> and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
sway one for rotation around us here and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.969 
sway one for rotation around us here and
then<00:01:32.790> one<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:33.479> swing<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.170> forward<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.740> back

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
then one for swing is a forward and back

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.710 
then one for swing is a forward and back
now<00:01:35.430> I'll<00:01:35.549> explain<00:01:35.700> how<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.270> use<00:01:36.570> that

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
now I'll explain how we can use that

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.280 
now I'll explain how we can use that
with<00:01:36.869> our<00:01:36.990> base<00:01:37.170> technique<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:38.610> swing<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:40.140> know

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
with our base technique so swing we know

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.170 
with our base technique so swing we know
is<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.619> rise<00:01:40.830> and<00:01:41.159> fall<00:01:41.400> action<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.030> it's

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
is the rise and fall action and it's

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.510 
is the rise and fall action and it's
generally<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> forward<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.470> backward<00:01:43.590> action

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
generally a forward and backward action

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.850 
generally a forward and backward action
our<00:01:44.760> rotation<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.780> what<00:01:45.960> turns<00:01:46.260> us<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:46.710> we're

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
our rotation is what turns us so we're

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.320 
our rotation is what turns us so we're
just<00:01:47.040> going<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.189> go<00:01:47.369> forward<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.880> backwards

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
just going to go forward and backwards

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.109 
just going to go forward and backwards
so<00:01:49.020> if<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:49.380> go<00:01:49.530> forward<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.729> try<00:01:51.060> this

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
so if we go forward and you can try this

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.260 
so if we go forward and you can try this
if<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:52.350> go<00:01:52.560> forward<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.189> then<00:01:53.310> rock<00:01:53.520> back<00:01:53.820> and

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
if you go forward and then rock back and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.780 
if you go forward and then rock back and
then<00:01:55.049> forward<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.590> then<00:01:55.680> rock<00:01:55.860> back<00:01:56.100> what

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
then forward and then rock back what

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.830 
then forward and then rock back what
happens<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.540> our<00:01:58.170> hips<00:01:58.670> tilt<00:01:59.670> us<00:01:59.970> up<00:02:00.420> and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
happens is our hips tilt us up and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.350 
happens is our hips tilt us up and
forward<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.740> arm<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.400> following<00:02:02.970> that

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
forward and so the arm is following that

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.899 
forward and so the arm is following that
line<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.470> can<00:02:04.500> take<00:02:04.860> up<00:02:05.130> all<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.729> way<00:02:05.850> to

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
line and we can take up all the way to

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.479 
line and we can take up all the way to
the<00:02:06.090> peak<00:02:06.299> we<00:02:06.900> can<00:02:07.079> stop<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.590> little<00:02:08.129> bit<00:02:08.280> on<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
the peak we can stop a little bit on the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.219 
the peak we can stop a little bit on the
way<00:02:08.579> back<00:02:08.789> or<00:02:09.090> we<00:02:09.239> can<00:02:09.269> take<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.629> all<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.929> way

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
way back or we can take it all the way

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.199 
way back or we can take it all the way
beside<00:02:11.099> us<00:02:11.280> like<00:02:11.430> we're<00:02:11.640> swimming<00:02:11.939> like

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
beside us like we're swimming like

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.050 
beside us like we're swimming like
freestyle<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.500> we<00:02:13.620> can<00:02:13.770> take<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.069> up<00:02:14.280> either

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
freestyle so we can take it up either

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.110 
freestyle so we can take it up either
way<00:02:15.330> all<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:16.080> way<00:02:16.110> around<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:17.220> then<00:02:18.000> you

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
way all the way around and then you

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.230 
way all the way around and then you
could<00:02:18.270> take<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.569> out<00:02:18.690> with

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
could take it out with

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.030 
could take it out with
and<00:02:19.480> action<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:19.930> we<00:02:20.050> have<00:02:20.260> this<00:02:20.440> circle<00:02:20.920> that's

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
and action so we have this circle that's

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.100 
and action so we have this circle that's
beside<00:02:21.430> our<00:02:21.580> body<00:02:21.760> for<00:02:22.060> swing<00:02:22.360> now<00:02:22.810> at<00:02:22.960> this

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
beside our body for swing now at this

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.570 
beside our body for swing now at this
point<00:02:23.350> we<00:02:23.470> should<00:02:23.650> say<00:02:23.800> that<00:02:23.980> this<00:02:24.070> is<00:02:24.250> equally

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
point we should say that this is equally

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.160 
point we should say that this is equally
as<00:02:24.700> important<00:02:25.180> for<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.360> man<00:02:25.570> as<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.960> lady

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
as important for the man as the lady

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.490 
as important for the man as the lady
even<00:02:26.980> though<00:02:27.130> a<00:02:27.730> lot<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.870> time<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.320> man

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
even though a lot of the time the man

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.130 
even though a lot of the time the man
has<00:02:29.710> two<00:02:29.950> hands<00:02:30.220> one<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.700> maybe<00:02:31.660> holding<00:02:32.020> the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
has two hands one and maybe holding the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.510 
has two hands one and maybe holding the
lady's<00:02:32.410> hand<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:32.980> other<00:02:33.070> holding<00:02:33.460> the

lady's hand and the other holding the
lady's<00:02:33.790> waist<00:02:34.030> but<00:02:34.750> there<00:02:34.930> are<00:02:35.110> occasions

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
lady's waist but there are occasions

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.490 
lady's waist but there are occasions
where<00:02:36.280> we're<00:02:36.580> either<00:02:36.820> apart<00:02:37.330> or<00:02:38.050> just<00:02:38.260> holding

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
where we're either apart or just holding

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.770 
where we're either apart or just holding
with<00:02:38.710> one<00:02:38.920> hand<00:02:39.280> when<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.000> man<00:02:40.180> needs<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.630> know

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
with one hand when the man needs to know

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.990 
with one hand when the man needs to know
what<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.050> do<00:02:41.200> with<00:02:41.380> his<00:02:41.530> free<00:02:41.800> arm<00:02:41.830> right<00:02:42.580> so<00:02:42.820> on

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
what to do with his free arm right so on

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.700 
what to do with his free arm right so on
styling<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:43.750> for<00:02:43.930> everybody

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
styling is for everybody

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.850 
styling is for everybody
now<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.700> second<00:02:46.090> rotation<00:02:46.210> at<00:02:46.810> second<00:02:47.530> circle

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
now the second rotation at second circle

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.160 
now the second rotation at second circle
is<00:02:48.010> our<00:02:48.160> rotation<00:02:48.730> circle<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:49.630> if<00:02:49.780> we<00:02:49.930> have

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
is our rotation circle so if we have

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.680 
is our rotation circle so if we have
turn<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:51.160> our<00:02:51.370> turn<00:02:51.640> can<00:02:52.000> turn<00:02:52.240> us<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.450> the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
turn so our turn can turn us to the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.300 
turn so our turn can turn us to the
right<00:02:52.840> or<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.200> left<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:53.650> if<00:02:53.740> we<00:02:53.860> turn<00:02:54.100> to

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
right or to the left so if we turn to

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.950 
right or to the left so if we turn to
the<00:02:54.400> right<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:55.650> we<00:02:56.650> can<00:02:56.800> turn<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.760> left

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
the right and we can turn to the left

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.350 
the right and we can turn to the left
now<00:02:58.960> you<00:02:58.990> can<00:02:59.320> see<00:02:59.620> that<00:03:00.160> we<00:03:00.340> can<00:03:00.550> just<00:03:00.580> fill<00:03:01.150> up

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
now you can see that we can just fill up

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.020 
now you can see that we can just fill up
this<00:03:01.600> circle<00:03:02.170> around<00:03:02.290> in<00:03:03.040> many<00:03:03.730> different

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
this circle around in many different

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.750 
this circle around in many different
ways<00:03:04.600> so<00:03:05.470> we<00:03:05.680> can<00:03:05.830> have<00:03:06.070> the<00:03:06.220> arms<00:03:06.700> just

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
ways so we can have the arms just

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.420 
ways so we can have the arms just
staying<00:03:07.270> out<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.840> side<00:03:08.140> we<00:03:08.710> can<00:03:08.920> curl<00:03:09.250> them

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
staying out to the side we can curl them

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.730 
staying out to the side we can curl them
in<00:03:09.580> so<00:03:09.850> they<00:03:10.030> can<00:03:10.090> curl<00:03:10.510> in<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.050> be<00:03:11.260> lower

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
in so they can curl in and be lower

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.190 
in so they can curl in and be lower
especially<00:03:12.520> in<00:03:12.940> a<00:03:13.030> tango<00:03:13.420> action<00:03:13.810> but<00:03:13.990> since

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
especially in a tango action but since

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.360 
especially in a tango action but since
we're<00:03:14.350> walking<00:03:14.620> you're<00:03:14.710> talking<00:03:14.950> about<00:03:15.070> walls

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
we're walking you're talking about walls

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.580 
we're walking you're talking about walls
today<00:03:15.610> we<00:03:16.300> can<00:03:16.480> have<00:03:16.630> our<00:03:16.660> arms<00:03:17.020> up<00:03:17.230> we<00:03:17.440> can

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
today we can have our arms up we can

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.520 
today we can have our arms up we can
take<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:17.920> over<00:03:18.100> our<00:03:18.520> head<00:03:18.940> so<00:03:19.630> we<00:03:19.840> can<00:03:19.990> turn<00:03:20.290> it

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
take it over our head so we can turn it

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
take it over our head so we can turn it
over<00:03:20.860> our<00:03:20.980> head

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
over our head

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.300 
over our head
anything<00:03:22.450> that<00:03:22.630> fills<00:03:22.930> up<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.650> circle<00:03:24.130> that's

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
anything that fills up the circle that's

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.460 
anything that fills up the circle that's
going<00:03:24.610> around<00:03:24.730> parallel<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.750> floor<00:03:25.990> so<00:03:26.350> it

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
going around parallel to the floor so it

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.240 
going around parallel to the floor so it
can<00:03:26.620> be<00:03:26.740> anywhere<00:03:27.280> any<00:03:28.060> range<00:03:28.570> any<00:03:29.170> range<00:03:29.920> from

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
can be anywhere any range any range from

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.940 
can be anywhere any range any range from
move<00:03:30.490> above<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.240> head<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.720> high<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.230> that

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
move above the head to high and that

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.500 
move above the head to high and that
covers<00:03:33.310> a<00:03:33.340> rotation<00:03:33.880> so<00:03:34.030> if<00:03:34.120> you're<00:03:34.240> doing

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
covers a rotation so if you're doing

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.690 
covers a rotation so if you're doing
lots<00:03:34.690> of<00:03:34.810> turns<00:03:35.080> you<00:03:35.410> can<00:03:35.980> finish<00:03:36.400> the

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
lots of turns you can finish the

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.810 
lots of turns you can finish the
rotation<00:03:36.850> all<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.690> way<00:03:37.810> up<00:03:38.080> with<00:03:38.890> both<00:03:39.640> of

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
rotation all the way up with both of

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.330 
rotation all the way up with both of
your<00:03:39.910> arms<00:03:39.970> or<00:03:40.390> you<00:03:40.930> can<00:03:41.080> take<00:03:41.350> it<00:03:41.530> all<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.740> way

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
your arms or you can take it all the way

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.180 
your arms or you can take it all the way
down<00:03:42.370> with<00:03:43.330> both<00:03:43.510> of<00:03:43.750> your<00:03:43.840> arms<00:03:44.140> and<00:03:44.350> it's

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
down with both of your arms and it's

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.010 
down with both of your arms and it's
just<00:03:45.460> as<00:03:45.550> appropriate<00:03:45.820> for<00:03:46.270> the<00:03:46.330> man<00:03:46.570> to<00:03:46.750> have

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
just as appropriate for the man to have

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.350 
just as appropriate for the man to have
his<00:03:47.230> arms<00:03:47.590> over<00:03:47.860> his<00:03:48.400> head<00:03:48.670> as<00:03:48.820> it<00:03:48.940> is<00:03:49.090> for<00:03:49.270> the

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
his arms over his head as it is for the

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.680 
his arms over his head as it is for the
lady

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
lady

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.140 
lady
yeah<00:03:49.960> it<00:03:50.020> just<00:03:50.200> depends<00:03:50.620> on<00:03:50.740> the<00:03:50.860> step<00:03:51.100> so<00:03:51.910> now

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
yeah it just depends on the step so now

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.740 
yeah it just depends on the step so now
last<00:03:52.600> Circle<00:03:53.050> is<00:03:53.200> this<00:03:53.590> way<00:03:53.940> okay<00:03:54.940> so<00:03:55.480> when

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
last Circle is this way okay so when

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.410 
last Circle is this way okay so when
we're<00:03:55.900> swaying<00:03:56.230> our<00:03:56.740> hips<00:03:57.250> a<00:03:57.460> tilting<00:03:58.030> from

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
we're swaying our hips a tilting from

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.780 
we're swaying our hips a tilting from
side<00:03:58.690> to<00:03:58.720> side<00:03:59.140> now<00:03:59.440> when<00:04:00.340> we're<00:04:00.490> doing<00:04:00.580> the

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
side to side now when we're doing the

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.780 
side to side now when we're doing the
sway<00:04:01.090> circle<00:04:01.720> okay<00:04:02.650> let's<00:04:03.100> just<00:04:03.340> take<00:04:03.490> one

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
sway circle okay let's just take one

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.610 
sway circle okay let's just take one
circle<00:04:04.330> at<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.510> time<00:04:04.750> so<00:04:04.990> we'll<00:04:05.140> just<00:04:05.260> take<00:04:05.440> our

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
circle at a time so we'll just take our

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.770 
circle at a time so we'll just take our
right<00:04:05.980> arm<00:04:06.250> and<00:04:06.490> do<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.150> circle<00:04:07.540> with<00:04:07.660> the

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
right arm and do the circle with the

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.630 
right arm and do the circle with the
right<00:04:07.960> arm<00:04:08.140> you<00:04:08.200> can<00:04:08.380> see<00:04:08.560> as<00:04:08.740> the<00:04:08.890> hip<00:04:09.070> lifts

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
right arm you can see as the hip lifts

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.640 
right arm you can see as the hip lifts
it<00:04:09.940> lifts<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:10.570> arm<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:10.990> as<00:04:11.080> at<00:04:11.200> low<00:04:11.380> as<00:04:11.530> it

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
it lifts the arm and as at low as it

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.170 
it lifts the arm and as at low as it
brings<00:04:11.830> it<00:04:12.040> back<00:04:12.070> down<00:04:12.400> we<00:04:12.550> can<00:04:12.700> take<00:04:12.880> it<00:04:12.970> all

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
brings it back down we can take it all

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.170 
brings it back down we can take it all
the<00:04:13.210> way<00:04:13.480> up<00:04:13.510> and<00:04:13.960> over<00:04:14.950> and<00:04:15.130> then<00:04:15.670> catch<00:04:15.910> it<00:04:16.060> on

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
the way up and over and then catch it on

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.580 
the way up and over and then catch it on
the<00:04:16.270> other<00:04:16.359> side<00:04:16.630> to<00:04:16.780> bring<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.080> all<00:04:17.200> the<00:04:17.470> way

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
the other side to bring it all the way

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.860 
the other side to bring it all the way
up<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:17.980> over<00:04:18.310> again<00:04:18.400> on<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:19.359> other<00:04:19.510> side

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
up and over again on the other side

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.170 
up and over again on the other side
right<00:04:20.109> so<00:04:21.070> again<00:04:21.220> this<00:04:21.520> can<00:04:21.730> be<00:04:21.790> done<00:04:21.880> in

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
right so again this can be done in

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.150 
right so again this can be done in
different<00:04:22.570> sizes<00:04:22.810> it<00:04:23.200> could<00:04:23.350> be<00:04:23.440> done<00:04:23.650> smaller

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
different sizes it could be done smaller

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.930 
different sizes it could be done smaller
to<00:04:24.610> bigger<00:04:24.640> okay<00:04:25.770> bigger<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:27.160> smaller<00:04:27.190> actions

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
to bigger okay bigger to smaller actions

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.440 
to bigger okay bigger to smaller actions
but<00:04:28.810> it's<00:04:28.960> still<00:04:29.290> on<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.620> same<00:04:29.940> circle<00:04:30.940> axis

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
but it's still on the same circle axis

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.119 
but it's still on the same circle axis
we<00:04:32.380> can<00:04:32.560> combine

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:33.129 
we can combine

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:34.679 
we can combine
all<00:04:33.189> of<00:04:33.369> these<00:04:33.520> together<00:04:33.789> -<00:04:34.179> and<00:04:34.389> that's<00:04:34.539> when

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:34.689 
all of these together - and that's when

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:36.269 
all of these together - and that's when
you<00:04:34.809> start<00:04:35.080> getting<00:04:35.169> really<00:04:35.319> creative<00:04:35.770> shapes

00:04:36.269 --> 00:04:36.279 
you start getting really creative shapes

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:37.889 
you start getting really creative shapes
but<00:04:36.520> what<00:04:36.699> we're<00:04:36.849> trying<00:04:37.029> to<00:04:37.149> emphasize<00:04:37.569> here

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:37.899 
but what we're trying to emphasize here

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:40.199 
but what we're trying to emphasize here
is<00:04:38.080> there's<00:04:38.770> base<00:04:39.039> technique<00:04:39.639> that's<00:04:39.879> going

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:40.209 
is there's base technique that's going

00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:43.079 
is there's base technique that's going
on<00:04:40.419> you<00:04:41.050> want<00:04:41.289> to<00:04:41.409> try<00:04:41.769> and<00:04:41.919> reflect<00:04:42.309> that<00:04:42.819> base

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:43.089 
on you want to try and reflect that base

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:45.989 
on you want to try and reflect that base
technique<00:04:43.479> and<00:04:43.739> amplify<00:04:44.739> it<00:04:44.769> into<00:04:45.729> a<00:04:45.759> bigger

00:04:45.989 --> 00:04:45.999 
technique and amplify it into a bigger

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:48.479 
technique and amplify it into a bigger
shape<00:04:46.269> because<00:04:46.779> we're<00:04:46.929> not<00:04:47.080> restricted<00:04:47.709> to

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:48.489 
shape because we're not restricted to

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:51.949 
shape because we're not restricted to
close<00:04:48.789> frame<00:04:49.239> we<00:04:49.869> can<00:04:50.019> open<00:04:50.289> up<00:04:50.679> and<00:04:51.039> show<00:04:51.759> a

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:51.959 
close frame we can open up and show a

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:55.139 
close frame we can open up and show a
magnified<00:04:52.959> version<00:04:53.379> of<00:04:53.889> what's<00:04:54.489> going<00:04:54.879> on<00:04:55.029> in

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:55.149 
magnified version of what's going on in

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:57.449 
magnified version of what's going on in
the<00:04:55.269> base
