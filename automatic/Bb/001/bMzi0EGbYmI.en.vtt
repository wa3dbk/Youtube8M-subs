that the Agartha player used against me

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.049 
that the Agartha player used against me
and<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.380> was<00:00:37.680> something<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.790> wanted<00:00:38.879> to

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
and that was something that I wanted to

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.430 
and that was something that I wanted to
tinker<00:00:39.480> with<00:00:39.510> now<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.079> see<00:00:40.230> if<00:00:40.290> other

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
tinker with now and see if other

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.119 
tinker with now and see if other
factions<00:00:41.010> could<00:00:41.219> reproduce<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.660> any<00:00:43.129> any

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
factions could reproduce it to any any

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.100 
factions could reproduce it to any any
different<00:00:44.550> extent<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.420> I'm<00:00:45.629> using<00:00:45.780> light

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
different extent so I'm using light

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.080 
different extent so I'm using light
focus<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.680> time<00:00:46.920> which<00:00:47.070> don't<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.700> as<00:00:47.910> much

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
focus this time which don't have as much

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.220 
focus this time which don't have as much
armor<00:00:48.800> as<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.489> battery<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:51.600> still<00:00:51.899> a

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
armor as the battery is but still a

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.430 
armor as the battery is but still a
fairly<00:00:53.000> resistant<00:00:54.000> unit<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.960> then<00:00:55.320> I've<00:00:55.410> used

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
fairly resistant unit and then I've used

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.260 
fairly resistant unit and then I've used
Egyptian<00:00:56.190> pikemen<00:00:56.789> which<00:00:56.910> are<00:00:57.030> actually

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
Egyptian pikemen which are actually

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.000 
Egyptian pikemen which are actually
probably<00:00:57.570> even<00:00:57.719> better<00:00:58.050> than<00:00:58.320> levy<00:00:58.500> pikemen

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
probably even better than levy pikemen

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.340 
probably even better than levy pikemen
and<00:00:59.370> what<00:00:59.670> they<00:00:59.820> do<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.239> put<00:01:00.870> my<00:01:00.899> general<00:01:01.289> in

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
and what they do I put my general in

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.959

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
one on each flank again just to try and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.870 
one on each flank again just to try and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
draw enemy units into a bad position so

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.240 
draw enemy units into a bad position so
when<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:27.900> started<00:01:28.380> my<00:01:28.439> opponent<00:01:28.890> was<00:01:28.979> all<00:01:29.100> in

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
when I started my opponent was all in

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.310 
when I started my opponent was all in
one<00:01:29.430> long<00:01:29.640> line<00:01:29.670> here<00:01:30.210> eddied<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:30.900> at<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> same

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
one long line here eddied up at the same

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.719 
one long line here eddied up at the same
time<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.560> did<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.159> don't<00:01:32.189> think<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.700> I

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
time I did so I don't think that I

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.520 
time I did so I don't think that I
readied<00:01:33.030> up<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.329> caught<00:01:33.479> him<00:01:33.630> off<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.170> don't

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
readied up and caught him off I don't

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.990 
readied up and caught him off I don't
know<00:01:34.710> if<00:01:34.770> he<00:01:34.860> just<00:01:35.009> wasn't<00:01:35.189> ready<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.520> go<00:01:35.759> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
know if he just wasn't ready to go and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.460 
know if he just wasn't ready to go and
he<00:01:36.090> starts<00:01:36.150> running<00:01:36.390> towards<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.020> back<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.439> I

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
he starts running towards the back and I

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.020 
he starts running towards the back and I
think<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:37.770> more<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.430> get<00:01:38.549> formed<00:01:38.909> up

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
think it's more so just to get formed up

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.490 
think it's more so just to get formed up
because<00:01:39.360> he<00:01:39.479> doesn't<00:01:39.509> do<00:01:39.930> any<00:01:40.110> kind<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.350> red

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
because he doesn't do any kind of red

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.530 
because he doesn't do any kind of red
line<00:01:40.710> camping<00:01:41.130> or<00:01:41.250> anything<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.240> I'm<00:01:42.360> not<00:01:42.479> sure

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
line camping or anything so I'm not sure

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.020 
line camping or anything so I'm not sure
again<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.409> think<00:01:43.680> he<00:01:43.799> was<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.100> not<00:01:44.549> ready<00:01:44.729> to

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
again I think he was just not ready to

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.760 
again I think he was just not ready to
push<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.689> button<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.049> he<00:01:46.140> did<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.500> then<00:01:46.590> got

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
push that button and he did and then got

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.350 
push that button and he did and then got
caught<00:01:46.920> off<00:01:47.070> guard<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.430> he<00:01:47.729> just<00:01:47.909> starts<00:01:48.240> to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
caught off guard so he just starts to

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.120 
caught off guard so he just starts to
form<00:01:48.600> up<00:01:48.689> his<00:01:48.810> troops<00:01:49.079> here<00:01:49.320> he's<00:01:49.829> brought<00:01:50.040> an

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
form up his troops here he's brought an

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.190 
form up his troops here he's brought an
extremely<00:01:50.670> infantry<00:01:51.180> heavy<00:01:51.360> army<00:01:51.750> kind<00:01:52.110> of

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
extremely infantry heavy army kind of

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.410 
extremely infantry heavy army kind of
like<00:01:52.320> he<00:01:52.439> did<00:01:52.590> last<00:01:52.619> time<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:54.180> will<00:01:54.329> be

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
like he did last time so this will be

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.690 
like he did last time so this will be
interesting<00:01:54.990> because<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.770> get<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.280> test<00:01:56.490> this

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
interesting because I get to test this

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.920 
interesting because I get to test this
army<00:01:57.030> out<00:01:57.119> against<00:01:57.360> someone<00:01:57.600> who's<00:01:57.719> come

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
infantry heavy so he's got substantially

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.840 
infantry heavy so he's got substantially
more<00:02:00.869> infantry<00:02:01.439> than<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.680> do

a lot more and it's better quality for

infantry engagements in this game and

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:47.149 
infantry engagements in this game and
once<00:05:45.389> patch<00:05:45.690> 9<00:05:46.020> first<00:05:46.349> came<00:05:46.620> out<00:05:46.710> I<00:05:46.770> think<00:05:46.919> we

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
once patch 9 first came out I think we

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:48.950

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
were seeing a lot more infantry being

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.439 
were seeing a lot more infantry being
used<00:05:49.289> because<00:05:50.009> cavalry<00:05:50.669> was<00:05:51.000> kind<00:05:51.330> of

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
used because cavalry was kind of

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:53.270 
used because cavalry was kind of
somewhat<00:05:51.840> nerfed<00:05:52.199> towards<00:05:52.740> infantry<00:05:53.159> it's

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
somewhat nerfed towards infantry it's

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.920 
somewhat nerfed towards infantry it's
not<00:05:53.400> quite<00:05:53.699> as<00:05:53.849> good<00:05:53.909> against<00:05:54.389> infantry<00:05:54.449> as<00:05:54.810> it

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
not quite as good against infantry as it

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.600 
not quite as good against infantry as it
used<00:05:55.080> to<00:05:55.169> be<00:05:55.320> and<00:05:55.590> a<00:05:56.010> lot<00:05:56.039> of<00:05:56.219> people<00:05:56.430> thought

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
used to be and a lot of people thought

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.950 
used to be and a lot of people thought
that<00:05:56.820> that<00:05:56.940> meant<00:05:57.180> oh<00:05:57.330> it's<00:05:57.539> gonna<00:05:57.690> be<00:05:57.779> an<00:05:57.900> all

I think<00:05:59.309> with<00:05:59.430> the<00:05:59.520> realization<00:05:59.849> that<00:06:00.210> the

00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:00.809 
I think with the realization that the

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:03.320 
I think with the realization that the
javelins<00:06:01.499> can<00:06:01.830> mow<00:06:02.069> down<00:06:02.279> entire<00:06:02.339> armies<00:06:03.180> of

heavy infantry people are coming javelin

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
heavy and just supporting them with

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.920 
heavy and just supporting them with
massive<00:06:07.529> units<00:06:07.889> like<00:06:08.039> elephants<00:06:08.610> and<00:06:09.599> and<00:06:09.899> I

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
massive units like elephants and and I

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.439 
massive units like elephants and and I
kind<00:06:10.139> of<00:06:10.199> think<00:06:10.379> in<00:06:10.860> chariots<00:06:11.520> I<00:06:11.759> mean<00:06:12.210> look<00:06:12.389> at

kind of think in chariots I mean look at

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:16.010 
kind of think in chariots I mean look at
that<00:06:12.830> 300<00:06:13.830> kills<00:06:14.159> on<00:06:14.430> the<00:06:14.460> side<00:06:14.729> chariots<00:06:15.300> so
