had some reservations about the driving
position<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.460> visibility<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.740> to<00:01:13.740> some

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
position the visibility and to some

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.530 
position the visibility and to some
extent<00:01:14.219> the<00:01:14.280> interior<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.909> car<00:01:15.119> but<00:01:15.360> I've

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
extent the interior of the car but I've

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.209 
extent the interior of the car but I've
been<00:01:15.869> saying<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.290> for<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.439> little<00:01:16.590> while<00:01:16.860> and

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:17.219 
been saying it for a little while and

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:20.420 
been saying it for a little while and
the<00:01:18.180> initial<00:01:19.140> qualms<00:01:19.590> about<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.890> visibility

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
the initial qualms about the visibility

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.160 
the initial qualms about the visibility
in<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.549> position<00:01:20.939> I'm<00:01:21.210> fairly<00:01:21.930> comfortable

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
in the position I'm fairly comfortable

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.760 
in the position I'm fairly comfortable
now<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.180> think<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.600> car<00:01:24.899> is<00:01:24.930> quite

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
now and I think that this car is quite

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.020 
now and I think that this car is quite
good<00:01:26.070> value<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.399> the<00:01:26.579> money<00:01:26.610> menu

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
good value for the money menu

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.330 
good value for the money menu
considering<00:01:27.479> there's<00:01:27.630> about<00:01:27.810> over<00:01:28.500> 29,000

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
considering there's about over 29,000

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.609 
considering there's about over 29,000
pounds<00:01:29.520> brand-new<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.899> this<00:01:31.140> could<00:01:31.350> be<00:01:31.439> yours

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
pounds brand-new and this could be yours

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.410 
pounds brand-new and this could be yours
for<00:01:31.740> somewhere<00:01:32.100> around<00:01:32.250> about<00:01:32.520> 20<00:01:32.789> to<00:01:32.909> 22<00:01:33.240> and

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
for somewhere around about 20 to 22 and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.920 
for somewhere around about 20 to 22 and
a<00:01:33.450> half

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
a half

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.990 
a half
pounds<00:01:34.440> it's<00:01:35.100> done<00:01:35.340> slightly<00:01:35.580> above<00:01:35.880> average

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
pounds it's done slightly above average

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.430 
pounds it's done slightly above average
mileage<00:01:36.420> but<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.810> think<00:01:37.080> it's<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.230> pretty<00:01:37.380> good

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
mileage but I think it's a pretty good

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.930 
mileage but I think it's a pretty good
price<00:01:37.680> what<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:37.980> think<00:01:38.160> it's<00:01:38.580> another<00:01:38.760> bad

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
price what do you think it's another bad

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.340 
price what do you think it's another bad
price<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.390> mileage<00:01:39.690> is<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.320> that

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
price the mileage is and in that

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.470 
price the mileage is and in that
direction<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.250> still<00:01:41.430> not<00:01:41.580> excessive

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
direction but it's still not excessive

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.240 
direction but it's still not excessive
what<00:01:43.380> do<00:01:43.440> you<00:01:43.500> think<00:01:43.650> about<00:01:43.800> the<00:01:43.920> way<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.190> it

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
what do you think about the way that it

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.370 
what do you think about the way that it
drives<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.030> mean<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.300> power<00:01:45.510> of<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> steering

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
drives I mean the power of the steering

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.320 
drives I mean the power of the steering
and<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.560> gearbox<00:01:46.800> handling<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:47.970> POW<00:01:48.150> is

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
and the gearbox handling the POW is

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.150 
and the gearbox handling the POW is
great<00:01:48.540> once<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.960> turbo<00:01:49.290> starts<00:01:49.710> spinning<00:01:50.040> it

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
great once the turbo starts spinning it

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.620 
great once the turbo starts spinning it
really<00:01:50.520> does<00:01:50.670> pick<00:01:50.850> up<00:01:51.030> when<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:51.510> you

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
really does pick up when it's like you

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.050 
really does pick up when it's like you
could<00:01:51.780> kick<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.229> back<00:01:52.410> and<00:01:53.060> steering's

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
could kick in the back and steering's

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.880 
could kick in the back and steering's
nice<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.450> solid<00:01:54.690> and<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.140> sits<00:01:55.500> very<00:01:55.619> nicely

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
nice and solid and it sits very nicely

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.609 
nice and solid and it sits very nicely
on<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> road<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.180> turn<00:01:57.420> them<00:01:57.619> really

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
on the road you just turn them really

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.230 
on the road you just turn them really
hard<00:01:58.830> and<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.280> just<00:01:59.430> dripped<00:01:59.820> great<00:02:00.000> great

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
hard and it just dripped great great

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.010 
hard and it just dripped great great
right<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.630> way<00:02:00.720> through<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.080> band<00:02:01.260> fantastic
