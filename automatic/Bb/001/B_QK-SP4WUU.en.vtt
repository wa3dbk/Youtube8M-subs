hey guys I'm going to do a narration on
my<00:00:09.130> minecraft<00:00:09.520> Mayan<00:00:10.180> temple<00:00:10.570> I<00:00:11.160> created<00:00:12.160> a

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:12.460 
my minecraft Mayan temple I created a

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.900 
my minecraft Mayan temple I created a
video<00:00:13.470> with<00:00:14.470> a<00:00:14.849> video<00:00:15.849> maker<00:00:16.090> obviously<00:00:17.080> and

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
video with a video maker obviously and

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.840 
video with a video maker obviously and
the<00:00:18.910> sound<00:00:19.720> was<00:00:20.140> out<00:00:20.320> of<00:00:20.500> sync<00:00:20.770> and<00:00:21.100> it<00:00:21.760> was

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:21.850 
the sound was out of sync and it was

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.740 
the sound was out of sync and it was
slightly<00:00:22.740> slow<00:00:23.740> so<00:00:24.160> I<00:00:24.190> had<00:00:24.490> to<00:00:24.670> speed<00:00:25.539> it<00:00:25.660> up

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
slightly slow so I had to speed it up

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.859 
slightly slow so I had to speed it up
with<00:00:25.930> a<00:00:25.960> program<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.689> everything<00:00:28.689> might<00:00:28.840> be

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
with a program and everything might be

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.259 
with a program and everything might be
going<00:00:29.230> really<00:00:29.439> fast<00:00:29.800> on<00:00:30.279> the<00:00:30.850> video<00:00:31.060> right<00:00:31.240> now

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
going really fast on the video right now

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.439 
going really fast on the video right now
so<00:00:32.010> could<00:00:33.010> obviously<00:00:33.340> see<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:33.820> rendering

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
so could obviously see the rendering

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.390 
so could obviously see the rendering
it's<00:00:34.809> taking<00:00:35.229> a<00:00:35.320> while<00:00:35.350> but<00:00:35.890> the<00:00:36.129> video<00:00:36.370> is

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
it's taking a while but the video is

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.530 
it's taking a while but the video is
going<00:00:36.699> super<00:00:36.909> fast

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
going super fast

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.079
