00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
yep that's good so uh one thing I just

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.789 
yep that's good so uh one thing I just
want<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.520> mention<00:01:02.820> before<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.120> get<00:01:03.239> started

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
want to mention before we get started

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.679 
want to mention before we get started
you<00:01:04.799> should<00:01:04.830> consider<00:01:05.489> scaling<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.450> in

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
you should consider scaling it in

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.480 
you should consider scaling it in
another<00:01:07.260> animation<00:01:07.770> program<00:01:08.100> before<00:01:08.400> you

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
another animation program before you

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.920 
another animation program before you
import<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.939> into<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.240> Unreal<00:01:09.600> Engine<00:01:09.750> 4

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
import it into the Unreal Engine 4

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.050 
import it into the Unreal Engine 4
because<00:01:10.920> once<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.280> import<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:11.850> just

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
because once you import it it's just

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.640 
because once you import it it's just
going<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.390> keep<00:01:12.600> locked<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.439> certain

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
going to keep locked on to a certain

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.679 
going to keep locked on to a certain
scale<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.610> will<00:01:14.790> not<00:01:14.970> look<00:01:15.210> good<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.479> your

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
scale so it will not look good on your

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.469 
scale so it will not look good on your
character<00:01:16.049> if<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.229> do<00:01:16.350> not<00:01:16.500> scale<00:01:16.950> it

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
character if you do not scale it

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.280
