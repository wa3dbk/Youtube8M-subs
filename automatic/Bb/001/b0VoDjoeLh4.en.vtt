00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:15.349 
the time maybe we don't refer to it

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.260 
the time maybe we don't refer to it
necessarily<00:00:15.679> and<00:00:15.889> the<00:00:16.009> shehnai<00:00:16.279> turn<00:00:16.580> but<00:00:17.119> it

necessarily and the shehnai turn but it

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.179 
necessarily and the shehnai turn but it
is<00:00:17.419> also<00:00:17.689> and<00:00:18.050> the<00:00:18.110> reason<00:00:18.410> we<00:00:18.500> questioning<00:00:19.009> a

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
is also and the reason we questioning a

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.010 
is also and the reason we questioning a
mission<00:00:19.520> name<00:00:19.640> in<00:00:19.790> French<00:00:20.029> means<00:00:20.300> chin<00:00:20.720> or<00:00:21.399> the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 
mission name in French means chin or the

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.420 
mission name in French means chin or the
continuous<00:00:24.020> movement<00:00:24.290> are<00:00:24.770> the<00:00:24.919> same<00:00:25.160> thing

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
continuous movement are the same thing

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.409 
continuous movement are the same thing
okay<00:00:25.910> so<00:00:27.369> I'm<00:00:28.369> gonna<00:00:28.579> make<00:00:28.790> it<00:00:28.910> as<00:00:29.059> easy<00:00:29.300> as

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
okay so I'm gonna make it as easy as

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:30.519 
okay so I'm gonna make it as easy as
possible<00:00:29.570> for<00:00:30.110> you

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
possible for you

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.589 
possible for you

1 &amp; 2 1 &amp; 2

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.029 
1 &amp; 2 1 &amp; 2
whether<00:01:30.950> it<00:01:31.069> is<00:01:31.100> those<00:01:31.999> before<00:01:32.450> okay<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.469> we're

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
whether it is those before okay so we're

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.590 
whether it is those before okay so we're
good<00:01:34.159> at<00:01:34.249> this<00:01:34.279> and<00:01:34.700> you<00:01:34.909> can<00:01:34.999> do<00:01:35.149> it<00:01:35.179> sideways

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
good at this and you can do it sideways

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.330 
good at this and you can do it sideways
you<00:01:35.779> can<00:01:36.079> do<00:01:36.289> to<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:36.529> front<00:01:36.679> you<00:01:36.950> can<00:01:37.100> do<00:01:37.219> it<00:01:37.279> to

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
you can do to the front you can do it to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.010 
you can do to the front you can do it to
the<00:01:37.459> back<00:01:37.579> so<00:01:38.119> how<00:01:38.270> about<00:01:38.329> you<00:01:38.509> toggle<00:01:38.779> and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
the back so how about you toggle and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.889 
the back so how about you toggle and
then<00:01:39.289> it<00:01:39.380> would<00:01:39.499> step<00:01:39.679> to<00:01:39.709> the<00:01:39.889> side<00:01:40.100> 1<00:01:40.819> &amp;<00:01:41.090> 2<00:01:41.600> but

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
then it would step to the side 1 &amp; 2 but

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.169 
then it would step to the side 1 &amp; 2 but
instead<00:01:42.709> of<00:01:42.770> positive<00:01:43.159> I<00:01:43.279> can<00:01:43.459> just<00:01:43.639> did<00:01:43.819> you

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
instead of positive I can just did you

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:45.609 
instead of positive I can just did you
keep<00:01:44.389> on<00:01:44.600> going<00:01:44.990> this<00:01:45.079> one<00:01:45.259> we<00:01:45.350> call<00:01:45.469> this

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
exactly the same as the toe turn no

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.779 
exactly the same as the toe turn no
because<00:02:08.660> it<00:02:08.780> just<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:09.349> turn<00:02:09.649> you<00:02:10.220> just<00:02:10.250> step

still<00:02:38.520> find<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.880> count<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.720> movement<00:02:40.170> of

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
still find a count in the movement of

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.980 
still find a count in the movement of
the<00:02:40.560> dancer<00:02:41.010> okay<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:42.120> that's<00:02:42.360> why<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> person

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
the dancer okay so that's why a person

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.660 
the dancer okay so that's why a person
likes<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.230> call<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.590> more<00:02:43.800> like<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.040> 3-step

likes to call it more like a 3-step

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.270 
likes to call it more like a 3-step
because<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.150> really<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.930> 100<00:02:46.770> percent<00:02:47.070> of<00:02:47.220> the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280
