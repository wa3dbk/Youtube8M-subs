00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
so a few people have been under the

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.160 
so a few people have been under the
impression<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.460> Microsoft<00:00:12.179> has<00:00:12.570> given<00:00:12.690> up

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
impression that Microsoft has given up

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.910 
impression that Microsoft has given up
on<00:00:13.440> Kinect<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.719> they<00:00:15.719> felt<00:00:16.109> like<00:00:16.350> they<00:00:16.650> did

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
on Kinect and they felt like they did

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.730 
on Kinect and they felt like they did
that<00:00:17.160> as<00:00:17.520> soon<00:00:18.210> as<00:00:18.390> they<00:00:18.600> unbundled<00:00:19.380> the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
that as soon as they unbundled the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.540 
that as soon as they unbundled the
device<00:00:20.070> from<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.090> Xbox<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.250> you<00:00:23.250> know<00:00:23.340> during

the holiday season the Xbox without

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.130 
the holiday season the Xbox without
Kinect<00:00:26.099> was<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.970> one<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.480> saw<00:00:27.720> really

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
Kinect was the one that you saw really

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.389 
Kinect was the one that you saw really
being<00:00:28.380> promoted<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.160> advertised<00:00:30.230> so<00:00:31.399> you

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
being promoted and advertised so you

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.889 
being promoted and advertised so you
know<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.669> haven't<00:00:32.880> heard<00:00:33.090> much<00:00:33.270> about<00:00:33.300> Kinect

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
know we haven't heard much about Kinect

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.260 
know we haven't heard much about Kinect
we<00:00:34.110> haven't<00:00:34.500> been<00:00:34.649> talking<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.399> lot<00:00:35.550> about<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
we haven't been talking a lot about the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.840 
we haven't been talking a lot about the
features<00:00:36.719> recently<00:00:37.500> since<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.070> reveal<00:00:38.460> and

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
features recently since the reveal and

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.420 
features recently since the reveal and
since<00:00:39.180> everybody<00:00:39.540> shamed<00:00:40.110> Microsoft<00:00:40.739> for

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
since everybody shamed Microsoft for

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.610 
since everybody shamed Microsoft for
doing<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.390> I've<00:00:42.930> never<00:00:42.989> been<00:00:43.440> one<00:00:43.590> of

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
doing it but I've never been one of

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.380 
doing it but I've never been one of
those<00:00:43.800> who<00:00:43.860> believe<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.399> Microsoft<00:00:45.090> was

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
those who believe that Microsoft was

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.319 
those who believe that Microsoft was
going<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.230> let<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.010> go<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.820> think<00:00:48.090> this

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
going to just let it go and I think this

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.119 
going to just let it go and I think this
may<00:00:48.570> be<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.930> year<00:00:48.960> why<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.620> learned<00:00:49.890> why

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
may be the year why we learned why

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.939 
may be the year why we learned why
Microsoft<00:00:50.539> originally<00:00:51.539> felt<00:00:51.870> then<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.739> was

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
Microsoft originally felt then it was

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.479 
Microsoft originally felt then it was
integral<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:55.050> part<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.559> your

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
integral to have this be part of your

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.369 
integral to have this be part of your
system<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.180> I've<00:00:57.300> got<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> couple<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:58.079> news

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
system so I've got a couple of news

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.069 
system so I've got a couple of news
items<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:59.280> we<00:01:00.120> are<00:01:00.239> going<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.629> talking

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
items that we are going to be talking

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.260 
items that we are going to be talking
about<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.440> kind<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.649> backs<00:01:01.949> up<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.789> theory

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
about that kind of backs up this theory

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.090 
about that kind of backs up this theory
that<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.690> year<00:01:04.110> may<00:01:04.290> be<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.589> year<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.830> we

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that this year may be the year that we

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.820 
that this year may be the year that we
learn<00:01:05.309> more<00:01:05.580> about<00:01:06.140> Kinect<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.380> its

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
learn more about Kinect and its

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.520 
learn more about Kinect and its
possibilities<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.180> first<00:01:09.390> up<00:01:09.600> Microsoft

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
possibilities so the first up Microsoft

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.070 
possibilities so the first up Microsoft
just<00:01:10.799> put<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.580> new<00:01:11.610> job<00:01:12.150> posting<00:01:12.689> looking

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
structure which is pretty strict so it

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.789 
structure which is pretty strict so it
could<00:03:45.310> be<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.549> play<00:03:46.060> on<00:03:46.389> that<00:03:46.689> or<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:47.650> know

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.379

maybe the official twitter account is

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.719 
maybe the official twitter account is

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:13.689 
different pieces of software and devices

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.749 
different pieces of software and devices
that's<00:04:14.349> why<00:04:14.500> you're<00:04:14.739> having<00:04:14.889> the<00:04:15.219> avatar

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:15.759 
that's why you're having the avatar

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:19.199 
that's why you're having the avatar
system<00:04:16.209> trying<00:04:16.870> to<00:04:17.049> be<00:04:17.169> crossbred<00:04:17.889> with<00:04:18.209> like

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
system trying to be crossbred with like

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.899 
system trying to be crossbred with like
Android<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.199> iOS<00:04:20.409> devices<00:04:21.159> that<00:04:21.519> was<00:04:21.699> talked

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:21.909 
Android and iOS devices that was talked

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:23.850 
Android and iOS devices that was talked
about<00:04:22.150> just<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.510> other<00:04:22.630> day<00:04:22.750> in<00:04:23.169> a<00:04:23.500> video<00:04:23.800> that

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
about just the other day in a video that

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.700 
about just the other day in a video that
I<00:04:24.070> did<00:04:24.270> so<00:04:25.270> it<00:04:25.449> would<00:04:25.570> make<00:04:25.750> sense<00:04:26.020> for

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
I did so it would make sense for

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.189 
I did so it would make sense for
Cortana<00:04:27.130> to<00:04:27.580> come<00:04:27.789> to<00:04:27.970> Xbox<00:04:28.449> especially<00:04:28.990> since

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
Cortana to come to Xbox especially since

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.439 
Cortana to come to Xbox especially since
you<00:04:29.410> talk<00:04:29.650> to<00:04:29.800> your<00:04:29.919> xbox<00:04:30.160> so<00:04:30.759> I<00:04:30.789> do<00:04:30.910> think<00:04:31.330> that

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
you talk to your xbox so I do think that

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.809 
you talk to your xbox so I do think that
it's<00:04:31.630> a<00:04:31.810> given<00:04:32.259> that<00:04:32.530> it<00:04:32.710> is<00:04:32.860> going<00:04:33.160> to<00:04:33.400> show<00:04:33.610> up

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:33.819 
it's a given that it is going to show up

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.680 
it's a given that it is going to show up
and<00:04:34.060> probably<00:04:34.800> sooner<00:04:35.800> rather<00:04:36.220> than<00:04:36.400> later

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
and probably sooner rather than later

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.020 
and probably sooner rather than later
and<00:04:37.690> last<00:04:38.080> year<00:04:38.440> just<00:04:38.740> before<00:04:38.949> e3<00:04:39.370> a<00:04:39.699> Twitter

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
and last year just before e3 a Twitter

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.150 
and last year just before e3 a Twitter
user<00:04:40.300> asked<00:04:40.720> Phil<00:04:40.900> Spencer<00:04:41.169> if<00:04:41.530> we<00:04:41.889> could

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
user asked Phil Spencer if we could

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.390 
user asked Phil Spencer if we could
expect<00:04:42.639> to<00:04:42.789> see<00:04:43.030> Cortana<00:04:43.539> for<00:04:44.319> Xbox<00:04:44.770> one<00:04:44.919> and

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
expect to see Cortana for Xbox one and

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.120 
expect to see Cortana for Xbox one and
III<00:04:45.910> now<00:04:46.180> remember<00:04:46.539> this<00:04:46.690> is<00:04:46.870> III<00:04:47.440> this<00:04:47.830> past

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
III now remember this is III this past

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.300 
III now remember this is III this past
III<00:04:48.699> and<00:04:48.880> Phil<00:04:49.569> said<00:04:49.930> they<00:04:50.349> actually<00:04:50.590> had<00:04:51.160> an

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
III and Phil said they actually had an

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.480 
III and Phil said they actually had an
idea<00:04:51.699> to<00:04:51.970> use<00:04:52.240> Cortana<00:04:52.720> during<00:04:53.259> the<00:04:53.380> show<00:04:53.650> but

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
idea to use Cortana during the show but

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.029 
idea to use Cortana during the show but
decided<00:04:55.030> against<00:04:55.479> it<00:04:55.630> so<00:04:55.960> they<00:04:56.530> could<00:04:56.889> have

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
decided against it so they could have

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.999 
decided against it so they could have
played<00:04:57.550> that<00:04:57.729> card<00:04:57.970> apparently<00:04:58.720> back<00:04:59.650> last

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
played that card apparently back last

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.089 
played that card apparently back last
year<00:05:00.280> but<00:05:00.520> this<00:05:01.360> year<00:05:01.419> could<00:05:02.050> be<00:05:02.259> a<00:05:02.440> little<00:05:02.889> bit

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099 
year but this year could be a little bit

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:05.879 
year but this year could be a little bit
different<00:05:03.639> and<00:05:04.090> then<00:05:05.080> you've<00:05:05.259> got<00:05:05.470> several

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
different and then you've got several

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.159 
different and then you've got several
stories<00:05:06.340> pumping<00:05:06.759> up<00:05:06.880> recently<00:05:07.090> also<00:05:07.720> about

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
stories pumping up recently also about

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.469 
stories pumping up recently also about
Microsoft's<00:05:08.949> getting<00:05:09.699> ready<00:05:09.910> to<00:05:10.180> unveil

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
Microsoft's getting ready to unveil

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.810 
Microsoft's getting ready to unveil
their<00:05:11.440> virtual<00:05:12.039> reality<00:05:12.639> or<00:05:12.789> augmented

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
their virtual reality or augmented

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.219 
their virtual reality or augmented
reality<00:05:13.830> technology<00:05:14.830> which<00:05:15.820> you<00:05:16.599> know<00:05:16.720> also

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
reality technology which you know also

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.159 
reality technology which you know also
would<00:05:17.979> probably<00:05:18.310> incorporate<00:05:19.169> connect

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
would probably incorporate connect

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.460 
would probably incorporate connect
somehow<00:05:20.470> so<00:05:21.280> I<00:05:21.310> don't<00:05:21.880> think<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.900> tech<00:05:23.199> is

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
somehow so I don't think the tech is

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.770 
somehow so I don't think the tech is
dead<00:05:24.009> at<00:05:24.699> all<00:05:24.849> I'm<00:05:25.150> personally<00:05:25.599> still

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
enjoying it you know I've used it to

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.370 
enjoying it you know I've used it to
skank<00:05:27.909> with<00:05:28.150> family<00:05:28.599> or<00:05:28.720> recently<00:05:29.050> that<00:05:29.319> I

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
skank with family or recently that I

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.529 
skank with family or recently that I
haven't<00:05:29.590> seen<00:05:29.800> in<00:05:29.860> years<00:05:30.009> and<00:05:30.370> the<00:05:30.880> camera

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
haven't seen in years and the camera

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.480 
haven't seen in years and the camera
quality<00:05:31.780> is<00:05:32.169> actually<00:05:32.560> really<00:05:32.860> good<00:05:33.130> on<00:05:33.310> that

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
quality is actually really good on that

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.510 
quality is actually really good on that
so<00:05:33.669> I<00:05:33.699> was<00:05:33.849> impressed<00:05:34.030> the<00:05:35.020> Forza<00:05:35.770> horizon<00:05:35.889> 2<00:05:36.310> I

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
so I was impressed the Forza horizon 2 I

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.930 
so I was impressed the Forza horizon 2 I
like<00:05:36.940> using<00:05:37.210> Kinect<00:05:37.870> in<00:05:38.020> that<00:05:38.259> it's<00:05:39.130> your<00:05:39.400> GPS

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
like using Kinect in that it's your GPS

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.610 
like using Kinect in that it's your GPS
in<00:05:40.210> that<00:05:40.360> game<00:05:40.599> and<00:05:40.720> you<00:05:40.810> can<00:05:40.960> say<00:05:41.110> like<00:05:41.289> Anna

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
in that game and you can say like Anna

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.820 
in that game and you can say like Anna
next<00:05:42.580> event<00:05:43.000> and<00:05:43.270> it'll<00:05:43.870> pull<00:05:44.050> up<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:44.590> next

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
next event and it'll pull up the next

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.010 
next event and it'll pull up the next
closest<00:05:45.490> race<00:05:45.789> to<00:05:46.090> you<00:05:46.270> which<00:05:46.479> is<00:05:46.599> really<00:05:46.870> nice

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
closest race to you which is really nice

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.110 
closest race to you which is really nice
so<00:05:47.080> you<00:05:47.409> don't<00:05:47.590> have<00:05:47.740> to<00:05:47.949> get<00:05:48.550> out<00:05:48.699> of<00:05:48.820> the<00:05:48.909> game

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
so you don't have to get out of the game

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.580 
so you don't have to get out of the game
you<00:05:49.270> don't<00:05:49.449> have<00:05:49.539> to<00:05:49.630> go<00:05:49.719> to<00:05:49.780> the<00:05:49.960> menu<00:05:50.169> pull<00:05:50.469> up

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.320 
you don't have to go to the menu pull up
the<00:05:50.710> map<00:05:50.889> or<00:05:51.099> anything<00:05:51.490> you<00:05:51.639> just<00:05:51.669> tell<00:05:52.180> your
