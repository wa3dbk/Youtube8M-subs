research is one of the things that

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.050

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
very long-standing institutions because

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.860 
very long-standing institutions because
they're<00:00:09.510> primarily<00:00:09.990> about<00:00:10.490> the<00:00:11.870> generation

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
they're primarily about the generation

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.930 
they're primarily about the generation
and<00:00:13.080> transmission<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.830> knowledge<00:00:13.980> that's<00:00:14.790> all

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
and transmission of knowledge that's all

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.930 
and transmission of knowledge that's all
universities<00:00:15.509> do<00:00:15.719> in<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.710> end<00:00:16.830> right<00:00:17.670> from

universities do in the end right from

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.670 
universities do in the end right from
the<00:00:18.090> beginning<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.840> university<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.650> has

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
the beginning of the university it has

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.830 
the beginning of the university it has
been<00:00:20.100> extremely<00:00:20.580> interested<00:00:21.300> in<00:00:21.390> research

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
been extremely interested in research

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.460 
been extremely interested in research
the<00:00:22.800> first<00:00:23.279> five<00:00:24.150> professors<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.990> came<00:00:25.260> to

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
the first five professors that came to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.710 
the first five professors that came to
the<00:00:25.590> university<00:00:26.220> were<00:00:26.820> all<00:00:27.269> research

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
the university were all research

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.540 
the university were all research
oriented<00:00:28.140> they<00:00:28.740> had<00:00:28.890> all<00:00:29.039> carried<00:00:29.369> out

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
oriented they had all carried out

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.209 
oriented they had all carried out
research<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.539> UK<00:00:30.960> where<00:00:31.800> they<00:00:31.949> came<00:00:32.160> from

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
research in the UK where they came from

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.510 
research in the UK where they came from
so<00:00:32.880> they<00:00:33.450> were<00:00:33.719> research<00:00:34.440> active<00:00:34.890> they

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
so they were research active they

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.660 
so they were research active they
published<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.710> they<00:00:37.710> started<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.520> do

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
published and they started to do

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.729 
published and they started to do
research<00:00:38.700> when<00:00:39.300> they<00:00:39.450> came<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.899> Auckland<00:00:40.320> in

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
research when they came to Auckland in

the period after that research started

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.069 
the period after that research started
to<00:00:43.710> decline<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> little<00:00:44.520> bit<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.390> real<00:00:45.570> problem

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
to decline a little bit the real problem

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.610 
to decline a little bit the real problem

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.680 
activities we're getting very exciting
interdisciplinary<00:04:25.340> research<00:04:25.699> going<00:04:26.060> on<00:04:26.270> so

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
interdisciplinary research going on so

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.909 
interdisciplinary research going on so
these<00:04:26.900> are<00:04:27.169> the<00:04:27.229> sorts<00:04:27.530> of<00:04:27.620> things<00:04:27.830> that

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
these are the sorts of things that

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.939 
these are the sorts of things that
people<00:04:28.220> absorb<00:04:29.680> more<00:04:30.680> or<00:04:30.800> less<00:04:31.840> unconsciously

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
people absorb more or less unconsciously

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:36.219 
people absorb more or less unconsciously
that<00:04:33.949> affect<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.610> way<00:04:34.729> people<00:04:34.759> think<00:04:35.509> they

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
that affect the way people think they

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.950 
that affect the way people think they
don't<00:04:36.470> realize<00:04:37.009> that<00:04:37.090> actually<00:04:38.090> some<00:04:38.750> of<00:04:38.870> the

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
don't realize that actually some of the

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.409 
don't realize that actually some of the
basis<00:04:39.440> of<00:04:39.470> this<00:04:39.740> has<00:04:40.340> been<00:04:40.669> a<00:04:40.940> research

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
basis of this has been a research

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.560 
basis of this has been a research
project<00:04:41.750> somewhere<00:04:42.229> in<00:04:42.590> the<00:04:43.280> past<00:04:43.550> and<00:04:43.910> it

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
project somewhere in the past and it

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.050 
project somewhere in the past and it
will<00:04:44.780> be<00:04:44.960> in<00:04:45.169> the<00:04:45.259> future<00:04:45.680> too<00:04:45.979> as<00:04:46.220> people

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
will be in the future too as people

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.749 
will be in the future too as people
think<00:04:47.270> about<00:04:47.570> new<00:04:47.930> issues<00:04:48.349> new<00:04:48.650> things<00:04:49.580> that

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
think about new issues new things that

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:51.850 
think about new issues new things that
they<00:04:49.849> want<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.150> research<00:04:50.690> which<00:04:51.289> will<00:04:51.530> shape

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
they want to research which will shape

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.509 
they want to research which will shape
thinking<00:04:52.699> into<00:04:52.940> the<00:04:53.060> future
