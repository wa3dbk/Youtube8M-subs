00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
basically you have to find the sweet

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.410 
basically you have to find the sweet
spot<00:00:51.540> basically<00:00:52.050> if<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.590> makes<00:00:52.770> any<00:00:52.890> sense

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
spot basically if that makes any sense

spot basically if that makes any sense
you<00:00:54.420> can't<00:00:54.690> see<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.559> doesn't<00:00:55.860> really<00:00:55.980> feel

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
you can't see it doesn't really feel

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.260 
you can't see it doesn't really feel
like<00:00:56.280> you're<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.730> glitch<00:00:56.910> when<00:00:57.149> you're

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
like you're in a glitch when you're

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.450 
like you're in a glitch when you're
actually<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.800> basically<00:00:59.100> when<00:00:59.309> you're

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
actually in it and basically when you're

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.959 
actually in it and basically when you're
in<00:00:59.610> this<00:00:59.760> section<00:01:00.000> here<00:01:01.399> you<00:01:02.399> take<00:01:02.670> less

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
in this section here you take less

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.729 
in this section here you take less
damage<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.690> way<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:03.930> if<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.259> find<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.559> sweet

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
damage in a way but if you find a sweet

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.230 
damage in a way but if you find a sweet
spot<00:01:04.799> then<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.279> can't<00:01:05.549> take<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.999> you<00:01:06.090> don't

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
spot then you can't take it you don't

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.910 
spot then you can't take it you don't
take<00:01:06.359> any<00:01:06.630> damage<00:01:06.779> at<00:01:07.049> all<00:01:07.200> now<00:01:07.529> a<00:01:07.560> lot<00:01:07.889> of

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
take any damage at all now a lot of

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.980 
take any damage at all now a lot of
times<00:01:08.069> it<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.429> better<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.999> do<00:01:09.569> it<00:01:09.689> while<00:01:09.869> you

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
times it is better to do it while you

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.109 
times it is better to do it while you
have<00:01:10.109> friends<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.529> a<00:01:10.619> game<00:01:10.829> with<00:01:11.009> you<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.850> they

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
have friends in a game with you so they

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.999 
have friends in a game with you so they
draw<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.479> fire<00:01:12.990> off<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.380> Dragons<00:01:13.859> and

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
draw the fire off the Dragons and

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.919 
draw the fire off the Dragons and
because<00:01:14.279> you<00:01:14.399> can<00:01:14.549> still<00:01:14.759> revive<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.600> be

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:15.929 
because you can still revive and be

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:20.149 
because you can still revive and be
revived<00:01:16.999> from<00:01:17.999> this<00:01:18.840> part<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.469> the<00:01:19.679> weather<00:01:19.920> go

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
revived from this part of the weather go

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.179 
revived from this part of the weather go
for<00:01:20.579> this<00:01:20.670> glitch<00:01:20.969> basically<00:01:21.599> so<00:01:22.590> as<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.920> as

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
for this glitch basically so as you as

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.879 
for this glitch basically so as you as
you<00:01:23.340> saw<00:01:23.719> how<00:01:24.719> to<00:01:24.749> do<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.079> basically<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.709> when

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:25.889 
you saw how to do it basically is when

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:28.309 
you saw how to do it basically is when
the<00:01:26.099> posters<00:01:26.700> come<00:01:26.880> down<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.359> keep<00:01:27.869> pressing

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:28.319 
the posters come down just keep pressing

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:31.309 
the posters come down just keep pressing
up<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:29.099> your<00:01:29.450> controller<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.990> you're<00:01:31.169> running

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
up on your controller so you're running

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.459 
up on your controller so you're running
towards<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.419> and<00:01:33.419> then<00:01:33.990> you've<00:01:34.139> got<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.319> try<00:01:34.409> to

towards it and then you've got to try to

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.019 
towards it and then you've got to try to
jump<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:34.919> top<00:01:35.099> of<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.429> and<00:01:35.579> you've<00:01:35.669> got<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.789> stay

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:36.029 
jump on top of it and you've got to stay

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:37.459 
jump on top of it and you've got to stay
on<00:01:36.060> top<00:01:36.209> of<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.479> until<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.840> goes<00:01:37.109> under<00:01:37.380> the

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
on top of it until it goes under the

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:38.809 
on top of it until it goes under the
ground<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.770> base<00:01:37.889> what<00:01:38.130> happens<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.549> go<00:01:38.700> on

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
ground the base what happens you go on

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.719 
ground the base what happens you go on
the<00:01:38.939> ground<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.659> if<00:01:40.349> that<00:01:40.409> makes<00:01:40.619> any<00:01:41.130> sense

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
the ground of it if that makes any sense

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.069 
the ground of it if that makes any sense
I'm<00:01:42.029> going<00:01:42.209> to<00:01:42.270> show<00:01:42.389> you<00:01:42.419> what<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.749> looks<00:01:42.929> like

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.109 
I'm going to show you what it looks like
when<00:01:43.259> someone<00:01:43.289> else<00:01:43.709> does<00:01:43.799> at<00:01:44.099> the<00:01:44.159> moment<00:01:44.669> but

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
when someone else does at the moment but

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.399 
when someone else does at the moment but
that's<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.450> basics<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.579> so<00:01:47.899> you<00:01:48.899> you're<00:01:49.229> in

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
that's the basics of it so you you're in

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.980 
that's the basics of it so you you're in
the<00:01:49.439> middle<00:01:49.739> here<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.219> take<00:01:50.399> very<00:01:50.579> little

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
the middle here and you take very little

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.359 
the middle here and you take very little
you<00:01:51.140> can<00:01:51.290> see<00:01:51.470> like<00:01:51.680> there's<00:01:51.920> no<00:01:52.040> point

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
you can see like there's no point

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.160 
you can see like there's no point
there's<00:01:53.119> maybe<00:01:53.329> what<00:01:53.540> hit<00:01:53.720> points<00:01:54.049> or

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
there's maybe what hit points or

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.880 
there's maybe what hit points or
anything<00:01:54.320> like<00:01:54.500> that

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
anything like that

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.039 
anything like that
suggesting<00:01:55.549> you<00:01:55.670> causing<00:01:56.299> any<00:01:56.479> damage<00:01:56.509> or<00:01:57.020> the

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
suggesting you causing any damage or the

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.630 
suggesting you causing any damage or the
grenades<00:01:57.470> as<00:01:57.649> you<00:01:57.770> can<00:01:57.920> see<00:01:58.100> aren't<00:01:58.460> going

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
grenades as you can see aren't going

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.310 
grenades as you can see aren't going
anywhere<00:01:58.790> once<00:01:59.630> you<00:01:59.780> get<00:01:59.930> in<00:01:59.990> a<00:02:00.049> sweet<00:02:00.290> spot

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
anywhere once you get in a sweet spot

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.270 
anywhere once you get in a sweet spot
then<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:00.860> can<00:02:01.009> fire<00:02:01.250> out<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:02.840> you<00:02:03.290> can<00:02:03.560> cause

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
then you can fire out and you can cause

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.710 
then you can fire out and you can cause
the<00:02:04.460> head<00:02:04.670> of<00:02:04.759> damage<00:02:05.149> and<00:02:05.240> not<00:02:05.360> take<00:02:05.539> any

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
the head of damage and not take any

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.779

so you know you in the pitch and to get
out<00:02:51.769> of<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.040> glitch<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.280> literally<00:02:52.700> just

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
out of the glitch you literally just

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.509 
out of the glitch you literally just
keep<00:02:53.030> running<00:02:53.209> forward<00:02:53.720> you'll<00:02:54.380> notice<00:02:54.890> when

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
keep running forward you'll notice when

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:56.470 
keep running forward you'll notice when
you're<00:02:55.640> trying<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:55.970> get<00:02:56.030> out<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.359> you'll

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
you're trying to get out that you'll

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.720 
you're trying to get out that you'll
sort<00:02:56.750> of<00:02:56.870> skid<00:02:57.230> around<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.709> map<00:02:57.920> quite<00:02:58.400> as<00:02:58.579> you

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
sort of skid around the map quite as you

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.310 
sort of skid around the map quite as you
perceive<00:02:59.030> as<00:02:59.269> there<00:02:59.510> so<00:02:59.720> you<00:02:59.840> skidding<00:03:00.230> around

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
but eventually you will pop out of the

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.960 
but eventually you will pop out of the
glitch<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:04.160> be<00:03:04.310> able<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.489> run<00:03:04.609> around<00:03:04.730> the

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
glitch and you be able to run around the

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.880 
glitch and you be able to run around the
click<00:03:05.180> stuff<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:05.600> don't<00:03:05.750> have<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:06.049> save<00:03:06.410> exit

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
and it's pretty straightforward very

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.710 
and it's pretty straightforward very
