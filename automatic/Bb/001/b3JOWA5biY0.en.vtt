then we're going to be reviewing the

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.130 
then we're going to be reviewing the
firewire<00:00:02.100> nano<00:00:02.639> and<00:00:03.419> this<00:00:03.659> is<00:00:03.810> going<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.049> be

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
firewire nano and this is going to be

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.539 
firewire nano and this is going to be
the<00:00:04.259> fourth<00:00:04.560> board<00:00:04.799> in<00:00:04.950> our<00:00:05.069> board<00:00:05.310> review

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
the fourth board in our board review

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:18.490 
the fourth board in our board review
series

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.440 

let's<00:00:19.130> go<00:00:19.250> into<00:00:19.400> the<00:00:19.520> specs<00:00:19.820> about<00:00:20.090> this<00:00:20.270> board

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.450 
let's go into the specs about this board

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.780 
let's go into the specs about this board
this<00:00:20.630> is<00:00:20.720> going<00:00:20.840> to<00:00:20.930> be<00:00:20.990> the<00:00:21.080> 55<00:00:21.710> model<00:00:22.340> of<00:00:22.610> the

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:22.790 
this is going to be the 55 model of the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.990 
this is going to be the 55 model of the
firewire<00:00:23.270> national<00:00:23.900> linear<00:00:24.830> flex<00:00:25.250> technology

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
firewire national linear flex technology

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.790 
firewire national linear flex technology
board<00:00:26.210> and<00:00:26.450> what<00:00:26.900> they've<00:00:27.050> done<00:00:27.230> is<00:00:27.410> I<00:00:27.529> put<00:00:27.680> in

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
board and what they've done is I put in

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.280 
board and what they've done is I put in
this<00:00:27.920> new<00:00:27.980> strainer<00:00:28.630> which<00:00:29.630> really<00:00:29.900> changes

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.290 
this new strainer which really changes

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.450 
this new strainer which really changes
the<00:00:30.320> whole<00:00:30.439> dimension<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:31.009> board<00:00:31.220> and<00:00:31.310> have

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
the whole dimension the board and have

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.010 
the whole dimension the board and have
the<00:00:31.580> board<00:00:31.759> rides<00:00:32.029> and<00:00:32.360> it<00:00:32.450> really<00:00:32.599> changes

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
the board rides and it really changes

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.540 
the board rides and it really changes
how<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:33.230> board<00:00:33.590> actually<00:00:33.800> feels<00:00:34.250> when<00:00:34.460> you're

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
how the board actually feels when you're

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.910 
how the board actually feels when you're
writing<00:00:34.820> it<00:00:35.030> on<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:36.170> exact<00:00:36.440> dimensions<00:00:36.590> of

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
writing it on the exact dimensions of

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.420 
writing it on the exact dimensions of
this<00:00:37.040> border<00:00:37.400> 55<00:00:38.030> x<00:00:38.420> 18<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:39.260> a<00:00:39.350> half<00:00:39.379> by<00:00:39.980> two

this border 55 x 18 and a half by two

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.290 
this border 55 x 18 and a half by two
and<00:00:40.760> five-sixteenths<00:00:41.059> with<00:00:41.870> 27<00:00:42.620> liters<00:00:43.300> let's

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
and five-sixteenths with 27 liters let's

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.000 
and five-sixteenths with 27 liters let's
board<00:00:44.540> actually<00:00:44.750> rides<00:00:45.170> can<00:00:45.470> be<00:00:45.590> comparable

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
board actually rides can be comparable

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.299 
board actually rides can be comparable
to<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.340> Vanguard<00:00:47.170> it's<00:00:48.170> very<00:00:48.379> springy<00:00:48.890> it

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
to the Vanguard it's very springy it

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.700 
to the Vanguard it's very springy it
catches<00:00:49.580> ways<00:00:49.940> very<00:00:50.330> similar<00:00:51.200> I<00:00:51.440> would

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
catches ways very similar I would

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.229 
catches ways very similar I would
recommend<00:00:51.829> this<00:00:52.190> board<00:00:52.399> for<00:00:52.670> waves<00:00:52.820> anywhere

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
recommend this board for waves anywhere

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.690 
recommend this board for waves anywhere
from<00:00:53.480> about<00:00:53.780> knee<00:00:54.770> to<00:00:54.829> waist<00:00:55.040> high<00:00:55.309> all<00:00:55.670> the

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
from about knee to waist high all the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.810 
from about knee to waist high all the
way<00:00:55.880> to<00:00:55.940> probably<00:00:56.780> above<00:00:57.290> overhead<00:00:57.770> I<00:00:58.040> don't

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
way to probably above overhead I don't

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.400 
way to probably above overhead I don't
usually<00:00:58.940> like<00:00:59.210> to<00:00:59.360> review<00:00:59.809> boards<00:01:00.110> until<00:01:00.379> I

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
usually like to review boards until I

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.290 
usually like to review boards until I
observe<00:01:00.739> them<00:01:00.950> for<00:01:01.129> a<00:01:01.160> while<00:01:01.309> but<00:01:01.670> this<00:01:01.969> board

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
observe them for a while but this board

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.079 
observe them for a while but this board
really<00:01:02.840> felt<00:01:03.550> reactive<00:01:04.550> you<00:01:04.729> could<00:01:04.850> really

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
really felt reactive you could really

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.800 
really felt reactive you could really
tell<00:01:05.330> feel<00:01:06.200> like<00:01:06.320> you<00:01:06.470> pull<00:01:06.710> off<00:01:06.740> any<00:01:07.009> maneuver

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
tell feel like you pull off any maneuver

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.930 
tell feel like you pull off any maneuver
obviously<00:01:08.810> as<00:01:08.899> a<00:01:08.930> tomo<00:01:09.320> design<00:01:09.680> and<00:01:09.979> what's<00:01:10.850> a

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
obviously as a tomo design and what's a

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.700 
obviously as a tomo design and what's a
really<00:01:11.210> cool<00:01:11.390> part<00:01:11.539> really<00:01:12.170> cool<00:01:12.410> thing<00:01:12.590> about

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
really cool part really cool thing about

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.380 
really cool part really cool thing about
this<00:01:12.920> board<00:01:13.160> is<00:01:13.280> it<00:01:13.430> has<00:01:13.550> the<00:01:13.670> quad<00:01:13.940> and<00:01:14.270> the

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
this board is it has the quad and the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.080 
this board is it has the quad and the
thruster<00:01:14.840> set<00:01:15.229> up<00:01:15.380> so<00:01:16.190> it<00:01:16.520> really<00:01:16.670> gives<00:01:16.759> you<00:01:17.000> a

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
thruster set up so it really gives you a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.670 
thruster set up so it really gives you a
whole<00:01:17.330> wide<00:01:17.660> variety<00:01:18.050> of<00:01:18.080> what<00:01:18.229> sport<00:01:18.530> can

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
whole wide variety of what sport can

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.389 
whole wide variety of what sport can
actually<00:01:18.950> do<00:01:19.479> rails<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:20.780> it<00:01:21.649> holds<00:01:21.830> most<00:01:22.190> of

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
actually do rails and it holds most of

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.730 
actually do rails and it holds most of
the<00:01:22.490> volume<00:01:22.700> from<00:01:23.119> about<00:01:23.439> right<00:01:24.439> at<00:01:24.619> this

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
the volume from about right at this

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.679 
the volume from about right at this
point<00:01:24.799> to<00:01:25.310> where<00:01:25.460> it<00:01:25.580> starts<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.060> share<00:01:26.360> or

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
point to where it starts and share or

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.179 
point to where it starts and share or
narrow<00:01:26.990> up<00:01:27.140> in<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.350> nose<00:01:27.560> which<00:01:27.860> makes<00:01:28.100> it

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
narrow up in the nose which makes it

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.440 
narrow up in the nose which makes it
really<00:01:28.310> easy<00:01:28.400> to<00:01:28.700> bottle<00:01:28.760> and<00:01:29.090> catch<00:01:29.210> waves

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
really easy to bottle and catch waves

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.300 
really easy to bottle and catch waves
I've<00:01:30.229> noticed<00:01:30.650> that<00:01:30.710> you<00:01:30.860> only<00:01:31.010> have<00:01:31.159> to

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
I've noticed that you only have to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.460 
I've noticed that you only have to
paddle<00:01:31.520> about<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:32.119> third<00:01:32.869> of<00:01:33.020> what<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.290> would

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
paddle about a third of what you would

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.899 
paddle about a third of what you would
have<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:33.770> with<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:33.950> normal<00:01:34.189> short<00:01:34.520> board<00:01:34.729> I

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
have to with a normal short board I

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.999 
have to with a normal short board I
typically<00:01:35.720> recommend<00:01:35.810> writing<00:01:36.439> this<00:01:36.710> board

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
typically recommend writing this board

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.920 
typically recommend writing this board
about<00:01:37.280> three<00:01:37.640> to<00:01:37.759> four<00:01:37.909> inches<00:01:38.240> under<00:01:38.750> what

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
about three to four inches under what

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.999 
about three to four inches under what
you<00:01:39.049> would<00:01:39.170> typically<00:01:39.500> write<00:01:39.680> your<00:01:39.830> troll

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
you would typically write your troll

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.160 
you would typically write your troll

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
poured out and its really great just

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.140
