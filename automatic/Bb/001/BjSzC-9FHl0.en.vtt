00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
put it back in and then it actually will

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.289 
put it back in and then it actually will
try<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.439> go<00:01:10.650> repair<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.670> can<00:01:11.729> also<00:01:12.000> get<00:01:12.270> a

try to go repair you can also get a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.760 
try to go repair you can also get a
cheaper<00:01:12.720> version<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.170> run<00:01:13.320> about<00:01:13.500> twenty<00:01:13.740> or

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
cheaper version and run about twenty or

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.230 
cheaper version and run about twenty or
thirty<00:01:14.040> dollars<00:01:14.400> where<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:15.000> get<00:01:15.119> the
