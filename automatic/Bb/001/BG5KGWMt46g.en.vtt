00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:05.309
 an hour and a quarter to travel the Milan pavia route by train it seems 

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:08.860
 science fiction but it is reality begins from our pavia station 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.919
 investigation on the 9 55 train leaving from voghera to Milan 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.019
 central with pavia stop at 10 am 14 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.769
 every morning have a very special event an hour and a quarter for 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:25.219
 travel 30 kilometers starting at 10 and 14 arriving 11 hours at 30 but why? 

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:29.119
 all this time to travel such a short route well now we will go to 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.500
 to explain it to you the solution is simple the regional train is forced to 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.180
 wait for an intercity that has priority generating more with a real trip 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.580
 own epic 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.930
 this home sweet home 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.920
 but how to accumulate all this delay discreetly but it is very simple 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.460
 just arrive 20 minutes systematic delay can make stops in 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.120
 stations 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.359
 like those of certosa di pavia locate triulzi orders major 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.809
 don't believe us well just watch look at the embarrassing slowness with the 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.520
 which trip our regional 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.750
 and minutes in fact accumulated dance 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.710
 or with a 20-minute stop at Certosa di Pavia if the preferred choice of 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.280
 usual 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.430
 or with some prolonged stop in the following stations 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.610
 here it is 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.450
 we are stuck 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.700
 the inter if that behind us 20 minutes late 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.710
 we are stopped at the certosa di pavia station to wait for this to arrive 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.570
 intercity imagine how late we will get to our station oh, i 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.060
 know how much accelerated remains the fact that this blessed intercity 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.260
 tied behind us 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.450
 coverings minutes late 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.730
 maremma sea floor now I see that for them we slow down we are at the stop of 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.000
 Villamaggiore means a nice lunch break 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.530
 nice 55 we are attentive to ten and a quarter travel time practically 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.330
 40 minutes to go given via app villamaggiore more or less ten 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.480
 kilometres 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.500
 but how can we explain all this but because it is very simple 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.869
 Trenitalia defines this delay as a planned delay 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.869
 it is understood that the train will take an hour a quarter because the intercity 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.909
 after all, he must pass though, as we have seen, twenty minutes late 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.790
 and it matters little if the regional passengers have to wait 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.399
 at the end it was expected late 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:21.399
 being a reality is not our fault of intercity pedals 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.129
 selen classiker delay inas mental retardation 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.999
 is our newsletter documented this year 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:32.559
 3 hours 0 5 instead 2 95 ea make us pay late 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.629
 but it is the fault of the crisis 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.459
 well we are the eldest but the stops of locate triulzi are still missing 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.019
 milano rogoredo milano lambrate and I have been on the train for almost an hour e 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.750
