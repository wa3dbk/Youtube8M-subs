00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.680
 I already skateboarded my three of the 15 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.960
 years just to walk him because I was 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.359
 kind of chubby but I know some goals 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.010
 henrique but overall the institut 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.630
 Luanda to dig and many 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.940
 identify with skateboard as a style of 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.840
 life, and today the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.210
 writing accounts for 60% of the population 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.610
 and the other 40% cooks for those who do not 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.860
 You know what is modinha is that galera that 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.860
 makes online advertising better known 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.230
 with the pops next to the definition of 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.770
 any dinner demonstration silver of 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.260
 like ritual typhus and effeminate beings 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.660
 keep in touch at alesp to change 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.420
 I made mine and make appointments in a 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.550
 any space in favor of becoming 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.580
 more isolated neighborhoods and color the nets 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.880
 social posing in the picture with the bic 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.880
 influenced by sound and technical 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.610
 tite do not say you're different 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.310
 Unfortunately we have not invaded the right. 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.310
 three of them but he can in case of 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.799
 Peak with skateboard possession entitled to 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.420
 cosip that ignoring the best part is the 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.850
 best thing to do because if 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.689
 immediately senses tension behind these 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.640
 shuttlecock 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.100
 there are many tribes because the radios of 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.210
 skateboard city what prejudice 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.759
 part of the afternoon 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.009
 if you're a goofy port prince but 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.649
 was left was for who ipatinga 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.479
 skateboard when pure music and already 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.549
 with modinha do not own a motorcycle 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.399
 research shows that in addition to 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.140
 radicality the sensation of freedom 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.720
 leave the house to skate that 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.659
 you run the risk of discrimination 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.920
 those who are paid to help 3d 's 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.689
 crime without any right of 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.909
 opinion that it is right and 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.310
 unfortunately a country like brazil 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.500
 skaters are targets of police officers 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.530
 any way I say that all act 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.540
 in this way but many of them of 61 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.709
 power to do whatever you want with these 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.540
 petistas 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.459
 Just as I've seen a lot 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.260
 Wrong rolling has fallen, whatever else 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.569
 lived on youtube you can search 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.430
 show this reality from there nobody 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.040
 respect one more game that even 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.560
 skateboarding is being handled with politicians 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.870
 where they only seek peace here on skype 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.760
 plasma monageng john person to come is 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.590
 because this abuse of authority in 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.230
 Last week police expulsÃ³ria 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.060
 he skateboarders popularizing and 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.300
 calling them fringe 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.400
 judging by the clubs and events 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.080
 those who most need it. 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.450
 thousands per critical floor but I already went 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.970
 this bias increasing every day 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.099
 What happens is we use the theory of 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.260
 titles that were with him 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.120
 beauty that marijuana is legalized but 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.150
 no one can judge everyone for years 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.950
 not justifying the error together with them 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.260
 of others I have nothing against 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.720
 marijuana in favor of marijuana but 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.849
 If you smoke a cigarette, you have a habit of 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.069
 get drunk for sure you are not the 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.019
 the right person to talk about who smokes or 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.629
 quit smoking I do not see anything wrong in 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.060
 smoke but I think it's very wrong with the 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.220
 abuse of authority by a soldier of 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.470
 police who has the power of a 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.810
 fbi agent means that fashion 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.700
 now it is serving prejudice besides being 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.590
 broken down by the games you are 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.170
 is practically hand in hand with the 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.390
 he left home and took 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.410
 You only take a slap but if in life 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.630
 these are 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.810
 the day was not very good besides these 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.180
 men play in striking at you run 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.720
 already left the TV crew that even ship 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.730
 thousand 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.490
 today all social classes mean 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.800
 a bob skate like lifestyle like me 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.400
 said before and the people of all 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.470
 tribes 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.290
 while men humiliate the tv 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.600
 discriminates and society valence means 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.790
 urban stu sport as if it were a game 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.580
 of the tam in general as a dog is 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.250
 unfortunately the sun core is Brazil 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.170
 country of football but this does not define each 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.360
 one that is of the same type as many 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.850
 I discriminate the skateboarders take the 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.410
 to grow not only in jampa without 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.180
 Talk about the prejudice you think 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.790
 We come from outside Brazil because 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.260
 if you went against this prejudice 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.910
 share this video where together they will 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.890
 try to change this reality 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.140
 enough to be treated as an animal comes 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.480
 here in protest and to let 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.690
 It's very clear that we pay taxes and 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.090
 sun oak and I have no right to leave 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.520
 to like our will see is wrong for 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.250
 Yes, I just want to take it easy without 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.240
 be judged troubled in his favor of peace 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.240
 for the soldiers
