00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.420 
there's a lot of time left because one
minute<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.369> some<00:02:09.270> seconds<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.899> just<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.740> long

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
minute and some seconds is just a long

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
actually and easier map to scream

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.509 
actually and easier map to scream
because<00:03:58.080> there<00:03:58.380> are<00:03:58.470> lots<00:03:58.709> of<00:03:58.860> objects<00:03:59.370> that

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
you can jump and use them to free run

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.979 
you can jump and use them to free run
however<00:04:02.700> when<00:04:02.940> there's<00:04:03.180> a<00:04:03.299> lot<00:04:03.450> of<00:04:03.480> time<00:04:03.630> left

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
however when there's a lot of time left
