00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.160
 a crisis that of the architecture of 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.170
 difficult solution with professionals 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.090
 forced to play with art for 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.500
 play down the problem that the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.480
 vision of the superintendent of the pole 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.220
 vittorio sgarbi museum of venice 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.990
 here is what he said in Venice i 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.820
 Adnkronos microphones on the occasion 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.320
 of the opening of the exhibition on the sides 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.380
 reflected from the future 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.689
 the biennial is also made up of architects 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.779
 important who fuck what he does 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.149
 the water what the clouds do they do 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.620
 because it is true as the curator says that 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.660
 they can't do architecture but 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.850
 only design then give a 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.649
 sign sign a sign instead the 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.090
 Padiglione Italia is the most serious one e 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.700
 I do not say this because I am Italian with 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.920
 current of here and to study see 20 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.960
 years of architecture see research and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.140
 very bad experiments and some 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.870
 beautiful things however the quantity indicates one 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.190
 seriousness while others do theirs 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.719
 what maybe because they have even less 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.890
 space yesterday I met president 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.620
 of the architects that must be said that they are 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.510
 150 thousand subscribers but at least 400 thousand 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.640
 graduates we can hope for a relaunch 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.580
 maybe of this kind of situations 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.040
 because the state is missing and then the state 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.240
 that I see the presence of 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.150
 Chilean minister is missing from us where 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.400
 the architecture is left to the 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.740
 entrepreneurs to builders and does not appear 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.580
 whether it is the responsibility of the government or 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.259
 of power to decide not to do the ara 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.220
 pacis instead make her do what she knows 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.450
 do the ara pacis 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.970
 it means that he has no interest in 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.700
 architecture and where it could say here 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.530
 the state you see the calls a 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.460
 american architect making one 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.320
 emblematic crap of horror 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.970
 I think this is in the background 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.399
 that architecture has the problem ready 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.950
 of resistance the need for it 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.150
 state is present in front of a theme 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.920
 so important 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.110
 everyone's villa and therefore make the man 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.430
 Italy with which taxes 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.650
 the labor of cinema for his 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.540
 central problem represent the 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.070
 resurrection of architecture and his 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.900
 hope driveway I wish all of you 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.030
 activists who are present with the 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.420
 bad news comment yesterday that there 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.360
 are in Italy 400 thousand graduates in 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.720
 architecture and 150 thousand subscribers 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.610
 to the order architects perhaps three this 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.530
 exciting theme that also applies to the 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.690
 philosophy I believe is a theme on which 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.880
 operate this biennial and the next ones 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.930
 claws wish best success as 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.930
 now these people
