00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
and even and this is what it should look

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.300 
and even and this is what it should look
like<00:05:10.810> when<00:05:11.200> you're<00:05:11.320> done<00:05:11.380> putting<00:05:11.860> in<00:05:12.010> the<00:05:12.100> pan

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
like when you're done putting in the pan

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.340 
like when you're done putting in the pan
so<00:05:13.240> then<00:05:13.390> you're<00:05:13.600> going<00:05:13.690> to<00:05:13.750> open<00:05:13.930> up<00:05:14.170> your

oven<00:05:14.590> throw<00:05:15.190> that<00:05:15.400> puppy<00:05:15.760> in<00:05:15.910> there<00:05:16.090> and<00:05:17.160> time

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
oven throw that puppy in there and time

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.150 
oven throw that puppy in there and time
wise<00:05:18.430> it's<00:05:18.880> going<00:05:19.300> to<00:05:19.420> vary<00:05:19.720> the<00:05:20.650> way<00:05:20.800> you<00:05:20.860> live
