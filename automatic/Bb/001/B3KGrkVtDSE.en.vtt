00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.070
 Hi there, you are watching papercraft 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.439
 channel about paper modeling and 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.199
 we continue to talk about assembly 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:23.970
 aka.ms paper and so on at the moment 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:26.259
 I already have this model 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.710
 actually all the basic mechanisms I 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.710
 made 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.210
 ast 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.469
 how to make a shop so let's 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:41.309
 go through all the nodes as you can see I 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:45.250
 I made this cover now I'll show you 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.309
 how do I tell in general how everywhere that I am 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:53.379
 remove we press this latch and 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:58.869
 take out the cover sorry almost forgot 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:02.979
 show you the action mechanism we 

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:06.369
 we enter the bolt and lower the hook we enter 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:09.399
 bolt hook when standing on 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.100
 fuse but nothing happens then 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:17.140
 same thing when we enter and put on 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:19.690
 fuse too so well let me get you 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:25.409
 Now we show and tell you about the cover 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:27.819
 I made the cover myself out of cardboard 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.630
 In general, from under the box from household 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:33.759
 technology why they began to do that 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.590
 which is proposed by piper manufacturing 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.429
 well because it consists of some 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.590
 there are hollow parts in general seemed to me 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:45.399
 on the fragile I did very 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.039
 durable is pretty west and here i am 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:52.649
 made such a hook 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:55.209
 so he entered the groove in this one and 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.050
 actually stiffeners that are 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:02:02.409
 on the receiver cover at 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.830
 original to those who made from 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:11.140
 cardboard further as you see i did 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:14.610
 a spring and such a guide that is 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.610
 we remove this item like this 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:25.810
 the spring I have is made of 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.980
 spiral from the old hair dryer consists of three 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.980
 springs one long 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:38.319
 2 she is somewhere 1 stretches here 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:43.480
 it is necessary for this part 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:45.819
 dressed on the side of the frame and consists of 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.129
 more small that is which stretches 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:52.060
 already up here it is needed for giving 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:55.090
 stiffness in general now this mechanism 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:00.849
 it works well I did this 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.629
 wire guide and glued to 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.109
 this detail 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.629
 I wrapped paper around it and stuck a 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.940
 inside this tube 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:13.599
 I covered this part with super glue and 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.959
 all subsequent details i'm going to them 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:20.230
 cover with super glue too 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.980
 further with regard to the shutter with bolt 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.049
 frame 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.000
 I covered this part with super glue here 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.569
 there is a hole for the guide 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.290
 Actually the shutter is removed like a 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.160
 original 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:41.069
 that is, there is a move here and this detail 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:47.349
 which moves this turn 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:50.109
 I glued on this item gum 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:53.549
 he didnâ€™t put it in general 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:55.000
 it turned out very much that she 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.620
 bent over 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.650
 and I had to put in here 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.819
 match actually did the same with 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.819
 all other axes 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.290
 after i shoot the rest 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.930
 stubs i didn't in steel axles 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:16.489
 cover them with superglue and paint everything 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:20.120
 internal parts yet I had such 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:23.360
 difficulty in general bolt made 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:27.560
 Here dent this part I had 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:31.430
 this is all covered with glue pva super glue 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:35.590
 I didn't have to cover her 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:39.979
 I will probably buy a part with super glue 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:42.110
 the glue shop building moment in 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.840
 general which is sold in tubes of 30 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:50.900
 I should have enough gram 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:53.410
 Next, remove the gas tube from the receiver 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.410
 overlay 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.990
 I covered this part too 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:05.440
 super glue and inside a bit because 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.440
 it's all about minox further I made a ramrod 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.629
 Here it turned out I made it from 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:16.000
 paper from A4 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:17.840
 sorry, I have it without any adaptations 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.389
 extra meaning you first 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.110
 glue and a few strips between 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:26.030
 a thin stick them on the edge of the sheet 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.599
 paper then wrapped 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:32.479
 until you get an oval further 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:34.430
 oval oval detail you cut along 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:39.889
 remove any half 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:42.919
 and the flat part of this half flat 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.729
 pieces of this half stick on the sheet 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:48.909
 a4 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:51.529
 then you roll everything up to the round part and 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:54.800
 cover the super glue why they became 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:57.830
 take doing a ramrod which is suggested 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.520
 by factoring itself but because it 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.960
 square more precisely our rectangle 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.830
 cylindrical shape 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:10.490
 and there is a rectangular in general, I decided that 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:13.270
 it will not be realistic further pillar by 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:17.629
 I also covered my forearm 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:22.900
 super glue that's about here to me 

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:32.000
 so enough glue well, in principle, I 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:38.460
 I think all let's get our back 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:46.490
 automatic put the shutter bolt 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:46.490
 wow almost forgot we put the gas pipe 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:07:00.240
 I put the ramrod, I certainly understand that I 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:04.360
 maybe not in the right order lu 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:06.460
 We collect we disassemble but about this I can 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.670
 be made video when will be in there ok 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:16.330
 ready in the next video I'll probably 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:20.800
 I'll show you already ready store and then 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:26.280
 There will be a video probably on the coating of glue and 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:29.310
 on painting so now we dress 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.310
 return mechanism 

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:47.380
 so we put on the cover in general, all 

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.380
 again a functionary 

00:07:53.979 --> 00:07:59.270
 so thank you all for your attention 

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.199
 subscribe to my channel put 

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:04.330
 fingers top 

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:04.330
 wait for new videos bye
