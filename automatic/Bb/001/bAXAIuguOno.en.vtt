00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
side front from Miss Erika's point of

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.660 
side front from Miss Erika's point of

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
view when she goes around the corner I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.610 
view when she goes around the corner I
think<00:01:46.940> it<00:01:47.030> feels<00:01:47.150> just<00:01:47.480> like<00:01:47.540> a<00:01:47.690> turning<00:01:48.470> rip

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620
