hi<00:00:01.500> Alan<00:00:01.979> here<00:00:02.159> from<00:00:02.370> damn<00:00:02.610> good<00:00:02.820> reviews

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
hi Alan here from damn good reviews

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.789 
hi Alan here from damn good reviews
today<00:00:03.629> I<00:00:03.659> have<00:00:03.959> something<00:00:04.230> you've<00:00:04.470> probably

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
today I have something you've probably

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.070 
today I have something you've probably
seen<00:00:05.160> on<00:00:05.339> TV<00:00:05.819> I<00:00:06.060> couldn't<00:00:06.509> imagine<00:00:06.629> that<00:00:06.870> you

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
seen on TV I couldn't imagine that you

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.500 
seen on TV I couldn't imagine that you
haven't<00:00:07.529> but<00:00:07.919> this<00:00:08.160> is<00:00:08.340> actually<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:09.179> new

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
haven't but this is actually the new

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.009 
haven't but this is actually the new
wave<00:00:09.800> precision<00:00:10.800> induction<00:00:11.519> cooktop<00:00:12.000> -<00:00:12.360> so

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
wave precision induction cooktop - so

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.079 
wave precision induction cooktop - so
you<00:00:13.110> may<00:00:13.559> have<00:00:13.679> seen<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.130> video<00:00:14.549> or<00:00:15.030> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
you may have seen the video or the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.090 
you may have seen the video or the
infomercial<00:00:15.780> for<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.020> first<00:00:16.260> one<00:00:16.500> or<00:00:17.039> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
infomercial for the first one or the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.460 
infomercial for the first one or the
second<00:00:17.760> one<00:00:17.789> which<00:00:18.150> has<00:00:18.300> been<00:00:18.330> out<00:00:18.600> now<00:00:18.630> now

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
second one which has been out now now

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.500 
second one which has been out now now
what<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:19.920> it's<00:00:20.430> an<00:00:20.789> induction<00:00:21.150> cooktop

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
what this is it's an induction cooktop

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.500 
what this is it's an induction cooktop
now<00:00:22.199> induction<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.920> really<00:00:23.189> nothing<00:00:23.609> new<00:00:23.850> it's

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
now induction is really nothing new it's

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.029 
now induction is really nothing new it's
been<00:00:24.600> around<00:00:24.840> for<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.109> lot<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.260> years<00:00:25.560> but<00:00:25.650> how

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
been around for a lot of years but how

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.670 
been around for a lot of years but how
induction<00:00:26.609> works<00:00:26.760> it's<00:00:27.269> based<00:00:27.900> on<00:00:28.109> magnetic

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
induction works it's based on magnetic

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.780 
induction works it's based on magnetic
principles<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:30.330> creates<00:00:30.810> heat<00:00:31.080> with

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
principles and it creates heat with

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.370 
principles and it creates heat with
Magma's<00:00:32.790> like<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.969> magnet<00:00:33.360> magnetic<00:00:34.020> field

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
Magma's like a magnet magnetic field

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.410 
Magma's like a magnet magnetic field
with<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> coils<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.120> heat<00:00:36.390> is

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
with the coils and that heat is

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.020 
with the coils and that heat is
transferred<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.110> something<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.590> steel<00:00:38.579> Pam

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
transferred to something like steel Pam

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.630 
transferred to something like steel Pam
and<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:40.379> great<00:00:40.590> thing<00:00:40.800> about<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.430> you

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
and the great thing about this is you

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.450 
and the great thing about this is you
can<00:00:41.760> really<00:00:42.149> control<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.660> temperature<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
can really control the temperature and

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.889 
can really control the temperature and
after<00:00:44.460> doing<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.820> lot<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.030> tests<00:00:45.450> temperature

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
after doing a lot of tests temperature

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.380 
after doing a lot of tests temperature
control<00:00:46.170> was<00:00:46.559> amazing<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.820> for

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
control was amazing on this for

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.420 
control was amazing on this for
everything<00:00:48.660> from<00:00:49.079> cooking<00:00:49.260> eggs<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:50.010> searing

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
everything from cooking eggs to searing

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.299 
everything from cooking eggs to searing
steaks<00:00:50.610> -<00:00:51.449> one<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> biggest<00:00:52.829> thing<00:00:53.010> was

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
steaks - one of the biggest thing was

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.209 
steaks - one of the biggest thing was
milking<00:00:53.820> chocolate<00:00:54.300> evenly<00:00:55.230> not<00:00:55.680> burning<00:00:55.980> it

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
milking chocolate evenly not burning it

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.380 
milking chocolate evenly not burning it
as<00:00:56.370> well<00:00:57.090> as<00:00:57.239> oils<00:00:57.750> I'm<00:00:57.960> able<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.039> reuse<00:00:59.969> oil

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
as well as oils I'm able to reuse oil

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.240 
as well as oils I'm able to reuse oil
which<00:01:00.660> almost<00:01:00.960> never<00:01:01.350> happens<00:01:01.859> when<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.039> cook

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
which almost never happens when I cook

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.030 
which almost never happens when I cook
stuff<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.699> gas<00:01:03.090> stove<00:01:03.390> top<00:01:03.719> also<00:01:04.530> boiling

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
stuff on a gas stove top also boiling

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.920 
stuff on a gas stove top also boiling
water<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> lot<00:01:05.850> faster<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.780> course

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
water is a lot faster of course

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.950 
water is a lot faster of course
depending<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.770> how<00:01:08.340> much<00:01:08.490> water<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.210> but

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
depending on how much water you have but

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.620 
depending on how much water you have but
it's<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.260> lot<00:01:10.470> faster<00:01:10.770> using<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.240> induction

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
it's a lot faster using the induction

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.109 
it's a lot faster using the induction
cooktop<00:01:13.200> over<00:01:13.950> something<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> gas<00:01:14.850> or

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
cooktop over something like a gas or

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.850 
cooktop over something like a gas or
electric<00:01:15.509> stove<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.350> you're<00:01:16.500> going<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.650> save

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
electric stove so you're going to save

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.090 
electric stove so you're going to save
time<00:01:17.189> there<00:01:17.990> now<00:01:18.990> everything<00:01:19.710> I've<00:01:19.830> cooked

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
time there now everything I've cooked

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.380 
time there now everything I've cooked
with<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.520> was<00:01:20.880> great

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
with this was great

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.240 
with this was great
now<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.990> remember<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.710> one<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> first

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
now I remember in one of the first

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.310 
now I remember in one of the first
videos<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.210> saw<00:01:24.450> for<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.780> they<00:01:24.930> said<00:01:25.170> oh

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
videos that I saw for this they said oh

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.560 
videos that I saw for this they said oh
the<00:01:25.740> surface<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.640> surface<00:01:26.850> really<00:01:27.210> doesn't

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
the surface the surface really doesn't

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.810 
the surface the surface really doesn't
get<00:01:27.630> hot<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.170> touch<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:29.189> does<00:01:29.430> get<00:01:29.640> hot

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
get hot you can touch it it does get hot

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.550 
get hot you can touch it it does get hot
especially<00:01:30.420> being<00:01:30.630> able<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.320> go<00:01:31.470> up

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
especially being able that it can go up

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.789 
especially being able that it can go up
to<00:01:31.680> UM<00:01:31.829> 500<00:01:32.640> plus<00:01:32.820> degrees<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:34.409> have<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> pan

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
to UM 500 plus degrees if you have a pan

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.380 
to UM 500 plus degrees if you have a pan
on<00:01:34.979> there<00:01:35.130> even<00:01:35.460> if<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.670> remove<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
on there even if you remove it the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.080 
on there even if you remove it the
surface<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.409> pan<00:01:37.650> was<00:01:37.860> 500<00:01:38.310> degrees<00:01:38.610> so

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
surface that the pan was 500 degrees so

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.460 
surface that the pan was 500 degrees so
I<00:01:39.119> still<00:01:39.390> don't<00:01:39.509> recommend<00:01:40.020> touching<00:01:40.380> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
I still don't recommend touching the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.800 
I still don't recommend touching the
service<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:42.000> know<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.180> don't<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.630> to

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
service but you know you don't have to

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.569 
service but you know you don't have to
have<00:01:42.960> those<00:01:43.140> things<00:01:43.200> like<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> fire<00:01:43.920> hazard<00:01:44.189> as

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
have those things like a fire hazard as

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.530 
have those things like a fire hazard as
far<00:01:45.149> as<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.869> know<00:01:45.960> open<00:01:46.470> flame<00:01:46.770> uh<00:01:47.299> my<00:01:48.299> biggest

issue with the NuWave precision
induction<00:01:51.659> cooktop<00:01:51.990> -<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.950> there's

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
induction cooktop - is that there's

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.050 
induction cooktop - is that there's
really<00:01:53.220> no<00:01:53.790> indicator<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.960> here<00:01:55.890> as<00:01:56.040> far<00:01:56.759> as

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
really no indicator on here as far as

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.300 
really no indicator on here as far as
you'll<00:01:57.630> see<00:01:57.840> all<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.079> different<00:01:58.409> buttons<00:01:58.530> but

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
you'll see all the different buttons but

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.480 
you'll see all the different buttons but
there's<00:01:59.700> no<00:01:59.909> indicator<00:02:00.649> by<00:02:01.649> sound<00:02:02.070> or

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
there's no indicator by sound or

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.280 
there's no indicator by sound or
something<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.060> flashes<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.659> tell<00:02:03.899> me<00:02:04.049> that

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
something that flashes to tell me that

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.399 
something that flashes to tell me that
maybe<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.340> pan<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.909> at<00:02:06.270> temperature<00:02:06.840> or<00:02:07.020> close

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
maybe the pan is at temperature or close

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.589 
maybe the pan is at temperature or close
to<00:02:07.590> temperature<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.640> why<00:02:08.789> don't<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.060> have<00:02:09.330> oil

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
to temperature so why don't you have oil

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.469 
to temperature so why don't you have oil
-<00:02:09.810> something<00:02:10.110> that's<00:02:10.229> about

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
- something that's about

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.270 
- something that's about
350<00:02:11.379> or<00:02:11.920> 375<00:02:12.459> degrees<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:14.650> was<00:02:14.799> more<00:02:15.040> or<00:02:15.129> less

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
350 or 375 degrees it was more or less

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.039 
350 or 375 degrees it was more or less
just<00:02:15.310> waiting<00:02:15.909> they<00:02:16.030> said<00:02:16.239> oh<00:02:16.269> I<00:02:16.390> guess<00:02:16.900> I'll

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
just waiting they said oh I guess I'll

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.199 
just waiting they said oh I guess I'll
wait<00:02:17.230> five<00:02:17.409> minutes<00:02:17.709> or<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.610> can<00:02:18.730> obviously

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
wait five minutes or it can obviously

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.570 
wait five minutes or it can obviously
put<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.480> thermometer<00:02:19.720> in<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.379> so<00:02:20.920> same<00:02:21.310> thing

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
put a thermometer in it so same thing

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.839 
put a thermometer in it so same thing
with<00:02:21.879> a<00:02:21.909> pan<00:02:22.330> heated<00:02:22.840> up<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.230> say<00:02:23.560> 500<00:02:24.549> degrees

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
with a pan heated up to say 500 degrees

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.960 
with a pan heated up to say 500 degrees
so<00:02:25.120> I<00:02:25.150> want<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.480> do<00:02:25.659> a<00:02:25.690> sear<00:02:26.080> so<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.250> had<00:02:27.519> no<00:02:27.790> way

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
so I want to do a sear so I had no way

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.699 
so I want to do a sear so I had no way
to<00:02:28.000> tell<00:02:28.360> even<00:02:28.870> if<00:02:28.959> they<00:02:29.080> were<00:02:29.140> giving<00:02:29.530> me<00:02:29.590> an

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
to tell even if they were giving me an

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.080 
to tell even if they were giving me an
estimation<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.640> okay<00:02:31.360> way<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.379> pan<00:02:32.620> and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
estimation of okay way to the pan and

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.580 
estimation of okay way to the pan and
it's<00:02:34.090> going<00:02:34.299> to<00:02:34.360> take<00:02:34.569> you<00:02:34.720> about<00:02:34.930> 10<00:02:35.379> minutes

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
it's going to take you about 10 minutes

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.069 
it's going to take you about 10 minutes
to<00:02:35.860> heat<00:02:36.069> up<00:02:36.180> no<00:02:37.180> idea<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.750> was<00:02:37.840> really

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
to heat up no idea that was really

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.100 
to heat up no idea that was really
nothing<00:02:38.319> in<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:39.160> manual<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.879> tell<00:02:40.090> me<00:02:40.269> that<00:02:40.450> so

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
nothing in the manual to tell me that so

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.800 
nothing in the manual to tell me that so
I<00:02:41.140> was<00:02:41.470> just<00:02:41.530> kind<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.370> just<00:02:43.090> eyeballing<00:02:43.629> it

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
I was just kind of just eyeballing it

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.069 
I was just kind of just eyeballing it
and<00:02:43.989> just<00:02:44.620> waiting<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.849> few<00:02:45.970> minutes<00:02:46.870> and

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
and just waiting a few minutes and

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.960 
and just waiting a few minutes and
figure<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.829> okay<00:02:48.280> it's<00:02:48.549> up<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.819> temperature

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
figure that okay it's up to temperature

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.349 
figure that okay it's up to temperature
now<00:02:49.870> another<00:02:50.170> thing<00:02:50.609> the<00:02:51.609> manual<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:52.180> comes

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
now another thing the manual that comes

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.949 
now another thing the manual that comes
with<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.780> is<00:02:53.230> actually<00:02:53.590> really<00:02:53.709> good<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.519> have

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
with it is actually really good you have

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.660 
with it is actually really good you have
you<00:02:55.959> know<00:02:56.049> just<00:02:56.079> a<00:02:56.349> Quick<00:02:56.799> Start<00:02:56.829> Guide<00:02:57.129> kind

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
you know just a Quick Start Guide kind

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.460 
you know just a Quick Start Guide kind
of<00:02:57.760> goes<00:02:57.910> over<00:02:58.120> everything<00:02:58.810> what<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.349> new

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470

of goes over everything what the new
wave<00:02:59.650> is<00:02:59.890> how<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.459> works<00:03:00.670> then<00:03:01.359> also<00:03:01.599> you<00:03:01.840> have

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
wave is how it works then also you have

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.199 
wave is how it works then also you have
a<00:03:02.349> bunch<00:03:02.890> of<00:03:02.980> different<00:03:03.129> complete<00:03:03.670> cookbook

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
a bunch of different complete cookbook

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.089 
a bunch of different complete cookbook
the<00:03:04.599> cookbook<00:03:04.930> manual<00:03:05.319> that<00:03:05.410> comes<00:03:05.620> with<00:03:05.799> it

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
the cookbook manual that comes with it

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.400 
the cookbook manual that comes with it
here<00:03:06.340> so<00:03:06.819> it<00:03:07.180> talks<00:03:07.450> about<00:03:07.599> everything<00:03:08.019> from

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
here so it talks about everything from

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.520 
here so it talks about everything from
beef<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.980> check<00:03:09.280> into<00:03:09.640> cooking<00:03:09.849> eggs<00:03:10.269> and<00:03:10.569> oils

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
beef to check into cooking eggs and oils

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.530 
beef to check into cooking eggs and oils
now<00:03:11.980> one<00:03:12.280> thing<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.579> does<00:03:12.790> mention<00:03:13.180> as<00:03:13.299> well<00:03:13.480> is

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
now one thing it does mention as well is

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.949 
now one thing it does mention as well is
when<00:03:14.079> you're<00:03:14.260> cooking<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:16.030> know<00:03:16.150> if<00:03:16.630> you<00:03:16.780> have

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
when you're cooking you know if you have

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.900 
when you're cooking you know if you have
something<00:03:17.290> like<00:03:17.319> oils<00:03:17.829> and<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.069> want<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.459> say

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
something like oils and you want to say

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.159 
something like oils and you want to say
fry<00:03:19.599> it<00:03:19.829> 350<00:03:20.829> degrees<00:03:21.340> for<00:03:21.669> something<00:03:21.940> like

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
fry it 350 degrees for something like

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.250 
fry it 350 degrees for something like
vegetable<00:03:23.169> oil<00:03:23.260> 350<00:03:23.919> to<00:03:24.040> 375<00:03:24.660> that<00:03:25.660> you're

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
vegetable oil 350 to 375 that you're

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.789 
vegetable oil 350 to 375 that you're
going<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.560> want<00:03:26.769> to<00:03:26.859> know<00:03:26.919> um<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:29.290> know<00:03:29.410> not

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
going to want to know um you know not

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.050 
going to want to know um you know not
only<00:03:29.859> how<00:03:30.310> long<00:03:30.459> it's<00:03:30.639> going<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.790> take<00:03:30.940> the

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
only how long it's going to take the

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.640 
only how long it's going to take the
heat<00:03:31.239> up<00:03:31.389> but<00:03:31.750> also<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.139> might<00:03:32.290> want<00:03:32.349> to

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
heat up but also you might want to

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.009 
heat up but also you might want to
increase<00:03:33.220> it<00:03:33.340> by<00:03:33.669> another<00:03:33.910> few<00:03:34.840> degrees

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
increase it by another few degrees

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.129 
increase it by another few degrees
because<00:03:35.950> when<00:03:36.190> you<00:03:36.280> add<00:03:36.609> food<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:37.959> that's

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
because when you add food to it that's

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.740 
because when you add food to it that's
cool<00:03:38.470> or<00:03:39.040> at<00:03:39.160> room<00:03:39.400> temperature<00:03:39.970> that's<00:03:40.480> going

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
cool or at room temperature that's going

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.509 
cool or at room temperature that's going
to<00:03:40.810> drop<00:03:41.049> and<00:03:41.319> then<00:03:41.590> after<00:03:41.889> a<00:03:41.950> few<00:03:41.980> minutes<00:03:42.400> you

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
to drop and then after a few minutes you

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.420 
to drop and then after a few minutes you
can<00:03:42.700> reset<00:03:43.239> it<00:03:43.269> to<00:03:43.630> actually<00:03:44.319> where<00:03:45.069> you<00:03:45.190> want

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
can reset it to actually where you want

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.569 
can reset it to actually where you want
it<00:03:45.519> to<00:03:45.639> be<00:03:45.819> so<00:03:46.450> after<00:03:47.169> using<00:03:47.319> the<00:03:47.530> cooktop<00:03:47.919> for

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
it to be so after using the cooktop for

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.729 
it to be so after using the cooktop for
a<00:03:48.609> lot<00:03:48.880> of<00:03:48.910> different<00:03:49.470> foods

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
a lot of different foods

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.190 
a lot of different foods
everything<00:03:51.489> from<00:03:51.760> again<00:03:52.180> sauteing<00:03:52.870> to

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
everything from again sauteing to

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.580 
everything from again sauteing to
searing<00:03:53.769> to<00:03:54.040> cooking<00:03:54.569> you<00:03:55.569> know<00:03:55.690> just<00:03:56.379> like

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
searing to cooking you know just like

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.500 
searing to cooking you know just like
eggs<00:03:56.889> making<00:03:57.549> sure<00:03:57.700> they<00:03:57.790> weren't<00:03:58.030> going<00:03:58.389> all

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
eggs making sure they weren't going all

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.170 
eggs making sure they weren't going all
over<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:58.840> place<00:03:59.019> or<00:03:59.230> burning<00:04:00.220> it<00:04:00.760> was<00:04:00.879> like<00:04:01.030> an

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
over the place or burning it was like an

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.050 
over the place or burning it was like an
even<00:04:01.569> cook<00:04:01.780> which<00:04:01.989> is<00:04:02.019> great<00:04:02.500> um<00:04:02.799> I<00:04:03.579> really

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
even cook which is great um I really

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.479 
even cook which is great um I really
give<00:04:04.239> this<00:04:04.419> induction<00:04:04.780> cooked<00:04:05.079> up<00:04:05.230> five<00:04:06.160> stars

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
give this induction cooked up five stars

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.220 
give this induction cooked up five stars
without<00:04:06.669> a<00:04:06.819> doubt<00:04:07.120> I<00:04:07.299> mean<00:04:07.480> I<00:04:07.629> love<00:04:07.989> having

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
without a doubt I mean I love having

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.770 
without a doubt I mean I love having
this<00:04:08.470> I<00:04:08.650> have<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.040> gas<00:04:09.310> stove<00:04:09.340> behind<00:04:10.060> me<00:04:10.239> but<00:04:10.720> I

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
this I have a gas stove behind me but I

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.900 
this I have a gas stove behind me but I
have<00:04:11.169> the<00:04:11.319> induction<00:04:11.769> cooktop<00:04:12.129> next<00:04:12.699> to<00:04:12.819> me

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
have the induction cooktop next to me

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.309 
have the induction cooktop next to me
now<00:04:13.090> and

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
now and

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.989 
now and
I<00:04:14.349> kind<00:04:14.650> of<00:04:14.709> rather<00:04:14.920> use<00:04:15.189> that<00:04:15.430> unless<00:04:15.670> I'm

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:15.999 
I kind of rather use that unless I'm

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:18.210 
I kind of rather use that unless I'm
doing<00:04:16.180> some<00:04:16.509> type<00:04:16.690> of<00:04:16.720> flambe<00:04:17.049> crazy<00:04:17.650> thing

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
doing some type of flambe crazy thing

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.129 
doing some type of flambe crazy thing
now<00:04:18.669> this<00:04:18.940> induction<00:04:19.570> cooktop<00:04:19.959> stove

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
now this induction cooktop stove

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.180 
now this induction cooktop stove
actually<00:04:20.560> came<00:04:20.979> with<00:04:21.910> their<00:04:22.810> uh<00:04:22.840> their<00:04:23.530> frying

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
actually came with their uh their frying

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.640 
actually came with their uh their frying
pan<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.880> this<00:04:25.270> is<00:04:25.419> a<00:04:25.449> nonstick<00:04:25.990> frying<00:04:26.410> pan

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
pan and this is a nonstick frying pan

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.740 
pan and this is a nonstick frying pan
but<00:04:27.039> it<00:04:27.370> has<00:04:27.550> almost<00:04:27.850> like<00:04:27.970> this<00:04:28.180> diamond

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
but it has almost like this diamond

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.650 
but it has almost like this diamond
coating<00:04:29.199> that<00:04:29.350> they<00:04:29.530> do<00:04:29.590> and<00:04:29.979> really<00:04:30.789> um<00:04:31.150> it's

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
coating that they do and really um it's

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.570 
coating that they do and really um it's
also<00:04:31.840> nice<00:04:32.229> and<00:04:32.470> heavy<00:04:32.620> nothing<00:04:33.250> that<00:04:33.400> you

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
also nice and heavy nothing that you

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.430 
also nice and heavy nothing that you
would<00:04:33.729> maybe<00:04:34.150> think<00:04:34.330> you<00:04:34.690> saw<00:04:34.900> in<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.229> store

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
would maybe think you saw in the store

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.770 
would maybe think you saw in the store
it's<00:04:35.620> like<00:04:35.800> oh<00:04:35.949> this<00:04:36.340> is<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:36.550> piece<00:04:37.150> of<00:04:37.300> garbage

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
it's like oh this is a piece of garbage

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.070 
it's like oh this is a piece of garbage
is<00:04:37.870> actually<00:04:38.440> a<00:04:38.500> nice<00:04:38.800> heavy<00:04:39.099> pan<00:04:39.400> and<00:04:40.080> because

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
is actually a nice heavy pan and because

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.870 
is actually a nice heavy pan and because
it's<00:04:41.410> this<00:04:41.620> diamond<00:04:42.130> coating<00:04:42.490> that<00:04:42.610> they<00:04:42.729> have

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
it's this diamond coating that they have

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.909 
it's this diamond coating that they have
on<00:04:43.120> it<00:04:43.270> not<00:04:43.810> only<00:04:44.050> does<00:04:44.199> it<00:04:44.229> create<00:04:44.590> a<00:04:44.620> really

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
on it not only does it create a really

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.430 
on it not only does it create a really
great<00:04:45.160> nonstick<00:04:45.729> surface<00:04:46.240> but<00:04:46.840> it's<00:04:47.110> a<00:04:47.229> lot

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
great nonstick surface but it's a lot

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.930 
great nonstick surface but it's a lot
safer<00:04:47.770> and<00:04:48.160> healthier

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
safer and healthier

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.080 
safer and healthier
I<00:04:49.139> believe<00:04:50.139> it's<00:04:50.259> green<00:04:50.530> you<00:04:51.009> know<00:04:51.130> a<00:04:51.520> green

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
I believe it's green you know a green

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.270 
I believe it's green you know a green
surface<00:04:52.690> um

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
surface um

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.920 
surface um
compared<00:04:55.060> to<00:04:55.150> something<00:04:55.539> like<00:04:55.660> the

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
compared to something like the

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.290 
compared to something like the
traditional<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:56.740> black<00:04:57.030> non-stick<00:04:58.030> pans

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
traditional the black non-stick pans

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.850 
traditional the black non-stick pans
where<00:04:58.630> you<00:04:58.720> get<00:04:58.900> something<00:04:59.139> like<00:04:59.199> the<00:04:59.380> Teflon

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
where you get something like the Teflon

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.189 
where you get something like the Teflon
where<00:05:00.490> after<00:05:01.120> a<00:05:01.150> while<00:05:01.330> it<00:05:01.630> should<00:05:01.780> come<00:05:02.020> off

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
where after a while it should come off

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.379 
where after a while it should come off
and<00:05:02.470> get<00:05:02.590> into<00:05:02.710> your<00:05:02.919> food<00:05:03.130> and<00:05:03.430> and<00:05:03.580> could

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
and get into your food and and could

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.540 
and get into your food and and could
possibly<00:05:04.840> cause<00:05:05.139> some<00:05:05.470> health<00:05:05.680> issues<00:05:05.860> so

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
possibly cause some health issues so

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.610 
possibly cause some health issues so
this<00:05:06.789> is<00:05:06.940> great<00:05:07.180> again<00:05:07.930> you<00:05:08.050> don't<00:05:08.169> want<00:05:08.320> to<00:05:08.530> be

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
this is great again you don't want to be

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.909 
this is great again you don't want to be
using<00:05:09.070> a<00:05:09.280> metal<00:05:10.210> spatulas<00:05:11.139> because<00:05:11.560> you<00:05:11.710> will

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
using a metal spatulas because you will

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.240 
using a metal spatulas because you will
scratch<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.340> surface<00:05:12.520> so<00:05:12.940> plastic<00:05:13.870> or<00:05:14.250> or

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
scratch the surface so plastic or or

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.370 
scratch the surface so plastic or or
wood<00:05:15.580> is<00:05:15.849> fine<00:05:16.630> you're<00:05:16.870> not<00:05:16.960> going<00:05:17.110> to<00:05:17.169> scratch

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
wood is fine you're not going to scratch

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.710 
wood is fine you're not going to scratch
everything<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:18.039> this<00:05:18.520> works<00:05:18.820> really<00:05:19.090> well<00:05:19.360> of

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
everything and this works really well of

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.510 
everything and this works really well of
course<00:05:19.780> with<00:05:20.349> the<00:05:20.470> production<00:05:20.770> of<00:05:20.979> the

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
course with the production of the

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.480 
course with the production of the
precision<00:05:21.909> induction<00:05:22.389> cooktop<00:05:23.099> but<00:05:24.099> you<00:05:24.310> can

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
precision induction cooktop but you can

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.510 
precision induction cooktop but you can
really<00:05:24.699> use<00:05:24.849> any<00:05:25.409> pan<00:05:26.409> and<00:05:26.770> a<00:05:27.099> great<00:05:27.310> way<00:05:27.490> to

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
really use any pan and a great way to

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.460 
really use any pan and a great way to
test<00:05:27.820> it<00:05:28.120> if<00:05:28.270> your<00:05:28.509> pans<00:05:28.780> going<00:05:29.020> to<00:05:29.080> work<00:05:29.289> with

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
test it if your pans going to work with

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.070 
test it if your pans going to work with
it<00:05:29.590> is<00:05:29.889> simply<00:05:30.370> take<00:05:30.520> a<00:05:30.550> magnet<00:05:31.090> stick<00:05:31.780> it<00:05:31.930> and

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
it is simply take a magnet stick it and

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.749 
it is simply take a magnet stick it and
if<00:05:32.560> it<00:05:32.710> sticks<00:05:32.919> to<00:05:33.099> the<00:05:33.190> bottom<00:05:33.280> of<00:05:33.460> the<00:05:33.520> pan

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 
if it sticks to the bottom of the pan

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.089 
if it sticks to the bottom of the pan
most<00:05:34.449> likely<00:05:34.840> it<00:05:35.020> will<00:05:35.470> work<00:05:35.770> with<00:05:36.039> the

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:36.099 
most likely it will work with the

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:38.219 
most likely it will work with the
induction<00:05:36.729> cooktop<00:05:37.180> so<00:05:37.599> it's<00:05:37.810> not<00:05:37.930> like<00:05:38.139> you

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
induction cooktop so it's not like you

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.830 
induction cooktop so it's not like you
have<00:05:38.409> to<00:05:38.560> just<00:05:38.770> buy<00:05:38.949> special<00:05:39.370> pans<00:05:39.820> to<00:05:40.659> work

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
have to just buy special pans to work

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.219 
have to just buy special pans to work
with<00:05:41.050> it<00:05:41.199> so<00:05:41.380> this<00:05:42.250> whole<00:05:42.580> set<00:05:42.909> I<00:05:43.150> really<00:05:44.080> give

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
with it so this whole set I really give

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.200 
with it so this whole set I really give
this<00:05:44.380> this<00:05:44.800> whole<00:05:44.979> set<00:05:45.220> right<00:05:45.370> here<00:05:45.400> of<00:05:45.820> the

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
this this whole set right here of the

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.659 
this this whole set right here of the
induction<00:05:46.750> cooktop<00:05:47.139> five<00:05:48.039> stars<00:05:48.340> without<00:05:48.639> a

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
induction cooktop five stars without a

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.300 
induction cooktop five stars without a
doubt<00:05:48.940> I<00:05:49.210> love<00:05:49.750> this<00:05:49.990> but<00:05:50.530> I'm<00:05:50.830> actually<00:05:51.009> going

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
to do a demo in another video of frying

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.879 
to do a demo in another video of frying
some<00:05:54.220> stuff<00:05:54.460> gonna<00:05:54.669> fry<00:05:54.880> some<00:05:54.909> eggplant<00:05:55.599> and

some stuff gonna fry some eggplant and
gonna<00:05:56.889> sear<00:05:57.250> some<00:05:57.930> probably<00:05:58.930> some<00:05:59.080> chicken<00:05:59.440> so
