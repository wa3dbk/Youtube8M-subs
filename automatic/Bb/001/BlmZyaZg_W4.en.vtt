00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.270
 hello comrades tankers with you 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.279
 andronchik 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.360
 this is my second video which is dedicated 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.860
 because there are cases when 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.370
 charged projectile type decides the outcome 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.890
 battle and so we begin 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.420
 armor-piercing projectiles as they Bebeshko 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.699
 the main type of shells that can 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.980
 shoot almost any weapon in the game 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.500
 this shell only damages the case 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.050
 breaking through the enemy's armor also he can 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.450
 damage modules or crew if it gets 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.730
 in the right place cases when punching 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.730
 power and projectile is not enough it is not 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.800
 will pierce the armor and will not cause damage if 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.640
 projectile falls into armor under too 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.699
 acute angle 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.489
 then it will ricochet and also does not cause damage. 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.979
 we hear in annoying in communication 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.110
 ricochet separately wanted and say about 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.490
 such positive properties would be more like 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.660
 normalization but more on that later 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.270
 high-explosive shells has 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.880
 most potential damage 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.670
 but slight armor penetration 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.160
 if a shell pierces the armor it explodes 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.830
 inside the tank causing maximum damage and 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.440
 additional damage to models or crew 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.780
 from the explosion high-explosive projectile not 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.910
 be sure to punch armor targets when 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.220
 in the past he will explode on tank armor 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.319
 less damage than after penetration 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.140
 damage in this case depends on the thickness 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.399
 armor the thicker the armor the more damage 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.190
 from the explosion and on the axis 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.000
 besides explosion damage from high-explosive 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.899
 shells absorb and tank screens 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.450
 high-explosive fragmentation projectiles also we 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.149
 damage several tanks at the same time 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.429
 since the blast has a certain radius 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.310
 here and tank shells a smaller radius 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:05.640
 high explosive action in sau shells 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.580
 the maximum bit and bombs 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.020
 used mainly for 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.390
 large-caliber guns as the main weight 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.330
 projectile and also for finishing off so 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.910
 called nedobitkov and shot down capture with 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.160
 bases further a little and subcaliber 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.379
 Projectiles sub-caliber projectiles main 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.610
 type shells for trail for medium tanks 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:28.440
 level ten and easy t71 principle 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.900
 actions similar to armor-piercing 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.879
 different high 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.069
 impenetrability on stronger loses 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:37.250
 punch and with distance has a smaller 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.590
 normalization further probably about the most 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.099
 main projectiles such as cumulative 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.319
 shells 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.780
 these are most premium shells for 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.159
 many tanks in the game 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.019
 their penetrability is noticeably higher than that of 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.450
 standard armor-piercing shells and 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.579
 armor-piercing damage for 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.159
 same gun effect breaking through 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.989
 not achieved by kinetic 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:59.260
 projectile energy like bb or armor 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.120
 piercing shells but at the expense of energy 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.639
 cumulative jet formed during 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.629
 explosive blasting 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.859
 certain form on some 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.500
 distance from armor 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.989
 hence the difference from their armor piercing armor 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.940
 sub-caliber cumulative projectiles less often 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.189
 bounce on them does not apply 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.010
 normalization rule and they lose 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:21.650
 scolding do not lose armor penetration 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.439
 distances also they have visible 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.480
 disadvantages first they can ricochet off 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:28.879
 you happen less often than in the case 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.950
 the use of armor piercing the second them 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.500
 penetration drops dramatically when hit 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.209
 screen for example in the caterpillar that is logical 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.879
 red-hot osprey i should first 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.400
 burn the screen then an empty space for not 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.810
 under before directly tank and only 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.299
 then the armor itself 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.449
 they have no third 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:50.750
 normalization further like to talk 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:53.540
 a little bit about rebounding depending on the eagle 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.209
 the projectile and armor meetings were determined 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.829
 ricochet ricochet shells angle 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.349
 meetings with an armor-piercing 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.449
 exceeds 70 ricochet when 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.609
 shooting armor piercing or subcaliber 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:06.590
 projectile does not occur if the caliber 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.079
 gun is three times the thickness 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.239
 armor in this case the shell is trying 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.940
 pierce armor regardless of the angle 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.650
 in contact with external modules 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.049
 for example running gear 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.239
 ricochet instruments or devices 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.060
 also does not occur regardless 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.039
 boiler meeting if the bounce was not then 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.340
 meeting angle is reduced by 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:29.479
 normalization angle is calculated 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.970
 instant armor penetration 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.770
 random variable where calling plus 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.379
 minus twenty 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.120
 five percent off nominal 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:39.280
 armor penetration specified in tth if 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.710
 ricochet was both a point and a projectile 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.659
 reduced by 25 percent and the projectile 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.639
 flies along a new trajectory and can 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:47.560
 get to another place of the tank calculation 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.020
 projectile flight occurs within 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.210
 only 1 cars therefore fall off another from 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.919
 rica shocked by the first projectile cannot 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.409
 if the second hit in the same tank 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.120
 ricochet ends then the projectile disappears 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.909
 Now let's talk a little about 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.210
 normalization normalization is such a thing 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:06.460
 which seems to be there, but ugly we dive 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.440
 in history at the turn of the twentieth century in 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.780
 form of armor-piercing shells happened 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.030
 revolution by scientists it was established that 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.479
 stupid final projectile at an angle of meeting with 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.729
 armor 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.940
 excellent from 0 degrees less often 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:21.220
 the river is quieter and better pierces the armor 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.229
 This phenomenon was called normalization. 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.659
 the essence of the phenomenon is that 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.880
 there is a bite of armor and after 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:30.400
 resultant force turns 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.099
 normal projectile ie reducing the angle 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.800
 I would also like to touch on such meetings. 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:38.800
 at first glance banal but not at all 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.830
 little important topic that this tsiferki 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.199
 through the drop line recorded in 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.569
 characteristics of the instrument and I respond to 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.610
 this question under the rate of fire where 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:51.460
 written average armor penetration 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.180
 armor penetration of each type is indicated 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.969
 projectile 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.909
 which it is possible to load the tank on 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:06:01.750
 tank example in to 7201 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:05.409
 I will show you that the first value is 235 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:08.740
 break through bb shichko second 334 this 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:10.960
 breaking through cumulative checks and 85 this 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.370
 breaking through high-explosive projectile 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.090
 also we can see 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.569
 damage from each type of projectile patches 0 8 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.029
 ten 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:21.400
 developers have applied this new feature 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:24.550
 like breaking through previously impenetrable 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.430
 fence posts as well as a tent 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.699
 tents in the center of the circle of capture but want 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.930
 notice that not all shells pierce 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:34.599
 cumulative and high-explosive fragmentation 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.759
 still does not break through these seemingly 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:38.800
 at first glance already punch and and 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:42.039
 projectiles as they detonate when 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.560
 meeting him well that's all thanks 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:45.409
 what watched my video subscribe to 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.679
 channel up new 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:47.679
 meeting
