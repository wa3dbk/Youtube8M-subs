minecraft<00:00:04.410> redstone<00:00:05.040> video<00:00:05.810> yes<00:00:06.810> today<00:00:07.379> I've

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
minecraft redstone video yes today I've

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.040 
minecraft redstone video yes today I've
got<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:07.890> new<00:00:07.980> invention<00:00:08.639> for<00:00:09.059> you<00:00:09.179> guys<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:09.840> is

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
got a new invention for you guys this is

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.499 
got a new invention for you guys this is
more<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.559> proof<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.519> concept<00:00:11.820> actually

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
more of a proof of concept actually

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.660 
more of a proof of concept actually
because<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.349> haven't<00:00:13.679> actually<00:00:13.980> really

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
because I haven't actually really

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.120 
because I haven't actually really
compacted<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.509> machine<00:00:15.900> at<00:00:16.109> all<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:16.890> is

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
compacted the machine at all this is

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.179 
compacted the machine at all this is
just<00:00:17.789> so<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.000> shudder<00:00:18.900> just<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.070> can

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
just so I shudder just so that I can

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.849 
just so I shudder just so that I can
show<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.609> guys<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.150> concept<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:22.020> what<00:00:22.109> I'm

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
show you guys the concept of what I'm

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.740 
show you guys the concept of what I'm
working<00:00:23.070> with<00:00:23.250> here<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:24.210> when<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.420> press<00:00:24.720> this

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
working with here so when I press this

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.189 
working with here so when I press this
button<00:00:25.519> the<00:00:26.519> dropper<00:00:27.029> down<00:00:27.240> here<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.840> going<00:00:28.109> to

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
button the dropper down here is going to

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.370 
button the dropper down here is going to
send<00:00:28.500> out<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:28.890> block<00:00:29.160> redstone<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.199> if<00:00:31.199> you

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
send out this block redstone and if you

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.889 
send out this block redstone and if you
look<00:00:31.410> into<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.040> machine<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.390> filled

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
look into this machine this is filled

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.190 
look into this machine this is filled
with<00:00:34.100> blocks<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.280> glass<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.630> can't<00:00:36.960> see

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
with blocks of glass so you can't see

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.920 
with blocks of glass so you can't see
the<00:00:37.410> glass<00:00:37.590> from<00:00:37.950> outside<00:00:38.430> but<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.879> from<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
the glass from outside but you from the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.860 
the glass from outside but you from the
inside<00:00:40.110> it's<00:00:40.559> blocked<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.670> when<00:00:42.090> an<00:00:42.300> item<00:00:42.570> is

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
inside it's blocked so when an item is

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.860 
inside it's blocked so when an item is
going<00:00:43.230> into<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.829> block<00:00:44.309> it's<00:00:45.120> going<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.539> try<00:00:45.809> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
going into a block it's going to try to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.279 
going into a block it's going to try to
escape<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.739> either<00:00:47.700> side<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:48.570> either<00:00:48.840> side

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
escape on either side so if either side

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.860 
escape on either side so if either side
has<00:00:49.559> an<00:00:49.710> empty<00:00:50.039> block<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:51.149> going<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.600> try<00:00:51.840> to

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
has an empty block it's going to try to

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.200 
has an empty block it's going to try to
go<00:00:52.050> over<00:00:52.289> there<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.100> that's<00:00:53.370> why<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.699> item

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
go over there so that's why the item

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.170 
go over there so that's why the item
will<00:00:54.360> go<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.539> either<00:00:54.809> side<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.820> then<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.090> will

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
will go to either side and then it will

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.610 
will go to either side and then it will
go<00:00:57.210> into<00:00:57.510> our<00:00:57.780> hoppers<00:00:58.320> here<00:00:58.710> these<00:00:59.160> two<00:00:59.460> and

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
go into our hoppers here these two and

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.539 
go into our hoppers here these two and
we'll<00:01:01.620> get<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:02.010> post<00:01:02.340> from<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.960> using<00:01:03.960> our

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
we'll get a post from that using our

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.420 
we'll get a post from that using our
amazing<00:01:05.549> comparators<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.920> that<00:01:07.920> will<00:01:08.189> turn

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
amazing comparators and that will turn

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.210 
amazing comparators and that will turn
on<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.760> piston<00:01:09.110> looping<00:01:10.110> itself<00:01:10.560> keeping<00:01:11.070> it

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
on the piston looping itself keeping it

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.120 
on the piston looping itself keeping it
on<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:12.080> every<00:01:13.080> time<00:01:13.260> we<00:01:13.439> press<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.860> button

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
on and every time we press the button

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.120 
on and every time we press the button
its<00:01:14.909> first<00:01:15.180> going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.600> reset<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:17.009> can

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
its first going to reset it as you can

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.179 
its first going to reset it as you can
see<00:01:17.369> here<00:01:17.640> these<00:01:18.600> piston<00:01:19.170> extend<00:01:19.650> down<00:01:19.830> first

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
see here these piston extend down first

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.090 
see here these piston extend down first
using<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.360> tech<00:01:21.590> post.really<00:01:22.590> I'm<00:01:22.890> just

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
using this for tech post.really I'm just

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.590 
using this for tech post.really I'm just
going<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.250> use<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.729> tech<00:01:23.970> post<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
going to use a to tech post so it's a

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.480 
going to use a to tech post so it's a
bit<00:01:24.750> faster<00:01:26.990> yep<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.409> resets<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.189> really

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
bit faster yep it resets it really

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.100 
bit faster yep it resets it really
quickly<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.090> then<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:31.380> despite<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:33.720> hopper

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
quickly and then the despite the hopper

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.789 
quickly and then the despite the hopper
will<00:01:34.950> shoot<00:01:35.400> out<00:01:35.520> another<00:01:35.790> redstone<00:01:36.090> block

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
will shoot out another redstone block

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.480 
will shoot out another redstone block
and<00:01:38.270> what<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.570> also<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.439> if<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.310> just

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
and what you can also do is if I just

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.340 
and what you can also do is if I just
extend<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.060> redstone<00:01:42.450> line<00:01:42.720> by<00:01:42.930> one<00:01:43.170> it

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
extend this redstone line by one it

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.859 
extend this redstone line by one it
makes<00:01:43.890> sure<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:45.060> reset<00:01:45.689> before<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
makes sure that it's reset before the

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.429 
makes sure that it's reset before the
yeah<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.259> makes<00:01:49.920> sure<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.520> reset<00:01:51.320> before<00:01:52.320> it

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
yeah it makes sure it's reset before it

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.700 
yeah it makes sure it's reset before it
actually<00:01:53.390> opened<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.509> hopper<00:01:54.869> but<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.530> main

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
actually opened the hopper but the main

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.389 
actually opened the hopper but the main
thing<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.790> uh<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.630> item

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
thing with this is that uh the item

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.370 
thing with this is that uh the item
sometimes<00:01:59.399> fly<00:01:59.820> out<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.299> that's<00:02:00.479> why<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.960> place

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
sometimes fly out and that's why I place

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.999 
sometimes fly out and that's why I place
a<00:02:01.409> block<00:02:01.680> here<00:02:01.740> because<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:03.210> hopper<00:02:04.020> tend<00:02:04.799> to

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
a block here because the hopper tend to

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.459 
a block here because the hopper tend to
when<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.610> locks<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.180> items<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.659> fly

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
when it locks the items just fly

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.369 
when it locks the items just fly
everywhere<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.819> yeah<00:02:09.000> that's<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.750> main<00:02:09.989> proof

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
everywhere so yeah that's the main proof

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.100 
everywhere so yeah that's the main proof
of<00:02:10.530> concept<00:02:11.039> for<00:02:11.129> right<00:02:11.430> now<00:02:11.459> if<00:02:11.970> anybody<00:02:12.900> you

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
of concept for right now if anybody you

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.770 
of concept for right now if anybody you
want<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.349> improve

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
want to improve
