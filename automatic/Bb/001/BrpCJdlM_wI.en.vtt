00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
pieces of aahhhs work together so one of

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.049 
pieces of aahhhs work together so one of
the<00:00:43.590> harder<00:00:43.860> things<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.460> trying<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.760> figure

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the harder things is trying to figure

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.970 
the harder things is trying to figure
out<00:00:45.300> especially<00:00:45.660> when<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.020> uneven<00:00:46.559> land<00:00:46.739> and

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
out especially when you uneven land and

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.610 
out especially when you uneven land and
things<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.750> how<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> cut<00:00:49.379> around

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
things like that how to cut around

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.000 
things like that how to cut around
certain<00:00:50.070> objects<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:52.350> get<00:00:52.530> your<00:00:52.680> angles

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
certain objects and get your angles

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.529 
certain objects and get your angles
right<00:00:53.960> so<00:00:54.960> let's<00:00:55.829> do<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.309> right<00:00:56.579> here<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.120> now

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
right so let's do that right here so now

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.389 
right so let's do that right here so now
we<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> next<00:00:58.170> section<00:00:59.010> here<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.309> we're

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
we have the next section here that we're

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.380 
we have the next section here that we're
going<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.579> want<00:01:01.309> so<00:01:02.309> what<00:01:02.520> we<00:01:03.030> know<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.300> an

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
going to want so what we know is an

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.929 
going to want so what we know is an
8-foot<00:01:03.719> section<00:01:03.930> right<00:01:04.290> here<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:05.430> we're<00:01:05.850> going

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
8-foot section right here so we're going

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.330 
8-foot section right here so we're going
to<00:01:06.000> go<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> starting<00:01:06.810> length<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
to go to the starting length and the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.179 
to go to the starting length and the
ending<00:01:08.670> length<00:01:08.930> it's<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.170> go<00:01:10.229> down<00:01:10.380> here

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.240 

so<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.369> starting<00:01:14.790> length<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.420> about<00:01:16.170> 36<00:01:16.920> not

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
so the starting length is about 36 not

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.240 
so the starting length is about 36 not
to<00:01:17.340> be<00:01:17.430> exactly<00:01:18.030> accurate<00:01:18.500> and<00:01:19.500> then<00:01:19.710> when<00:01:20.189> you

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
to be exactly accurate and then when you

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.280 
to be exactly accurate and then when you
go<00:01:20.369> eight<00:01:20.520> feet<00:01:20.759> away<00:01:23.659> which<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.810> about<00:01:25.049> right

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
go eight feet away which is about right

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.600 
go eight feet away which is about right
here<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:27.030> get<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> ending<00:01:27.540> length<00:01:28.579> which<00:01:29.579> is

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
here you get the ending length which is

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:39.350 
here you get the ending length which is
about<00:01:30.470> 30<00:01:34.220> yeah<00:01:35.220> 29<00:01:35.579> 1/2<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.630> ah<00:01:37.880> 36<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.030> one<00:01:39.180> end

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
about 30 yeah 29 1/2 so ah 36 on one end

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.990 
about 30 yeah 29 1/2 so ah 36 on one end
29<00:01:39.990> 1/2<00:01:40.290> another<00:01:41.090> let<00:01:42.090> me<00:01:42.180> get<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:43.220> mark<00:01:44.220> here<00:01:44.430> 36

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
29 1/2 another let me get a mark here 36

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.750 
29 1/2 another let me get a mark here 36
I've<00:01:45.210> already<00:01:45.420> marked<00:01:45.600> it

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
I've already marked it

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.490 
I've already marked it
and<00:01:47.420> then<00:01:47.690> on<00:01:47.840> this<00:01:47.930> side<00:01:47.990> we're<00:01:48.290> going<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.440> go

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
and then on this side we're going to go

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.300 
and then on this side we're going to go
29<00:01:49.400> and<00:01:49.760> a<00:01:49.970> half<00:01:50.320> now<00:01:51.320> any<00:01:51.590> objects<00:01:52.070> that<00:01:52.130> are

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
29 and a half now any objects that are

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.910 
29 and a half now any objects that are
sticking<00:01:52.640> out<00:01:52.730> like<00:01:52.940> that<00:01:53.170> concrete<00:01:54.170> I'm<00:01:54.740> just

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
sticking out like that concrete I'm just

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.800 
sticking out like that concrete I'm just
going<00:01:55.040> to<00:01:55.070> mark<00:01:55.370> this<00:01:55.580> first<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.120> we'll<00:01:56.270> worry

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
going to mark this first and we'll worry

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.660 
going to mark this first and we'll worry
about<00:01:56.870> those<00:01:57.140> other<00:01:57.260> objects<00:01:57.650> later<00:01:57.830> so

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
about those other objects later so

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.390 
about those other objects later so
you're<00:01:58.850> getting<00:01:59.060> two<00:01:59.150> semis<00:01:59.510> Strait<00:01:59.980> is<00:02:00.980> here

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
you're getting two semis Strait is here

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
use one of your ends and we're going to

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.910 
use one of your ends and we're going to
draw<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:06.980> line<00:02:07.250> from<00:02:07.580> point<00:02:07.670> A<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.060> point<00:02:08.210> B<00:02:08.920> now

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
draw a line from point A to point B now

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
you trying just to do too many things at

you trying just to do too many things at
once<00:02:22.850> with<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.180> cutting<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:24.080> is<00:02:24.230> very

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
once with the cutting it is very

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.840 
once with the cutting it is very
confusing<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:26.060> do<00:02:26.240> not<00:02:26.420> recommend<00:02:27.520> if<00:02:28.520> using

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
confusing so do not recommend if using

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.670 
confusing so do not recommend if using
yourself<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.360> just<00:02:29.510> keep<00:02:29.810> it<00:02:29.960> simple<00:02:30.080> two

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
yourself and just keep it simple two

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.580 
yourself and just keep it simple two
cuts<00:02:31.270> to<00:02:32.270> two<00:02:32.510> measurements<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.020> one<00:02:33.170> cut<00:02:33.410> at

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
cuts to two measurements and one cut at

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.140 
cuts to two measurements and one cut at
a<00:02:33.650> time<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:35.330> it'll<00:02:35.600> go<00:02:36.370> be<00:02:37.370> very<00:02:37.550> quick<00:02:37.820> to<00:02:37.850> cut

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
a time and it'll go be very quick to cut

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.540 
a time and it'll go be very quick to cut
now<00:02:38.440> on<00:02:39.440> this<00:02:39.710> here<00:02:39.980> you're<00:02:40.130> going<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.280> want<00:02:40.340> to

put it near an edge if this flaps too

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.400 
put it near an edge if this flaps too
much<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:44.420> just<00:02:44.660> shattered<00:02:45.020> into<00:02:45.140> a<00:02:45.230> million

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
much it just shattered into a million
