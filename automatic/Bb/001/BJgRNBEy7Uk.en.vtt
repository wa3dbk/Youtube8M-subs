00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
so the first time I ever saw this

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.570 
so the first time I ever saw this
vehicle<00:01:33.440> is<00:01:33.530> when<00:01:33.650> I<00:01:33.740> was<00:01:33.800> playing<00:01:34.159> the

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.719 
vehicle is when I was playing the
battlefront<00:01:35.090> games<00:01:35.390> I<00:01:36.380> was<00:01:37.159> a<00:01:37.190> huge<00:01:37.430> fan<00:01:37.460> at

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
battlefront games I was a huge fan at

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.820 
battlefront games I was a huge fan at
the<00:01:37.760> battlefront<00:01:38.210> games<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:38.840> I<00:01:39.530> always

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
the battlefront games and I always

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.990 
the battlefront games and I always
thought<00:01:40.040> that<00:01:40.100> this<00:01:40.340> was<00:01:40.520> a<00:01:40.549> pretty<00:01:40.850> awesome

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
thought that this was a pretty awesome

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.570 
thought that this was a pretty awesome
vehicle<00:01:41.409> it<00:01:42.409> looks<00:01:42.590> a<00:01:42.710> lot<00:01:42.950> like<00:01:43.070> a<00:01:43.130> tank<00:01:43.430> it

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
vehicle it looks a lot like a tank it

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.969 
vehicle it looks a lot like a tank it
functions<00:01:44.000> like<00:01:44.090> a<00:01:44.180> tank

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
functions like a tank

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.510 
functions like a tank
it<00:01:45.979> basically<00:01:46.100> is<00:01:46.580> a<00:01:46.610> hovering<00:01:47.000> tank<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:47.690> I

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
it basically is a hovering tank and I

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.219 
it basically is a hovering tank and I
think<00:01:49.520> Hazar<00:01:49.729> I<00:01:49.790> did<00:01:49.940> a<00:01:50.000> good<00:01:50.120> job<00:01:50.229> bringing

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
think Hazar I did a good job bringing

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:14.619 
then a look at the bottom side as well
so<00:02:13.189> as<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.370> can<00:02:13.459> see<00:02:13.640> there's<00:02:13.819> some<00:02:14.000> nails<00:02:14.299> on

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
so as you can see there's some nails on

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.080 
so as you can see there's some nails on
the<00:02:14.659> bottom<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:16.250> white<00:02:16.400> house<00:02:16.610> bird<00:02:16.879> did

it<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:18.620> know<00:02:18.739> it<00:02:18.890> looks<00:02:19.280> great<00:02:19.519> because<00:02:20.200> it

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
it you know it looks great because it

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.070 
it you know it looks great because it
really<00:02:21.530> looks<00:02:21.799> like<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.909> tank<00:02:23.180> is<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.480> hovering

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
really looks like the tank is a hovering

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.100 
really looks like the tank is a hovering
if<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.319> just<00:02:24.500> kind<00:02:24.709> of<00:02:24.860> push<00:02:25.489> it<00:02:25.519> across<00:02:25.730> for<00:02:25.939> you

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
if I just kind of push it across for you

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.200 
if I just kind of push it across for you
my<00:02:27.920> table<00:02:28.250> isn't<00:02:28.370> perfectly<00:02:28.850> flat<00:02:29.150> but

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
my table isn't perfectly flat but

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.380 
my table isn't perfectly flat but
otherwise<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:31.310> know<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.730> definitely<00:02:31.970> looks

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
otherwise you know it definitely looks

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.870 
otherwise you know it definitely looks
like<00:02:32.480> it's<00:02:32.810> it's<00:02:33.320> hovering<00:02:33.740> which<00:02:34.460> is<00:02:34.610> great

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
like it's it's hovering which is great

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.420 
like it's it's hovering which is great
because<00:02:35.650> it's<00:02:36.650> supposed<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:37.010> be<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.190> hovercraft

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
because it's supposed to be a hovercraft

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.770 
because it's supposed to be a hovercraft
vehicle<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.650> it's<00:02:39.650> really<00:02:39.920> nice<00:02:40.160> that<00:02:40.780> Hasbro

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
vehicle and it's really nice that Hasbro

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.230 
vehicle and it's really nice that Hasbro
was<00:02:41.900> able<00:02:42.080> to<00:02:42.140> do<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.830> incorporate<00:02:43.040> that<00:02:43.910> look

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
was able to do to incorporate that look

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.690 
was able to do to incorporate that look
in<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.480> way<00:02:44.600> that<00:02:44.930> doesn't<00:02:45.410> detract<00:02:45.800> from<00:02:46.100> the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
in a way that doesn't detract from the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.730 
in a way that doesn't detract from the
appearance<00:02:47.240> of<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.450> vehicle<00:02:47.840> alright<00:02:48.560> so

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
appearance of the vehicle alright so

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.710 
appearance of the vehicle alright so
since<00:02:48.860> this<00:02:49.010> vehicle<00:02:49.340> is<00:02:49.460> a<00:02:49.490> tank<00:02:49.880> as<00:02:50.090> you<00:02:50.570> can

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
since this vehicle is a tank as you can

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.050 
since this vehicle is a tank as you can
see<00:02:50.870> it's<00:02:51.020> heavily<00:02:51.470> armoured<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.100> it

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060
