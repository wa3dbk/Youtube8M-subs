00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hi guys another day more and I will 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.410
 I really understand that I understand you already 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.660
 I will not say what I used to say though 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.340
 think about it but I know you're 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.519
 angry and that you have reached your 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.789
 limit of patience so today today 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.830
 I'm going with you half ideas and 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.410
 is that if you buy a console 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.650
 new and it seems that the only thing that receives 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.019
 so interesting or a master is definite 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.720
 edition to the first cousins ​​of the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.369
 x last generation division what 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.399
 it seemed that the blip is 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.530
 turning a habit a little 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.530
 dangerous and I already understand you really 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.200
 in addition to that in my case in my case to 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.200
 Although it is understood and you want 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.329
 be rational towards you I leave 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.090
 lead by passion in this is something 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.010
 douar I love it and specifically before 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.500
 it seemed to me a super ethical decision 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.079
 confrontation against hercules and cronos 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.879
 from I bought myself to god of war 3 in ps 5 and 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.309
 successive console we would be 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.800
 delighted and if I would sign now I know that 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.210
 It is not the best option I have made 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:12.270
 It seems a bit stupid to me as if it were 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.570
 the host when they saw the trailer in 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.490
 question then not something with four or a 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.200
 spin-off the host does not and in the end it turns out 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.970
 which is a remaster of 3 and above you 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.800
 I counted confused because they lie images 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.130
 and videos of all god of war points 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.100
 It is not a 03/03 addition I understand that 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.010
 this is already a little case of feeling 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.690
 ok but I have already booked or copied 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.560
 one was reserved but I like to 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.560
 book soon 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.420
 I understand that maybe observing what 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.310
 obvious that it is to win pasta logically 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.710
 maybe it's a way of santa sony 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.200
 monica of qatar the ps4 hardware of 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.630
 catam not to mess with him to see what 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.580
 is able to do and so on the way 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.490
 we have assembled a when war 3 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.460
 a thousand per second 1080p mode photo is 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.590
 very fashionable to photo mode and that will come 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.730
 July 15 according to how well you know 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.160
 few seconds good minutes but of 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.649
 I really understand them I will understand the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.990
 margin that I'm looking forward to 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.330
 that July 15 , really, what 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.280
 I'm looking forward but I understand the 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.620
 I understand that there is a certain limit to 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.650
 all 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.840
 so I just wait for your bile 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.580
 I pray to people who are also very 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.900
 happy with the water, because if you do not buy 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.489
 whoever is also another option 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.420
 but the truth is that the thing is no longer 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.909
 try that I understand you I feel that is 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.290
 heavy but it starts to be a little 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:41.090
 esperpéntico so nothing a little kiss and os 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.200
 I will see on July 15 with a boxing of a 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.200
 very expected game
