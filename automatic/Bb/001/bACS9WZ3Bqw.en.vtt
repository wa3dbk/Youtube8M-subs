00:00:57.906 --> 00:01:01.056
Moving close now

00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:06.752
Your hands just knock me off my feet

00:01:10.356 --> 00:01:13.916
Yeah, like a puppet now

00:01:15.193 --> 00:01:19.436
I cannot move to my own beat

00:01:23.223 --> 00:01:27.484
But I can dance tonight

00:01:28.044 --> 00:01:33.086
and make up songs for us to sing

00:01:34.067 --> 00:01:40.257
You hold my heart because it's cheap

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:45.779
And to your rhythm I will shout

00:01:46.513 --> 00:01:49.779
my love for play

00:02:16.296 --> 00:02:26.328
(the only way, the only way...)

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:30.630
Take off your hat

00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:36.094
and pull a rabbit out for me

00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:43.463
I'm like a lark, now

00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:51.331
I play on my back and on my knees

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.921
So I will

00:02:54.607 --> 00:03:16.510
Run, now. Run, now

00:03:18.247 --> 00:03:22.720
But I can dance tonight

00:03:23.238 --> 00:03:29.415
and make up songs for us to sing (I can play on my back and knees)

00:03:29.415 --> 00:03:35.463
You hold my heart because it's cheap (I play with my self it seems)

00:03:35.984 --> 00:03:41.534
And to your rhythm I will shout

00:03:41.806 --> 00:03:45.092
my love for play
