than a cast off right this is how we

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.360 
than a cast off right this is how we
finish<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.360> edge<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.870> our<00:00:58.020> row<00:00:58.289> now<00:00:59.100> why<00:00:59.219> would

you<00:00:59.460> use<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> purl<00:01:00.090> bind<00:01:00.359> off<00:01:00.570> as<00:01:00.930> opposed<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
you use a purl bind off as opposed to a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.219 
you use a purl bind off as opposed to a
knit<00:01:02.520> bind<00:01:02.760> off<00:01:02.940> well<00:01:03.329> there's<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.049> couple

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
knit bind off well there's a couple

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.670 
knit bind off well there's a couple
reasons<00:01:04.439> one<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:05.960> if<00:01:06.960> you're<00:01:07.200> knitting

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
reasons one is if you're knitting

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.230 
reasons one is if you're knitting
stockinette<00:01:08.100> fabric<00:01:08.220> there<00:01:08.820> may<00:01:09.090> be<00:01:09.119> a

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
stockinette fabric there may be a

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.890 
stockinette fabric there may be a
tendency<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> fabric<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.350> curl<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.100> so

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
tendency for the fabric to curl and so

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.450 
tendency for the fabric to curl and so
using<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.960> purl<00:01:13.229> bind<00:01:13.500> off<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.979> going<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.250> sort

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
using a purl bind off is going to sort

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.780 
using a purl bind off is going to sort
of<00:01:14.610> twist<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.900> edge<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.560> little<00:01:16.799> bit<00:01:16.950> more

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
of twist that edge a little bit more

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.600 
of twist that edge a little bit more
towards<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.439> will<00:01:19.590> lay<00:01:19.770> flat<00:01:19.799> a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
towards you and so it will lay flat a

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.570 
towards you and so it will lay flat a
little<00:01:20.850> bit<00:01:21.030> nicer<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:22.650> other<00:01:22.770> reason<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.369> if

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
little bit nicer the other reason is if

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.270 
little bit nicer the other reason is if
you<00:01:23.610> want<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.509> stay<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.960> pattern<00:01:25.470> right<00:01:26.040> you

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
you want to stay in pattern right you

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.580 
you want to stay in pattern right you
might<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.820> binding<00:01:27.090> off<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.869> backside<00:01:28.560> of

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
might be binding off on the backside of

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.950 
might be binding off on the backside of
your<00:01:28.920> fabric<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.540> wouldn't<00:01:30.780> want<00:01:30.930> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
your fabric and so you wouldn't want to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.890 
your fabric and so you wouldn't want to
use<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.170> knit<00:01:31.590> stitch<00:01:32.490> along<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.270> last<00:01:33.600> edge

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
use a knit stitch along the last edge

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.600 
use a knit stitch along the last edge
here<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.619> would<00:01:34.770> want<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.040> use<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> purl<00:01:35.520> stitch

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
here you would want to use a purl stitch

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.630 
here you would want to use a purl stitch
if<00:01:36.210> you're<00:01:36.509> doing<00:01:36.689> stocking<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.560> again<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.009> so

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
if you're doing stocking it again and so

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.870 
if you're doing stocking it again and so
then<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.720> would<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> purl<00:01:40.950> bind<00:01:41.189> off<00:01:41.430> right

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
then you would do a purl bind off right

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.940 
then you would do a purl bind off right
to<00:01:42.119> bind<00:01:42.299> off<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.630> pattern<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.680> those<00:01:43.829> are

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
to bind off in pattern so those are

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.830 
to bind off in pattern so those are
really<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> two<00:01:44.490> big<00:01:44.970> reasons<00:01:45.329> why<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.509> would

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
really the two big reasons why you would

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.219 
really the two big reasons why you would
use<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:46.110> bind<00:01:46.470> off<00:01:46.649> like<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.960> final

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
use a bind off like this and the final

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.550 
use a bind off like this and the final
reason<00:01:49.350> might<00:01:49.619> be<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.939> an<00:01:51.119> element

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
reason might be if you have an element

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.359 
reason might be if you have an element
like<00:01:52.560> here<00:01:53.040> where<00:01:53.399> we<00:01:54.060> did<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:55.040> Pearlridge<00:01:56.040> row

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
like here where we did a Pearlridge row

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.469 
like here where we did a Pearlridge row
again<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.540> help<00:01:57.750> keep<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.290> fabric<00:01:58.530> from

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
again to help keep the fabric from

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.889 
again to help keep the fabric from
curling<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.979> will<00:02:02.189> match<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:03.060> row

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
curling the this will match that row

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.389 
curling the this will match that row
alright<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:04.770> let<00:02:04.890> me<00:02:04.950> show<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.130> how<00:02:05.340> we

off<00:04:16.440> like<00:04:16.650> normal<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:17.880> then<00:04:18.799> what<00:04:19.799> I<00:04:19.829> like<00:04:19.950> to

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.180 
off like normal and then what I like to
do<00:04:20.489> is<00:04:21.109> some<00:04:22.109> people<00:04:22.349> will<00:04:22.470> just<00:04:22.620> pull<00:04:22.919> this

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
do is some people will just pull this

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.010 
do is some people will just pull this
straight<00:04:24.030> through<00:04:24.300> but<00:04:24.479> that<00:04:24.630> doesn't<00:04:24.930> really

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
straight through but that doesn't really

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.600 
straight through but that doesn't really
tighten<00:04:25.530> down<00:04:25.560> that<00:04:26.010> last<00:04:26.370> stitch

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
tighten down that last stitch

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.219

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
so I just give it a little bit of slack

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.029

and then pull your working yarn through

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.990 
and then pull your working yarn through
that<00:04:33.699> loop<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:34.330> then<00:04:35.400> we'll<00:04:36.400> just<00:04:36.580> pull<00:04:36.819> all

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000

that loop and then we'll just pull all
the<00:04:37.120> way<00:04:37.150> through<00:04:37.509> now<00:04:37.719> you<00:04:37.750> might<00:04:38.199> want<00:04:38.379> to

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409 
the way through now you might want to

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.559 
the way through now you might want to
cut<00:04:38.590> your<00:04:38.710> yarn<00:04:38.909> so<00:04:39.909> you<00:04:40.000> don't<00:04:40.150> have<00:04:40.270> to<00:04:40.360> pull

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:40.569 
cut your yarn so you don't have to pull

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:42.570 
cut your yarn so you don't have to pull
all<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:41.050> way<00:04:41.139> through<00:04:41.439> a<00:04:41.620> bunch<00:04:42.250> of<00:04:42.370> yarn
