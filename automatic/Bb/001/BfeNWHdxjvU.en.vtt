 gently to create a braid 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.320

 more natural finish and longer subject 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.950
 with an elastic 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.350

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.659

 starting with the sections below 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.960
 heat the braids with the dryer 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.149
 using a downward movement that 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.490
 go from the scalp to the 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.500
 tips reserve the sections above 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.990
 for the end let the 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.179
 braids completely before moving on to 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.340
 next step you have to undo the 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.350

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.450

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.850

 that will help to release the curl combs with 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.200
 fingers until you get the look that 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.880
 you want but do not exaggerate if you work 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.670
 too much hair is added 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.799
