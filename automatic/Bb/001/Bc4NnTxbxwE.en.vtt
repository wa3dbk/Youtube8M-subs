00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.550
 do you ever lose as 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.210
 your money earned 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.310
 how to spend it to make a profit in 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.460
 what currency to keep your reservation 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.769
 intangible let's think together what is 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.619
 the money and how much is our 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.720
 work never the money is enough 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.110
 although every year we earn more money never 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.909
 We have the necessary because every year 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.769
 we see that the prices of 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:42.690
 communities and services but the 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.790
 money is continually depreciating 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.530
 and our work does not get easier 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.129
 to earn the same amount of money 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.899
 because we keep buying the food 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.370
 because it 's an agreement anyway 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.030
 necessary and advantageous for us 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.820
 for example every month we charge 500 euros 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.290
 with that amount we can buy 50 kilos 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.509
 of meat each year we earn six thousand euros 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.479
 with that amount we can buy 600 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.490
 kilos of meat suppose that the interest 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.180
 annual inflation is about 10 per 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.940
 hundred 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.090
 that way the 10 percent will be 60 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.730
 kilograms of meat equals more than the salary 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.280
 monthly one year you're fed up with 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.700
 work for free a whole month of the year 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.140
 you are happy that they bite a part 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.050
 more than your honestly chipped livestock 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.060
 from birth they have educated us to 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.250
 make money like all the people who 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.260
 let's comply with a training we 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.540
 let's put in a good position and let's be 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.940
 good productive workers is 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.250
 lie we spent time on the side 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.140
 opposite of the barricade let's see how 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.509
 we can save our piece of 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.250
 meat we can do with the money 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.020
 so that we do not lose in costs of 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.030
 our work 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.730
 the same as those who bite their 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.770
 piece every year buy gold 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.049
 Y 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.630
 We do not talk about buying a few kilos of gold 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:11.630
 immediately it is possible to increase your reservation 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.030
 gold staff starting with a gram 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.070
 today thanks to the development of 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.890
 communications on the internet people 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.930
 now they have some possibilities 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.330
 completely new the online store 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.160
 in walk decks offers its customers the 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.650
 possibility of buying gold bullion 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.110
 fun in the amount they create 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.720
 possible according to the monetary resources of 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.880
 each the price of gold is the 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.950
 same as in the market that's why the 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.870
 people can buy and sell their 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.150
 personal gold reserves without 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.760
 restrictions in addition using the program 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.590
 of bonds it is possible to receive amounts 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.740
 additional gold or perform 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.380
 recommendations successes but when and 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.570
 how to buy gold trends 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.910
 global growth and decline 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.980
 price per gram are caused by 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.720
 many factors including 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.090
 fluctuations in the prices of 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.280
 currency but following the diagram 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.530
 investment gold cost during a 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.900
 long term will be possible not only 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.930

 buys gold permanently both high 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.120
 as in price drop 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.220
 will buy it for the average price 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.519
 because guess the lowest quote 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.620
 it is quite difficult in this way not 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.569
 have no risk before the possible 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.780
 fluctuations of quotation as their 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.190
 benefits has already earned them freedom from 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.520
