00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:20.550
 1,255 thread and today I bring you another game 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.250
 in this case it's nova I think a lot of 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.529
 you already know this game is one 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.029
 of the best games that gameloft has 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.700
 because because it 's action and science 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.200
 fiction and horror ok 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.690
 Well, it's not so terrifying, but it's 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.059
 science fiction ok good first thing 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.070
 have to do is leave a link in the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.710
 description of the video where is the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.600
 ap file kyle the data this and we 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.739
 we go to our file plans and 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.620
 the data that will go on sd card and on 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.170
 gameloft gameloft remember that if not 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.680

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.079
 ok and inside of gameloft will be another one that 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.180
 It called game if you do not have also 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.920
 the created or within the game will 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.670
 sd data no 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:13.060
 well, having this, it would only be enough 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.939
 install the ap file here we install 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.729

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:22.390
 I have the game or we left and already 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:25.780

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.810
 Okey game such that to say that for 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.939
 that do not have the break and I use with 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.580
 these games this I recommend you 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.920

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.860
 to serve 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.580
 I do not use it because if I get hold of 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.670

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.300

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:53.770

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.410

 Spanish and that's fine for what 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.879

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.610
