exactly<00:04:30.380> the<00:04:30.620> same<00:04:30.830> speed<00:04:31.190> you<00:04:31.789> don't<00:04:31.970> you<00:04:32.090> can

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
exactly the same speed you don't you can

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.820 
exactly the same speed you don't you can
kind<00:04:32.419> of<00:04:32.509> space<00:04:32.780> everything<00:04:33.199> correctly<00:04:33.530> in
