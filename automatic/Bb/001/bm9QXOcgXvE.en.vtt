the Kershaw injection 3.0 and 3.5 we

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.490 
the Kershaw injection 3.0 and 3.5 we
thought<00:00:06.180> we'd<00:00:06.330> do<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.450> quick<00:00:06.750> side-by-side

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
comparison you know you can read the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.970 
comparison you know you can read the
specs<00:00:09.450> but<00:00:10.110> sometimes<00:00:10.380> it's<00:00:10.469> nice<00:00:10.559> just<00:00:10.620> to

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
specs but sometimes it's nice just to
