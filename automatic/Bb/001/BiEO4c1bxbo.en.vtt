00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.310 

my

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
my

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.819 
my
right<00:00:47.160> there<00:00:48.030> sure<00:00:48.390> are<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.750> lot<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.260> sea

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
right there sure are a lot of sea

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.150 
right there sure are a lot of sea
creatures<00:00:50.460> here<00:00:50.789> well<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:52.079> guess<00:00:52.680> we're<00:00:52.920> gonna

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
creatures here well I guess we're gonna

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.569 
creatures here well I guess we're gonna
have<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.699> relocate<00:00:54.239> them<00:00:54.989> well<00:00:55.860> before<00:00:56.340> we

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
have to relocate them well before we

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.500 
have to relocate them well before we
move<00:00:56.610> them

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
move them

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.840 
move them
I<00:00:57.539> suppose<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.590> should<00:00:58.620> go<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.219> ask<00:00:59.399> them<00:00:59.820> if

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
I suppose we should go and ask them if

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.609 
I suppose we should go and ask them if
they<00:01:00.239> want<00:01:00.510> they<00:01:01.140> moved<00:01:01.530> hey<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.489> guys<00:01:03.619> we're
