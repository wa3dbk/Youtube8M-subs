you<00:01:51.659> might<00:01:52.020> see<00:01:52.350> here<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.920> vallejo

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
you might see here that the vallejo

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.980 
you might see here that the vallejo
action<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.030> forward<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.479> little<00:01:54.840> bit

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
action for the forward is a little bit

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.410

different and let me explain why after
we<00:01:58.049> come<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.380> collect<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.770> feet<00:01:59.070> we're<00:01:59.490> going

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
we come and collect the feet we're going

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.940 
we come and collect the feet we're going
to<00:01:59.670> do<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> spiraling<00:02:00.570> action<00:02:01.140> into<00:02:01.799> this

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
to do a spiraling action into this

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.280 
to do a spiraling action into this
forward<00:02:02.520> cross<00:02:02.909> or<00:02:03.270> forward<00:02:03.780> we<00:02:03.930> might<00:02:04.110> call

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
forward cross or forward we might call

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.039 
forward cross or forward we might call
it<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.530> forward<00:02:04.890> vallejo<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.270> back<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:06.960> a

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
it a forward vallejo so it's back in a

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.010 
it a forward vallejo so it's back in a
normal<00:02:07.530> vallejo<00:02:07.860> action<00:02:08.899> collecting<00:02:09.899> the

could be split as well we transfer our

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.290 
could be split as well we transfer our
way<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.410> right<00:03:34.700> rotating<00:03:35.700> our<00:03:35.820> body<00:03:36.090> to

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
way to the right rotating our body to

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.630 
way to the right rotating our body to
the<00:03:36.390> left<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:36.900> creates<00:03:37.260> that<00:03:37.350> belay<00:03:37.770> us<00:03:37.950> so

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
the left that creates that belay us so

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.320 
the left that creates that belay us so
we<00:03:38.730> time<00:03:39.030> for<00:03:39.239> bolero<00:03:39.570> action<00:03:41.030> with<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.150> leg

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
we time for bolero action with the leg

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.900 
we time for bolero action with the leg
moving<00:03:42.660> at<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.870> same<00:03:43.080> time<00:03:43.440> so<00:03:43.980> when<00:03:44.160> her<00:03:44.370> left

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910

our<00:03:50.790> right<00:03:51.360> foot<00:03:51.630> is<00:03:51.840> going<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:52.920> side<00:03:53.270> we

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
our right foot is going to the side we

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.940 
our right foot is going to the side we
rotate<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.840> left<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.440> creates<00:03:55.770> the

rotate to the left that creates the
belay<00:03:56.280> oh<00:03:56.630> now<00:03:57.630> we<00:03:57.750> can<00:03:57.900> do<00:03:58.020> this<00:03:58.140> as<00:03:58.350> many

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
belay oh now we can do this as many

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:09.530 
belay oh now we can do this as many
times<00:03:58.800> as<00:03:59.250> we<00:03:59.310> wish

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
oh it's easy to for the leader to begin

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.159 
oh it's easy to for the leader to begin
the<00:04:20.400> exit<00:04:20.970> rather<00:04:21.239> than<00:04:21.479> doing<00:04:21.630> any<00:04:21.900> more
