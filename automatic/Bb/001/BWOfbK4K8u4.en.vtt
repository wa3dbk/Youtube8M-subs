00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 do not 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.580
 in the union 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:13.189
 they were positive in their vote component brand product 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.419
 is well positioned 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:19.800
 by any place where I move, you talk about isophoton 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.800
 and everyone knows the company 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.480
 it is what we put in value by entering 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.429
 in the manufacturing processes 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.429
 the module 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.140
 what we make 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.000
 and the cell 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.210
 technically and in terms of quality is a module 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.110
 higher in the market standards by asia ie isophoton 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.060
 maybe the cost that was where we had the main problem 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.590
 I was crazy 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.030
 but the kun omen 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.770
 so what we saw is that what we have to do is continue to follow 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.120
 making that module with that quality 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.190
 but otty half the cost 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.440
 in relation to the situation 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.930
 what we saw in isophoton that calmness to the product is good 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.650
 the brand is p 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.110
 positioned 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.760
 and the market is growing in Spain 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.760
 but outside we were seeing that yes 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.240
 we got to work on those three points which is a bit the 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.760
 the key to success 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.280
 the operations photo 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.000
 his photo 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.050
 many deficiencies 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.920
 in the manufacturing process 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.020
 that caused what is called extracostes is to say 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.580
 if you wafers you receive 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.600
 portu manufacturing process 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.420
 they never become cells, that is, for a wastebasket 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.150
 the losses 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.320
 Those are 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.300
 Many 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.460
 million euros in the case these acts 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.289
 what he did 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.170
 p so to speak our Korean partner is 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.170
 optimize company eliyahu 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.430
 manufacturing processes 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.400
 order picture andes 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.300
 I was in many markets 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.750
 where there is no market 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.700
 but neither is it expected 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.040
 and yet we are in markets where what we had to do was reinforce 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.559
 our presence 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:14.779
 3 an optimization of the general expense of the company 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:18.059
 has been carried out and it is still coming to tavo 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.230
 has started with epo replaced the entire management team is today saying 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.289
 I can say 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:26.589
 that all the management team of them is worth the first line 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:29.329
 they are no longer of the previous 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.639
 and there I can tell you in comparison to what was before this 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.839
 we have brought cheaper people 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:39.269
 menéndez is to say people who come more than to work 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.639
 to things a little bit the results in the next 3 to 5 years this is going to 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:44.459
 turn around 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.869
 two-thirds 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:48.509
 will be in the united states and china 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:50.799
 or on that axis so to speak 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.739
 and a third bastad 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:53.679
 With which 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:56.109
 if you want to supply those markets 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.359
 the logical thing is to grow healthy 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.109
 because if not the transportation costs 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:06.519
 the currency risks and all that start yes that's why our plan 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.589
 increase 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:10.779
 we say if we want to attack the American market 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:14.179
 if we want to attack the Chinese market ximénez 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:17.629
 because the plants the campaign we currently have here 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.889
 can grow but seeing 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.639
 the european market 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.059
 middle East 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:27.699
 Africa is the strategy that has been defined is the correct one for this sector 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.720
 We are happy with the company, mainly with the staff 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.949
 efe I see 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:36.389
 We came to live to call the Iraqi people of Madrid understood 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.709
 I wanted to be there because if there are problems here we are better 2% 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.719
 practically the entire workforce 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.799
 with which we are side by side with them 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.739
 I can tell you that every day since you leave happy it's not interesting to know all 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.439
 the truth in this subject 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.979
 Well then because I and I fundamentally think that there are others 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:02.189
 created interests is to say you have to realize that I talk about the sector 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:03.009
 electric 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:06.919
 right now he has no interest in the photovoltaic sector as well as what 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.719
 has in the wind sector 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:11.619
 then when it is established to the side 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.869
 what will you talk about the crisis situation in general 

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:18.079
 in the letter is smaller at the time of distributing 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.909
 well hey let's go demonize one be good officer to others so that the 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:24.910
 letter is bigger threat for me the matte paper for you 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.999
 let's put data or figures on the table 

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:30.389
 although the year 2009 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.860
 year that has been a horrible year lissavetzky in Spain the sector 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.050
 photovoltaic that is with a decree 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.110
 good one was cut was cut in 2008 that affected 2009 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.799
 the world power installed spoke the global were 7 gigawatts 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.409
 in 2010 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:49.699
 this year that has ended have been 15 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.650
 that the sector has grown 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.590
 in spite of spain p this from japan and live all this topic well it serves better 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.050
 for someone to realize 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.830
 p if this had not happened 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.440
 What I'm seeing outside of Spain is that there is a tendency that 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:05.349
 you can stop 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:10.110
 3 at the end because I am one of those who thinks of who reason will enter the 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.099
 system 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.579
 and vested interests or particular interests as he 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.860
 me and I can tell you that he slid photon 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.860
 90% of our turnover is outside of Spain 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:25.110
 where are you going to make tomorrow investments in the future 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.270
 well, in those countries that 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.620
 here yes support us for what you are going to do supports what are you going to do 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.059
 investments 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:35.770
 you can make additional investments so this nation of the world is 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.860
 I'm telling you 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.219
 look at the official data that is published on market growth 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:42.610
 The expectations 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.539
 look at what investments are being made 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:48.539
 the 10 and first companies that are in the world in this sector 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:51.850
 and you from the board where jobs are being generated 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.809
 why do not you do them here 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:54.740
 very easy 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.300
 you have legislation that can link 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.889
 to the minute now 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.350
 you understand the financing from the banks 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.600
 percent is cut 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.009
 to this sector 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:07.909
 at all levels the factory because it manufactures 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.909
 to the installer because there is a lador 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.610
 live there is no funding for this 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.449
 excuse that banks put 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:19.400
 the regulatory uncertainty 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.790
 7 you move with a decree that you have changed it and that on top of it is the 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.889
 new decree still very old 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:26.669
 open 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:28.379
 Possible changes 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:30.199
 it is not going to invest here 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:33.589
 the debate right now that you have to put on the table is that 

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:35.960
 If our mix is ​​this energetic 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.470
 that we currently have 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.849
 is the right one and which one we want to develop 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:41.419
 and if we want to give 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:44.840
 an important weight to the renewable ones and spoke of all 

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:50.680
 what to each technology and I would do it based on the contribution that 

00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:54.449
 have the industry pif the industry is already 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:56.259
 focused coast 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:58.939
 all that about these expensive is cheap 

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:00.319
 it is not true 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:04.399
 the industra station 2 important ports for cost reduction 

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:07.349
 and I tell you that in the next two years 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:09.240
 we will arrive at what we call 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.789
 the crit parity 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:13.219
 from the east sector that means 

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:15.050
 that the energy produced 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.819
 of photovoltaic origin does not matter 

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:22.330
 that any other act in 2008 here in Spain became three thousand 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.330
 500 megawatts in 2009 69 

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:29.949
 how do you explain that he has been able to survive 

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:34.150
 say that in Spain everything counts that our main customers in Spain 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.479
 they were small and swindlers 

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:39.939
 that were dedicated to make parks place the plates 

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:41.699
 but I love you from the manufacturer 

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:43.050
 the company like ours 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.090
 spoke of installation companies that are going to assemble modules 

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:48.300
 all have disappeared 

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.810
 if nothing has been done as they are going to review there is another site 

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.610
 despite this 

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.909
 it was pretended that this me that I am has not been understood 

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:58.089
 it was not understood well 

00:07:58.089 --> 00:07:59.570
 especially in a context 

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.839
 because if you say today to efe 

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:03.519
 is that we were the only ones
