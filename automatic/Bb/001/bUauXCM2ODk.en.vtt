I'll show you how I made my Borg cube so
we're<00:00:34.500> at<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.860> create<00:00:35.520> spaceship<00:00:36.530> screen<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.479 
so for the body you click the cube and
then<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.690> use<00:00:45.930> your<00:00:46.170> scroll<00:00:46.559> wheel<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.129> your

then you use your scroll wheel on your
mouse<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:48.120> make<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.480> as<00:00:48.570> big<00:00:48.750> as<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.080> can<00:00:49.110> and

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
mouse to make it as big as you can and

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.950 
mouse to make it as big as you can and
then<00:00:51.269> click<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:51.900> the<00:00:52.080> paint<00:00:52.350> button<00:00:53.780> and<00:00:54.780> we

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
then click on the paint button and we

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.990 
then click on the paint button and we
don't<00:00:55.170> want<00:00:55.320> one<00:00:55.470> of<00:00:55.500> these<00:00:55.769> complete<00:00:56.400> styles

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
don't want one of these complete styles

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.640 
don't want one of these complete styles
we<00:00:57.210> want<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.480> paint<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.960> with<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.290> a<00:00:58.410> pattern

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
we want to paint it with just a pattern

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.030 
we want to paint it with just a pattern
so<00:00:59.010> click<00:00:59.220> on<00:00:59.309> paintbrush<00:01:00.030> mode<00:01:00.360> and<00:01:02.750> then

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
so click on paintbrush mode and then

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:12.530 
so click on paintbrush mode and then
notice<00:01:05.040> I'm<00:01:05.190> on<00:01:05.339> screen<00:01:05.700> 4<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.240> 6<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:11.270> I<00:01:12.270> use

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
notice I'm on screen 4 of 6 and I use

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.340 
notice I'm on screen 4 of 6 and I use
this<00:01:12.750> one<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.320> my<00:01:13.470> first<00:01:13.740> video<00:01:14.720> but<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.780> think

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
this one in my first video but I think

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.450 
this one in my first video but I think
we<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.619> do<00:01:16.710> better<00:01:16.890> than<00:01:17.070> that

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
we can do better than that

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.030 
we can do better than that
I<00:01:17.490> think<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:18.060> pattern<00:01:18.479> here<00:01:19.020> looks<00:01:19.740> more

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
I think this pattern here looks more

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.750 
I think this pattern here looks more
Borg<00:01:20.280> ish<00:01:23.390> ok<00:01:24.920> so<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.070> already<00:01:26.189> looks<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.729> bit

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
Borg ish ok so that already looks a bit

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.300 
Borg ish ok so that already looks a bit
like<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.060> Borg<00:01:27.390> but<00:01:27.860> dissembling<00:01:28.860> which<00:01:29.100> I've

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
like a Borg but dissembling which I've

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.160 
like a Borg but dissembling which I've
discovered<00:01:29.700> looks<00:01:30.030> Borg<00:01:30.330> ish<00:01:30.540> as<00:01:30.780> well<00:01:30.960> which

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
discovered looks Borg ish as well which

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.070 
discovered looks Borg ish as well which
we<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.470> add<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.330> now<00:01:33.330> go<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.659> effect

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
we can add on to it now go to effect

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.620 
we can add on to it now go to effect
here<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:36.950> then<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.369> think<00:01:38.969> the<00:01:39.060> ring<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.390> lights

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
here and then I think the ring of lights

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.370 
here and then I think the ring of lights
okay<00:01:40.549> so<00:01:41.549> we<00:01:41.640> can<00:01:41.759> put<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.090> wherever<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.840> want

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
okay so we can put that wherever we want

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.770 
okay so we can put that wherever we want
now<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.310> too<00:01:44.490> big<00:01:44.700> there<00:01:44.939> but<00:01:45.240> if<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.450> click<00:01:45.509> on

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
now it's too big there but if I click on

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.230 
now it's too big there but if I click on
it<00:01:45.899> again<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.460> use<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.490> mouse<00:01:47.789> scroll<00:01:48.179> wheel

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
it again and use the mouse scroll wheel

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.410 
it again and use the mouse scroll wheel
I<00:01:48.810> can<00:01:49.140> shrink<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:51.829> and<00:01:52.829> if<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.670> shrink<00:01:53.880> it

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
I can shrink it and if you shrink it

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.429 
I can shrink it and if you shrink it
oopsy-daisy<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:56.840> think<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.960> looks<00:01:58.170> but

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
oopsy-daisy I think that looks but

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.940 
oopsy-daisy I think that looks but
vaguely<00:01:59.009> Borg<00:01:59.429> ish<00:01:59.670> you<00:02:00.450> might<00:02:00.630> disagree<00:02:00.950> then

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
vaguely Borg ish you might disagree then

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.020 
vaguely Borg ish you might disagree then
the<00:02:02.039> other<00:02:02.189> thing<00:02:02.490> which<00:02:02.609> looks<00:02:02.819> really

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
the other thing which looks really

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.760 
the other thing which looks really
Baugus<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.840> here<00:02:04.469> under<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> detail<00:02:05.219> tab<00:02:05.670> and

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
Baugus is here under the detail tab and

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.749 
Baugus is here under the detail tab and
it's<00:02:07.770> actually<00:02:08.100> this<00:02:08.220> thing<00:02:08.280> here<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
it's actually this thing here the

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.390 
it's actually this thing here the
space-time<00:02:09.360> grille<00:02:09.920> now<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.100> doesn't<00:02:11.280> look

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
space-time grille now that doesn't look

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.940 
space-time grille now that doesn't look
right<00:02:11.640> at<00:02:11.790> all<00:02:12.140> but<00:02:13.140> once<00:02:13.319> we've<00:02:13.530> put<00:02:13.740> it<00:02:13.830> on

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
right at all but once we've put it on

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.090 
right at all but once we've put it on
there<00:02:14.190> just<00:02:15.090> click<00:02:15.240> on<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.510> again<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:16.100> then

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
there just click on it again and then

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.620 
there just click on it again and then
you<00:02:17.130> use<00:02:17.340> your<00:02:17.370> mouse<00:02:17.730> scroll<00:02:18.090> wheel<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.510> make

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
you use your mouse scroll wheel to make

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.380 
you use your mouse scroll wheel to make
it<00:02:18.750> really<00:02:19.200> really<00:02:19.470> small<00:02:20.030> small<00:02:21.030> as<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.360> can

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
it really really small small as you can

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.890 
it really really small small as you can
get<00:02:21.630> it

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.870 

see<00:02:25.900> now<00:02:26.020> that<00:02:26.050> looks<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:26.440> bit<00:02:26.470> buggy<00:02:26.770> and<00:02:27.460> then

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
see now that looks a bit buggy and then

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.710 
see now that looks a bit buggy and then
we<00:02:28.000> drag<00:02:28.270> it<00:02:28.390> up<00:02:28.570> a<00:02:28.750> bit<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:30.210> we<00:02:31.210> drag<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.540> along

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
we drag it up a bit and we drag it along

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.970 
we drag it up a bit and we drag it along
a<00:02:31.900> bit<00:02:32.910> okay<00:02:33.910> now<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.120> me<00:02:34.480> that's<00:02:35.020> very<00:02:35.440> buggy

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
a bit okay now to me that's very buggy

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.820 
a bit okay now to me that's very buggy
and<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:37.450> if<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.660> put<00:02:37.840> heaps<00:02:38.050> of<00:02:38.200> them<00:02:38.230> on<00:02:38.530> and

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
and so if you put heaps of them on and

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.870 
and so if you put heaps of them on and
just<00:02:39.490> do<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.730> same<00:02:39.760> thing<00:02:44.490> it<00:02:45.490> looks<00:02:45.730> like

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
just do the same thing it looks like

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.800 
just do the same thing it looks like
little<00:02:46.060> slots<00:02:46.390> where<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.720> ball<00:02:46.900> might<00:02:47.140> go

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
little slots where the ball might go

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.110 
little slots where the ball might go
alright<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:50.080> that's<00:02:50.440> a<00:02:50.830> couple<00:02:51.490> of<00:02:51.640> ideas<00:02:51.760> to

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
alright so that's a couple of ideas to

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.260 
alright so that's a couple of ideas to
get<00:02:52.240> you<00:02:52.360> going<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.990> I<00:02:53.710> can't<00:02:53.950> wait<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.250> see<00:02:54.460> if

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
get you going and I can't wait to see if

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.390 
get you going and I can't wait to see if
anyone<00:02:55.780> responds<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:56.680> if<00:02:56.800> you<00:02:56.920> do<00:02:57.070> what'd<00:02:57.310> you

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
anyone responds and if you do what'd you

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.730 
anyone responds and if you do what'd you
come<00:02:57.580> up<00:02:57.610> with
