 Translator: ali alshalali Checker: khalid marbou 

00:00:06.327 --> 00:00:07.484
 We all watched movies 

00:00:07.484 --> 00:00:09.729
 Spin about the horrible insects of outer space 

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:12.294
 Or stories of kidnapping by green men 

00:00:12.294 --> 00:00:14.325
 But the study of life in the universe, 

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:16.995
 Including the possibility of extraterrestrial life, 

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:20.087
 It is also a serious scientific endeavor. 

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:23.267
 Space biology is based on various areas, 

00:00:23.267 --> 00:00:24.160
 Such as physics, 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.185
 And biology 

00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:26.170
 And astronomy 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.182
 Geology, 

00:00:27.182 --> 00:00:29.351
 To study how life was formed on Earth, 

00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:31.013
 How can it be formed elsewhere, 

00:00:31.013 --> 00:00:32.895
 And how we can monitor them. 

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:35.191
 Many ancient religions are described 

00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:38.105
 Other worlds inhabited by humans, 

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.074
 But these are like the legendary worlds 

00:00:40.074 --> 00:00:41.517
 Or parallel universes 

00:00:41.517 --> 00:00:42.813
 With other planets present 

00:00:42.813 --> 00:00:44.613
 In the physical world itself. 

00:00:44.613 --> 00:00:46.434
 Only in the last century 

00:00:46.434 --> 00:00:47.604
 Enables scientists 

00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:49.183
 From doing serious research 

00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:51.384
 About life outside the planet. 

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.296
 We know it at the simplest level 

00:00:53.296 --> 00:00:55.452
 Living organisms on earth need three things: 

00:00:55.452 --> 00:00:56.345
 Liquid water, 

00:00:56.345 --> 00:00:57.547
 Energy source, 

00:00:57.547 --> 00:01:00.005
 Organic matter, carbon. 

00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:01.376
 We also know that Earth 

00:01:01.376 --> 00:01:03.336
 Are at a convenient distance from the sun, 

00:01:03.336 --> 00:01:06.264
 So that they are not either frozen or fused. 

00:01:06.264 --> 00:01:08.389
 Thus the planets are located at an appropriate distance 

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:09.643
 Of its own stars 

00:01:09.643 --> 00:01:11.880
 May be able to support life. 

00:01:13.187 --> 00:01:14.349
 But we thought 

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:15.521
 Life can only exist 

00:01:15.521 --> 00:01:17.402
 In such terrestrial-like environments, 

00:01:17.402 --> 00:01:20.124
 One of the astounding discoveries of astrological biology 

00:01:20.124 --> 00:01:22.526
 It was about the diversity of life. 

00:01:22.526 --> 00:01:24.426
 We now know that life can thrive 

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:26.247
 In some of the most extreme environments 

00:01:26.247 --> 00:01:28.607
 Which may be fatal to known organisms. 

00:01:28.607 --> 00:01:30.419
 Life is found everywhere, 

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:32.551
 In the black smoke of hydrothermal vents 

00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:34.605
 In the dark depths of the Earth's oceans, 

00:01:34.605 --> 00:01:36.602
 For hot and acidic springs 

00:01:36.602 --> 00:01:38.273
 At the foot of the volcanoes, 

00:01:38.273 --> 00:01:40.654
 Higher altitude in the atmosphere. 

00:01:40.654 --> 00:01:43.134
 Living organisms living in such difficult circumstances 

00:01:43.134 --> 00:01:45.184
 Called extrimovil (severe conditions) 

00:01:45.184 --> 00:01:46.791
 They can survive at maximum 

00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:47.636
 Temperatures 

00:01:47.636 --> 00:01:48.437
 And pressure 

00:01:48.437 --> 00:01:49.434
 Radiation, 

00:01:49.434 --> 00:01:50.470
 In addition to salinity, 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.386
 Acidity, 

00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:53.629
 Even in limited availability of sunlight 

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:54.498
 Or water, 

00:01:54.498 --> 00:01:55.881
 Or oxygen. 

00:01:56.988 --> 00:01:59.345
 What is the special thing about Extrimoville? 

00:01:59.345 --> 00:02:01.399
 It has been found in thriving environments 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.697
 Emulate those that exist in the worlds of space objects. 

00:02:03.697 --> 00:02:05.908
 One of the most important of these worlds 

00:02:05.908 --> 00:02:08.681
 It is our red and dusty neighbor, Mars. 

00:02:08.681 --> 00:02:11.736
 Today, astronomy is exploring places 

00:02:11.736 --> 00:02:14.228
 Which may have existed in the past in Mars 

00:02:14.228 --> 00:02:16.534
 Using a NASA probe. 

00:02:16.534 --> 00:02:18.333
 One of those is "Gail nozzle", 

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.062
 Nozzle established 

00:02:20.062 --> 00:02:21.589
 When the Meteor struck the surface of Mars 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:24.271
 About 3.8 billion years ago. 

00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:27.671
 The evidence from the orbit indicates the ancient effects of water, 

00:02:27.671 --> 00:02:28.763
 Which means that the nozzle 

00:02:28.763 --> 00:02:31.185
 Perhaps life has already been supported 

00:02:31.185 --> 00:02:32.841
 Planets are not the only places 

00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:34.928
 Which was researched by astronomy. 

00:02:34.928 --> 00:02:37.518
 For example, "Europa" is one of the satellites of Jupiter, 

00:02:37.518 --> 00:02:39.200
 And "Enceladus" and "Titan" 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.349
 Two moons of Saturn, 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.595
 All are exciting possibilities. 

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:45.018
 Although these satellites are very cold 

00:02:45.018 --> 00:02:46.847
 Two of which are covered with thick ice, 

00:02:46.847 --> 00:02:50.028
 There is evidence for liquid oceans under the crust. 

00:02:50.028 --> 00:02:52.950
 It is possible that there is life in those oceans, 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.199
 Or Aisha can be around black smoke vents 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.838
 At the bottom? 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:59.321
 Titan is particularly promising 

00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:00.465
 It also contains an atmosphere 

00:03:00.465 --> 00:03:02.745
 Similar to land as well as lakes, rivers and seas 

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:04.496
 Flowing across the surface. 

00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:05.929
 It is very cold, however, 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:07.545
 Very cool waterproof liquid, 

00:03:07.545 --> 00:03:09.382
 So those rivers instead can flow 

00:03:09.382 --> 00:03:10.657
 With liquid hydrocarbons 

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:12.953
 Such as methane and ethane. 

00:03:12.953 --> 00:03:14.915
 These consist of hydrogen, 

00:03:14.915 --> 00:03:16.943
 More importantly, carbon, 

00:03:16.943 --> 00:03:18.480
 It is a basic construction block 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.255
 For all forms of life as we know them. 

00:03:20.255 --> 00:03:22.969
 So, could you find life in these lakes? 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:24.842
 Although the shuttle is being designed 

00:03:24.842 --> 00:03:26.513
 To study these distant worlds, 

00:03:26.513 --> 00:03:28.347
 It may take many years to build 

00:03:28.347 --> 00:03:29.537
 And even longer to get them 

00:03:29.537 --> 00:03:31.134
 Where they must be. 

00:03:31.134 --> 00:03:33.188
 At the same time, astronomy works 

00:03:33.188 --> 00:03:35.849
 In private natural laboratories on Earth, 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.108
 To learn about exotic things 

00:03:37.108 --> 00:03:39.379
 And wonderful forms of life that can exist 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:40.832
 And to help us answer one day 

00:03:40.832 --> 00:03:43.065
 On one of the oldest human questions: 

00:03:43.065 --> 00:03:44.614
 Are we alone?
