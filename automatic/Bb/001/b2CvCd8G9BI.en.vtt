00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:08.170
 this is the top 100 of video games 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.170
 inspector favorites 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.750
 number 64 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.520
 to the vine 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.250
 definitely the best time of the 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.590
 combination of capcom and disney was the 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.410
 nintendo but the super nintendo also 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.820
 he had his jewels and this game was the most 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.190
 big among all 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.980
 Aladdin was one of those games that you do not 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.949
 you could lose in his times it was almost 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.750
 a must buy there was a version 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.900
 to seal and another one for super nintendo 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.090
 which were very different but I must 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.640
 say that my favorite was the super 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.680
 Nintendo is one of those games in the 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.800
 you see variety between scene and scene 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.440
 the level design of this game was 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.229
 simply masterful and enjoyed it 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.930
 even without being very skillful but the game 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.940
 I taught you quickly how to do it 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.400
 everything the game added was 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.530
 fun from his visions to his 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.140
 forms I think my favorite part of 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.390
 game is when you replicate the scene in the 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.970
 that lavÃ­n and jasmine sing in the 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.130
 movie is a spectacular moment that 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.619
 they practically translated it equally from the 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.780
 Movie to game is a perfect game 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.880
 that reminds you that sometime in the 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.579
 history games based on 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.250
 it was a matter of respect and they made you 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.700
 expect something spectacular instead of 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.700
 contrary 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.759
