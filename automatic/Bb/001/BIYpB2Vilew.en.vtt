that<00:00:25.590> from<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.580> first<00:00:26.849> case<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.180> you

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
that from the first case that you

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.779 
that from the first case that you
encounter<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:28.949> kind<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.220> surprise<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.209 
encounter and we kind of surprise the
visitor<00:00:30.300> here<00:00:30.630> because<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.590> don't<00:00:31.769> find<00:00:32.040> gold

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
visitor here because we don't find gold

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.389 
visitor here because we don't find gold
pieces<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.210> case<00:00:33.540> we<00:00:34.020> find<00:00:34.230> ceramics<00:00:35.010> and

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
pieces in that case we find ceramics and

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.479 
pieces in that case we find ceramics and
stone<00:00:35.760> works<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.530> breaking<00:00:37.860> kind<00:00:38.399> of

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
stone works so this is breaking kind of

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.209 
stone works so this is breaking kind of
piece<00:00:38.730> made<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.390> preconception<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.590> all

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
piece made this preconception that all
