00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
but so now I got my my AC 130 and and

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.930 
but so now I got my my AC 130 and and
you<00:03:24.660> know<00:03:24.690> usually<00:03:25.430> team<00:03:26.430> death<00:03:26.580> match<00:03:26.610> up

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
you know usually team death match up

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.820 
you know usually team death match up
with<00:03:27.000> a<00:03:27.120> c-130<00:03:27.600> can<00:03:27.810> be<00:03:27.870> difficult<00:03:28.050> because

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
with a c-130 can be difficult because

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.680 
with a c-130 can be difficult because
your<00:03:29.220> enemy<00:03:29.519> your<00:03:29.760> enemies<00:03:30.120> spawn<00:03:30.450> randomly

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690

your enemy your enemies spawn randomly
all<00:03:31.170> around<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.709> you<00:03:32.220> do<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.489> same<00:03:32.519> thing

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
all around and you do the same thing

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.960 
all around and you do the same thing
with<00:03:33.450> your<00:03:33.570> teammates<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:35.310> sometimes<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:35.880> can

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
with your teammates so sometimes it can

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.220 
with your teammates so sometimes it can
be<00:03:36.000> difficult<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:36.570> I<00:03:36.630> was<00:03:36.780> able<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:37.019> pull<00:03:37.200> it

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
my chopper instead I just I don't know

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.860 
my chopper instead I just I don't know
why<00:03:52.830> I<00:03:52.890> feel<00:03:53.040> like<00:03:53.160> I've<00:03:53.310> better<00:03:53.489> luck<00:03:53.780> you<00:03:54.780> can

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
why I feel like I've better luck you can

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.570

with<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.570> chopper<00:03:57.989> and<00:03:58.230> that's<00:03:58.410> probably

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
with the chopper and that's probably

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.640 
with the chopper and that's probably
more<00:03:59.310> what<00:04:00.239> it<00:04:00.360> like<00:04:01.050> it's<00:04:01.230> probably<00:04:01.470> better

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
more what it like it's probably better
