00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
so good to make sure that we clean

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.560 
so good to make sure that we clean
regularly<00:01:09.750> because<00:01:10.380> if<00:01:10.650> not<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.729> product<00:01:12.240> has

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
regularly because if not the product has

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.020 
regularly because if not the product has
hardened<00:01:13.320> which<00:01:13.950> makes<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.460> much<00:01:14.760> more

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
hardened which makes it much more

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.890 
hardened which makes it much more
difficult<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.840> get<00:01:16.020> off<00:01:17.090> more<00:01:18.090> work<00:01:18.479> means

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
difficult to get off more work means

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.219 
difficult to get off more work means
more<00:01:19.320> time

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
more time

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.690 
more time
so<00:01:22.229> once<00:01:22.439> I've<00:01:22.590> cleaned<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.040> surface<00:01:23.460> really

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
so once I've cleaned that surface really

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.249 
so once I've cleaned that surface really
good<00:01:24.030> I'll<00:01:24.750> follow<00:01:25.110> up<00:01:25.229> lastly<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> q-tip
