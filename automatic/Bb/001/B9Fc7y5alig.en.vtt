00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.150
 good evening good found live on the scagliotti channel I have 5 5 black arrow 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.860
 it is 9 pm a few minutes back like every Thursday laib 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.450
 the appointment with black on white hobby advance immediately the 52nd episode from 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.650
 when there is television the 29th season so I occasionally avoid myself 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.580
 I gladly stop and owe the particular beers that are found there 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.700
 interval hours and said an important historical experience and provides copying 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.659
 details we mentioned 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:18.520
 of countries 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.460
 I said Germans from the Chinese because they are maybe a little more I do a 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.660
 but we hope there are some emerging countries in the beer world 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.700
 as in wine we have seen at vinitaly type 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.960
 but there are certainly emerging countries like Italy 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.880
 because Italy is currently saying it's big on the pitch 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.620
 quality at all quality 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.920
 these are the lament of all these 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.410
 small chills these microbreweries I know almost 150 lately then numbers 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.870
 have arrived 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.560
 more or less water euro 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.060
 it's nice to hear all this 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.640
 effervescence all this interest 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.850
 and which then corresponds to the great curiosity of the public 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.950
 because the public is responding a way 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.920
 that's so surprising 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.790
 but here is what he meant or wanted to do with this I allow myself to 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.569
 to complete what I had told, I started to tell 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.419
 in Europe there are 3 cultural CPs, ie IP braids 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.699
 which they produce 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:24.209
 these 300i 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.439
 all three of them make a blonde beer, but all three produce it 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.239
 a different way from the other 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.630
 I refer to the Anglo-Saxon cepu 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.099
 to that baby don't have you seen at that 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.129
 Teutonic 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.099
 all the countries that come from the network or tonic are all there recently 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.920
 from that former area we say so 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.509
 Habsburg now 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:52.129
 bho imagine that these three produce a blonde blonde child girl reads if 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.500
 we didn't have the opportunity to have our table over 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.559
 or you can do the house yourself 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:59.139
 oh the next time that 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:00.609
 andre t a little 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:06.550
 pears and try 3 blond beers an English lagher one instead veridiana 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.220
 and another German will feel that she survives completely different 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:13.339
 this says a lot because 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:14.429
 why the 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:18.279
 the cultural world that all that can be modeled is not 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:19.239
 only 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.809
 made of marks 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:25.340
 of brains famous more or less but it is also made of so much passion 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.919
 of people who have been carrying on for centuries and centuries 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:30.119
 certain traditions 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:33.119
 here is our company wants to make synthesis wants 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:39.479
 carry on this project that talks about viral strains and their styles 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:41.029
 brewers 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:42.170
 a style 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.859
 and something that 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.219
 reminds the world of wine of the famous native vines 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.409
 they are the ones that are produced in certain specific areas 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.729
 ancient dream. 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:04:00.049
 in the three from the inside of the 300 p as in wine we can find different 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.489
 forms of autoxy beers 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.889
 and here we recognize 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:06.820
 for everyone 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.339
 they can certainly understand in the Saxon cie porno 

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:11.950
 a typical style 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.509
 that belongs to him that nobody is ever true 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:16.329
 He was 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.549
 that remain 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.079
 Irish stop 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.019
 or the hey you from the classic beer 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.180
 the old saying that it was produced and that it is still produced 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.779
 in England 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:30.829
 if then you call me the Belgian stock we immediately see the abbey beers 

00:04:30.829 --> 00:04:31.759
 pistils 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.770
 with the sub-style the Trappist one 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.539
 or the blanc 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.039
 if instead we come to the other chapeau 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.360
 green we immediately recognize another style that is the one of the spies I have 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.110
 pils or even skis 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.260
 they are produced exclusively in the area 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.360
 colony 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.810
 your company 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.550
 he did this because I told him now my own shoes 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.779
 it's nice to see our market 

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:02.239
 she rightly asked me a very interesting cerreto question 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.830
 there are emerging countries, there are certainly emerging countries 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.800
 the world 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.080
 consumer interest and curiosity 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.050
 no way of beer now and transverse 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.139
 our great fortune is to have ears 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.120
 open the antennas always well explained 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.140
 and to hear evaluate to see attend 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:25.990
 exhibitions 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.700
 and attend 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.610
 moments in which you are 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.309
 find the many beer lovers 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:35.669
 and we discover that among us there are people who come from an auditor 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:36.740
 in Europe 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.099
 download of the world 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.339
 I wanted to close by saying. 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:43.930
 that 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.180
 thanks all this great interest for the first time in Italy 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:52.770
 the next 11 12 and 13 imp will be for May 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.759
 in Milan there will be the first 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:58.029
 qbr festival ie milan via the festival 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:03.419
 it says a lot it is true gravy to which level we are arriving 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.139
 says it all because 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.440
 only rentals in london there is a shadow a demonstration that 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:11.020

 3 days is estimated 100,000 people 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.159
 that is, I believe 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:29.490
 dr usually 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.639
 his beard
