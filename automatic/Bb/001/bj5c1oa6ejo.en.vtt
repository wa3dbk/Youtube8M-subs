00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 Hello and welcome to me 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.069
 really need one last time 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.330
 One last time I need you so 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.309
 I have not decided so three projects 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.769
 three brand new projects i 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.300
 I would really like to do that 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.590
 Of course, I will not do it to you once 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.820
 I betrayed that to myself 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.960
 thought and I found this idea 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.730
 really awesome 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.500
 So I the second you already see one 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.890
 Corner lures I explain you the same 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.750
 really everything you really find everything 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.820
 he looks absolutely in the app in 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.230
 the description I'm not saying now 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.640
 always with every single thing I do 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.350
 that's what every description will look like 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.820
 Just look in there it is 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.350
 not complicated even when it starts 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.980
 complicated looks okay it's all right 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.040
 fast 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.180
 yes and now when he first first 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.000
 the simplest many zelda have said 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.379
 I chose myself 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 I myself I have decided to play 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.590
 I would like to play everything 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.570
 but i am starting here from 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.820
 the part only a single last so 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.440
 either seasons or that's coming 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.329
 How many agree 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.280
 respective things has got something more 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.899
 Of course you will win 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.640
 but only the order of let's 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.830
 that is, if you are quite a few for 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.420
 vote awakening left then that is 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.280
 course in the first place and then what 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.470
 next on place two and so on 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:20.850
 So, maybe that will help you 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:22.110
 somehow so well that is there is already 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.340
 all said I believe that explains itself 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.150
 all by itself except that you 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.009
 I already have such a percent 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.869
 played through so you decide in the 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.930
 end effect what you want to see first 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.610
 third now is already the third 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.070
 I do not have much for the first 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.320
 told 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.329
 the bell as a vote for the 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.180
 Of course, remakes it is one to the third 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.950
 generation of the downloadlink closer 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.149
 description as I said and there is 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.229
 you that I'm not too high 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.290
 plan so that a bit faster 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.810
 so download it for you and then 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.250
 Do you have these because they are there 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.079
 you downloaded any fear no 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.030
 virus or something like that i would not like you 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.159
 dismiss 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.890
 then just double-click 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.570
 immigrant or what you have I do 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.590
 Now drag and drop on the 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.939
 desktop you can of course 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.860
 wrap up and so far behind you 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.250
 there definitely from any case that I am 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.230
 then in the pact then have a double click 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.670
 then you will find that all that 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.489
 especially important if only on the 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.890
 So first on the application one 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.390
 right-click and then as administrator 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.280
 that 's really important to do that 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.700
 make you run as an administrator 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.040
 really important does the addition 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.069
 fun is really like that 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.940
 and yes you do that because otherwise with me 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.739
 not working differently now either 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.989
 now as I said it looks worse 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.900
 as it really is no scare 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:44.569
 you just have to get up here 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:48.150
 in game scroll down in brackets g 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.970
 select sapphire yes i will set it to 14 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.890
 I think it's really cool here 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:57.690
 that does not interest you as the 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:01.680
 pokémon info qliktech and that will 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.049
 Anyway, you can gray out anyway 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.489
 Choose your pokemon what you want it 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:10.500
 It does not matter how much you like it 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.720
 what the only one to me now 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.680
 that your suitcase bonn 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.389
 Of course I could still mail a lot 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.470
 the only thing I really ask for 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.480
 would 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.750
 items it really matter to me I 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.819
 has not used moves that the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.220
 widgets are that they really learn it 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.650
 i dont want to be scared now 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.519
 tomorrow with loud fire or something like that is one 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.829
 weird 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.389
 So calm smog and then you do not 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.069
 with the moves directly exaggerating that it 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:45.660
 directly mud bomb or something like that 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:46.530
 it learns so much anyway so then so 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.250
 you already do that 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.709
 and then you have smog me now 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.730
 do not know that in English 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.680
 probably that's what they are 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.470
 English things so as I said 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.629
 I'm sure you can now too 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.560
 so now please only shine or 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.690
 do not determine 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.790
 huke rostock it seems no 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.290
 snob probably that no idea if 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.680
 it can learn now matter 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.850
 In any case , it does not seem 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.570
 I do not want to be tall and the other one 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:23.280
 I do not think I care and then 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.450
 Just do random babys you want 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.360
 Being bad can be good 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.480
 31 maximum so we get 31 times 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.240
 apparently not or is there 31 there 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.630
 In the game , her husband died himself 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.710
 none of our event can you still that 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.660
 determine the nature of the 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.350
 the hairline crack beings can you still 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:47.050
 Let's just say we can do that 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.940
 that can and then you just have to 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.940
 leave everything and press on course 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.850
 that you can now either me 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.510
 as a text file or just like that somehow 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.850
 first colon the code you can 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.270
 Send me a maximum of three eggs per person 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.170
 So everyone is allowed to send in three eggs 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.940
 because I only do that from one 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.520
 certain number of the project so synonymous 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.060
 I try to get eggs, I do 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:19.240
 not at all because it makes no sense 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:23.590
 if I tell a story in any case yes 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:26.140
 code either by e-mail or by now 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.140
 the really rotten so it is 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.280
 really reluctant but if you want in 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.470
 the comments 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.090
 with the three codes well but please 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.220
 first a colon so I enter there 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.290
 there is no overview 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.930
 description limit more in the 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.340
 comment because without just this code 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.870
 could also click on it as often as you do 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.460
 that does not break anything for this 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.290
 pokémon if you have a new one 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.310
 Pokemon is now doing chelsea, for example 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.400
 and so on because you have to, of course, 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.050
 generate a new code 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.590
 So clearly remember me on this thing 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.310
 to click 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.600
 Now I have three refurbish because the 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.440
 never click on it and of course that 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.090
 remember everything again 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.320
 but it really is not much and it 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.090
 It's quick, because of everything 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.490
 only babies are usually only 12 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:13.290
 moves from you want the reading moves 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:15.610
 as for example , imani can be with 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.040
 Christian and profession I do not know if 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.030
 the animal works but you can 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.390
 I could tell you myself 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.680
 it was me and it was me 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.900
 probably very long and you think 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.500
 you as soon as the snout but I have 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.760
 I explained everything now 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.230
 if there are any questions left this could be 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.480
 of course the children, of course, too 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:35.120
 I would like to ask and I would 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.070
 happy if you are diligent with and doing 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.340
 if not find pays through stopped 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:42.260
 So that looks alone in you and now 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.900
 I would be happy and I hope you 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.180
 look forward to the following projects yes 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.580
 but that fits and sounds a bit 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.820
 new wind ii rhein main canal and 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:57.320
 this time yes, so I really 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:59.540
 I really want to do a lot now and 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:03.169
 I'll probably do it too 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:06.680
 I really sit down firmly 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:08.870
 upload times so please 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.830
 I'll probably talk about that 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:16.510
 inform again 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:16.510
 but so far never pixo with
