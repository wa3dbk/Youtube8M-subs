00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.319 

so<00:00:57.079> that<00:00:57.260> part<00:00:57.530> is<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:57.860> same<00:00:58.070> each<00:00:58.280> time<00:00:58.520> so

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
so that part is the same each time so

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.020 
so that part is the same each time so
then<00:00:59.510> we're<00:00:59.690> up<00:00:59.719> here<00:00:59.989> on<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:00.489> 9th<00:01:01.489> and<00:01:01.879> we're

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
then we're up here on the 9th and we're

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:17.320 
then we're up here on the 9th and we're
doing<00:01:02.210> a<00:01:02.269> semitone<00:01:02.600> babe<00:01:10.210> that's<00:01:11.210> it

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.340 

and<00:01:18.110> then<00:01:18.230> we<00:01:18.380> sustain<00:01:18.770> it<00:01:18.800> on<00:01:19.010> that<00:01:19.190> Ino<00:01:19.580> there

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
and then we sustain it on that Ino there

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.850 
and then we sustain it on that Ino there
and<00:01:21.350> then<00:01:22.130> end<00:01:22.930> so<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.050> cause<00:01:24.260> in<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.590> verse

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
and then end so the cause in the verse

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.920 
and then end so the cause in the verse
we<00:01:25.550> have<00:01:25.790> E<00:01:26.710> major<00:01:27.710> a<00:01:28.130> major<00:01:28.850> E<00:01:29.510> flat<00:01:29.540> on<00:01:29.840> the

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
we have E major a major E flat on the

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.710 
we have E major a major E flat on the
base<00:01:31.030> but<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:32.090> can't<00:01:32.330> play<00:01:32.480> it<00:01:32.540> two<00:01:32.750> ways<00:01:32.930> so

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
base but you can't play it two ways so

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.330 
base but you can't play it two ways so
so<00:01:35.720> you<00:01:35.810> can<00:01:35.930> put<00:01:36.080> your<00:01:36.230> first<00:01:36.920> finger<00:01:37.010> back

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
so you can put your first finger back

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.120 
so you can put your first finger back
here<00:01:37.580> on<00:01:37.820> six<00:01:38.360> and<00:01:39.140> then<00:01:39.590> your<00:01:39.710> fur<00:01:39.860> finger<00:01:42.130> or

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
here on six and then your fur finger or

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.900 
here on six and then your fur finger or
you<00:01:43.190> can<00:01:43.310> play<00:01:45.010> so<00:01:46.010> your<00:01:46.130> third<00:01:46.370> finger<00:01:46.580> comes

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
you can play so your third finger comes

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.890 
you can play so your third finger comes
up<00:01:47.060> here<00:01:47.440> and<00:01:48.440> then<00:01:48.560> your<00:01:48.710> first<00:01:48.979> finger<00:01:49.130> is

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
up here and then your first finger is

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.530 
up here and then your first finger is
borrowing<00:01:50.900> the<00:01:51.050> D<00:01:51.320> G<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.010> B<00:01:52.190> strings<00:01:52.390> so<00:01:53.390> we

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
borrowing the D G and B strings so we

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.430 
borrowing the D G and B strings so we
got<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:53.930> e<00:01:55.960> will<00:01:56.960> be<00:01:57.050> fit<00:01:57.320> on<00:01:57.410> the<00:01:57.500> base<00:01:58.990> C<00:01:59.990> sharp

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
got a e will be fit on the base C sharp

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.200 
got a e will be fit on the base C sharp
minor<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:02.600> pay<00:02:03.200> major

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
minor and pay major

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.880 
minor and pay major
so<00:02:05.210> those<00:02:05.360> your<00:02:05.540> first<00:02:05.720> chords<00:02:08.649> C<00:02:09.649> chopped

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
so those your first chords C chopped

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.410 
so those your first chords C chopped
minor<00:02:10.100> you<00:02:10.250> can<00:02:10.280> put<00:02:10.520> here<00:02:11.500> about<00:02:12.500> two<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:13.420> then

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
minor you can put here about two a then

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:24.710 
minor you can put here about two a then
we're<00:02:14.540> coming<00:02:14.600> up<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:14.959> here<00:02:15.200> on<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.560> 12

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.950 

so<00:02:25.720> he's<00:02:25.930> exactly<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.380> same<00:02:26.560> as<00:02:26.710> down<00:02:26.890> here

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
so he's exactly the same as down here

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:37.530 
so he's exactly the same as down here
you're<00:02:28.960> doing<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.200> full<00:02:29.440> tone<00:02:29.740> Bend<00:02:36.360> then<00:02:37.360> this

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
you're doing a full tone Bend then this

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.520 
you're doing a full tone Bend then this
pie<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.050> same<00:02:43.020> then<00:02:44.020> we<00:02:44.110> have<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.320> verse

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
pie is the same then we have the verse

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:51.960 
pie is the same then we have the verse
ports<00:02:44.860> again<00:02:49.440> then<00:02:50.440> we<00:02:50.560> back<00:02:50.740> up<00:02:50.950> here<00:02:51.250> on<00:02:51.490> the

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
ports again then we back up here on the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.780 
ports again then we back up here on the
ninth

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.710 

but<00:02:58.790> this<00:02:58.910> time<00:02:59.120> it's<00:02:59.270> slightly<00:02:59.450> different

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
but this time it's slightly different

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:08.380 
but this time it's slightly different
going<00:03:00.440> a<00:03:02.410> so<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.560> B<00:03:04.160> c-sharp<00:03:07.000> then<00:03:08.000> we<00:03:08.180> have

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
going a so a B c-sharp then we have

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.450 
going a so a B c-sharp then we have
small<00:03:08.930> course<00:03:09.200> we<00:03:09.440> have<00:03:09.590> C<00:03:09.830> minor<00:03:10.070> so<00:03:10.430> a

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
small course we have C minor so a

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:23.100 
small course we have C minor so a
c-sharp<00:03:10.940> minor'<00:03:14.140> 8b

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.140 

so<00:03:24.110> while<00:03:24.410> those<00:03:24.590> calls<00:03:24.950> are<00:03:25.040> playing<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.700> C

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
so while those calls are playing the C

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.320 
so while those calls are playing the C
sharp<00:03:26.390> minor<00:03:26.510> a<00:03:27.490> be<00:03:28.490> around

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
sharp minor a be around

00:03:29.330 --> 00:04:12.809 
sharp minor a be around
hey<00:03:30.190> so<00:03:31.190> we<00:03:31.280> have<00:03:57.220> small<00:03:58.220> more<00:03:58.370> time

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.160 

so<00:04:13.819> throughout<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.209> song<00:04:14.420> we<00:04:14.600> mix<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:14.990> up

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
so throughout the song we mix it up

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:28.420 
so throughout the song we mix it up
between<00:04:18.400> that<00:04:19.400> one<00:04:22.540> that<00:04:23.540> one<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:27.100> those<00:04:28.100> ones

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
between that one that one and those ones

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.480 
between that one that one and those ones
so<00:04:29.360> bit<00:04:29.660> later<00:04:29.840> on<00:04:30.140> after<00:04:30.470> one<00:04:30.590> of<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.800> courses

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
so bit later on after one of the courses

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:43.550 
so bit later on after one of the courses
we<00:04:31.669> have
