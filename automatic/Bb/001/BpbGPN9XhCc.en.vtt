of skin yes well instead of actually

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.710

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
has so one of the one of the tricks that

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.330 
has so one of the one of the tricks that
I<00:01:29.430> often<00:01:29.670> use<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.570> my<00:01:30.659> practice<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.409> using<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
I often use in my practice is using a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.039 
I often use in my practice is using a
gentle<00:01:32.610> skin<00:01:32.939> cleanser<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.540> morning<00:01:33.900> and

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
gentle skin cleanser in the morning and

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.410 
gentle skin cleanser in the morning and
something<00:01:34.560> more<00:01:34.920> foaming<00:01:35.460> at<00:01:35.610> night<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
something more foaming at night and the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.300 
something more foaming at night and the
reason<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.350> oftentimes<00:01:37.920> we

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
reason for that is that oftentimes we

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.490 
reason for that is that oftentimes we
can<00:01:38.340> tend<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.850> over<00:01:39.119> exfoliate<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:40.200> really

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
can tend to over exfoliate so really

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.319 
can tend to over exfoliate so really
using<00:01:40.680> something<00:01:41.100> gentle<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.640> morning<00:01:42.060> to

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
using something gentle in the morning to

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
screen it is not a sunblock so we're

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.979 
screen it is not a sunblock so we're
always<00:02:29.859> getting<00:02:30.189> penetration<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.359> some<00:02:31.840> of
