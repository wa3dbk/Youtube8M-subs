it is important the one kind of house

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.660 
it is important the one kind of house
with<00:00:15.240> one<00:00:15.330> shot<00:00:16.100> another<00:00:17.100> thing<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.279> notice<00:00:17.460> is

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
with one shot another thing to notice is

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.980 
with one shot another thing to notice is
I<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:18.270> can<00:00:18.390> just<00:00:18.570> stand<00:00:18.720> on<00:00:18.779> this<00:00:18.900> platform

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
I you can just stand on this platform

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.710 
I you can just stand on this platform
here<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.680> keep<00:00:19.830> shooting<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.570> areas<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.660> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
here and keep shooting it areas in the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.599 
here and keep shooting it areas in the
next<00:00:21.960> platform<00:00:22.199> before<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:23.100> actually<00:00:23.189> move

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
next platform before we actually move

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.939 
next platform before we actually move
the<00:00:24.170> important<00:00:25.170> part<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.380> though<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.710> be<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:25.859> to

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
the important part is though it be it to

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.410 
the important part is though it be it to
the<00:00:26.039> one<00:00:26.189> block<00:00:26.340> those<00:00:26.550> corners<00:00:27.029> like<00:00:27.210> those

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
the one block those corners like those

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.990 
the one block those corners like those
in<00:00:27.570> between<00:00:27.660> areas<00:00:28.220> that<00:00:29.220> area<00:00:29.760> will<00:00:29.970> start

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
in between areas that area will start

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.120 
in between areas that area will start
falling<00:00:30.689> off<00:00:30.960> even<00:00:31.289> before<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.740> previous

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
falling off even before the previous

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.650 
falling off even before the previous
area<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.550> done<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.300> actually<00:00:33.480> use

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
area is done so you can actually use

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.700 
area is done so you can actually use
this<00:00:34.640> kind<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.730> like<00:00:35.850> as<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.380> preloader<00:00:37.380> like

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
this kind of like as a preloader like

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.950 
this kind of like as a preloader like
you<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:37.890> use<00:00:38.010> as<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.280> CREP<00:00:38.910> kind<00:00:39.660> think<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:39.870> you

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
you can use as a CREP kind think so you

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.389 
you can use as a CREP kind think so you
don't<00:00:40.079> have<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.230> keep<00:00:40.379> rolling<00:00:40.800> as<00:00:40.980> fast<00:00:41.280> you

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
don't have to keep rolling as fast you

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.810 
don't have to keep rolling as fast you
can<00:00:41.780> if<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.930> do<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.800> finish<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.489> as<00:00:44.610> fast

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
can if you do just finish it as fast

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.490 
can if you do just finish it as fast
just<00:00:45.300> finished<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.660> one<00:00:45.809> platform<00:00:46.110> areas

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
just finished that one platform areas

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.920 
just finished that one platform areas
fast<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.309> then<00:00:47.510> try<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.539> like<00:00:48.750> just

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
fast you can and then try to like just

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.250 
fast you can and then try to like just
pick<00:00:49.110> up<00:00:49.230> as<00:00:49.379> many<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.860> them<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> next<00:00:50.430> area

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
pick up as many of them in the next area

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.569 
pick up as many of them in the next area
any<00:00:52.260> dino<00:00:52.469> knows<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.680> do<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.949> without<00:00:53.129> manual

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
any dino knows I do this without manual

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.939 
any dino knows I do this without manual
aim<00:00:54.170> as<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.289> believe<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.590> one<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
aim as I believe this is one of the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.130 
aim as I believe this is one of the
easier<00:00:56.489> ways<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:56.969> do<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.149> without

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
easier ways you can do this without

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.520 
easier ways you can do this without
holding<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.710> shift<00:00:58.949> button<00:00:59.100> yeah<00:00:59.370> I<00:01:00.530> don't

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
holding to the shift button yeah I don't

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.399 
holding to the shift button yeah I don't
have<00:01:01.710> any<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.039> ammo<00:01:02.280> capacity<00:01:02.399> upgrades

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
have any of the ammo capacity upgrades

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.390 
have any of the ammo capacity upgrades
and<00:01:04.409> don't<00:01:04.619> be<00:01:04.680> afraid<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.920> fall<00:01:05.070> down<00:01:05.129> either

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
and don't be afraid to fall down either

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.380 
and don't be afraid to fall down either
because<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.700> only<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:05.939> move<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
because you only just move on to the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.080 
because you only just move on to the
next<00:01:06.450> platform

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.630 

so<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.109> damage<00:01:10.409> bonus<00:01:10.710> really<00:01:11.130> helps<00:01:11.399> with<00:01:11.579> uh

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
so the damage bonus really helps with uh

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.050 
so the damage bonus really helps with uh
with<00:01:12.289> one<00:01:13.289> shotting<00:01:13.649> what<00:01:14.549> makes<00:01:14.729> it'll<00:01:14.939> go<00:01:15.030> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
with one shotting what makes it'll go a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.599 
with one shotting what makes it'll go a
lot<00:01:15.299> faster<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.990> believe<00:01:16.740> if<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.070> didn't<00:01:17.520> have

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:17.609 
lot faster I believe if I didn't have

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:19.190 
lot faster I believe if I didn't have
that<00:01:17.819> I<00:01:18.000> would<00:01:18.270> probably<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.780> use<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> lock

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
that I would probably have to use a lock

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.969 
that I would probably have to use a lock
on<00:01:19.380> method<00:01:20.270> as<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.539> see<00:01:21.750> mast<00:01:22.530> just

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
on method as you can see mast just

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.590 
on method as you can see mast just
barely<00:01:23.310> got<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.700> last<00:01:23.850> one<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:26.420> it's<00:01:27.420> getting

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
barely got the last one so it's getting

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.990 
barely got the last one so it's getting
out<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> first<00:01:28.049> prize<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> snooze<00:01:28.709> dart<00:01:29.009> which

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
out the first prize a snooze dart which

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.099 
out the first prize a snooze dart which
will<00:01:30.299> put<00:01:30.719> enemies<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.950> sleep<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.929> wasn't

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.109 
will put enemies to sleep and I wasn't

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:35.209 
will put enemies to sleep and I wasn't
really<00:01:34.259> satisfied<00:01:34.439> with<00:01:34.770> how<00:01:34.859> they<00:01:34.950> completed

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
really satisfied with how they completed

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:41.929 
really satisfied with how they completed
that<00:01:35.369> one<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.119> did<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.509> again<00:01:40.489> yeah<00:01:41.489> using

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
that one so I did it again yeah using

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.760 
that one so I did it again yeah using
shift<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.599> believe<00:01:43.049> using<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:43.380> auto<00:01:43.500> aim<00:01:43.649> thing

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
shift I believe using the auto aim thing

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.699 
shift I believe using the auto aim thing
this<00:01:43.920> shouldn't<00:01:44.579> put<00:01:44.789> make<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> lot<00:01:45.299> easier

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:45.709 
this shouldn't put make it a lot easier

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:47.539 
this shouldn't put make it a lot easier
since<00:01:46.709> you<00:01:46.799> don't<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.099> spend<00:01:47.280> as<00:01:47.399> much

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
since you don't have to spend as much

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.209 
since you don't have to spend as much
time<00:01:47.610> trying<00:01:48.179> to<00:01:48.299> hit<00:01:48.509> things<00:01:48.689> as<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.920> manual

with<00:02:14.110> no<00:02:15.110> damage<00:02:15.350> upgrades<00:02:16.300> but<00:02:17.300> it<00:02:17.450> would<00:02:17.569> be

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
with no damage upgrades but it would be

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.940 
with no damage upgrades but it would be
a<00:02:17.720> lot<00:02:17.959> harder<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.050> actually<00:02:21.350> when<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:21.860> was

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
a lot harder and I actually when I was

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.199 
a lot harder and I actually when I was
doing<00:02:22.100> this<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.280> actually<00:02:22.459> didn't<00:02:22.940> know<00:02:23.000> I

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
doing this to actually didn't know I

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.180 
doing this to actually didn't know I
forgot<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:23.600> you<00:02:23.870> could<00:02:24.050> walk<00:02:24.680> on<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:24.950> things

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
forgot that you could walk on the things

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.220 
forgot that you could walk on the things
which<00:02:25.310> is<00:02:25.400> why<00:02:25.580> you<00:02:26.360> don't<00:02:26.450> see<00:02:26.720> me<00:02:26.840> looking

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
which is why you don't see me looking

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.210 
which is why you don't see me looking
onto<00:02:27.350> things<00:02:27.650> at<00:02:27.800> all<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.830> know<00:02:30.890> that<00:02:31.100> maybe

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
onto things at all so I know that maybe

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.960 
onto things at all so I know that maybe
raise<00:02:31.520> all<00:02:31.880> right<00:02:32.120> but<00:02:32.270> yeah<00:02:32.540> there<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:32.840> go

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
raise all right but yeah there you go

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.690 
raise all right but yeah there you go
this<00:02:34.970> one's<00:02:35.209> also<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.420> lot<00:02:35.569> smoother<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.550> as<00:02:37.550> you

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
this one's also a lot smoother so as you

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.460 
this one's also a lot smoother so as you
can<00:02:37.760> see<00:02:37.970> just<00:02:38.150> prepping<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.840> targets<00:02:39.230> able

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
can see just prepping the targets able

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.009 
can see just prepping the targets able
to<00:02:39.530> destroy<00:02:39.980> as<00:02:40.100> much<00:02:40.250> when<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.520> get<00:02:40.730> there

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
to destroy as much when you get there

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.970 
to destroy as much when you get there
which<00:02:42.019> gives<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:42.320> lot<00:02:42.410> more<00:02:42.470> time<00:02:42.739> to

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
which gives you a lot more time to

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.310 
which gives you a lot more time to
manually<00:02:43.430> aim<00:02:45.610> and<00:02:46.610> stuff<00:02:47.300> that<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:47.989> there

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
manually aim and stuff that and there

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.430 
manually aim and stuff that and there
you<00:02:48.440> go<00:02:49.150> first<00:02:50.150> prize<00:02:52.750> alright<00:02:53.750> i<00:02:53.780> hope<00:02:54.200> you

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
you go first prize alright i hope you
