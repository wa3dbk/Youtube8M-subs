agent<00:04:16.489> SI<00:04:17.060> x<00:04:17.329> then<00:04:18.230> the<00:04:18.590> number<00:04:19.250> one<00:04:20.470> SI<00:04:21.470> x

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
agent SI x then the number one SI x

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.890 
agent SI x then the number one SI x
number<00:04:22.160> one<00:04:22.790> so<00:04:23.750> agent<00:04:24.230> six<00:04:24.830> SI<00:04:25.730> x<00:04:25.910> as<00:04:26.240> in<00:04:26.510> six

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
number one so agent six SI x as in six

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.960 
number one so agent six SI x as in six
isn't<00:04:27.080> SI<00:04:27.620> x<00:04:27.800> and<00:04:28.160> then<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.390> number<00:04:29.630> 10<00:04:30.970> you
