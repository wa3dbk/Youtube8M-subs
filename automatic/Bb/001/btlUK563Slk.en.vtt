00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.449 
seams are not there zigzag and they are
not<00:02:18.180> surged<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:20.170> figured<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:21.100> this<00:02:21.280> was

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
not surged so I figured that this was

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.060 
not surged so I figured that this was
made<00:02:21.880> by<00:02:21.910> someone<00:02:22.350> for<00:02:23.350> themselves<00:02:23.770> or<00:02:24.010> for

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
made by someone for themselves or for

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.640 
made by someone for themselves or for
someone<00:02:24.459> else<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:24.970> you<00:02:25.540> guys<00:02:25.720> know<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.080> and

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
someone else and you guys know that and

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.350 
someone else and you guys know that and
if<00:02:26.739> you<00:02:26.860> didn't<00:02:27.160> know<00:02:27.250> my<00:02:27.489> favorite<00:02:27.820> color<00:02:28.030> is

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
if you didn't know my favorite color is

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.150 
if you didn't know my favorite color is
green<00:02:28.510> I'm<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:28.989> sucker<00:02:29.170> for<00:02:29.290> green<00:02:29.680> but<00:02:30.130> I

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
green I'm a sucker for green but I

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.930 
green I'm a sucker for green but I
really<00:02:30.610> like<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.390> it<00:02:32.200> feels<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:33.100> me<00:02:33.130> like<00:02:33.310> the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
really like that it feels to me like the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.840 
really like that it feels to me like the
way<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.150> fits<00:02:34.360> on<00:02:34.630> me<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.430> everything<00:02:36.430> like<00:02:36.790> a

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
way it fits on me and everything like a

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.420 
way it fits on me and everything like a
baseball<00:02:37.239> tee<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.080> so<00:02:38.320> I<00:02:38.650> really<00:02:39.070> like<00:02:39.250> the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
baseball tee and so I really like the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.490 
baseball tee and so I really like the
fit<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:40.030> like<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.420> color<00:02:40.630> like<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.080> stripes

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.580 
fit I like the color like the stripes
and<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:42.670> really<00:02:43.330> got<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.630> because<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:43.959> was

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
and so I really got it because I was

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.810 
and so I really got it because I was
thinking<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:44.980> I<00:02:45.130> was<00:02:45.250> going<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.519> do

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
thinking that I was going to do

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.360 
thinking that I was going to do
something<00:02:45.850> to<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.690> but<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.380> just<00:02:47.709> fell<00:02:48.010> in<00:02:48.040> love

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
something to it but I just fell in love

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.160 
something to it but I just fell in love
with<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.700> way<00:02:48.820> it<00:02:48.970> fits<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.900> way<00:02:50.019> it

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
with the way it fits and the way it

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.600 
with the way it fits and the way it
looks<00:02:50.350> and<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.680> just<00:02:50.950> really<00:02:51.160> wanted<00:02:51.459> to

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
looks and so I just really wanted to

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.880 
looks and so I just really wanted to
wear<00:02:51.910> it<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.600> know<00:02:52.720> just<00:02:53.110> really<00:02:53.410> in<00:02:53.739> a

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.490 
wear it you know just really in a
comfortable<00:02:54.400> manner<00:02:54.910> just<00:02:55.120> everyday<00:02:55.780> run<00:02:56.350> to
