now varnishes to test test this with so
I've<00:00:34.290> just<00:00:34.350> got<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.620> basic<00:00:34.860> white<00:00:35.510> this<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
I've just got a basic white this is the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.970 
I've just got a basic white this is the
OPI<00:00:38.090> white<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:41.030> alpine<00:00:42.030> snow<00:00:42.300> one<00:00:42.980> just

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
OPI white it's the alpine snow one just

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.910 
OPI white it's the alpine snow one just
a<00:00:44.100> basic<00:00:44.489> white<00:00:44.730> on<00:00:45.149> there<00:00:45.530> it's<00:00:46.530> not<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.800> to

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
a basic white on there it's not going to

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.279 
a basic white on there it's not going to
compare<00:00:47.700> they're<00:00:47.940> both<00:00:50.930> I've<00:00:51.930> done<00:00:52.079> another

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
compare they're both I've done another

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.729 
compare they're both I've done another
video<00:00:52.530> with<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.160> one<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.730> while<00:00:54.600> ago<00:00:54.739> it's

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
video with this one a while ago it's

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.639 
video with this one a while ago it's
just<00:00:55.829> nice<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.309> compare<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.820> both<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.690> try

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
just nice to compare the both so I try

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.299 
just nice to compare the both so I try
the<00:00:58.710> OPI<00:00:59.219> one<00:00:59.640> first<00:01:01.039> put<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> shake<00:01:04.100> just<00:01:05.100> need

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the OPI one first put a shake just need

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.410 
the OPI one first put a shake just need
to<00:01:05.400> apply<00:01:05.700> one<00:01:06.000> coat<00:01:06.619> see<00:01:07.619> how<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.799> goes<00:01:08.420> very

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
to apply one coat see how it goes very

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.210 
to apply one coat see how it goes very
excited<00:01:09.930> first<00:01:10.320> time<00:01:10.530> I've<00:01:10.590> used<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:11.010> come

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
excited first time I've used it come

00:01:11.220 --> 00:02:04.260 
excited first time I've used it come
home<00:01:11.369> straight<00:01:11.670> from<00:01:11.700> work<00:01:13.040> to<00:01:14.040> use<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:16.009> okay

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:29.740 

good<00:02:05.270> never<00:02:05.479> got<00:02:05.689> a<00:02:05.719> minute

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:57.690 

it's<00:02:30.750> cracking<00:02:30.989> nicely<00:02:31.590> on<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.890> thumb

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:09.300 

so<00:02:58.700> my<00:02:58.819> left<00:02:59.060> hand<00:02:59.330> has<00:02:59.540> got<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.870> OPI<00:03:00.260> on<00:03:00.620> it

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.160 

not<00:03:10.310> too<00:03:10.490> bad

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:49.050 

my<00:03:15.170> right<00:03:15.440> hand<00:03:15.770> is<00:03:16.069> gonna<00:03:16.190> have<00:03:17.319> barium<00:03:18.319> on<00:03:18.620> it

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.070 

could<00:03:50.060> be<00:03:50.209> quite<00:03:50.480> quick<00:03:50.810> when<00:03:50.959> you're

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
could be quite quick when you're

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.270 
could be quite quick when you're
applying<00:03:51.380> this<00:03:51.680> because<00:03:51.890> it<00:03:51.980> dries<00:03:52.250> so

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
applying this because it dries so

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.390 
applying this because it dries so
quickly<00:03:52.849> as<00:03:53.209> you<00:03:53.330> can<00:03:53.450> see<00:03:53.920> starts<00:03:54.920> cracking

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
quickly as you can see starts cracking

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:12.070 
quickly as you can see starts cracking
straightaway<00:04:09.760> try<00:04:10.760> not<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.120> overlap<00:04:11.690> up<00:04:11.900> is

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
straightaway try not to overlap up is

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:21.420 
straightaway try not to overlap up is
very<00:04:12.440> difficult

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.470 

Barry<00:04:22.430> m1<00:04:22.760> is<00:04:22.880> a<00:04:22.910> bit<00:04:23.060> thicker<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.880> OPI<00:04:26.120> one's

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
Barry m1 is a bit thicker the OPI one's

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:39.730 
Barry m1 is a bit thicker the OPI one's
quite<00:04:26.810> thin<00:04:31.060> thicker<00:04:32.060> consistency<00:04:34.420> big<00:04:38.740> smell

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
quite thin thicker consistency big smell

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:53.770 
quite thin thicker consistency big smell
the<00:04:39.860> same<00:04:46.840> yeah<00:04:47.840> smell<00:04:48.260> same<00:04:52.600> let's<00:04:53.600> have<00:04:53.750> a

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
the same yeah smell same let's have a

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:08.890 
the same yeah smell same let's have a
look<00:05:01.750> quite<00:05:02.750> similar<00:05:03.020> really<00:05:07.120> the<00:05:08.120> OPI<00:05:08.420> is<00:05:08.510> a

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
look quite similar really the OPI is a

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.680 
look quite similar really the OPI is a
thinner<00:05:09.550> nob<00:05:10.550> nail<00:05:10.880> polish<00:05:11.180> and<00:05:11.360> that's<00:05:11.510> why

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
thinner nob nail polish and that's why

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
thinner nob nail polish and that's why
it's<00:05:11.870> and<00:05:12.680> you've<00:05:12.830> got<00:05:12.920> a<00:05:12.950> small<00:05:13.340> cracks<00:05:13.700> in<00:05:14.000> it

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
it's and you've got a small cracks in it

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.230 
it's and you've got a small cracks in it
but<00:05:15.710> I<00:05:15.740> did<00:05:15.920> try<00:05:16.160> and<00:05:16.220> apply<00:05:16.550> it<00:05:16.730> a<00:05:16.820> little<00:05:17.000> bit

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
but I did try and apply it a little bit

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:26.800 
but I did try and apply it a little bit
more<00:05:17.390> thicker<00:05:17.890> on<00:05:18.890> young<00:05:19.250> ones<00:05:19.550> there<00:05:25.690> like<00:05:26.690> I

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
more thicker on young ones there like I

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.630 
more thicker on young ones there like I
said<00:05:26.990> the<00:05:27.110> barium<00:05:27.500> one<00:05:27.680> was<00:05:27.919> quite<00:05:28.100> a<00:05:28.160> thick

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
said the barium one was quite a thick

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:42.190 
said the barium one was quite a thick
polish<00:05:29.300> so<00:05:34.570> they're<00:05:35.570> both<00:05:35.690> pretty<00:05:35.930> good<00:05:36.020> I<00:05:41.200> put

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
polish so they're both pretty good I put

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.890 
polish so they're both pretty good I put
a<00:05:42.290> couple<00:05:42.560> of<00:05:42.620> links<00:05:42.980> into<00:05:43.460> the<00:05:43.900> description
