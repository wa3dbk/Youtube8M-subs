an<00:00:19.529> issue<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.189> there<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.490> no<00:00:20.640> compression

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
an issue in that there is no compression

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.429 
an issue in that there is no compression
and<00:00:22.609> it<00:00:23.609> does<00:00:23.850> run<00:00:24.090> but<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.720> think<00:00:25.109> there<00:00:25.289> could

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
and it does run but I think there could

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.460 
and it does run but I think there could
be<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.650> spun<00:00:26.010> bearing<00:00:26.460> or<00:00:27.060> there<00:00:27.300> could<00:00:27.510> be<00:00:27.570> a

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
be a spun bearing or there could be a

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.679 
be a spun bearing or there could be a
crack<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.460> one<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.029> Pistons<00:00:30.480> I

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
crack in the one of the Pistons I

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.060 
crack in the one of the Pistons I
believe<00:00:31.679> it's<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:31.980> 1980<00:00:32.640> can't<00:00:33.300> tell<00:00:33.600> for<00:00:33.809> sure
