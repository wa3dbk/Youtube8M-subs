00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.719

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.790
 physically driving not without barriers 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.340
 to various moods 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.070
 I am patriotic and I welcome you 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.619

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.170
 national that is called training of 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.390
 public and today all of us 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.330
 we are invited to see a function 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.480
 didactic of the symphony orchestra 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.480
 national 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.219
 the piece pedro and the wolf of sergei 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.739
 prokofiev in the interpretation of the 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.629
 national symphony orchestra is a story 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.570
 idealized so that 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.730
 schoolchildren recognize the texture of each 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.370
 one of the symphonic instruments that 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.920
 they make up an orchestra associating their 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.979
 sound to the different characters of the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.379
 fable let's see what instrument goes to 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.860
 be the little bird let's try the 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.860
 flute 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:19.180
 we need someone to make a duck 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.180
 can do the hype 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.210
 so I'm going to 5 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.750
 of water 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.719
 an applause for man 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.430
 this experience allows them to develop 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.229
 decoding capabilities 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.180
 naturally such a complex language 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.270
 like the musical 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.370
 we are all born with musical intelligence and 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.380
 she is very important because she is 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.450
 linked to our development potential 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.140
 linguistic and our ability to 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.140
 movement 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.380
 and that is 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.780
 Pedro made a loop with the rope and 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:13.260
 slid softly on the tail of the 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.260
 Wolf 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.030
 and then I find the soda with all its 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.030
 forces
