00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
top notch as of right now I am 230 I

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.200 
top notch as of right now I am 230 I
weighed<00:01:07.590> at<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.520> beginning<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.150> journey

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
weighed at the beginning of this journey

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.899 
weighed at the beginning of this journey
of<00:01:09.659> mine<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.869> weighed<00:01:10.610> 260<00:01:11.610> I've<00:01:12.420> should<00:01:12.659> see<00:01:12.840> 66

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
of mine I weighed 260 I've should see 66

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.719 
of mine I weighed 260 I've should see 66
but<00:01:14.909> extra<00:01:15.840> six<00:01:16.049> pounds<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.740> doesn't<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.280> don't

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
but extra six pounds it doesn't I don't

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.520 
but extra six pounds it doesn't I don't
think<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.970> really<00:01:18.000> matters<00:01:18.210> but<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.020> does<00:01:19.290> but

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
think it really matters but it does but

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.850 
think it really matters but it does but
anyway<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.939> extra<00:01:21.299> six<00:01:21.540> pounds<00:01:22.170> so

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
anyway so that extra six pounds so

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.219 
anyway so that extra six pounds so
basically<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.369> lost<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.700> 33<00:01:24.299> pounds<00:01:24.630> or
