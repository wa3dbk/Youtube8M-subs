learning it maybe just to you know get
the<00:00:17.250> flow<00:00:17.490> with<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.760> motion<00:00:18.199> so<00:00:19.199> here's<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
the flow with the motion so here's the

into the pit if you have one of these

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.410 
into the pit if you have one of these
black<00:00:24.960> pit<00:00:25.350> beds<00:00:25.619> go<00:00:26.580> ahead<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:26.939> do<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.180> into

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
black pit beds go ahead and do it into

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.160 
black pit beds go ahead and do it into
here<00:00:27.630> first

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
here first

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.990

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
so that you don't twist it to break it

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.650 
so that you don't twist it to break it
that<00:00:31.859> would<00:00:32.040> be<00:00:32.070> fun<00:00:32.309> okay<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:32.820> measure<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.540> out

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
that would be fun okay so measure it out

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.190 
that would be fun okay so measure it out
your<00:00:34.500> shot<00:00:34.770> say<00:00:35.010> what<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.579> want<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.760> take<00:00:35.969> off

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
and then you're going to go and then

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.790 
and then you're going to go and then
once<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.449> get<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.750> there<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.350> start

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
once you get it there you can start

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.229 
once you get it there you can start
building<00:00:53.190> up<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.780> max<00:00:55.219> so<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.489> like<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.059> do

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
building up the max so what I like to do

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.590 
building up the max so what I like to do
actually<00:00:57.930> put<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.410> mat<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.250> higher<00:00:59.609> then

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
actually put the mat so it's higher then

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.830 
actually put the mat so it's higher then
the<00:01:00.750> pit<00:01:00.989> level

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.600 

and<00:01:06.840> then<00:01:07.289> you<00:01:07.500> know<00:01:07.649> that<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:08.039> you<00:01:08.219> can<00:01:08.399> make

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
and then you know that if you can make

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.499 
and then you know that if you can make
