it's just honestly really trippy I feel

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.549 
it's just honestly really trippy I feel
like<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> lot<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.899> artists<00:00:46.170> too<00:00:46.320> are<00:00:46.410> more

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
like a lot of the artists too are more

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.380 
like a lot of the artists too are more
geared<00:00:46.739> towards<00:00:46.890> your<00:00:47.309> specific<00:00:47.760> genre<00:00:48.180> so

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
geared towards your specific genre so

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.639 
geared towards your specific genre so
it's<00:00:48.570> like<00:00:48.719> you're<00:00:48.930> not<00:00:49.079> playing<00:00:49.320> with<00:00:49.469> like

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
it's like you're not playing with like

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.229 
it's like you're not playing with like
people<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.070> are<00:00:50.160> randomly<00:00:50.520> like<00:00:50.850> kind<00:00:51.149> of

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
people that are randomly like kind of

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.090 
people that are randomly like kind of
off<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.870> know<00:00:51.989> yeah<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.620> makes<00:00:52.890> sense

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
off you know yeah it just makes sense

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.440 
off you know yeah it just makes sense
now

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
now

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.420 
now
I<00:00:54.540> think<00:00:55.290> that's<00:00:55.410> kind<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.620> easier<00:00:55.950> to<00:00:56.160> when

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
I think that's kind of easier to when

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.860 
I think that's kind of easier to when
you're<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:56.700> getting<00:00:57.180> bigger<00:00:57.360> as<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> band

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
you're like getting bigger as a band

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.300 
you're like getting bigger as a band
like<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.170> get<00:00:58.320> more<00:00:58.470> like<00:00:58.800> tours<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.250> are

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
like you get more like tours that are

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.920 
like you get more like tours that are
geared<00:00:59.550> towards<00:00:59.820> your<00:00:59.910> sound<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.330> think<00:01:00.450> so<00:01:00.720> I

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
geared towards your sound I think so I

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.990
