yeah I had the opportunity at res to
talk<00:00:13.230> about<00:00:13.910> my<00:00:14.910> new<00:00:15.509> company<00:00:15.959> which<00:00:16.610> was<00:00:17.610> just

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
talk about my new company which was just

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.450 
talk about my new company which was just
been<00:00:17.970> startup<00:00:18.450> called<00:00:18.689> 22cans<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:20.220> we've<00:00:20.340> got

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
been startup called 22cans and we've got

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.069 
been startup called 22cans and we've got
these<00:00:20.610> weird<00:00:20.849> things<00:00:21.029> called<00:00:21.300> experiments

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:22.079 
these weird things called experiments

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:23.510 
these weird things called experiments
these<00:00:22.259> are<00:00:22.470> technology<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.400> we're

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
these are technology that we're

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.700 
these are technology that we're
experimenting<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.509> with<00:00:24.750> releasing<00:00:25.110> as<00:00:25.410> apps

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
experimenting in with releasing as apps

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.099 
experimenting in with releasing as apps
and<00:00:26.210> there's<00:00:27.210> kind<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.630> psychological

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
and there's kind of psychological

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.529 
and there's kind of psychological
experiments<00:00:29.099> as<00:00:29.220> well<00:00:29.429> as<00:00:29.580> being<00:00:29.789> technology

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
experiments as well as being technology

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.970 
experiments as well as being technology
experiments<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.259> first<00:00:31.500> one<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.859> those

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
experiments and the first one of those

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.990 
experiments and the first one of those
is<00:00:32.250> called<00:00:32.610> curiosity<00:00:33.140> it's<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.559> black<00:00:35.339> cube<00:00:35.760> in

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
is called curiosity it's a black cube in

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.150 
is called curiosity it's a black cube in
the<00:00:36.089> corner<00:00:36.449> of<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.690> white<00:00:37.019> room<00:00:37.379> you<00:00:37.980> can

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
the corner of this white room you can

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.819 
the corner of this white room you can
tap<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.670> cube<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.360> eventually<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.680> can

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
tap on the cube and eventually you can

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.560 
tap on the cube and eventually you can
find<00:00:41.159> out<00:00:41.400> what's<00:00:41.670> at<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.059> center<00:00:42.089> of<00:00:42.449> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
find out what's at the center of the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.939 
find out what's at the center of the
cube<00:00:42.750> that's<00:00:43.049> essentially<00:00:43.589> what<00:00:43.769> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
tapping and I'll start to realize after

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.300 
tapping and I'll start to realize after
a<00:01:08.280> while<00:01:08.840> firstly<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.350> other<00:01:10.680> people

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
a while firstly that you other people

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.400 
a while firstly that you other people
are<00:01:11.400> tapping<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.939> same<00:01:12.270> queue<00:01:12.600> perhaps

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
are tapping on the same queue perhaps

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.640 
are tapping on the same queue perhaps
hundreds<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.100> thousands<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.700> other<00:01:14.850> people

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
hundreds of thousands of other people

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.230 
hundreds of thousands of other people
really<00:01:16.650> what<00:01:16.800> you<00:01:16.920> realize<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.580> there's<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.880> lot

it's over 60 million tats are needed to
get<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.340> center<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.820> key<00:02:03.000> but<00:02:03.330> i<00:02:03.479> don't

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
get to the center of the key but i don't

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.480 
get to the center of the key but i don't
think<00:02:03.659> anyone<00:02:04.049> these<00:02:04.409> days<00:02:04.470> knows<00:02:05.130> how
