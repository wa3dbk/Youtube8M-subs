00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.200
 We won. Let's start from that 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.280
 It was not a special open match 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.520
 Speaking of the Vistula - we did not play very well in the first half 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.920
 On the other hand, we did not let rivals create too many opportunities. 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.560
 We were lucky that we managed to score a goal 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.080
 At last it was a goal scored after playing a free kick. We often do not shoot at fixed parts of the game ... 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.880
 ... except for direct shots from penalty kicks or free kicks. 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.880
 ... except for direct shots from penalty kicks or free kicks. 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.800
 This time it was a free kick on the side of the court, which is why I am happy to win this goal. 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:54.600
 Leading to a 1-0 break, I told the players that we had to play very mature in the second half. 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.640
 I even compared it to the style of the Italian team. 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.880
 To how the Italians would play if they were leading 1: 0. 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.760
 You have to compact the playing field, allow your opponent to stay on the ball and try to score a goal ... 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.560
 ... or be careful and use the rival's error. 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.120
 That's what happened. 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.840
 Losing 0: 2, Jagiellonia tried to score. 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.560
 I did not worry though that we could lose this match 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.280
 Jagiellonia played boldly today 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.080
 We, however, presented quality. 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.960
 And even though we did not present "Barcelona football" 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.080
 if such a term can be used at all. 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.800
 I saw a lot of concentration in my players. They've done a lot of hard work today. 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.080
 And maybe that's why we deserved to win. 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.120
 Of course, I'm happy about the other results this weekend. 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.400
 Eight points over the other team. Legia unexpectedly loses. 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.440
 I must admit that they contribute to the construction of the team. 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.480
 I see players who work together and everyone begins to believe that this season will be different.
