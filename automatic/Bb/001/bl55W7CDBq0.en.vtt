00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
it to be honest I think the outgoing

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
it's a really good looking car you've

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.190 
it's a really good looking car you've
you've<00:01:08.300> kind<00:01:08.510> of<00:01:08.540> kept<00:01:08.720> true<00:01:08.930> to<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.170> original

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
you've kind of kept true to the original

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.060 
you've kind of kept true to the original
still<00:01:10.160> got<00:01:10.310> it's<00:01:10.430> nice<00:01:10.870> lifted<00:01:11.870> sort<00:01:12.740> of<00:01:12.800> star

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
still got it's nice lifted sort of star

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.040 
still got it's nice lifted sort of star
so<00:01:13.280> it<00:01:13.340> gives<00:01:13.520> it<00:01:13.640> that<00:01:13.820> nice<00:01:14.120> sort<00:01:15.020> of

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
so it gives it that nice sort of

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.140 
so it gives it that nice sort of
presence<00:01:15.440> and<00:01:15.770> it<00:01:16.130> just<00:01:16.759> looks<00:01:16.970> like<00:01:17.030> a

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
presence and it just looks like a

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.870 
presence and it just looks like a
generally<00:01:17.690> safe<00:01:18.050> rugged<00:01:18.950> reliable<00:01:19.430> car<00:01:19.670> I

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
generally safe rugged reliable car I

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.260 
generally safe rugged reliable car I
think<00:01:20.300> it's<00:01:20.660> softer<00:01:21.670> shaping<00:01:22.670> I<00:01:22.910> think<00:01:23.119> I<00:01:23.150> do

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
think it's softer shaping I think I do

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.510 
think it's softer shaping I think I do
like<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.690> estate<00:01:24.170> box<00:01:24.440> style<00:01:24.979> but<00:01:25.220> at<00:01:25.400> the

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
like the estate box style but at the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.520 
like the estate box style but at the
same<00:01:25.670> time<00:01:25.910> they<00:01:26.060> can<00:01:26.240> be<00:01:26.270> too<00:01:26.570> blunt<00:01:26.810> I<00:01:27.050> think

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
same time they can be too blunt I think

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.469 
same time they can be too blunt I think
the<00:01:27.590> previous<00:01:27.770> generation<00:01:28.550> they<00:01:29.000> lost<00:01:29.270> their

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
the previous generation they lost their

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.420 
the previous generation they lost their
way<00:01:29.630> perhaps<00:01:29.840> a<00:01:30.110> little<00:01:30.259> bit<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:30.890> I<00:01:30.979> like<00:01:31.009> it<00:01:31.399> I

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
way perhaps a little bit and I like it I

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.740 
way perhaps a little bit and I like it I
think<00:01:31.460> it's<00:01:31.729> a<00:01:31.820> good<00:01:31.940> and<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.180> good<00:01:32.390> improvement

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
think it's a good and a good improvement

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.680 
think it's a good and a good improvement
and<00:01:33.170> it's<00:01:33.350> more<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:34.310> core<00:01:34.580> Subaru<00:01:35.420> that<00:01:35.570> you

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
and it's more the core Subaru that you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.880 
and it's more the core Subaru that you
would<00:01:35.810> expect<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:36.320> that<00:01:36.410> people<00:01:36.560> are<00:01:36.710> gonna

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
would expect and that people are gonna

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.960 
would expect and that people are gonna
have<00:01:36.979> gonna<00:01:37.250> want<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:37.490> buy<00:01:42.550> just<00:01:43.550> looking<00:01:43.880> on

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
have gonna want to buy just looking on

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.880 
have gonna want to buy just looking on
the<00:01:44.060> interior<00:01:44.450> for<00:01:44.540> example<00:01:44.960> there<00:01:45.170> is<00:01:45.200> an

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
the interior for example there is an

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.649 
the interior for example there is an
improvement<00:01:46.310> there<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:47.150> front<00:01:47.360> seats<00:01:47.540> were

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
improvement there the front seats were

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.990 
improvement there the front seats were
great<00:01:47.870> for<00:01:48.049> me<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.830> drivers<00:01:49.220> position<00:01:49.520> was

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
great for me the drivers position was

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.820 
great for me the drivers position was

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
of the amount of space and boot space

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.539 
of the amount of space and boot space
there's<00:02:02.030> ample<00:02:02.350> family<00:02:03.350> affair<00:02:03.680> for<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.130> the

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
anything I've ever ever seen before it

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.770 
anything I've ever ever seen before it
from<00:02:09.649> from<00:02:09.860> Subaru<00:02:10.250> so<00:02:10.580> cabin<00:02:11.239> spaces

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
from from Subaru so cabin spaces

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.770 
from from Subaru so cabin spaces
excellent<00:02:12.290> seats<00:02:13.010> have<00:02:13.130> really<00:02:13.400> comfy

excellent seats have really comfy

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.050 
excellent seats have really comfy
it's<00:02:15.290> got<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.470> nice<00:02:15.650> ice<00:02:16.370> fields<00:02:16.700> are<00:02:16.820> steering

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
it's got a nice ice fields are steering

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.770 
it's got a nice ice fields are steering
well<00:02:17.830> just<00:02:18.830> generally<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.220> whole<00:02:19.430> cabin<00:02:20.390> is<00:02:20.510> a

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
well just generally the whole cabin is a

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.289 
well just generally the whole cabin is a
really<00:02:21.140> nice<00:02:21.320> place<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.100> be

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
really nice place to be

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.610 
really nice place to be
it's<00:02:23.299> got<00:02:23.420> more<00:02:23.570> cabin<00:02:24.080> space<00:02:24.110> definitely

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
it's got more cabin space definitely

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.650 
it's got more cabin space definitely
than<00:02:24.920> my<00:02:25.400> outback<00:02:25.820> and<00:02:26.239> I<00:02:26.299> think<00:02:26.480> there's<00:02:26.600> more

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
than my outback and I think there's more

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.570 
than my outback and I think there's more
headroom<00:02:27.110> space<00:02:27.350> as<00:02:27.920> well<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:28.280> I<00:02:28.340> think<00:02:28.430> it's

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
headroom space as well so I think it's

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.039 
headroom space as well so I think it's
definitely<00:02:28.640> an<00:02:29.000> improvement<00:02:29.090> but<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:29.810> doesn't

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
definitely an improvement but it doesn't

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.810 
definitely an improvement but it doesn't
look<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.320> bigger<00:02:30.530> car<00:02:30.799> so<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.370> think<00:02:31.430> it's<00:02:31.640> clever

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
look a bigger car so I think it's clever

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
look a bigger car so I think it's clever
the<00:02:32.030> way<00:02:32.060> they've<00:02:32.269> done<00:02:32.299> that<00:02:32.630> because

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
the way they've done that because

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.050 
the way they've done that because
they've<00:02:33.170> increased<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.980> space<00:02:34.190> inside<00:02:34.670> but

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
they've increased the space inside but

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.539 
they've increased the space inside but
it's<00:02:35.570> still<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.870> maneuverable<00:02:36.769> car<00:02:37.160> even

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
it's still a maneuverable car even

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:38.890 
it's still a maneuverable car even

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.180 
basis so I'm aware of the tires they're
sort<00:03:29.180> of<00:03:29.239> dual<00:03:29.330> purpose<00:03:29.660> tire<00:03:29.870> so<00:03:30.080> it<00:03:30.379> fit<00:03:31.069> the

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
sort of dual purpose tire so it fit the

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.910 
sort of dual purpose tire so it fit the
purpose<00:03:31.610> I<00:03:31.790> mean<00:03:32.120> Subaru<00:03:32.780> for<00:03:32.989> me<00:03:33.170> they

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
purpose I mean Subaru for me they

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.970 
purpose I mean Subaru for me they
invented<00:03:34.670> this<00:03:34.849> genre<00:03:35.090> so<00:03:35.660> it's<00:03:36.470> not<00:03:36.620> kind<00:03:36.860> of

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
invented this genre so it's not kind of

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.640 
invented this genre so it's not kind of
them<00:03:37.430> comparing<00:03:38.060> them<00:03:38.180> itself<00:03:38.959> to<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.230> market

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
them comparing them itself to the market

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.229 
them comparing them itself to the market
is<00:03:39.770> the<00:03:39.890> market<00:03:40.040> comparing<00:03:40.610> themselves<00:03:40.760> to

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
is the market comparing themselves to

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.750 
is the market comparing themselves to
the<00:03:41.750> car<00:03:41.959> compared<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.800> other<00:03:42.890> off-road

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
the car compared to other off-road

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.220 
the car compared to other off-road
estates<00:03:44.209> I<00:03:44.360> think<00:03:44.510> there<00:03:44.629> is<00:03:44.660> more<00:03:44.930> ground

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
estates I think there is more ground

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.920 
estates I think there is more ground
clearance<00:03:45.470> sir<00:03:45.769> I<00:03:46.040> think<00:03:46.610> there's<00:03:46.760> more

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
clearance sir I think there's more

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.710 
clearance sir I think there's more
off-road<00:03:47.930> ability<00:03:48.319> than<00:03:48.790> 99%<00:03:49.790> of<00:03:50.060> people<00:03:50.510> are

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
off-road ability than 99% of people are

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.660 
off-road ability than 99% of people are
going<00:03:50.870> to<00:03:50.989> ever<00:03:51.410> need<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:52.040> mean<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.340> idea<00:03:52.580> of

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
going to ever need I mean the idea of

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.220 
going to ever need I mean the idea of
playing<00:03:52.879> Land<00:03:53.209> Cruiser<00:03:53.599> that<00:03:53.629> describes<00:03:54.140> we

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
playing Land Cruiser that describes we

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.809 
playing Land Cruiser that describes we
go<00:03:54.290> into<00:03:54.530> school<00:03:54.769> on<00:03:54.800> doesn't<00:03:55.220> appeal<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:55.459> me

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
go into school on doesn't appeal to me

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:56.720 
go into school on doesn't appeal to me
I<00:03:55.849> think<00:03:56.300> it's<00:03:56.480> still

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
I think it's still

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.220 
I think it's still
go<00:03:56.909> to<00:03:57.209> car<00:03:57.450> if<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:57.959> bought<00:03:58.110> an

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
go to car if you bought an

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.140 
go to car if you bought an
all-wheel-drive<00:03:58.470> estate<00:03:59.040> in<00:03:59.580> terms<00:03:59.879> of<00:04:00.000> S

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
all-wheel-drive estate in terms of S

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.030 
all-wheel-drive estate in terms of S
SUVs<00:04:00.930> I<00:04:01.260> don't<00:04:01.470> know<00:04:01.560> I<00:04:01.620> think<00:04:01.680> when<00:04:02.010> people

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
SUVs I don't know I think when people

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.280 
SUVs I don't know I think when people
buying<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.610> SUV<00:04:03.060> sector<00:04:03.599> they<00:04:03.989> look<00:04:04.170> at

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
buying the SUV sector they look at

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.080 
buying the SUV sector they look at
things<00:04:04.530> like<00:04:04.620> Range<00:04:05.129> Rovers<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:05.670> stuff<00:04:05.909> and<00:04:06.030> I

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
things like Range Rovers and stuff and I

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.699 
things like Range Rovers and stuff and I
think<00:04:06.269> on<00:04:06.390> badge<00:04:06.629> alone<00:04:06.989> it's<00:04:07.290> probably<00:04:07.590> not

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
think on badge alone it's probably not

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.800 
think on badge alone it's probably not
gonna<00:04:07.950> can<00:04:08.640> I<00:04:08.730> track<00:04:08.940> people<00:04:09.239> away<00:04:09.390> from<00:04:09.450> Range

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
gonna can I track people away from Range

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.839 
gonna can I track people away from Range
Rovers<00:04:10.140> but<00:04:10.290> in<00:04:10.379> the<00:04:10.560> estate<00:04:10.830> class<00:04:11.099> city<00:04:11.459> that

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
Rovers but in the estate class city that

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.039 
Rovers but in the estate class city that
it's<00:04:11.970> meant<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.239> be<00:04:12.330> in<00:04:12.599> I<00:04:12.720> think<00:04:12.750> it's

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
it's meant to be in I think it's

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:20.870 
it's meant to be in I think it's
definitely<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:14.220> top<00:04:14.430> one<00:04:19.880> touchscreen

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
definitely the top one touchscreen

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.939 
definitely the top one touchscreen
technology<00:04:21.090> so<00:04:21.690> it's<00:04:21.840> mimicking<00:04:22.500> some<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.860> the

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
technology so it's mimicking some of the

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.129 
technology so it's mimicking some of the
air<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.280> tablets<00:04:23.699> that<00:04:23.820> are<00:04:23.910> out<00:04:24.000> there<00:04:24.139> from

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
air the tablets that are out there from

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.830 
air the tablets that are out there from
what<00:04:25.260> I've<00:04:25.350> seen<00:04:25.919> of<00:04:25.979> it<00:04:26.190> so<00:04:27.090> it<00:04:27.540> looks<00:04:27.720> as

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
what I've seen of it so it looks as

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.330 
what I've seen of it so it looks as
though<00:04:27.870> it's<00:04:28.050> quite<00:04:28.139> sort<00:04:28.620> of<00:04:28.650> intuitive<00:04:29.160> and

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
though it's quite sort of intuitive and

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.010 
though it's quite sort of intuitive and
these<00:04:29.760> are<00:04:29.880> friendly<00:04:30.180> yeah<00:04:30.539> I<00:04:30.570> think<00:04:30.870> you

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
these are friendly yeah I think you

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.960 
these are friendly yeah I think you
would<00:04:31.139> be<00:04:31.260> able<00:04:31.320> to<00:04:31.470> use<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:31.830> safely<00:04:32.310> because

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
would be able to use it safely because

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.189 
would be able to use it safely because
if<00:04:33.060> it<00:04:33.150> was<00:04:33.270> any<00:04:33.389> smaller<00:04:33.720> than<00:04:33.840> you<00:04:34.080> would

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
if it was any smaller than you would

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.140 
if it was any smaller than you would
have<00:04:34.320> to<00:04:34.590> sort<00:04:34.830> of<00:04:34.919> be<00:04:35.100> looking<00:04:35.789> at<00:04:35.880> it<00:04:36.000> it

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
have to sort of be looking at it it

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.520 
have to sort of be looking at it it
would<00:04:36.270> have<00:04:36.360> all<00:04:36.570> your<00:04:36.720> attention<00:04:36.990> on<00:04:37.260> so<00:04:37.440> you

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
would have all your attention on so you

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.290 
would have all your attention on so you
need<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.830> drive<00:04:38.430> so<00:04:38.669> you<00:04:38.760> would<00:04:38.880> have<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.060> stop

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
need to drive so you would have to stop

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.909 
need to drive so you would have to stop
and<00:04:39.479> use<00:04:39.600> it<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:39.960> I<00:04:40.139> like<00:04:40.320> that<00:04:40.500> super<00:04:40.800> have

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
and use it and I like that super have

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.740 
and use it and I like that super have
done<00:04:41.100> it<00:04:41.190> themselves<00:04:41.340> so<00:04:41.850> that<00:04:42.000> it's<00:04:42.330> gonna<00:04:42.510> be

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
done it themselves so that it's gonna be

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.810 
done it themselves so that it's gonna be
easy<00:04:42.900> to<00:04:43.199> update<00:04:44.130> when<00:04:44.340> it<00:04:44.490> goes<00:04:44.610> into

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
easy to update when it goes into

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.279 
easy to update when it goes into
services<00:04:45.419> they'll<00:04:45.630> be<00:04:45.720> able<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:45.930> do<00:04:46.110> all<00:04:46.199> the

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
services they'll be able to do all the

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:47.779 
services they'll be able to do all the
updates<00:04:46.410> and<00:04:46.889> things<00:04:47.100> like<00:04:47.310> that<00:04:47.370> so<00:04:47.550> I<00:04:47.610> think

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
updates and things like that so I think

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.490

honest it'll depend on pricing in spec

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.200 
honest it'll depend on pricing in spec
what<00:05:35.870> what<00:05:36.260> will<00:05:36.410> get<00:05:36.560> inherent<00:05:37.060> but<00:05:38.060> I've

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
what what will get inherent but I've

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.720 
what what will get inherent but I've
also<00:05:38.360> checked<00:05:39.110> that<00:05:39.410> the<00:05:39.680> the<00:05:39.950> emissions<00:05:40.370> are

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
also checked that the the emissions are

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.310 
also checked that the the emissions are
much<00:05:41.000> lower<00:05:41.180> than<00:05:41.420> the<00:05:41.540> outgoing<00:05:41.660> model<00:05:41.870> so

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
much lower than the outgoing model so

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.750 
much lower than the outgoing model so
car<00:05:42.710> attacks<00:05:42.950> in<00:05:43.070> Ireland<00:05:43.370> we<00:05:43.490> do<00:05:43.610> get

car attacks in Ireland we do get
punished<00:05:44.060> quite<00:05:44.210> heavily<00:05:44.390> but<00:05:44.690> higher

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
punished quite heavily but higher

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.980 
punished quite heavily but higher
emissions<00:05:45.200> is<00:05:46.090> 145<00:05:47.090> g/km<00:05:47.960> of<00:05:48.500> co2<00:05:49.070> and<00:05:49.460> this<00:05:49.990> so

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
emissions is 145 g/km of co2 and this so

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.080 
emissions is 145 g/km of co2 and this so
like<00:05:51.470> it<00:05:51.740> make<00:05:51.920> a<00:05:51.950> difference<00:05:52.100> 200<00:05:52.760> euro<00:05:52.970> a

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
like it make a difference 200 euro a
