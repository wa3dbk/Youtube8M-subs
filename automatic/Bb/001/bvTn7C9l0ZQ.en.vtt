the<00:02:00.560> glue<00:02:00.710> so<00:02:01.010> I've<00:02:01.190> made<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.460> small<00:02:01.700> mark<00:02:02.090> there

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
the glue so I've made a small mark there

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.080 
the glue so I've made a small mark there
so<00:02:02.840> what<00:02:03.110> do<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.260> do<00:02:03.410> you<00:02:03.950> babble<00:02:04.490> all<00:02:04.700> these

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
so what do you do you babble all these

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.080 
so what do you do you babble all these
edges<00:02:05.330> over<00:02:05.870> here<00:02:06.430> which<00:02:07.430> are<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.820> ones<00:02:07.850> that

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
edges over here which are the ones that

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.639 
edges over here which are the ones that
taught<00:02:08.420> you<00:02:08.570> this<00:02:08.690> key<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.050> this<00:02:09.110> key<00:02:09.229> has<00:02:09.590> a

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
taught you this key and this key has a

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.600 
taught you this key and this key has a
radius<00:02:10.070> and<00:02:10.280> those<00:02:10.850> true<00:02:11.120> here<00:02:11.480> cannot<00:02:12.080> just

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
radius and those true here cannot just

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.980 
radius and those true here cannot just
you<00:02:13.610> put<00:02:13.820> them<00:02:14.000> together<00:02:14.209> you<00:02:14.510> have<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.870> have

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
you put them together you have to have

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.870 
you put them together you have to have
glue<00:02:15.230> in<00:02:15.380> there<00:02:15.530> you<00:02:16.130> bought<00:02:16.430> them<00:02:16.640> true

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
glue in there you bought them true

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.730 
glue in there you bought them true
together<00:02:17.270> like<00:02:17.510> that<00:02:19.750> good<00:02:20.750> like<00:02:20.959> that<00:02:21.200> then

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
together like that good like that then

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.400 
together like that good like that then
you<00:02:21.890> come<00:02:22.100> here<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.970> this<00:02:23.120> key<00:02:23.360> this<00:02:24.020> is<00:02:24.080> the

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
you come here to this key this is the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.840 
you come here to this key this is the
area<00:02:24.800> where<00:02:24.950> you're<00:02:25.100> going<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.310> start<00:02:25.550> uh<00:02:25.670> so

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
area where you're going to start uh so

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.140 
area where you're going to start uh so
you<00:02:25.910> want<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.270> make<00:02:26.450> sure<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.870> match<00:02:27.110> that<00:02:27.530> even

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.660 

going<00:02:32.150> up<00:02:32.330> is<00:02:32.540> very<00:02:32.900> corner<00:02:33.380> lay<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.250> bet

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
going up is very corner lay the bet

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.970 
going up is very corner lay the bet
like<00:02:34.910> here<00:02:35.209> don't<00:02:35.450> let<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.720> touch<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.320> just

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
like here don't let it touch and just

coming back here who you were starting

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.010 
coming back here who you were starting
right<00:02:39.350> there

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020

come away from follow this key just

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.020 
come away from follow this key just
looking<00:02:49.140> from<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.440> top<00:02:49.710> and<00:02:50.370> come<00:02:50.640> in<00:02:50.790> that

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
looking from the top and come in that

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.810 
looking from the top and come in that
even<00:02:51.500> you<00:02:52.500> come<00:02:52.710> back<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.160> corner<00:02:53.610> here

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
even you come back to this corner here

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.000 
even you come back to this corner here
is<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.030> tricky<00:02:54.300> part<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:55.140> got<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.410> go<00:02:55.530> all<00:02:55.710> the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
is the tricky part you got to go all the

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.640 
is the tricky part you got to go all the
way<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.400> corner<00:02:56.750> push<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.960> in<00:02:58.080> there<00:02:58.290> and

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
way to that corner push it in there and

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.340 
way to that corner push it in there and
then<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.670> just<00:02:59.940> hold<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.450> right<00:03:00.600> here<00:03:00.660> when

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
then you just hold it right here when

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.820 
then you just hold it right here when
you<00:03:01.470> fold<00:03:01.770> it<00:03:01.950> back<00:03:06.020> that's<00:03:07.020> that<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.560> you're

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
you fold it back that's that and you're

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.140 
you fold it back that's that and you're
going<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.070> make<00:03:08.190> sure<00:03:08.400> it's<00:03:08.550> nice<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:08.700> huge

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
going to make sure it's nice and huge

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.450 
going to make sure it's nice and huge
the<00:03:09.900> side<00:03:10.140> rails<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.590> always<00:03:10.890> want<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.190> send

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
the side rails you always want to send

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.220 
the side rails you always want to send
with<00:03:11.670> 36<00:03:12.150> grit<00:03:12.420> because<00:03:12.600> there's<00:03:12.960> a<00:03:12.990> lot<00:03:13.080> of

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
with 36 grit because there's a lot of

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.650 
with 36 grit because there's a lot of
friction<00:03:13.680> with<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:13.860> water<00:03:14.210> you<00:03:15.210> want<00:03:15.300> to<00:03:15.480> make

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
friction with the water you want to make

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.550 
friction with the water you want to make
sure<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:16.020> stays<00:03:16.290> in<00:03:16.320> your<00:03:16.560> books<00:03:21.440> when<00:03:22.440> you

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
sure it stays in your books when you

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.650 
sure it stays in your books when you
take<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:22.890> razor<00:03:23.070> blade<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:24.090> come<00:03:24.300> from<00:03:24.480> the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
take the razor blade you come from the

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.570 
take the razor blade you come from the
top<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:25.470> mark<00:03:25.770> where<00:03:26.010> you're<00:03:26.190> going<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.400> start

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
top you mark where you're going to start

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.480 
top you mark where you're going to start
your<00:03:26.790> cut<00:03:27.000> here<00:03:27.860> and<00:03:28.860> this<00:03:29.070> is<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.250> little

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
your cut here and this is a little

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.720 
your cut here and this is a little
tricky<00:03:30.290> but<00:03:31.290> they're<00:03:34.250> all<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.370> way<00:03:35.460> to<00:03:35.520> the

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
tricky but they're all the way to the

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:42.930 
tricky but they're all the way to the
top<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:37.290> this<00:03:37.620> way<00:03:38.210> know<00:03:39.210> you're<00:03:39.390> yet

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.590 

oops<00:03:43.940> let's<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.810> table<00:03:45.140> back<00:03:45.260> there<00:03:46.600> careful

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
oops let's the table back there careful

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.710 
oops let's the table back there careful
the<00:03:47.690> table<00:03:48.520> and<00:03:49.520> then<00:03:49.730> you<00:03:49.880> just<00:03:50.150> work<00:03:50.690> your

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
the table and then you just work your

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.590 
the table and then you just work your
way<00:03:50.960> up<00:03:51.130> I'm<00:03:52.130> sure<00:03:52.370> that<00:03:52.610> the<00:03:53.240> rail<00:03:53.450> was

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
way up I'm sure that the rail was

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.530 
way up I'm sure that the rail was
exposed<00:03:54.080> so<00:03:54.980> you<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:55.490> cut<00:03:55.760> it<00:03:55.880> right<00:03:56.210> at<00:03:56.510> the

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
exposed so you you cut it right at the

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.000 
exposed so you you cut it right at the
end<00:03:56.720> of<00:03:56.990> the<00:03:57.080> mech<00:03:57.530> it

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
end of the mech it

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.310 
end of the mech it
we<00:03:58.670> already<00:03:58.970> prepped<00:03:59.300> this<00:03:59.540> piece<00:03:59.780> as<00:04:00.020> you<00:04:00.140> can

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
we already prepped this piece as you can

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.830 
we already prepped this piece as you can
see<00:04:00.530> I<00:04:00.770> do<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.430> edges<00:04:01.760> sharper<00:04:02.270> so<00:04:02.480> if<00:04:02.630> when

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
see I do the edges sharper so if when

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.720 
see I do the edges sharper so if when
you<00:04:02.960> do<00:04:03.080> the<00:04:03.230> sanding<00:04:03.650> you<00:04:04.040> want<00:04:04.250> it<00:04:04.340> to<00:04:04.460> put

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
you do the sanding you want it to put

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.400 
you do the sanding you want it to put
against<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.240> other<00:04:05.420> one<00:04:05.660> which<00:04:05.840> is<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:05.990> quarter

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
against the other one which is a quarter

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.470 
against the other one which is a quarter
inch<00:04:06.560> thick<00:04:06.650> so<00:04:07.370> you<00:04:07.460> want<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:07.940> other<00:04:08.120> matte

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
inch thick so you want the other matte

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.050 
inch thick so you want the other matte
to<00:04:08.780> be<00:04:08.960> below<00:04:09.830> that<00:04:10.010> surface<00:04:10.340> so<00:04:10.670> that's<00:04:10.910> why

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
to be below that surface so that's why

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.970 
to be below that surface so that's why
we<00:04:11.270> leave<00:04:11.420> it<00:04:11.600> sharp<00:04:11.870> all<00:04:12.080> the<00:04:12.170> way<00:04:12.230> around<00:04:12.530> so

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
we leave it sharp all the way around so

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.040 
we leave it sharp all the way around so
you<00:04:13.010> don't<00:04:13.250> have<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:13.550> do<00:04:13.670> as<00:04:13.760> much<00:04:13.970> sand<00:04:14.390> inside

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
you don't have to do as much sand inside

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.920 
you don't have to do as much sand inside
the<00:04:15.260> foothold<00:04:15.650> to<00:04:16.190> get<00:04:16.820> it<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.420> other<00:04:17.600> one<00:04:17.810> too

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
the foothold to get it the other one too

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.960 
the foothold to get it the other one too
but<00:04:18.110> right<00:04:18.290> against<00:04:18.770> included<00:04:19.580> this<00:04:19.730> shape

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
but right against included this shape

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.180 
but right against included this shape
right<00:04:20.239> here<00:04:20.530> here<00:04:21.530> we<00:04:21.709> are<00:04:21.739> doing<00:04:22.010> the

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
right here here we are doing the

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.340 
right here here we are doing the
installation<00:04:22.750> continuing<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.810> installation

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
installation continuing the installation

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.650 
installation continuing the installation
on<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.890> side<00:04:25.100> rails<00:04:25.370> you<00:04:26.000> got<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.300> make<00:04:26.450> sure

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
on the side rails you got to make sure

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.520 
on the side rails you got to make sure
you<00:04:26.810> match<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.350> pattern<00:04:27.800> on<00:04:28.480> side<00:04:29.480> rail<00:04:29.810> so<00:04:30.050> we

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
you match the pattern on side rail so we

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.530 
you match the pattern on side rail so we
already<00:04:30.890> cut<00:04:31.190> to<00:04:31.460> match<00:04:31.670> it<00:04:31.880> you<00:04:31.910> just<00:04:32.180> put<00:04:32.420> her

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
already cut to match it you just put her

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.690 
already cut to match it you just put her
against<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.170> match<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.680> diamond<00:04:34.040> plate<00:04:34.220> and

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
against the match the diamond plate and

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.300 
against the match the diamond plate and
of<00:04:35.390> course<00:04:35.630> already<00:04:35.990> got<00:04:36.260> the<00:04:36.410> glue<00:04:36.590> on<00:04:36.770> it<00:04:36.920> we

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
of course already got the glue on it we

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.070 
of course already got the glue on it we
had<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.580> tape<00:04:37.820> to<00:04:37.970> protect<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.570> surface<00:04:38.930> that

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
had the tape to protect the surface that

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:47.710 
had the tape to protect the surface that
we<00:04:39.200> don't<00:04:39.350> want<00:04:39.470> to<00:04:39.560> get<00:04:39.680> any<00:04:39.830> glue<00:04:40.040> on

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:09.440 
go just go against that max this other
rail<00:05:04.160> you<00:05:05.160> go<00:05:05.340> about<00:05:05.580> halfway<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:09.180> top

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
rail you go about halfway the top

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.390 
rail you go about halfway the top
surface<00:05:09.750> again<00:05:10.320> follow<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:10.830> side<00:05:11.160> of<00:05:11.310> the

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400

make<00:05:12.180> sure<00:05:12.389> it's<00:05:12.540> no<00:05:12.660> gaps<00:05:13.790> then<00:05:14.790> you<00:05:14.940> get<00:05:15.150> this

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
make sure it's no gaps then you get this

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.379 
make sure it's no gaps then you get this
part<00:05:15.660> in<00:05:15.840> so<00:05:16.080> this<00:05:16.290> doesn't<00:05:16.650> lift<00:05:16.830> back<00:05:17.130> up

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
part in so this doesn't lift back up

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.140 
part in so this doesn't lift back up
always<00:05:18.389> tilting<00:05:19.080> it<00:05:19.200> this<00:05:19.380> way

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
always tilting it this way

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.110 
always tilting it this way
we've<00:05:21.150> got<00:05:21.330> no<00:05:21.510> bubbles<00:05:21.900> in<00:05:22.020> it
