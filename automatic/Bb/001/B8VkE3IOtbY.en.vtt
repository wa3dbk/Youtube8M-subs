00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
creation of this bike course was a lot

creation of this bike course was a lot
of<00:00:39.980> fun<00:00:40.250> for<00:00:40.460> me<00:00:40.610> as<00:00:40.760> an<00:00:41.180> athlete<00:00:41.330> as<00:00:41.780> a<00:00:41.810> cyclist

of fun for me as an athlete as a cyclist

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.650 
of fun for me as an athlete as a cyclist
I<00:00:42.560> look<00:00:42.770> for<00:00:43.070> courses<00:00:43.790> that<00:00:44.000> would<00:00:44.120> be<00:00:44.270> fun<00:00:44.510> to

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
I look for courses that would be fun to

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.220 
I look for courses that would be fun to
ride<00:00:44.870> and<00:00:45.370> so<00:00:46.370> as<00:00:46.550> we<00:00:46.790> approached<00:00:47.420> Whistler

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
ride and so as we approached Whistler

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.870 
ride and so as we approached Whistler
and<00:00:48.380> we're<00:00:48.530> looking<00:00:48.800> into<00:00:48.950> our<00:00:49.070> options<00:00:49.579> I

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
and we're looking into our options I

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.510 
and we're looking into our options I
went<00:00:50.780> out<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:51.020> rode<00:00:51.260> a<00:00:51.500> number<00:00:51.920> of<00:00:52.040> roads<00:00:52.340> in

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
went out and rode a number of roads in

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.420 
went out and rode a number of roads in
the<00:00:52.640> area<00:00:52.790> and<00:00:53.829> created<00:00:54.829> a<00:00:54.920> course<00:00:55.160> that<00:00:55.370> I

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
the area and created a course that I

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.250 
the area and created a course that I
thought<00:00:55.730> would<00:00:55.880> be<00:00:55.910> fun<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:56.540> challenging

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
thought would be fun and challenging

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.580 
thought would be fun and challenging
that<00:00:58.250> would<00:00:58.370> be<00:00:58.579> an<00:00:59.110> experience<00:01:00.110> for<00:01:00.230> the

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
that would be an experience for the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.229 
that would be an experience for the
athletes<00:01:01.040> that<00:01:01.160> they<00:01:01.340> wouldn't<00:01:01.610> forget<00:01:01.970> and

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
athletes that they wouldn't forget and

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.439 
athletes that they wouldn't forget and
so<00:01:02.930> creating<00:01:03.890> this<00:01:04.250> course<00:01:04.519> through<00:01:05.329> the

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
so creating this course through the

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.170 
so creating this course through the
glaciated<00:01:05.990> Peaks<00:01:06.740> and<00:01:07.100> through<00:01:07.820> some<00:01:08.030> of<00:01:08.120> the

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
glaciated Peaks and through some of the

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.090 
glaciated Peaks and through some of the
valley<00:01:08.360> sections<00:01:08.990> I<00:01:09.320> think<00:01:09.590> it's<00:01:09.710> going<00:01:09.860> to<00:01:09.920> be

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
valley sections I think it's going to be

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.510 
valley sections I think it's going to be
an<00:01:10.400> amazing<00:01:10.909> ride<00:01:11.090> for<00:01:11.450> all<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.900> athletes

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
three and a half miles are pretty steep

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.039 
three and a half miles are pretty steep
up<00:01:22.220> to<00:01:22.610> a<00:01:22.640> ten<00:01:22.940> percent<00:01:23.180> incline<00:01:23.690> in<00:01:23.840> some

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.899 
up to a ten percent incline in some
sections<00:01:24.470> then<00:01:24.950> it<00:01:25.040> levels<00:01:25.310> off<00:01:25.430> for<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.670> mile

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
sections then it levels off for a mile

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.550 
sections then it levels off for a mile
and<00:01:26.180> then<00:01:26.479> three<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:26.750> a<00:01:26.840> half<00:01:26.990> more<00:01:27.170> miles<00:01:27.440> to

and then three and a half more miles to
the<00:01:27.620> very<00:01:27.799> top<00:01:28.040> to<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.220> turnaround<00:01:28.729> if

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
the very top to the turnaround if

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.880 
the very top to the turnaround if
there's<00:01:29.420> any<00:01:29.600> bit<00:01:29.780> of<00:01:29.810> good<00:01:30.020> news<00:01:30.200> here<00:01:30.229> you'll

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
there's any bit of good news here you'll

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.740 
there's any bit of good news here you'll
have<00:01:31.040> a<00:01:31.070> tailwind<00:01:31.549> going<00:01:31.790> up<00:01:31.970> but<00:01:32.420> then<00:01:32.510> again

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
have a tailwind going up but then again

00:01:32.750 --> 00:02:04.020 
have a tailwind going up but then again
you'll<00:01:32.869> have<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:33.020> headwind<00:01:33.380> coming<00:01:33.890> down

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.610 

so<00:02:04.570> after<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.870> pass<00:02:05.020> through<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.290> gauge<00:02:05.470> of

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
so after you pass through the gauge of

the entrance to Whistler Olympic Park
you<00:02:07.540> have<00:02:07.570> one<00:02:07.810> mile<00:02:07.990> to<00:02:08.110> go<00:02:08.259> into<00:02:08.470> your<00:02:08.619> reach

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
you have one mile to go into your reach

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.499 
you have one mile to go into your reach
here<00:02:09.160> which<00:02:09.340> is<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.640> far<00:02:10.179> end<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.420> the

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
here which is the far end of the

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.210 
here which is the far end of the
biathlon<00:02:10.929> parking<00:02:11.350> lot<00:02:11.500> this<00:02:11.950> is<00:02:12.010> your

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
biathlon parking lot this is your

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.980 
biathlon parking lot this is your
turnaround<00:02:12.610> point<00:02:12.820> once<00:02:13.390> you're<00:02:13.510> here<00:02:13.720> it's

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
turnaround point once you're here it's

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:41.720 
turnaround point once you're here it's
eight<00:02:14.170> miles<00:02:14.380> back<00:02:14.560> down<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.010> hill

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.120 

so<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.880> pacing<00:02:43.360> for<00:02:43.630> this<00:02:43.990> race<00:02:44.260> is<00:02:44.560> crucial

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
so the pacing for this race is crucial

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.310 
so the pacing for this race is crucial
for<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:46.000> be<00:02:46.120> successful<00:02:46.300> on<00:02:46.870> this<00:02:46.990> course

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
for you to be successful on this course

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.700 
for you to be successful on this course
you're<00:02:48.010> going<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.310> have<00:02:48.490> to<00:02:48.700> hold<00:02:49.060> back<00:02:49.210> some

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
you're going to have to hold back some

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.680 
you're going to have to hold back some
the<00:02:50.710> front<00:02:50.980> end<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.310> this<00:02:51.460> course<00:02:51.790> because

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
the front end of this course because

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.750 
the front end of this course because
there<00:02:53.050> are<00:02:53.200> some<00:02:53.440> hills<00:02:53.680> that<00:02:53.950> come<00:02:54.190> very<00:02:54.520> late

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
there are some hills that come very late

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.570 
there are some hills that come very late
so<00:02:55.450> you'll<00:02:55.630> get<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.290> climbing<00:02:56.740> in<00:02:57.520> the

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
so you'll get the climbing in the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.060 
so you'll get the climbing in the
Calahan<00:02:58.210> but<00:02:58.420> don't<00:02:58.630> push<00:02:58.870> too<00:02:58.900> hard<00:02:59.110> you'll

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
Calahan but don't push too hard you'll

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.010 
Calahan but don't push too hard you'll
probably<00:03:00.310> pick<00:03:00.790> up<00:03:00.820> a<00:03:01.060> tailwind<00:03:01.570> head<00:03:01.780> in<00:03:01.900> the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
probably pick up a tailwind head in the

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.750 
probably pick up a tailwind head in the
Pemberton<00:03:02.530> that's<00:03:02.740> the<00:03:02.980> traditional<00:03:03.550> wind

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
Pemberton that's the traditional wind

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.270 
Pemberton that's the traditional wind
and<00:03:04.030> that's<00:03:05.020> a<00:03:05.140> good<00:03:05.290> time<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.560> get<00:03:05.800> you<00:03:05.950> some

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
and that's a good time to get you some

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.620 
and that's a good time to get you some
nutrition<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:06.940> you'll<00:03:07.090> pick<00:03:07.270> up<00:03:07.300> special

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
nutrition and you'll pick up special

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.240 
nutrition and you'll pick up special
needs<00:03:08.020> as<00:03:08.200> your<00:03:08.350> head<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.620> through<00:03:08.770> Pemberton

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
needs as your head and through Pemberton

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.340 
needs as your head and through Pemberton
about<00:03:09.520> halfway<00:03:09.760> through<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.780> course<00:03:11.050> the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
about halfway through the course the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.170 
about halfway through the course the

back from Pemberton is uphill on your
way<00:03:46.510> into<00:03:46.750> Whistler<00:03:47.230> so<00:03:47.380> you're<00:03:47.500> gonna<00:03:47.620> want

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
way into Whistler so you're gonna want

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.470 
way into Whistler so you're gonna want
to<00:03:47.920> save<00:03:48.100> something<00:03:48.550> in<00:03:48.670> those<00:03:48.820> legs<00:03:49.150> for

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
to save something in those legs for

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.420 
to save something in those legs for
those<00:03:50.380> last<00:03:50.820> 30<00:03:51.820> K<00:03:52.120> or<00:03:52.420> 20<00:03:52.780> miles<00:03:53.250> there<00:03:54.250> are

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
those last 30 K or 20 miles there are

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.060 
those last 30 K or 20 miles there are
some<00:03:54.730> very<00:03:55.150> specific<00:03:55.780> areas<00:03:56.230> that<00:03:56.830> you<00:03:56.920> need

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
some very specific areas that you need

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.610 
some very specific areas that you need
to<00:03:57.190> pay<00:03:57.370> attention<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.910> on<00:03:58.240> the<00:03:58.270> descents<00:03:58.840> some

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
to pay attention to on the descents some

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.470 
to pay attention to on the descents some
of<00:03:59.740> those<00:03:59.890> are<00:04:00.100> coming<00:04:00.400> out<00:04:00.640> of<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.030> Callaghan

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.320 
of those are coming out of the Callaghan
Valley<00:04:01.780> and<00:04:02.190> then<00:04:03.190> there's<00:04:03.520> another<00:04:03.970> one

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
Valley and then there's another one

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.990 
Valley and then there's another one
that's<00:04:05.050> actually<00:04:05.620> on<00:04:05.830> your<00:04:06.040> return<00:04:06.460> trip<00:04:06.700> to

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
that's actually on your return trip to

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.270 
that's actually on your return trip to
Whistler<00:04:07.180> as<00:04:07.630> you're<00:04:08.440> heading<00:04:08.710> south<00:04:08.980> from

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
Whistler as you're heading south from

Whistler as you're heading south from
Pemberton<00:04:09.910> where<00:04:10.510> there's<00:04:10.690> a<00:04:10.750> big<00:04:11.050> sweeping

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.180 
Pemberton where there's a big sweeping
u-turn<00:04:13.660> that<00:04:14.200> you<00:04:14.320> can<00:04:14.470> get<00:04:14.680> some<00:04:14.920> pretty<00:04:15.070> good

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
u-turn that you can get some pretty good

u-turn that you can get some pretty good
speed<00:04:15.640> on<00:04:15.670> but<00:04:16.480> pay<00:04:16.630> attention<00:04:16.660> because

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
speed on but pay attention because

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.360 
speed on but pay attention because
there's<00:04:17.470> more<00:04:17.650> than<00:04:17.830> likely<00:04:18.010> going<00:04:18.220> to<00:04:18.310> be

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
there's more than likely going to be

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.430 
there's more than likely going to be
riders<00:04:18.820> heading<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.239> opposite<00:04:19.989> uphill
