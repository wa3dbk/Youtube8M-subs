00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.110 
the jump I like to do big things but
they<00:01:50.810> seem<00:01:51.020> normal<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.470> me<00:01:51.619> so

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.080 

I<00:01:54.240> learned<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.900> ollie<00:01:55.080> over<00:01:55.230> a<00:01:55.410> cold<00:01:55.710> pan<00:01:56.100> and

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
I learned to ollie over a cold pan and

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.080 
I learned to ollie over a cold pan and
like<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.780> day<00:01:58.560> or<00:01:58.800> something<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.400> then<00:01:59.700> from

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
like a day or something and then from

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.210 
like a day or something and then from
there<00:02:00.330> I<00:02:00.600> was<00:02:00.990> around<00:02:01.170> lots<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.440> platforms<00:02:02.040> and

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
there I was around lots of platforms and

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.740 
there I was around lots of platforms and
he<00:02:02.310> was<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.580> ollie<00:02:02.760> onto<00:02:03.000> something<00:02:03.540> so

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
he was the ollie onto something so

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.450 
he was the ollie onto something so
that's<00:02:04.380> probably<00:02:04.620> why<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.920> learned<00:02:05.190> to<00:02:05.370> all

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460
