00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
forward for the Planning Commission the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.520 
forward for the Planning Commission the
initial<00:00:52.570> thought<00:00:52.810> of<00:00:53.020> going<00:00:53.200> through

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
initial thought of going through

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.620 
initial thought of going through
planning<00:00:53.890> was<00:00:54.010> quite<00:00:54.220> daunting<00:00:54.490> because<00:00:55.210> you

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
planning was quite daunting because you

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.350 
planning was quite daunting because you
read<00:00:56.080> lots<00:00:56.320> of<00:00:56.560> books<00:00:56.620> on<00:00:57.160> these<00:00:57.340> things<00:00:57.700> in

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
read lots of books on these things in

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.760 
read lots of books on these things in
fact<00:00:58.630> it<00:00:58.870> was<00:00:59.080> very<00:00:59.880> reasonable<00:01:00.880> process<00:01:01.360> and

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
fact it was very reasonable process and

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.439 
fact it was very reasonable process and
I<00:01:02.770> thinking<00:01:03.160> all<00:01:03.340> from<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.730> point<00:01:04.000> where<00:01:04.239> we

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
I thinking all from the point where we

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.320 
I thinking all from the point where we
and<00:01:04.809> as<00:01:05.470> you<00:01:05.680> made<00:01:05.830> an<00:01:05.920> offer<00:01:06.070> on<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.520> land<00:01:06.729> to

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
and as you made an offer on the land to

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.550 
and as you made an offer on the land to
the<00:01:07.390> point<00:01:07.630> being<00:01:07.840> able<00:01:08.050> to<00:01:08.110> put<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.260> first

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
the point being able to put the first

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.859 
the point being able to put the first
foundations<00:01:09.310> down<00:01:09.550> Taylor<00:01:09.850> was<00:01:10.270> about<00:01:10.479> six

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
through that period and helped us

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.609 
through that period and helped us
understand<00:01:17.710> how<00:01:17.800> we<00:01:17.950> needed<00:01:18.280> to<00:01:18.369> get<00:01:18.490> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619

granny and just trying to use natural

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.430 
granny and just trying to use natural
materials<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.580> we<00:02:18.330> think<00:02:18.510> they<00:02:18.810> hold<00:02:19.050> tiles

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
materials like we think they hold tiles

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.710 
materials like we think they hold tiles
we've<00:02:19.800> actually<00:02:19.950> used<00:02:20.160> them<00:02:20.490> upside<00:02:21.000> down<00:02:21.360> and

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
we've actually used them upside down and

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.270 
we've actually used them upside down and
incorporated<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.500> paw<00:02:22.710> print<00:02:22.740> that<00:02:23.130> was

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
incorporated a paw print that was

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.700 
incorporated a paw print that was
naturally<00:02:24.030> there<00:02:24.210> from<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.510> cat<00:02:24.750> when<00:02:25.350> we<00:02:25.530> dug

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
naturally there from a cat when we dug

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.860 
naturally there from a cat when we dug
the<00:02:25.830> foundation<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.490> we<00:02:26.640> found<00:02:26.880> some

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
the foundation that we found some

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.140
