didn't catch that I threw in some
variations<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:29.550> second<00:03:29.910> time<00:03:30.030> I<00:03:30.060> played<00:03:30.330> the

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
variations the second time I played the

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.840

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
these tone bands from the 11th fret to

these tone bands from the 11th fret to
the<00:03:34.830> 13th<00:03:35.280> fret<00:03:36.019> can<00:03:37.019> be<00:03:37.170> turned<00:03:37.410> into<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.709> sort

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
the 13th fret can be turned into a sort

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.190 
the 13th fret can be turned into a sort
of<00:03:37.950> tandem<00:03:38.430> pedal<00:03:39.030> steel<00:03:39.209> kind<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.510> Bend<00:03:39.720> by

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
of tandem pedal steel kind of Bend by

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.830 
of tandem pedal steel kind of Bend by
just<00:03:40.410> grabbing<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.910> 12th<00:03:42.420> fret<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.810> the

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
just grabbing the 12th fret of the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:53.690 
just grabbing the 12th fret of the
b-string<00:03:43.050> in<00:03:43.470> addition<00:03:43.860> so<00:03:52.340> so<00:03:53.340> that's<00:03:53.519> one

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
b-string in addition so so that's one

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.820 
b-string in addition so so that's one
way<00:03:53.819> of<00:03:53.850> varying<00:03:54.269> it<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.569> at<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:54.989> end<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.709> can

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
way of varying it and at the end you can

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.740 
way of varying it and at the end you can
also<00:03:55.980> bury<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.430> ending<00:03:56.760> lick<00:03:57.150> rather<00:03:57.600> than

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
also bury the ending lick rather than

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.140 
also bury the ending lick rather than
going<00:03:57.930> up<00:04:01.010> put<00:04:02.010> any<00:04:02.160> kind<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.430> other<00:04:02.610> knee<00:04:02.970> like
