00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello everyone with you maracasi you are watching 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.460
 transfer of fun and bugs part 30 and 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.280
 today's release will have a lot 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.000
 interesting bugs new mode tank 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.160
 race 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.550
 here's how you can see tea 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.740
 fit into the turn and stuck in the pipes 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.199
 pretty funny moment you need all the same 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.189
 gently turn to such 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.859
 there were no situations and here I am an outsider 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.040
 it seems he has already lagged behind everyone and he needs 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.710
 urgently catch up opponents but unsuccessful 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.829
 Chaffik jump crashes and falls 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.530
 under the ground it seems this player is unlikely 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.040
 already be able to catch up with their rivals 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.800
 the race didn’t go very well 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.800
 Here is such a kosyachok occurred 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.750
 how nice to be in the lead 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.730
 race and what a great springboard chaffik 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.640
 gain speed but crashes 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.890
 and flies right inside this house like 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.390
 live now all the same get out of here 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.430
 opponents come by with a smirk and 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.220
 continue the race and our hero tries 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.970
 somehow leave here but he has nothing 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.930
 it does not work like that 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.960
 that everything seems to be going well but here it’s time 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.180
 you're already inside the building and out of here 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.250
 no 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.070
 friends look carefully at the road 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.270
 otherwise there might be such you 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.150
 problems but it happens that the bugs 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.549
 bring not only harm but also benefit 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.470
 albeit a small player for example 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.220
 gaining speed ahead the cliff 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.759
 he makes a leap and see which one 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.610
 great trick here 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:54.060
 twists the tank around its axis and 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:57.000
 looks very cool it looks like this 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.540
 player race failed crashes he here 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.090
 the wall and now generally falls down and he 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.729
 decides if my race doesn't go right 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.509
 another player, too, spoil everything 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.290
 he begins to pinch that cupie 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.159
 and pushes him off to approach the pipe and the most 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.680
 funny he gets to do it and 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:22.549
 the enemy will not be able to leave already 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.250
 the player for an hour continues his race 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.970
 the truth is we can hardly get to 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.950
 rivals as you probably understood in 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.930
 This mode is very important to look at 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.569
 road and not bump into any 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.849
 obstacles or you can get stuck here in 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.549
 such an awkward position yet 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:43.819
 opponents will blatantly shoot at you 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:46.849
 so friends look at the road and then 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:52.209
 You can get stuck or worse fail 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:52.209
 underground of course funny tank 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.040
 one more confirmation of what you need 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.040
 look at the road they shoot 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.319
 with opponents and something can happen here 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.530
 such a ridiculous moment you drive you to 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.049
 wall and get out of here you can not yet 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.840
 and the joke is that for some reason the enemy 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.690
 got up and shoot out with our hero 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.390
 which is unlikely to get out of here 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.940
 naturally kill him fail 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.340
 what a tough enemy clash 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.849
 completely bummed and our hero decides 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.519
 revenge is catching up with the abuser and just 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.159
 imprints it into the wall in literal 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.799
 sense really the adversary cannot 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:40.920
 get out of this house is funny 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.099
 it turned out so here the enemy rams 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.750
 our chaffik and then he catches up 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:52.220
 offender and pushes him into the wall here 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.220
 she's some sweet revenge 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.980
 next we have a very funny moment 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:04.680
 the player decides to act not by the rules 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.680
 he wants to cut off a little his way 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.189
 jumps from this bridge and lands 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.379
 straight to the zone where the race is not decided 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:15.989
 here and so he thinks that he cheats 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:19.350
 the smartest rides down the hill 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:22.380
 cheerful but not so rosy the fact is 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.199
 that it is impossible to return from here to the race 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.110
 because there is no way out although it may 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:31.199
 to be somewhere there is a loophole quite 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.720
 you can probably even cut it straight somewhere 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.810
 very robust and win that way 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.440
 I don’t know the race exactly but anyway 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.440
 funny 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.890
 And finally, let's see two 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.760
 wonderful shots from the guard on 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:53.160
 kv-2 and t49 I will be interested by the way 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.900
 read in the comments what built 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.300
 better here for example kv-2 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.620
 again with the guard gets on 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.210
 mordo.ru wonderful shot turned out 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:07.200
 best traditions kv-2 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.900
 but he excelled and 49 on the move he shoots 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.320
 and even without a sniper mode 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.290
 picks up fifty four she really stood 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.990
 in place of the temple is cool and that's it 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.270
