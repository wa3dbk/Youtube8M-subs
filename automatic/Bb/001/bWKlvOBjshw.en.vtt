00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:02.240
 m he 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.720
 but 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.270
 whom 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.109
 as soon as it came out more or less decently 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:12.009
 no intent 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.119
 Sochitsy merchant 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.059
 author what they could do beautifully 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.550
 better 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.789
 the question is now an hour of play 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.829
 having a little understanding 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.829
 we understand the author as intended 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.609
 and he did pretty well 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.029
 after we dismantled the download 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.460
 it's time to get down to the plot 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.300
 of course there was a joke and yet like that 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.370
 who would you be or not 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.160
 but that we have complete freedom of choice 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.800
 build a big and beautiful house 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.490
 make your company 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.040
 to breed animals 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.510
 you are going to dry 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.850
 in the end with the system and the snakes 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.900
 present world 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.540
 before that 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.130
 worth it to drop but I already 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.130
 at least with a convincing bare hand 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.910
 get some stones and make a little 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.420
 shelters 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.390
 and that's what the wait is not the friendliest 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.780
 a guest 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.780
 such as discount zones when buying 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.250
 after you have experienced your first 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.020
 night can search 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.820
 to create a bed 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.900
 with which it will be possible 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.000
 in the end not to survive 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.570
 japanese iron to create armor 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.570
 and the field of perfect tools 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.710
 you will have 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.710
 not easy to kill 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.220
 You can build a good dollar 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.840

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.270

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.270
