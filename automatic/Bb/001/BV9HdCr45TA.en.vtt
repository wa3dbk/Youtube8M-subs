00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
from a few years ago around the back you

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.990 
from a few years ago around the back you

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
460,000 dots so it's not a hugely high

460,000 dots so it's not a hugely high
resolution<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:50.700> definitely<00:00:50.879> enough<00:00:51.270> to

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
resolution but it's definitely enough to

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.650

the option of getting it with or without
image<00:01:45.420> stabilization<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.500> strongly<00:01:47.100> suggest

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
image stabilization I strongly suggest

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.149
