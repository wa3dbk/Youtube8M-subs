00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:05.460
 it never protects itself from the young 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.200
 girls like many highlights andreasen 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.160
 I've already got that 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:17.550
 all rejected that counts but that 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:19.980
 It is not called but you feel 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.130
 that the interest of his 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:28.710
 age group has grown quite a bit 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:32.790
 In any case, but you have it on 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.649
 already used to success try it 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.579
 to win by bringing your ship 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.110
 complete training every day and that 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.200
 today was more than failed 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.820
 yes it was it was very good but still 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.870
 not perfect so his little things 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.789
 in it can improve 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.320
 but it was definitely nice 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.309
 training three good jumps and of that 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.440
 he 'll start all morning 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:01:03.629
 The perfect is the enemy of the good 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:06.900
 say you are satisfied about it 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.820
 but for that you have to bring what that 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.229
 but now with the perfect start 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.420
 because she is not another 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.220
 Friend jump perfectly and yes perfect 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.520
 then we can be natural 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.490
 the plan exactly so now we want 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.650
 seriously the changeover will be 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.040
 There are no problems with his country 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.009
 more 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.140
 not quite a problem with each other 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.509
 working and working optimally 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.939
 tries is now better is that 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.250
 you then compete for the next 19 35 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.780
 can sometimes thinks a plow in the hall 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.909
 bit off eight now for me 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.770
 even only two before yes every now and then 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.470
 nice thought but now 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.670
 getting better again in the beginning one 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.920
 then speaks of one 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.350
 so dynamic stereotypes had when 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.930
 something has automated and that is 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.909
 already automated the new yes 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.799
 a whole the left foot was in front 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.009
 automated and now I am only 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.930
 making it perfect and easy 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.439
 without thinking the clean and pure 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.840
 put 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.060
 so the landing is the only thing on the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.640
 perfect longer still missing 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.810
 There is something else missing but there 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.430
 to work 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.730
 then we wish you a team 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.730
 All the best
