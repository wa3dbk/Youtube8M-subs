00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:05.800
I'm Yunji De Nies.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.340
Take a look at this!! Is

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.070
it a sinkhole or the

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.670
remnants of something

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.340
else? That's what folks

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:12.910
in Wahiawa are asking

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.510
about this giant hole

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.350
near Lake Wilson.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.910
KITV4's Andrew Pereira

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.080
joins us with our top

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.650
story at 6... Andrew?

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.150
Yunji and Paula, you

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.720
really have to be

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.050
standing next to this

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.620
hole to appreciate how

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.690
deep it is. Big enough

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.990
that it almost claimed a

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.930
car!

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.590
It doesn't look that bad

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.410
from far away, but as you

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.170
come closer, the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.740
size of this hole in the

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.370
ground becomes a head

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.370
scratcher.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.970
VIXIE CASTRO: "WE TELL

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.170
THEM THERE'S A HOLE IN

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.740
THE BACKYARD, BUT WHEN

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.140
THEY COME THEN THEY'RE

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.780
CALLING FRIEND AFTER

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.650
FRIEND. SO, YEAH, IT'S

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.280
MESMERIZING."

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.810
ASHLEY MAPA: "IT KIND OF

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.180
SCARES ME. I DON'T

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.820
REALLY LIKE GETTING CLOSE

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.950
TO IT BECAUSE I'M SCARED

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.350
MYSELF AND ACTUALLY FALL

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.890
IN, YOU KNOW?" Folks who

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.490
live or work on this

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.290
2-acre lot off Wilikini

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.890
Drive in Wahiawa say the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.860
hole opened up without

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.190
warning Sunday at about

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.030
11 a.m.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.600
CYNTHIA MAPA: "IT'S

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.260
DANGEROUS SO THEY HAVE

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.270
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.830
IT." A 30-foot tree that

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.140
had stood nearby fell

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.600
into the hole and is no

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.340
longer visible.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.940
"ROCK THROWN IN HOLE"

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.040
Needless to say, it's a

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.110
long way down.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.610
SKYLER SILVA: "I JUST

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.950
CAME AND STARTED

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.580
THROWING STUFF INSIDE AND

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.580
MESSING AROUND. TRIED TO

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.150
SEE IF ANOTHER LEDGE

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.890
WOULD FALL OFF BUT IT

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:27.420
DIDN'T." However a BMW

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.590
parked nearby almost

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.220
fell in. The car's

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.960
windshield cracked from

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.160
the force of the jolt.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.030
ASHLEY MAPA: "I'M SCARED

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.630
THAT IT ACTUALLY CAN GET

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.930
BIGGER AND SUCK A BUNCH

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.400
OF OTHER THINGS IN WITH

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.170
IT BECAUSE IT'S

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.800
UNPREDICTABLE YOU KNOW?"

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.400
A sewer pipe located near

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.840
the hole broke off when

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.510
it opened up on Sunday.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.110
The person who leases the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.740
lot from the landowner

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.010
believes the hole used to

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.810
be a cesspool. There's

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.380
no shortage of theories

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.280
of what caused this

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.880
gaping chasm.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.480
VIXIE CASTRO: "I GUESS

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.720
FROM THE WEATHER, YEAH.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.720
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.320
TRIGGERED IT AND MAYBE

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.620
PERHAPS AN AIR SOCKET IN

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.320
THE EARTH."

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.890
TRENTON OLORASA: "I THINK

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.490
IT'S BY AN AIR BUBBLE

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.090
THAT POPPED THE DIRT OUT

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.440
OF THE GROUND AND SUCKED

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.960
THE

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.900
TREE IN.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.700
I THINK WE SHOULD FENCE

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.900
IT AND MAKE SURE PEOPLE

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.900
DON'T COME BY IT."

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.500
The leaseholder of the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.810
land is taking Trenton's

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.380
suggestion to heart...

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.010
He says he'll erect a

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.580
fence around the hole and

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.750
eventually fill it in

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.350
with rocks and dirt. The

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.950
Honolulu Board of Water

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.810
Supply is going out to

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:30.380
take a look at the hole,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.020
and both the city and

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.900
state have been notified.
