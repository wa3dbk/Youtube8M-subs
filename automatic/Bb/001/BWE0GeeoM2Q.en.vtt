00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.840

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.020
 also in the general body and 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.369
 Face care I think so the drugstore 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.260
 to offer a lot 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.000
 I have directly at the evening 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.970
 because that's the first thing that comes to mind 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.859
 and that there is a product which I 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.539
 Swear for ages already 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.609
 I've also had you many years ago 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.500
 shown my videos and I find it 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.149
 still it is the best product 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.489
 for me i need no other in 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.620
 this area and that is one thing 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.350
 finishing cream if you are with yours 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.059
 entire make-up entire styling of 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.770
 give the hair craft you give yourself 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.180
 this cream just just completely 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.760
 to conclude about the hair 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.579
 that's totally what that is 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.590
 totally simply quiet in methane or 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.460
 flying hair and that too completely 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.260
 It just makes it totally supple 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.800
 shiny and a nice one often and too 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.840
 and that's from christie's 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.270
 magic formula pages finish cream with 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.159
 avocado oil gives her ghostly 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.670
 dry hair suppleness and when 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.170
 without flying have so that's what makes 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.390
 it actually makes it easy here 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.850
 super nice supple and you will 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.110
 simply live so carefree style comes 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.030
 about six euros 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.060
 then I continue with the body and 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.439
 I have a body lotion for me 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.970
 I did not discover it that long ago 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.159
 use of the I me again 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.799
 a product after bought and that 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.530
 This is often the often over seed of 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.090
 Maria extra for very dry skin that 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.350
 I have already shown a video and 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.939
 That's a second pack 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.100
 so you see that I do that 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.460
 I really use creamy every day 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.899
 memorable and evening one now 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.700
 regardless of whether I am in the morning 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.970
 or am I at night make it an ever 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.990
 pug and in the evening before going to sleep 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.180
 It's really great 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.590
 it just wears out very well, though 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.000
 still super fast 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.890
 it's just such a really good one 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.680
 Social coaches for the body and besides 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.149
 also judges how finally how 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.830
 So sunscreen a bit really 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.230
 After sunscreen, I wear this on 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.510
 I immediately the beach somehow 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.980
 Revenge at sight and there I remember 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.720
 It's been that way since summer 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.069
 I find that for this season and 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.590
 for spring and for the 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.140
 summer just perfect so what do i have 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.780
 something for the face and that 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.930
 really a great product from maria 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.360
 the beauty effect is so you hear 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.370
 ours is just that way again 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.220
 I have an extra dose of moisture 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.890
 you already shown in my routine 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.260
 I think that's what I'm promoting 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.880
 I take every day before I actually 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.510
 apply my day cream 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.760
 of that I give myself a surge 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.130
 me so on the finger and 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.349
 simplifying the then my whole face 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.880
 you can do it autopsied only to pucker 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.650
 apply it so there is one 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.230
 Extraportion moisture goes and 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.150
 that only so beautiful is done so often me 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.400
 think it has a totally smoothing 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.019
 effect and would be simple 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.579
 It feels like the skin feels 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.290
 after that not so dry anymore 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.269
 and the good thing is that is 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.840
 super fast moves are so is in 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:19.180
 two seconds it is gone with me and that 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.920
 the main thing we are absorbed 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.450
 I have to say that we are very 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.319
 very dry skin therefore has the 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.200
 great for me 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.060
 That's why I think that's the way it is 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.530
 moves in quickly because I just notice 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.060
 that my skin is really well tolerated 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.650
 Us really good and he can use 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.690
 I take something for face what 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.540
 you also definitely recommend to you 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.030
 can and indeed is that the mask of 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.490
 all 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.430
 you really really like it 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.260
 even for years now and I have to 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.840
 just say that that is a mass 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.130
 also that I can trust really well 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.720
 visually always count 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.950
 if i just that led that me 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.050
 another extra care 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.300
 it needs as I said the 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.220
 Moisture mask here stands around 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.200
 wild rose and voices also extra for 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.580
 dry skin 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.610
 it's definitely not 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.440
 clarifying or so if your train or 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.330
 bitchy in one then I wish you that 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.970
 Definitely not recommend for this 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.890
 it should not have thought it should be yes 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.420
 also it does not say it is here 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.359
 just really just and moisture too 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.000
 donate a bit more to your Europe 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.280
 to push it again 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.110
 to give extra-care so that 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.050
 After that they simply approached nicely 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.790
 and feels intensively groomed 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.470
 I just always feel that 's it 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.479
 over two days that I really did 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.610
 note that has really brought something 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.930
 put my skin somehow dry 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.940
 maybe I sometimes like that 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.370
 have eyes or chin 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.350
 they are also absolutely cheap 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.850
 not much i think i am for one 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.560
 euro and you have two packs 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.780
 I said how much higher and 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.550
 Boost costs the cost of not more than 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.410
 three euros between two and three 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.840
 The thing is incredible 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.460
 Great bargains and my last 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.140
 Product is a few add for that 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.560
 today also very happy to bring in 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.650
 The drugstore has so many perfumes 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.930
 because I actually distance myself with that 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.580
 all really stupid so then find 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.160
 right, just judge 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.100
 difference between drogerie perfume and 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.350
 high end perfume is kind of like that 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.990
 no idea and also wants in hunter 5 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.539
 but prefer for every day and 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.260
 unite so after the sport I use 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.970
 very much like 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.520
 a perfume which is not that expensive 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.710
 is what you swimmer and spray 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.240
 can and where it ultimately pity 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.400
 It would be the product so quickly empty 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.230
 and I have a very good one out there 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.720
 The drugstore found what you personally wanted 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:39.080
 I really like it and it is 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.230
 from esprit live at sbs the 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.660
 name not just totally fresh 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.710
 moment not at all because you realize that 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.120
 I do not find that in it at all 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.790
 Drogerie product is so it smells 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.960
 very fresh is now real 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.150
 Spectacular is a fresh one 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.850
 athletic I would say such a 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.670
 a bit flowery but quite pleasant 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.860
 totally discreet but you just smell it 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.860
 just smells good so you do not know 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.360
 simply pleasant somehow and that 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.010
 As I said, I like to use it 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.740
 in the morning when i just go fast 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.020
 go shopping and feel me and how I feel 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.950
 more comfortable if it just killed principle 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.330
 tuned or things sport as I said 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.310
 just think it's great for in between 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.770
 is a super cheap think it is 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.300
 at ten or 15 euros 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.980
 this is definitely my third or 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.290
 fourth bottle i really use 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.550
 since years always arises around so 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.110
 or I have it somewhere a handbag 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.790
 lying on the road is easy 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.740
 great as well as pretty small and whole 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.990
 practically yes and I just wanted that 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.700
 even occasionally has it really such a 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.740
 For many years my favorite 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.680
 is and i believe in every video 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.140
 Yes, that was one of the products I showed 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.170

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.039

00:06:57.829 --> 00:07:00.769
 confused

 we'll see each other in another 

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:04.089
