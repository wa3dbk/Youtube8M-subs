right now we can edit it later I think I

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:19.750 
right now we can edit it later I think I
probably<00:00:04.080> get<00:00:04.350> it<00:00:04.470> from<00:00:04.620> like<00:00:04.910> right<00:00:05.910> there

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.540 
now I'm going to show y'all how it's
done<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.140> how<00:00:22.260> we<00:00:22.410> fillet<00:00:22.800> stripers

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:34.670 

quickly<00:00:26.550> right<00:00:27.500> not<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:28.529> quickly<00:00:33.559> all<00:00:34.559> right

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
quickly right not so quickly all right

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.979 
quickly right not so quickly all right
this<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.730> remnants<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.329> our<00:00:36.480> hall<00:00:36.750> from

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
this is the remnants of our hall from

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.850 
this is the remnants of our hall from
last<00:00:37.230> night<00:00:38.059> if<00:00:39.059> we<00:00:39.270> did<00:00:40.460> about<00:00:42.559> 27<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.680> think

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
last night if we did about 27 I think

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.130 
last night if we did about 27 I think
that<00:00:44.010> was<00:00:44.160> twenty<00:00:44.789> five<00:00:45.090> stripers<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.960> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
that was twenty five stripers and a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.510 
that was twenty five stripers and a
couple<00:00:46.379> walleye<00:00:47.989> from<00:00:49.879> Lake<00:00:50.879> Powell<00:00:51.949> so<00:00:52.949> just

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
couple walleye from Lake Powell so just

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.240 
couple walleye from Lake Powell so just
kind<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.090> quick<00:00:54.809> slice<00:00:55.230> right<00:00:55.829> behind<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
kind of a quick slice right behind the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.670 
kind of a quick slice right behind the
gill<00:00:56.430> there<00:00:56.780> get<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> knife<00:00:58.079> right<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
gill there get the knife right on the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.479 
gill there get the knife right on the
edge<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> ribs<00:01:00.859> it's<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> backbone<00:01:02.219> I

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
edge of the ribs it's the backbone I

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.670 
edge of the ribs it's the backbone I
guess<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:02.820> for<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.059> V<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:04.110> cut<00:01:04.350> straight

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
guess like for the V and cut straight

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.310 
guess like for the V and cut straight
down<00:01:05.299> along<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.540> backbone<00:01:08.119> till<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.479> get

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
down along that backbone till I get

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.980 
down along that backbone till I get
about<00:01:10.530> halfway<00:01:10.830> down<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.340> fish<00:01:11.689> and<00:01:12.689> then<00:01:12.810> I

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
about halfway down the fish and then I

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.719 
about halfway down the fish and then I
poke<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:13.890> all<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.310> way<00:01:14.430> through<00:01:17.600> out<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.750> tail

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
poke it all the way through out the tail

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.490 
poke it all the way through out the tail
and<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:21.350> kind<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.380> play<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.710> back<00:01:23.159> off<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
and just kind of play that back off the

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.899 
and just kind of play that back off the
top<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.770> rib<00:01:25.979> there<00:01:28.430> not<00:01:29.430> really<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.729> lot<00:01:29.880> of

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
top of the rib there not really a lot of

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:41.270 
top of the rib there not really a lot of
good<00:01:30.119> meat<00:01:30.380> on<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.560> ribs<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:32.040> pretty<00:01:32.340> skinny

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:50.010 

been<00:01:42.280> there<00:01:48.000> where<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.119> ribs<00:01:49.359> best<00:01:49.659> you<00:01:49.780> can

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
been there where the ribs best you can

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.749 
been there where the ribs best you can
then<00:01:50.229> you<00:01:50.319> got<00:01:50.469> this<00:01:50.619> nice<00:01:50.859> fillet<00:01:51.219> left<00:01:51.520> over

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
then you got this nice fillet left over

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.580 
then you got this nice fillet left over
this<00:01:51.939> is<00:01:52.090> actually<00:01:52.390> pretty<00:01:52.539> skinny<00:01:52.960> fish<00:01:53.289> so

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
this is actually pretty skinny fish so

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.859 
this is actually pretty skinny fish so
you<00:01:54.039> don't<00:01:54.490> got<00:01:54.610> a<00:01:54.640> lot<00:01:54.670> of<00:01:54.819> meat<00:01:55.030> on<00:01:56.310> next<00:01:57.310> step

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
you don't got a lot of meat on next step

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.240 
you don't got a lot of meat on next step
and<00:01:58.869> hook<00:01:59.140> that<00:01:59.319> in<00:01:59.590> there<00:01:59.799> and<00:01:59.950> that<00:01:59.979> will

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
and hook that in there and that will

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.080 
and hook that in there and that will
clipboard<00:02:02.009> lay<00:02:03.009> that<00:02:03.219> chunk<00:02:03.789> of<00:02:03.909> meat<00:02:04.060> right

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
off the right off the skin stripers have

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.339 
off the right off the skin stripers have
this<00:02:11.890> line<00:02:12.190> of<00:02:12.370> red<00:02:12.549> meat<00:02:12.930> just<00:02:13.930> not<00:02:14.079> too<00:02:14.319> good

this line of red meat just not too good

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.490 
this line of red meat just not too good
eaten<00:02:14.769> you<00:02:14.860> want<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.130> get<00:02:15.280> rid<00:02:15.459> of<00:02:15.489> that<00:02:16.500> when

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
eaten you want to get rid of that when

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.800 
eaten you want to get rid of that when
you're<00:02:17.620> playing<00:02:17.890> these<00:02:18.099> out<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:19.950> we<00:02:20.950> just<00:02:21.810> make

rather nippy here it's been about

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.849 
rather nippy here it's been about
probably<00:03:24.269> mid-teens<00:03:25.269> last<00:03:25.690> night<00:03:25.989> maybe<00:03:26.410> up
