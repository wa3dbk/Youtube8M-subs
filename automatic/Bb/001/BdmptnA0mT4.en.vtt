as a bronze no one really knows why they

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.209 
as a bronze no one really knows why they
probably<00:00:10.290> just<00:00:10.410> messed<00:00:10.650> it<00:00:10.769> up<00:00:10.860> it<00:00:11.010> pretty

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
probably just messed it up it pretty

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.520 
probably just messed it up it pretty
pretty<00:00:11.550> much<00:00:11.639> should<00:00:12.000> be<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.389> gold<00:00:12.780> if<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:13.349> look

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
pretty much should be a gold if you look

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.990 
pretty much should be a gold if you look
at<00:00:13.620> him<00:00:13.710> he's<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:14.070> pretty<00:00:14.280> solid<00:00:14.519> card<00:00:14.849> even

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
at him he's a pretty solid card even

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.660 
at him he's a pretty solid card even
like<00:00:15.710> not<00:00:16.710> even<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:16.949> bad<00:00:17.190> compared<00:00:17.609> to

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
like not even that bad compared to

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.460 
like not even that bad compared to
Brandon<00:00:17.940> Flowers<00:00:18.060> 93<00:00:18.810> speeds<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.199> be<00:00:19.260> really

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
Brandon Flowers 93 speeds and be really

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.200 
Brandon Flowers 93 speeds and be really
good<00:00:19.619> when<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.430> upgrade<00:00:20.580> him<00:00:20.880> I'm<00:00:20.970> not<00:00:21.090> really

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
good when you upgrade him I'm not really

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.670 
good when you upgrade him I'm not really
sure<00:00:21.300> what<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.630> stats<00:00:21.869> are<00:00:22.050> can't<00:00:22.320> find<00:00:22.560> it

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
sure what the stats are can't find it

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.009 
sure what the stats are can't find it
online<00:00:22.800> right<00:00:23.189> now<00:00:23.220> but<00:00:23.609> if<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.330> have<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.720> done

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
online right now but if you have it done

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.089 
online right now but if you have it done
let<00:00:25.289> me<00:00:25.350> know<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.560> comments<00:00:25.920> down<00:00:25.949> below

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
let me know in the comments down below

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.200 
let me know in the comments down below
but<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.340> think<00:00:26.550> he's<00:00:26.640> gonna<00:00:26.730> have<00:00:26.970> at<00:00:27.060> least

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
but I think he's gonna have at least

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.390 
but I think he's gonna have at least
like<00:00:27.420> 94<00:00:27.869> maybe<00:00:28.140> 95<00:00:28.560> speed<00:00:28.890> which<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.220> really

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
like 94 maybe 95 speed which is really

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.339 
like 94 maybe 95 speed which is really
solid<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:30.689> know<00:00:30.779> really<00:00:30.929> good<00:00:31.109> acceleration

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
solid you know really good acceleration

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.229 
solid you know really good acceleration
really<00:00:31.859> good<00:00:31.980> agility<00:00:32.189> man<00:00:32.610> cover<00:00:32.880> should<00:00:33.149> be

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
really good agility man cover should be

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.850 
really good agility man cover should be
up<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.690> 90s<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.230> would<00:00:34.350> assume<00:00:34.559> zone

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
up in the 90s I would assume zone

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.830 
up in the 90s I would assume zone
coverage<00:00:35.130> going<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:35.399> high<00:00:35.550> 80s<00:00:35.969> press

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
coverage going to be high 80s press

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.940 
coverage going to be high 80s press
hopefully<00:00:37.200> will<00:00:37.350> be<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.469> little<00:00:37.649> bit<00:00:37.860> better

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
hopefully will be a little bit better

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.220 
hopefully will be a little bit better
only<00:00:38.190> 75<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.000> card<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.420> then<00:00:39.750> play

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
only 75 in this card and then play

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.630 
only 75 in this card and then play
recognition<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.800> pretty<00:00:41.040> low<00:00:41.219> right<00:00:41.250> now<00:00:41.430> it's

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
recognition is pretty low right now it's

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.130 
recognition is pretty low right now it's
70<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.059> hopefully<00:00:42.480> that's<00:00:42.660> at<00:00:42.780> least<00:00:42.840> like<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
70 so hopefully that's at least like a

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.229 
70 so hopefully that's at least like a
76<00:00:43.770> or<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.010> maybe<00:00:44.190> like<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.399> 78<00:00:45.000> on<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
76 or it's maybe like a 78 on the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.270 
76 or it's maybe like a 78 on the
upgraded<00:00:45.690> version<00:00:45.719> not<00:00:46.559> completely<00:00:47.070> sure<00:00:47.100> yet

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
upgraded version not completely sure yet

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.970 
upgraded version not completely sure yet
though<00:00:47.989> but<00:00:48.989> should<00:00:49.260> be<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> pretty<00:00:49.559> decent

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
though but should be a pretty decent

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.319 
though but should be a pretty decent
item<00:00:50.190> still<00:00:50.399> not<00:00:50.579> really<00:00:50.700> sure<00:00:50.789> why<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.239> a

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
item still not really sure why it's a

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.670 
item still not really sure why it's a
bronze<00:00:51.539> we<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.840> go<00:00:51.930> take<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.140> look<00:00:52.260> at<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.440> set

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
bronze we can go take a look at the set

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.130 
bronze we can go take a look at the set
real<00:00:52.829> quick<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.219> believe<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.180> an<00:00:54.360> 87<00:00:54.840> overall

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
real quick I believe it is an 87 overall

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.660 
real quick I believe it is an 87 overall
still<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.410> don't<00:00:55.530> believe<00:00:55.890> they<00:00:56.039> upgraded<00:00:56.550> them

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
still I don't believe they upgraded them

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.729 
still I don't believe they upgraded them
at<00:00:56.850> all<00:00:57.480> but<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:57.870> go<00:00:58.020> check<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.440> out<00:00:58.500> go<00:00:58.710> to

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
at all but we can go check it out go to

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.200 
at all but we can go check it out go to
rising<00:00:59.160> stars<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.579> see<00:00:59.699> what<00:00:59.850> we're<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.059> on

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
rising stars and see what we're going on

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.670 
rising stars and see what we're going on
here<00:01:00.420> looks<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.109> oh<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.320> actually<00:01:01.590> could

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
here looks like oh we actually could

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.619 
here looks like oh we actually could
take<00:01:01.800> plus<00:01:02.010> 10<00:01:02.250> overall<00:01:02.489> boo<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:02.879> he<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> 90

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
take plus 10 overall boo so he is a 90

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.939 
take plus 10 overall boo so he is a 90
overall<00:01:03.930> i<00:01:03.960> was<00:01:04.170> thinking<00:01:04.530> they<00:01:04.589> might<00:01:04.799> do

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
overall i was thinking they might do

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.410 
overall i was thinking they might do
that<00:01:04.979> for<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.280> playoffs<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.760> they<00:01:05.939> did<00:01:06.210> right

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
that for the playoffs and they did right

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.359 
that for the playoffs and they did right
there<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> pretty<00:01:07.860> nice<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.280> he's

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
there so that is a pretty nice and he's

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.770 
there so that is a pretty nice and he's
going<00:01:08.580> for<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.790> lot<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.060> guys<00:01:09.150> could<00:01:09.360> see<00:01:09.540> on

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
going for a lot you guys could see on

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.570 
going for a lot you guys could see on
the<00:01:10.530> auction<00:01:10.650> house<00:01:10.890> he<00:01:11.040> was<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:11.490> on

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
the auction house he was going for on

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.960 
the auction house he was going for on
40k<00:01:12.060> right<00:01:12.299> now<00:01:12.860> definitely<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> lot<00:01:14.130> but<00:01:14.909> he

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
40k right now definitely a lot but he

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.730 
40k right now definitely a lot but he
does<00:01:15.119> get<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.270> 10<00:01:15.540> overall<00:01:15.810> boost<00:01:16.170> he<00:01:16.409> will<00:01:16.619> be

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
does get a 10 overall boost he will be

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
overall should be a pretty solid

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.929 
overall should be a pretty solid
cornerback<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.310> guys<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.700> was

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
cornerback for you guys but I was

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.520 
cornerback for you guys but I was
thinking<00:01:26.970> about<00:01:27.330> opening<00:01:27.450> all<00:01:27.780> man<00:01:27.990> pecs<00:01:28.259> for

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
thinking about opening all man pecs for

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.069 
thinking about opening all man pecs for
Bradley<00:01:29.159> Roby<00:01:29.280> but<00:01:29.640> since<00:01:30.240> he<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.479> technically

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
Bradley Roby but since he is technically

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.510 
Bradley Roby but since he is technically
a<00:01:31.200> bronze<00:01:31.560> player<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.890> don't<00:01:32.130> want<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> open

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
a bronze player I don't want to open

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.429 
a bronze player I don't want to open
them<00:01:32.579> because<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.570> all<00:01:33.689> man<00:01:33.869> pecs<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.290> get

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
them because in all man pecs you get

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.590 
them because in all man pecs you get
four<00:01:34.680> golds<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.880> mix<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.210> six<00:01:36.420> other

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
four golds and just a mix of six other

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.760 
four golds and just a mix of six other
player<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.930> team<00:01:37.079> items<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.530> if<00:01:37.650> you're

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
player and team items so if you're

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.740 
player and team items so if you're
looking<00:01:37.979> for<00:01:38.009> Bradley<00:01:38.400> Roby<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.820> assume<00:01:39.509> he'll

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
looking for Bradley Roby I assume he'll

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.550 
looking for Bradley Roby I assume he'll
take<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.020> place<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:42.299> bronze<00:01:43.200> card<00:01:43.470> I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
take the place of a of a bronze card I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.990 
take the place of a of a bronze card I
would<00:01:43.680> assume<00:01:43.890> busy<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.310> technically<00:01:44.880> a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
would assume busy is technically a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.389 
would assume busy is technically a
bronze<00:01:45.390> item<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:45.990> I'm<00:01:46.170> not<00:01:46.320> really<00:01:46.409> sure<00:01:46.560> let
