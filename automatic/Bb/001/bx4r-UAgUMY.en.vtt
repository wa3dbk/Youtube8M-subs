00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
building a fence to keep them out and so

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.190 
building a fence to keep them out and so
these<00:03:26.370> people<00:03:26.609> will<00:03:27.359> likely<00:03:27.660> lose<00:03:27.989> their

and<00:03:33.000> they'll<00:03:33.510> probably<00:03:33.720> start<00:03:33.959> heading<00:03:34.260> to

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
and they'll probably start heading to

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.560 
and they'll probably start heading to
the<00:03:34.470> urban<00:03:34.739> areas<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.070> Dhaka<00:03:35.700> being<00:03:36.150> the
