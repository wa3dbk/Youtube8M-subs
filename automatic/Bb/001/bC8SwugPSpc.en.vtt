monochrome or a monochrome like it's in
German<00:00:10.250> I<00:00:11.250> need<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.120> make<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.300> correction<00:00:12.780> that

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
German I need to make a correction that

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.550 
German I need to make a correction that
many<00:00:13.469> people<00:00:14.070> pointed<00:00:14.670> out<00:00:15.199> during<00:00:16.199> my<00:00:16.260> last

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
many people pointed out during my last

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.330 
many people pointed out during my last
video<00:00:17.960> when<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:18.990> used<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.500> camera<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:20.100> Leica

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
video when I used a camera that Leica

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.900 
video when I used a camera that Leica
sent<00:00:20.760> me<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:22.010> analyze<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.250> sort<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.580> give<00:00:23.730> them

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
sent me to analyze and sort of give them

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.849 
sent me to analyze and sort of give them
my<00:00:24.029> opinion<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.720> thought<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.740> was

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
my opinion I thought that it was

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.570 
my opinion I thought that it was
misspelled<00:00:26.460> because<00:00:26.970> monochrome<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:28.580> you

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
misspelled because monochrome is you

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.650 
misspelled because monochrome is you
know<00:00:29.699> needs<00:00:30.449> an<00:00:30.630> e<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.320> end<00:00:31.550> but<00:00:32.660> it's

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
know needs an e in the end but it's

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.810 
know needs an e in the end but it's
actually<00:00:34.020> German<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.710> many<00:00:35.010> people<00:00:35.430> pointed

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
actually German and many people pointed

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.880 
actually German and many people pointed
it<00:00:35.969> out<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.450> appreciate<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.590> very

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
it out so I appreciate that it's a very

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.190 
it out so I appreciate that it's a very
nice<00:00:38.300> you<00:00:39.300> know<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.629> we<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> good

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
nice you know that we have a good

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.319 
nice you know that we have a good
photography<00:00:41.100> community<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.149> not

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
photography community that can not

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.950 
photography community that can not
correct

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
correct

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.040 
correct
these<00:00:43.469> small<00:00:43.829> mistakes<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.640> make<00:00:45.050> so

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
these small mistakes that I make so

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.950 
these small mistakes that I make so
anyway<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.890> had<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.940> return<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.719> because

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
anyway I had to return that one because

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.750 
anyway I had to return that one because
that<00:00:48.989> was<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.559> sample<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.129> was<00:00:50.250> given<00:00:50.610> to

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
that was just a sample that was given to

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.290 
that was just a sample that was given to
me<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.600> give<00:00:51.780> them<00:00:51.930> my<00:00:51.989> opinion<00:00:52.370> so<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.699> ended<00:00:54.210> up

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
me to give them my opinion so I ended up

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.709 
me to give them my opinion so I ended up
buying<00:00:54.539> mine<00:00:54.960> again<00:00:55.949> from<00:00:56.940> from<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.449> store

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
buying mine again from from the store

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.670 
buying mine again from from the store
they<00:00:58.620> just<00:00:58.859> got<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.370> bunch<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.820> them<00:00:59.969> now<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
they just got a bunch of them now and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.990 
they just got a bunch of them now and
you<00:01:01.680> know<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> first<00:01:02.129> thing<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.489> noticed

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
you know the first thing that I noticed

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.270 
you know the first thing that I noticed
is<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.390> looks<00:01:03.600> pretty<00:01:04.110> much<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> same<00:01:04.470> like<00:01:04.979> my

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
is it looks pretty much the same like my

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.510 
is it looks pretty much the same like my
Leica<00:01:05.729> m9<00:01:05.970> p<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.350> bought<00:01:07.650> from<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.130> from

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
Leica m9 p that I bought from the from

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.120 
Leica m9 p that I bought from the from
the<00:01:08.640> store<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.450> few<00:01:09.720> months<00:01:10.200> ago<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.890> only

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the store a few months ago the only

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.969 
the store a few months ago the only
difference<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.090> doesn't<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:12.780> any

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
difference is that this doesn't have any

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.330 
difference is that this doesn't have any
sort<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.159> letters<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.450> top<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.920> doesn't

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
sort of letters on the top so it doesn't

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.330 
sort of letters on the top so it doesn't
say<00:01:17.640> like<00:01:17.939> anywhere<00:01:18.860> it<00:01:19.860> doesn't<00:01:20.070> say

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
say like anywhere it doesn't say

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.810 
say like anywhere it doesn't say
monochrome<00:01:21.000> anywhere<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:21.840> empty<00:01:22.820> so

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
monochrome anywhere it's just empty so

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.190 
monochrome anywhere it's just empty so
you<00:01:23.909> kind<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.689> know<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.110> be

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
you kind of you know I have to be

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.320 
you kind of you know I have to be
professional<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.009> know<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:27.150> it's

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
professional to know that it's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.390 
professional to know that it's
monochrome<00:01:27.960> because<00:01:28.650> otherwise<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.189> looks

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
monochrome because otherwise it looks

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.969 
monochrome because otherwise it looks
just<00:01:29.640> like<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.880> regular<00:01:30.150> camera<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.140> even<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
just like a regular camera and even the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.730 
just like a regular camera and even the
back<00:01:32.420> sort<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.570> looks<00:01:34.079> pretty<00:01:34.350> much<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.560> same

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
back sort of looks pretty much the same

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.340 
back sort of looks pretty much the same
they<00:01:35.340> have<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.640> screen<00:01:35.970> here<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:37.290> know

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
they have the screen here that you know

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.990 
they have the screen here that you know
the<00:01:37.470> screen<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.860> black<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.280> white<00:01:38.460> because

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
the screen is black and white because

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.880 
the screen is black and white because
you<00:01:39.210> know<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.479> camera<00:01:39.869> only<00:01:40.049> takes<00:01:40.409> pictures

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
you know the camera only takes pictures

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.639 
you know the camera only takes pictures
in<00:01:41.070> black<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.490> white<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:43.020> know<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.439> rest

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
in black and white and you know the rest

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.980 
in black and white and you know the rest
of<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.070> pretty<00:01:44.369> much<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:45.299> same<00:01:45.570> as<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
of it is pretty much the same as the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.620 
of it is pretty much the same as the
Leica<00:01:46.200> m9<00:01:46.500> p<00:01:47.180> it's<00:01:48.180> also<00:01:48.479> only<00:01:50.119> manual<00:01:51.119> focus

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
Leica m9 p it's also only manual focus

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.630 
Leica m9 p it's also only manual focus
still<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.229> mean<00:01:52.380> they<00:01:52.530> haven't<00:01:52.799> done<00:01:52.890> autofocus

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
still I mean they haven't done autofocus

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.170 
still I mean they haven't done autofocus
yet<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:56.100> kind<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.759> figure<00:01:56.939> it

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
yet so you you kind of have to figure it

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.240 
yet so you you kind of have to figure it
out<00:01:57.270> yourself<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.049> have<00:01:58.439> different<00:01:58.860> videos

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
out yourself and I have different videos

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.420 
out yourself and I have different videos
on<00:01:59.490> how<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.299> do<00:02:02.060> how<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.119> do<00:02:03.950> how<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:04.979> do<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> good

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
on how to do how to do how to do a good

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.779 
on how to do how to do how to do a good
job<00:02:05.490> with<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.909> focusing<00:02:07.039> you<00:02:08.039> can<00:02:08.250> watch<00:02:08.550> these

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
job with a focusing you can watch these

so you know this is all this is all

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.560 
so you know this is all this is all
mechanical<00:02:51.760> there's<00:02:52.720> no<00:02:52.900> like<00:02:53.110> computers<00:02:53.830> and

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
it's it's professional it's a Leica

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.949 
it's it's professional it's a Leica
that's<00:03:20.110> what<00:03:20.260> we<00:03:20.410> have<00:03:20.530> come<00:03:20.740> to<00:03:20.890> expect<00:03:21.959> and

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
that's what we have come to expect and

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.870 
that's what we have come to expect and
then<00:03:23.170> you<00:03:23.350> know<00:03:23.470> I<00:03:23.500> also<00:03:23.709> got<00:03:23.980> this<00:03:24.160> lens<00:03:24.490> here

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
then you know I also got this lens here

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.780 
then you know I also got this lens here
this<00:03:25.630> is<00:03:26.070> it<00:03:27.070> says<00:03:27.400> 3.4<00:03:28.300> on<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.670> other

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
this is it says 3.4 on it and the other

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.160 
this is it says 3.4 on it and the other
thing<00:03:30.880> that<00:03:31.060> I<00:03:31.209> noticed<00:03:31.300> is<00:03:31.720> it's<00:03:31.900> tricky

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
thing that I noticed is it's tricky

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.510 
thing that I noticed is it's tricky
because<00:03:32.320> even<00:03:32.709> though<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:33.070> cover<00:03:33.340> is

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
because even though the cover is

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.390 
because even though the cover is
rectangular<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:35.350> lens<00:03:35.650> actually<00:03:35.980> is

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
rectangular the lens actually is

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:43.820 
rectangular the lens actually is
circular<00:03:36.970> so<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:38.260> know<00:03:38.380> this<00:03:38.590> is<00:03:38.830> a<00:03:40.320> 24<00:03:41.320> a<00:03:42.150> spaz

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
circular so you know this is a 24 a spaz

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:50.360 
circular so you know this is a 24 a spaz
asph<00:03:44.860> lens<00:03:46.770> and<00:03:47.770> you<00:03:48.370> know<00:03:48.520> it's<00:03:48.780> supposedly

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
asph lens and you know it's supposedly

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.310 
asph lens and you know it's supposedly
you<00:03:51.370> know<00:03:51.400> for<00:03:51.880> wider<00:03:52.750> pictures<00:03:53.520> like<00:03:54.520> you<00:03:54.550> can

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
you know for wider pictures like you can

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.040 
you know for wider pictures like you can
you<00:03:56.320> can<00:03:56.910> take<00:03:57.910> bigger<00:03:58.209> pictures<00:03:58.690> with<00:03:58.930> this

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
you can take bigger pictures with this

you can take bigger pictures with this
with<00:03:59.320> more<00:03:59.560> megapixels<00:04:00.540> it's<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.570> very<00:04:01.750> good

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
with more megapixels it's a very good

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.960 
with more megapixels it's a very good
lens<00:04:02.140> I<00:04:02.560> tried<00:04:03.070> it<00:04:03.220> out<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.490> other<00:04:03.610> day<00:04:03.940> and

monochrome<00:04:33.320> again<00:04:34.320> I<00:04:34.350> mean<00:04:34.620> it's<00:04:34.830> it's<00:04:35.160> a<00:04:35.280> nice

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
monochrome again I mean it's it's a nice

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.210 
monochrome again I mean it's it's a nice
setup<00:04:35.850> I<00:04:36.120> like<00:04:36.360> it<00:04:36.570> it's<00:04:36.950> professional<00:04:37.970> but

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
setup I like it it's professional but

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.860 
setup I like it it's professional but
you<00:04:41.220> know<00:04:41.340> sometimes<00:04:41.700> if<00:04:42.150> you<00:04:42.330> really<00:04:42.360> want<00:04:42.780> to

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
you know sometimes if you really want to

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.920 
you know sometimes if you really want to
capture<00:04:43.080> a<00:04:43.560> good<00:04:43.920> picture<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:45.090> you<00:04:45.720> want

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
capture a good picture and you want

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.840 
capture a good picture and you want
autofocus<00:04:46.680> because<00:04:46.950> I<00:04:47.040> said<00:04:47.250> like<00:04:47.460> I<00:04:47.490> you<00:04:47.700> mean

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
autofocus because I said like I you mean

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.250 
autofocus because I said like I you mean
they<00:04:47.970> did<00:04:48.150> the<00:04:48.240> monochrome<00:04:48.690> and<00:04:48.930> they<00:04:48.990> didn't

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
they did the monochrome and they didn't

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.560 
they did the monochrome and they didn't
do<00:04:49.320> autofocus<00:04:49.980> so<00:04:50.640> they<00:04:51.090> told<00:04:51.150> me<00:04:51.420> at<00:04:51.540> the

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
do autofocus so they told me at the

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.190 
do autofocus so they told me at the
store<00:04:51.870> that<00:04:52.080> this<00:04:52.290> one<00:04:52.500> here<00:04:52.860> would<00:04:53.130> take

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
store that this one here would take

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.270 
store that this one here would take
autofocus<00:04:55.200> pictures

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
autofocus pictures

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.270 
autofocus pictures
this<00:04:56.580> is<00:04:56.760> Nikon<00:04:59.060> d700<00:05:00.060> and<00:05:00.830> this<00:05:01.830> one<00:05:02.010> you<00:05:02.160> can

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
this is Nikon d700 and this one you can

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.860 
this is Nikon d700 and this one you can
tell<00:05:02.460> that<00:05:02.610> a<00:05:02.670> sort<00:05:02.910> of<00:05:02.940> focus<00:05:03.300> because<00:05:03.390> when

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
tell that a sort of focus because when

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.060 
tell that a sort of focus because when
we<00:05:03.930> press<00:05:04.140> the<00:05:04.260> button<00:05:04.290> I<00:05:04.710> don't<00:05:04.860> know<00:05:04.920> if<00:05:05.010> you

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
we press the button I don't know if you

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.380 
we press the button I don't know if you
can<00:05:05.220> hear<00:05:05.430> this<00:05:05.870> but<00:05:07.670> you<00:05:08.670> know<00:05:08.790> it'll<00:05:09.030> try<00:05:09.360> to

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
can hear this but you know it'll try to

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.620 
can hear this but you know it'll try to
to<00:05:10.290> focus<00:05:10.530> on<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:10.950> subject<00:05:11.220> and<00:05:11.640> move<00:05:12.360> things

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
to focus on the subject and move things

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.010 
to focus on the subject and move things
around<00:05:12.920> I<00:05:13.920> can<00:05:14.670> get<00:05:14.880> it<00:05:15.000> to<00:05:15.120> do<00:05:15.240> it<00:05:15.360> right<00:05:15.570> now

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
around I can get it to do it right now

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.090 
around I can get it to do it right now
there<00:05:16.500> we<00:05:16.590> go<00:05:16.770> very<00:05:17.490> subtle<00:05:18.620> there<00:05:19.620> we<00:05:19.710> go<00:05:19.860> see

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
there we go very subtle there we go see

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.740 
there we go very subtle there we go see
and<00:05:20.280> it<00:05:20.400> moves<00:05:20.580> on<00:05:20.700> its<00:05:20.730> own<00:05:21.000> it's<00:05:21.420> it's

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
and it moves on its own it's it's

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.340 
and it moves on its own it's it's
electronic<00:05:22.790> the<00:05:23.790> like<00:05:24.000> is<00:05:24.210> mechanical<00:05:24.930> so<00:05:25.140> it

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
electronic the like is mechanical so it

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.860 
electronic the like is mechanical so it
can<00:05:25.590> do<00:05:25.800> that<00:05:25.980> but<00:05:26.280> you<00:05:26.520> know<00:05:26.640> if<00:05:26.730> you<00:05:26.940> if<00:05:27.120> I

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
can do that but you know if you if I

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.750 
can do that but you know if you if I
guess<00:05:28.020> if<00:05:28.200> auto<00:05:28.440> focus<00:05:28.860> is<00:05:28.980> very<00:05:29.070> important

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
guess if auto focus is very important

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.780 
guess if auto focus is very important
then<00:05:29.910> you<00:05:29.940> have<00:05:30.150> to<00:05:30.240> get<00:05:30.390> an<00:05:30.510> icon<00:05:30.660> but<00:05:31.790> you

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
then you have to get an icon but you

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.200 
then you have to get an icon but you
know<00:05:32.910> if<00:05:33.060> you<00:05:33.210> want<00:05:33.420> a<00:05:33.540> professional<00:05:34.290> camera

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
know if you want a professional camera

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:42.470 
know if you want a professional camera
black<00:05:36.210> and<00:05:36.450> white<00:05:36.630> like<00:05:37.280> Adams<00:05:39.410> you<00:05:40.410> know<00:05:41.480> in

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
black and white like Adams you know in

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.170 
black and white like Adams you know in
in<00:05:42.840> in<00:05:43.080> take<00:05:43.410> professional<00:05:43.860> pictures<00:05:44.180> then

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
in in take professional pictures then

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.020 
in in take professional pictures then
the<00:05:45.360> Leica<00:05:45.570> monochrome<00:05:46.200> is<00:05:46.410> the<00:05:46.530> best<00:05:47.030> and

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
the Leica monochrome is the best and

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.180 
the Leica monochrome is the best and
then<00:05:48.240> if<00:05:48.450> you<00:05:48.690> want<00:05:49.440> to<00:05:49.560> get<00:05:49.710> a<00:05:49.740> very<00:05:50.010> good

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
then if you want to get a very good

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.070 
then if you want to get a very good
professional<00:05:50.430> lens<00:05:51.530> this<00:05:52.530> I<00:05:53.510> mean<00:05:54.510> the<00:05:54.660> Mach<00:05:54.870> 2

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
professional lens this I mean the Mach 2

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.170 
professional lens this I mean the Mach 2
looks<00:05:55.290> is<00:05:55.500> also<00:05:55.800> very<00:05:56.040> good

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
looks is also very good

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.450 
looks is also very good
this<00:05:57.510> one<00:05:57.720> has<00:05:57.930> fewer<00:05:58.290> numbers<00:05:58.740> so<00:05:59.070> you<00:05:59.280> know

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
this one has fewer numbers so you know

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.240 
this one has fewer numbers so you know
it<00:05:59.580> doesn't<00:05:59.910> quite<00:06:00.060> distract<00:06:00.600> you<00:06:00.780> as<00:06:00.900> much

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
it doesn't quite distract you as much

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.160 
it doesn't quite distract you as much
you<00:06:02.250> know<00:06:02.370> still<00:06:02.670> goes<00:06:02.880> up<00:06:03.060> to<00:06:03.210> 16<00:06:03.690> but<00:06:03.990> it

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170 
you know still goes up to 16 but it

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.690 
you know still goes up to 16 but it
stops<00:06:04.470> at<00:06:05.450> 3.4<00:06:06.560> the<00:06:07.560> Mach<00:06:07.770> -<00:06:07.950> looks<00:06:08.160> like<00:06:08.430> head

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
stops at 3.4 the Mach - looks like head

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:14.360 
stops at 3.4 the Mach - looks like head
one<00:06:09.510> point<00:06:10.080> six<00:06:10.470> and<00:06:11.990> one<00:06:12.990> point<00:06:13.320> four<00:06:13.890> I<00:06:13.920> think

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
one point six and one point four I think

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.040 
one point six and one point four I think
and<00:06:14.520> then<00:06:14.610> one<00:06:14.880> so<00:06:15.180> you<00:06:15.240> know<00:06:15.420> more<00:06:15.690> numbers

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
and then one so you know more numbers

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.960 
and then one so you know more numbers
this<00:06:16.350> one<00:06:16.560> just<00:06:16.800> this<00:06:17.160> one<00:06:17.340> kind<00:06:17.520> of<00:06:17.580> cuts<00:06:17.790> to

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
this one just this one kind of cuts to

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.450 
this one just this one kind of cuts to
the<00:06:18.060> chase<00:06:18.090> you<00:06:18.630> know<00:06:18.750> there's<00:06:19.020> no<00:06:19.200> no<00:06:20.010> wasted

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
the chase you know there's no no wasted

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.440 
the chase you know there's no no wasted
movements<00:06:21.030> here<00:06:21.740> so<00:06:22.740> you<00:06:22.800> know<00:06:23.010> it's<00:06:23.610> I<00:06:24.120> think

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
movements here so you know it's I think

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.480 
movements here so you know it's I think
that<00:06:24.840> these<00:06:25.020> videos<00:06:25.260> can<00:06:25.650> help<00:06:25.680> you<00:06:26.100> decide

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
that these videos can help you decide

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.540 
that these videos can help you decide
which<00:06:26.700> way<00:06:26.940> you<00:06:26.970> want<00:06:27.150> to<00:06:27.420> go<00:06:27.600> and<00:06:28.280> whether<00:06:29.280> you

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
which way you want to go and whether you

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.930 
which way you want to go and whether you
want<00:06:29.730> to<00:06:29.820> use<00:06:29.850> the<00:06:30.360> the<00:06:30.870> Leica<00:06:31.530> or<00:06:32.190> whether<00:06:32.610> you

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
want to use the the Leica or whether you

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.350 
want to use the the Leica or whether you
want<00:06:33.420> to<00:06:33.510> use<00:06:33.540> autofocus<00:06:34.440> and<00:06:34.790> Nikon<00:06:35.790> I<00:06:36.000> got

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
want to use autofocus and Nikon I got

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.120 
want to use autofocus and Nikon I got
the<00:06:36.479> Nikon<00:06:36.930> too<00:06:37.140> because<00:06:37.440> you<00:06:37.560> know<00:06:37.590> sometimes

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
the Nikon too because you know sometimes

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.159 
the Nikon too because you know sometimes
you<00:06:38.250> have<00:06:38.310> to<00:06:38.490> capture<00:06:38.910> the<00:06:39.060> moment<00:06:39.240> and

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.169 
you have to capture the moment and
