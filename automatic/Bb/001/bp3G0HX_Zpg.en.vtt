released out of here ever all the PSI
are<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.780> all<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.379> PVC<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:42.200> 260<00:00:43.200> rated<00:00:43.559> psi<00:00:44.340> so

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
are in all the PVC is a 260 rated psi so

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.779 
are in all the PVC is a 260 rated psi so
we're<00:00:45.300> always<00:00:45.510> over<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.170> 110<00:00:46.710> under<00:00:47.129> our<00:00:47.309> psi

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
we're always over like 110 under our psi

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.729 
we're always over like 110 under our psi
no<00:00:47.969> matter<00:00:48.149> what<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:48.960> not<00:00:49.140> going<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.350> blow<00:00:49.469> up

we<00:01:51.119> need<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.330> do<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.630> put<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.929> in<00:01:52.050> there<00:01:52.170> back

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.240 

this<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.800> propane<00:02:02.340> gun<00:02:02.750> it<00:02:03.950> we've<00:02:04.950> had<00:02:05.130> to

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
this is a propane gun it we've had to

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.499 
this is a propane gun it we've had to
make<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.429> couple<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.880> different<00:02:06.179> modifications

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
make a couple of different modifications

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.919 
make a couple of different modifications
to<00:02:07.080> it<00:02:07.200> get<00:02:07.440> it<00:02:07.560> perfected<00:02:08.369> but<00:02:08.630> general<00:02:09.630> idea

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
to it get it perfected but general idea

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.460 
to it get it perfected but general idea
is<00:02:10.160> propane<00:02:11.160> from<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.610> tank<00:02:12.080> goes<00:02:13.080> into<00:02:13.350> this

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
is propane from this tank goes into this

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.390 
is propane from this tank goes into this
house<00:02:13.709> right<00:02:14.100> here<00:02:14.780> this<00:02:15.780> red<00:02:16.290> house<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:17.340> we

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
house right here this red house and we

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.289 
house right here this red house and we
get<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.610> specific<00:02:18.269> psi<00:02:18.810> by<00:02:19.080> using<00:02:19.319> this<00:02:19.500> gauge

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
get a specific psi by using this gauge

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.930 
get a specific psi by using this gauge
usually<00:02:21.299> around<00:02:21.390> 22<00:02:22.019> and<00:02:22.350> then<00:02:23.160> push<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.700> into

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
usually around 22 and then push it into

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.560 
usually around 22 and then push it into
this<00:02:24.120> into<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.920> chamber<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.269> can<00:02:27.480> get

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
this into the chamber so you can get

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.810 
this into the chamber so you can get
equal<00:02:27.989> measured<00:02:28.290> amounts<00:02:28.709> gets<00:02:29.130> us<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.340> firing

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
equal measured amounts gets us to firing

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.300 
equal measured amounts gets us to firing
and<00:02:30.750> consistent<00:02:31.380> pressure<00:02:32.720> yeah<00:02:34.160> this<00:02:35.160> right

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
and consistent pressure yeah this right

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.150 
and consistent pressure yeah this right
here<00:02:35.459> is<00:02:35.489> an<00:02:35.640> igniter<00:02:36.620> like<00:02:37.620> from<00:02:37.829> a<00:02:37.920> grill

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
here is an igniter like from a grill

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.680 
here is an igniter like from a grill
inside<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.329> the<00:02:39.829> ish<00:02:40.829> out<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.480> inside<00:02:42.480> of

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
inside of the ish out of that inside of

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.170 
inside of the ish out of that inside of
the<00:02:42.810> gun<00:02:43.049> there's<00:02:43.650> two<00:02:44.250> screws<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.670> touch

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
the gun there's two screws that touch

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.789 
the gun there's two screws that touch
each<00:02:45.359> other<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.840> when<00:02:46.440> we<00:02:46.650> push<00:02:46.859> this<00:02:47.269> hail

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
each other and when we push this hail

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:54.220 
each other and when we push this hail
tell<00:02:49.799> me<00:02:49.890> if<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.100> does<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.400> yeah<00:02:51.329> you<00:02:52.170> were<00:02:52.320> gone

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
tell me if it does it yeah you were gone

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.009 
tell me if it does it yeah you were gone
yeah<00:02:55.230> thumb<00:02:55.850> that<00:02:56.850> spark<00:02:57.239> will<00:02:57.420> go<00:02:57.540> between<00:02:57.720> it

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
yeah thumb that spark will go between it

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.180 
yeah thumb that spark will go between it
so<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.260> I'll<00:02:58.380> ignite<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.890> propane<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.609> talk

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
so that I'll ignite the propane and talk

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.540 
so that I'll ignite the propane and talk
the<00:03:01.180> truth<00:03:01.420> this<00:03:01.690> thing<00:03:01.930> is<00:03:02.430> really<00:03:03.430> getting

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
the truth this thing is really getting

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.030 
the truth this thing is really getting
the<00:03:03.940> oxygen<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.810> play<00:03:05.260> came<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.590> mix<00:03:05.800> and

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
the oxygen and the play came to mix and

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.860 
the oxygen and the play came to mix and
we<00:03:06.760> couldn't<00:03:06.970> figure<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.240> out<00:03:07.420> for<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.720> long

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
we couldn't figure that out for a long

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.580 
we couldn't figure that out for a long
time<00:03:08.170> until<00:03:08.410> we<00:03:08.590> realized<00:03:09.010> we<00:03:09.310> needed<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:10.630> mix

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
time until we realized we needed to mix

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.550 
time until we realized we needed to mix
it<00:03:11.800> so<00:03:12.370> we<00:03:12.460> use<00:03:12.640> this<00:03:12.820> computer<00:03:13.060> fan<00:03:13.570> in<00:03:13.930> the

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
it so we use this computer fan in the

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.910 
it so we use this computer fan in the
switch<00:03:14.920> in<00:03:15.160> just<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.430> 9-volt<00:03:15.820> battery<00:03:16.800> do<00:03:17.800> it

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
switch in just a 9-volt battery do it

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.290 
switch in just a 9-volt battery do it
all<00:03:18.070> together<00:03:18.280> and<00:03:18.760> hit<00:03:19.690> on<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:21.070> fan<00:03:21.370> actually

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
all together and hit on the fan actually

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.810 
all together and hit on the fan actually
is<00:03:22.690> facing<00:03:23.140> this<00:03:23.320> way<00:03:23.380> it<00:03:24.310> doesn't<00:03:24.370> make<00:03:24.670> much

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
is facing this way it doesn't make much

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.630 
is facing this way it doesn't make much
sense<00:03:25.320> if<00:03:26.320> you<00:03:26.530> don't<00:03:26.680> think<00:03:26.830> about<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.310> this

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
sense if you don't think about it this

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.210 
sense if you don't think about it this
way<00:03:27.700> it'll<00:03:28.030> pull<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.540> air<00:03:28.720> in<00:03:28.990> and<00:03:29.290> it'll<00:03:29.950> pull

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
way it'll pull the air in and it'll pull

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.950 
way it'll pull the air in and it'll pull
the<00:03:30.370> propane<00:03:30.760> which<00:03:30.940> comes<00:03:31.210> in<00:03:31.390> here<00:03:31.780> and

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
the propane which comes in here and

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.220 
the propane which comes in here and
mixes<00:03:32.950> it<00:03:32.980> evenly<00:03:33.490> oxygen<00:03:34.450> this<00:03:34.840> won't<00:03:34.990> get<00:03:35.170> a

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
mixes it evenly oxygen this won't get a

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.290 
mixes it evenly oxygen this won't get a
consistent<00:03:35.590> result<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:39.370> then<00:03:39.520> all<00:03:39.700> you<00:03:40.150> gotta

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
consistent result and then all you gotta

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.140 
consistent result and then all you gotta
do<00:03:40.510> is<00:03:40.540> once<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:40.990> get<00:03:41.170> this<00:03:41.820> pretty<00:03:42.820> much<00:03:43.000> the

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
do is once you get this pretty much the

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.110 
do is once you get this pretty much the
nekkid<00:03:43.570> hiring<00:03:44.350> it<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:45.310> get<00:03:45.460> a<00:03:45.670> measure<00:03:45.910> your

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
nekkid hiring it you get a measure your

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.180 
nekkid hiring it you get a measure your
propane<00:03:46.570> introduce<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:47.950> chamber
