a little bit better it's looking very
shimmery<00:04:47.500> on<00:04:47.710> me<00:04:48.190> but<00:04:48.730> I<00:04:48.790> think<00:04:49.210> she<00:04:49.420> put<00:04:49.630> soft

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
shimmery on me but I think she put soft

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.020 
shimmery on me but I think she put soft
and<00:04:50.290> gentle<00:04:50.470> underneath<00:04:51.250> of<00:04:51.430> it<00:04:51.520> so<00:04:51.700> it<00:04:51.820> gives

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
and gentle underneath of it so it gives

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.920 
and gentle underneath of it so it gives
it<00:04:52.180> like<00:04:52.390> a<00:04:52.890> champagne<00:04:54.000> kind<00:04:55.000> of<00:04:55.270> quarrel

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
it like a champagne kind of quarrel

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.110 
it like a champagne kind of quarrel
which<00:04:56.410> I<00:04:56.530> wouldn't<00:04:56.770> try<00:04:56.950> because<00:04:57.310> I<00:04:57.550> coral

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
which I wouldn't try because I coral

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.020 
which I wouldn't try because I coral
wool<00:04:58.330> I<00:04:58.690> like<00:04:58.900> to<00:04:59.050> leave<00:04:59.230> some<00:04:59.590> on<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.920> L<00:05:00.040> which

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
wool I like to leave some on the L which

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.310 
wool I like to leave some on the L which
I<00:05:01.150> think<00:05:01.360> I'm<00:05:01.450> gonna<00:05:01.570> try<00:05:01.780> because<00:05:02.080> it's<00:05:02.230> so

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
I think I'm gonna try because it's so

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.380 
I think I'm gonna try because it's so
pretty<00:05:02.560> I<00:05:02.860> also<00:05:03.340> have<00:05:03.550> porcelain<00:05:03.790> pinks<00:05:04.300> I

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
pretty I also have porcelain pinks I

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.580 
pretty I also have porcelain pinks I
think<00:05:04.600> that<00:05:04.720> one<00:05:04.840> might<00:05:05.020> give<00:05:05.320> it<00:05:05.440> like<00:05:05.560> a

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
think that one might give it like a

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.950 
think that one might give it like a
Pinker<00:05:06.070> effect<00:05:06.430> it's<00:05:07.240> often<00:05:07.570> gentle<00:05:07.870> would

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
Pinker effect it's often gentle would

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.030 
Pinker effect it's often gentle would
give<00:05:08.080> it<00:05:08.170> more<00:05:08.200> of<00:05:08.410> like<00:05:08.440> a<00:05:08.590> shimmery

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
give it more of like a shimmery
