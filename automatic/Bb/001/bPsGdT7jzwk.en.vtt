 the story is called patrick scott very much 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.280
 I should start imaginative gentleman 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.040
 are you going as you please so is 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.200
 divided into kÃ¤fertal patrick then 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.330
 let's just not read the loss 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.940
 in front 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.680
 okay he helmut dear friends and 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.860
 welcome to a new episode 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.229
 strong together with inside and red mushroom 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.460
 I started my vigorous recording of the 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.110
 Filmmaking actually as good as 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.820
 always insulting each other 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.890
 incapable and rule opens again 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:27.650
 gay but somehow today was something 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.180
 unlike anything else that does not matter 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.840
 governed as if it were the 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:36.470
 pair 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:38.240
 Today, somehow it had to be that way 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.810
 exactly what it was but it feels 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.810
 not good because 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.360
 when we finished the recording 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:51.149
 I lay down on my bed and thought 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:53.220
 and bring you down again and again 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:02:01.200
 how do you think my cell phone ignores this 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:02.970
 just think for a long time 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.009
 I decided that feeling 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.099
 definitely has no meaning and 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.610
 wondered how I could do it 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:20.940
 that sounds like the best animal 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:22.739
 recommend and made something realistic 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.620
 Are you doing here ? I asked 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.480
 So do not be surprised at ours 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.239
 the calls and messages have responded 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.090
 We thought we would get the region 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.090

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.540
 I'm getting up a bit ok then 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.090
 Come in, I said and came together 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.190
 We three in the living room region Felix 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.959
 From now on I sit down on the 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.640
 armchair diagonally next to what do we want 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.920
 Now I want to do one 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:03:01.650
 Watching film suggested Felix form good idea 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:05.010
 Fuzz of ballast of you sit down 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.359

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.950
 last step company and what 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.780
 Now let's all have it 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.100

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:20.040
 reviere ok and shame put felix 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:21.720
 Helped felix through the hair too 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:27.269
 agreed and we agreed on 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:29.100
 Ted and resourceful during the movie 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.049
 I always had to Felix and risks 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.310
 fix had become huge 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.880
 cuddly as if he was back time 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.460
 again 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.990
 This sting in the stomach area 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.450
 otherwise some edge your knives in 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.800
 belly I was about jealous me 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.030
 tried this thought again quickly 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.850
 to displace but it just worked out 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.710
 I was not really into it 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.710
 felix in love no no his cock 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.080
 well he was pretty cute though 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.400
 I was not gay at all 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.380
 would have thought about it if I have 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.300
 could be gay 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.090
 and that was probably the one 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.190
 point, of course, had me in one 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.900
 my best friend in love with patrick 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:29.970
 hello staff to talk as well as 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:31.260
 lost on today with felix do not ask 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.220
 always back to reality 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.660
 what did i bring out there then felix 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.070
 had me leaning on this 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.420
 set on this line and looked at me 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.190
 right in the eye 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.570
 we want to notice here as 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.050
 beautiful in his brown eyes 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.050
 were 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.520
 you are now with yours 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.960
 thought again felix and asked 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.360
 I do not really know what I mean 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.030
 to answer is not important said 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.310
 After all, I wanted to govern well 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.980
 just know if we should order pizza 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.480
 said felix clearly peter klink said well 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.830
 snow you turn me back to 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.900
 TV and then noticed that 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.210
 movie was over was fast 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.830
 because she knows how we look to me 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.630
 I could talk to him then he says something 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.610

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.910
 hours passed as a reputable company 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.910
 not bad 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.220
 because now you're done here 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.849

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.370
 bordered 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.479
 I just smiled embarrassed let us 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.849

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:35.610
 I'm hungry there that I could 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.530
 come from Rewe himself freak Mindich 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.469
 Fighting and grabbing the phone 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.849
 to order so pizza comes in 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:43.800
 about half an hour 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:47.129
 I said that what I had hung up 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:50.310
 Well felix said and then sits down 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:52.259
 Back on the sofa where I would have it 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.270
 found better when he was on the on the 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:57.360
 but would have remained sitting chair back 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.719
 that would have come now that I move 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.699
 said baby and felix were left 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:05.639
 a little farewell to it 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.169
 Present and Felix remained one more 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.770
 well and say goodbye to 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:10.379
 20 o'clock 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.240
 yes I do not know if they were gone 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.860
 I immediately put the sleep to sleep 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:19.590
 I love my bed shortly afterwards 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:21.840
 already an okay then the dream comes and 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.349

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.639
 episode 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:29.520
 then comes no idea when on the 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:32.009
 channel parallel to it and out I am 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.259

 we'll make it so again with the 2006 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:43.139
 I do not think so 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.879
 Just try it, I think so 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:47.009
