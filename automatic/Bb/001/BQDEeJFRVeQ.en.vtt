00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.520
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.899
 second part again today with ours 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.210
 patrol boat and for the car test we 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.820
 are here on a small quiet lake 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.480
 it is a bit windy but supposedly 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.780
 yes makes our 120 km h so we hope 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.000
 Just that's good so the weather 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.410
 is beautiful just somehow i have 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.410
 the fear is still cold now 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.450
 that could be faster 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.539
 the 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.850
 he fights very well with the insane 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:52.390
 why live ten meters high waves? 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.390
 does not work anymore 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.189
 I do not want to swim 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.360
 O 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.150
 So we had no radio demolition 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:30.100
 but either is somewhere now 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.410
 Water penetrated this strong 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.450
 Wellengang we felt so 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.450
 ten meters high waves at least 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:49.050
 brother is a cable or I have 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.050
 no idea so two minutes of fraud &amp; 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.520
 So maybe in the next video 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.290
 more 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.360
 maybe then with a new one 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.740
 march seen after a day 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.480
 needed to have even at first 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.890
 to install the battery in the boat 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.430
 two minutes of driving fun and yes that was it 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.440
 then too 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.030
 We had no warning signal that 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.380
 means the battery is still full 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.610
 thank god it is not so far 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.830
 happened outside because i can give you 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.960
 say that water was really cold and 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.440
 there is no running right behind 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.750
 fun 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.070
 I'm curious what tomorrow 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.070
