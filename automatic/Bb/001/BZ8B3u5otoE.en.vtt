that's<00:01:23.460> something<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:24.030> start

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
that's something you can start

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.420 
that's something you can start
experimenting<00:01:24.869> with<00:01:25.049> if<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.890> play<00:01:26.040> all<00:01:26.189> three

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
experimenting with if you play all three

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.490 
experimenting with if you play all three
notes<00:01:26.610> together<00:01:26.880> one<00:01:27.420> three<00:01:27.750> five<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
notes together one three five in the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.050 
notes together one three five in the
base<00:01:28.680> hand<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.100> sounds<00:01:29.340> really<00:01:29.490> kind<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.790> heavy

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
base hand it sounds really kind of heavy

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.080 
base hand it sounds really kind of heavy
and<00:01:30.420> close<00:01:31.080> together<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.880> often<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
and close together so often in the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.969 
and close together so often in the
baseline<00:01:33.509> what<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.899> see<00:01:34.080> in<00:01:34.200> arpeggios<00:01:34.770> is

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
baseline what you see in arpeggios is

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.620 
baseline what you see in arpeggios is
they<00:01:35.100> take<00:01:35.280> away<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> three<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.299> chord

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
they take away the three of the chord

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.990 
they take away the three of the chord
and<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> left<00:01:37.380> hand<00:01:37.649> only<00:01:38.009> will<00:01:38.189> play<00:01:38.399> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
and in the left hand only will play the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.820 
and in the left hand only will play the
one<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.570> five<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.170> chord<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.649> then

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
one in the five of the chord and then

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.039 
one in the five of the chord and then
eight<00:01:41.100> or<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.060> could<00:01:42.210> call<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.570> one<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:42.929> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
eight or you could call it a one on the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.380 
eight or you could call it a one on the
octave<00:01:43.409> above<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.399> that's<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.030> really<00:01:45.299> good

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
octave above so that's a really good

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.060 
octave above so that's a really good
habit<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.869> start<00:01:46.229> playing<00:01:46.500> with<00:01:46.710> if<00:01:46.920> you're

versus<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.049> more<00:02:06.200> open<00:02:06.350> sound<00:02:08.050> so<00:02:09.050> once<00:02:09.259> you

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
versus the more open sound so once you

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.449 
versus the more open sound so once you
get<00:02:09.500> that<00:02:09.649> openness<00:02:10.190> in<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.459> left<00:02:10.700> hand

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
get that openness in a left hand

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.710 
get that openness in a left hand
really<00:02:13.459> from<00:02:13.670> there<00:02:13.879> on<00:02:14.090> out<00:02:14.269> what<00:02:14.540> you're

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
really from there on out what you're

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.539 
really from there on out what you're
doing<00:02:14.959> is<00:02:15.080> you're<00:02:15.200> thinking<00:02:15.370> specifically<00:02:16.370> I

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
doing is you're thinking specifically I

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.610 
doing is you're thinking specifically I
need<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.239> hit<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.569> sea<00:02:17.780> bass<00:02:17.959> note<00:02:18.230> on<00:02:18.440> beat

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
need to hit the sea bass note on beat

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.130 
need to hit the sea bass note on beat
one<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:18.860> after<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:19.660> anything<00:02:20.660> you<00:02:20.750> do<00:02:20.959> is

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
one and after that anything you do is

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.100 
one and after that anything you do is
more<00:02:21.290> general<00:02:21.769> you<00:02:22.370> just<00:02:22.610> need<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.910> play<00:02:23.150> notes

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
more general you just need to play notes

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.380 
more general you just need to play notes
to<00:02:24.500> fill<00:02:24.769> the<00:02:24.980> beats<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.580> as<00:02:25.910> long<00:02:26.060> as<00:02:26.090> there

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
to fill the beats and as long as there

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.630 
to fill the beats and as long as there
any<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.379> the<00:02:27.470> notes<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.920> C<00:02:28.129> chord<00:02:28.400> it's

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
any of the notes of the C chord it's

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.100 
any of the notes of the C chord it's
going<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:28.970> sound<00:02:29.150> fine<00:02:29.480> it's<00:02:29.750> not<00:02:29.930> any

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
going to sound fine it's not any

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:39.220 
going to sound fine it's not any
specific<00:02:30.230> order<00:02:31.069> you<00:02:31.370> have<00:02:31.400> to<00:02:31.610> do<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:38.230> when

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
specific order you have to do so when

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.440 
specific order you have to do so when
three<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.769> four<00:02:40.099> and<00:02:40.400> so<00:02:40.790> you<00:02:40.910> can<00:02:41.060> go<00:02:41.209> in<00:02:41.390> a

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
three and four and so you can go in a

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.270 
three and four and so you can go in a
downward<00:02:41.989> direction<00:02:42.019> or<00:02:42.709> an<00:02:42.950> upward

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
downward direction or an upward

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.100 
downward direction or an upward
direction<00:02:43.489> that's<00:02:44.450> something<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:44.840> can<00:02:44.989> begin

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
direction that's something you can begin

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.660 
direction that's something you can begin
to<00:02:45.379> practice<00:02:45.590> is<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.579> play<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.910> 1<00:02:47.120> 3<00:02:47.480> 5<00:02:48.670> just

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
to practice is to play the 1 3 5 just

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.430 
to practice is to play the 1 3 5 just
moving<00:02:50.060> up<00:02:50.209> on<00:02:50.450> any<00:02:50.870> chord<00:02:51.260> you're<00:02:51.410> playing

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
moving up on any chord you're playing

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.360 
moving up on any chord you're playing
and<00:02:52.129> then<00:02:52.819> practice<00:02:53.440> alternating<00:02:54.440> those

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.350 

give<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.120> little<00:02:59.390> bit<00:02:59.510> of<00:02:59.630> rhythmic<00:02:59.810> variation

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
give a little bit of rhythmic variation

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.000 
give a little bit of rhythmic variation
then<00:03:02.360> you<00:03:02.720> can<00:03:02.900> practice<00:03:03.080> playing<00:03:03.650> them

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
then you can practice playing them

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.190 
then you can practice playing them
together

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.449 

you<00:03:08.200> can<00:03:08.379> practice<00:03:08.709> playing<00:03:09.280> them<00:03:09.430> in

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
you can practice playing them in

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.280 
you can practice playing them in
parallel<00:03:09.939> motion<00:03:10.299> where<00:03:10.780> they're<00:03:10.930> going<00:03:11.170> in

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
parallel motion where they're going in

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
parallel motion where they're going in
the<00:03:11.319> same<00:03:11.620> direction<00:03:12.810> or<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:14.799> can<00:03:14.950> practice

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
the same direction or you can practice

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.860 
the same direction or you can practice
mirror<00:03:15.760> motion<00:03:16.239> where<00:03:16.390> they're<00:03:16.510> going<00:03:16.689> in<00:03:16.810> the

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
mirror motion where they're going in the

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.110 
mirror motion where they're going in the
opposite<00:03:17.379> direction<00:03:18.659> to<00:03:19.659> each<00:03:19.780> other

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
opposite direction to each other

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.380 
opposite direction to each other
so<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.450> trick<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:22.590> know<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.430> regardless

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
so the trick is to know that regardless

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.180 
so the trick is to know that regardless
of<00:03:24.540> what<00:03:24.690> direction<00:03:24.900> you're<00:03:25.409> going<00:03:25.440> or<00:03:25.920> how

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
of what direction you're going or how

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.670 
of what direction you're going or how
much<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:26.879> fill<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.360> beats<00:03:27.569> you're<00:03:28.170> really

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
much you fill the beats you're really

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.449 
much you fill the beats you're really
just<00:03:28.980> using<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.879> same<00:03:30.150> three<00:03:30.510> notes<00:03:31.159> in<00:03:32.159> both

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
just using the same three notes in both

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.789 
just using the same three notes in both
hands<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:33.569> before<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:33.930> go<00:03:34.200> I<00:03:34.230> want<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.560> show<00:03:34.709> you

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
hands so before I go I want to show you

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.500 
hands so before I go I want to show you
one<00:03:34.980> other<00:03:35.099> quick<00:03:35.370> thing<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.819> that's<00:03:35.970> how<00:03:36.450> to

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
one other quick thing and that's how to

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.690 
one other quick thing and that's how to
apply<00:03:36.900> this<00:03:36.959> information<00:03:37.319> if<00:03:38.069> you're<00:03:38.459> in<00:03:38.610> a

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
apply this information if you're in a

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.880 
apply this information if you're in a
song<00:03:38.909> it<00:03:39.120> has<00:03:39.239> pulses<00:03:39.989> of<00:03:40.110> three<00:03:40.409> instead<00:03:40.680> of

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
song it has pulses of three instead of

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.589 
song it has pulses of three instead of
pulses<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.519> four<00:03:41.819> so<00:03:42.209> if<00:03:42.329> you're<00:03:42.480> doing

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
pulses of four so if you're doing

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.110 
pulses of four so if you're doing
arpeggios<00:03:43.440> in<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.739> song<00:03:44.010> that<00:03:44.250> has<00:03:44.459> counts<00:03:44.970> of

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
arpeggios in a song that has counts of

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.240 
arpeggios in a song that has counts of
three<00:03:45.420> instead<00:03:45.959> of<00:03:46.019> counts<00:03:46.379> of<00:03:46.470> four<00:03:46.739> you'll

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
three instead of counts of four you'll

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.680 
three instead of counts of four you'll
want<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.459> just<00:03:47.640> adapt<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.209> so<00:03:48.390> that<00:03:48.540> you're

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
want to just adapt it so that you're

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.930 
want to just adapt it so that you're
filling<00:03:49.140> three<00:03:49.500> beats<00:03:49.709> worth<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:50.159> notes<00:03:50.340> so

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
filling three beats worth of notes so

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.650 
filling three beats worth of notes so
for<00:03:51.120> example<00:03:51.629> one<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.680> two<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.700> three<00:03:54.120> and

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
for example one and two and three and

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.720 
for example one and two and three and
then<00:03:55.260> you're<00:03:55.829> done<00:03:56.010> with<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.250> pattern<00:03:56.609> and

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
then you're done with the pattern and

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.720 
then you're done with the pattern and
you<00:03:56.790> start<00:03:57.120> again<00:03:57.239> one<00:03:58.049> and<00:03:58.560> two<00:03:58.829> and<00:03:59.340> three

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
you start again one and two and three

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.190 
you start again one and two and three
and<00:04:00.090> one<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:01.440> two<00:04:02.160> and<00:04:02.609> three<00:04:02.879> and<00:04:03.390> you<00:04:04.049> could

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
and one and two and three and you could

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.500 
and one and two and three and you could
play<00:04:04.349> right<00:04:04.739> hand<00:04:05.040> arpeggios<00:04:05.190> while<00:04:06.060> you're

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
play right hand arpeggios while you're

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.839 
play right hand arpeggios while you're
playing<00:04:06.690> left<00:04:06.959> hand<00:04:07.230> arpeggios<00:04:07.400> one<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:11.250> just

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
playing left hand arpeggios one and just

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.510 
playing left hand arpeggios one and just
remember<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.269> spread<00:04:12.599> on<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:12.780> left

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.940 

so<00:04:16.420> one<00:04:16.600> last<00:04:16.780> thing<00:04:16.930> before<00:04:17.170> I<00:04:17.410> go<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:17.830> that's

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
so one last thing before I go and that's

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.430 
so one last thing before I go and that's
to<00:04:18.280> talk<00:04:18.489> about<00:04:18.670> how<00:04:19.270> to<00:04:19.300> make<00:04:19.630> our<00:04:19.840> Pesci<00:04:20.290> O

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
to talk about how to make our Pesci O

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.760 
to talk about how to make our Pesci O
sound<00:04:20.890> even<00:04:21.459> softer<00:04:22.180> and<00:04:22.390> the<00:04:23.170> way<00:04:23.290> to<00:04:23.350> do<00:04:23.590> that

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
sound even softer and the way to do that

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.070 
sound even softer and the way to do that
is<00:04:24.040> to<00:04:24.190> use<00:04:24.220> a<00:04:24.400> neighborhood<00:04:24.940> note<00:04:25.180> so<00:04:25.720> if<00:04:25.960> the

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
is to use a neighborhood note so if the

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.800 
is to use a neighborhood note so if the
court<00:04:26.440> is<00:04:26.590> man<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:27.070> one<00:04:27.220> three<00:04:27.550> five<00:04:27.790> you<00:04:28.630> can

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
court is man and one three five you can

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.320 
court is man and one three five you can
use<00:04:28.930> a<00:04:28.960> neighborhood<00:04:29.470> note<00:04:29.650> too<00:04:30.460> to<00:04:31.000> make<00:04:31.180> it

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
use a neighborhood note too to make it

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.110 
use a neighborhood note too to make it
sound<00:04:31.570> softer<00:04:32.260> so<00:04:33.040> leadless<00:04:33.820> here<00:04:34.030> in

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
sound softer so leadless here in

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.180 
sound softer so leadless here in
arpeggio<00:04:34.690> where<00:04:35.530> we're<00:04:35.650> going<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.830> use<00:04:35.980> the

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
arpeggio where we're going to use the

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.190 
arpeggio where we're going to use the
one<00:04:36.340> three<00:04:36.610> five<00:04:36.850> and<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.600> neighborhood<00:04:37.990> note

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
one three five and the neighborhood note

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.610 
one three five and the neighborhood note
of<00:04:38.380> two

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:50.860 

see<00:04:42.130> much<00:04:42.310> softer<00:04:42.730> sense<00:04:43.230> one<00:04:44.230> five<00:04:44.860> one<00:04:45.370> three

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.890 

I'll<00:04:51.530> show<00:04:51.710> you<00:04:51.770> one<00:04:51.980> example<00:04:52.340> of<00:04:52.550> this

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
I'll show you one example of this

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.920 
I'll show you one example of this
watermark<00:04:53.900> by<00:04:54.200> Enya<00:04:54.680> uses<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.730> base<00:04:56.540> notes

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
watermark by Enya uses the base notes

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:05.469 
watermark by Enya uses the base notes
one<00:04:57.440> five<00:04:58.370> nine<00:04:59.139> three<00:05:00.400> nine<00:05:01.450> five

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.600 

so<00:05:06.110> if<00:05:06.169> we<00:05:06.289> took<00:05:06.439> that<00:05:06.620> back<00:05:06.830> to<00:05:06.979> the<00:05:07.099> key<00:05:07.279> of<00:05:07.400> C

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
so if we took that back to the key of C

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.210 
so if we took that back to the key of C
that<00:05:07.759> we're<00:05:07.879> working<00:05:08.210> on<00:05:08.360> one

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.740 

999

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.320 

I'm<00:05:17.020> very<00:05:17.170> pretty<00:05:17.500> sound<00:05:17.860> so<00:05:18.520> as<00:05:18.700> he<00:05:18.820> practice

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
I'm very pretty sound so as he practice

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.960 
I'm very pretty sound so as he practice
arpeggio<00:05:23.070> when<00:05:24.070> you<00:05:24.220> had<00:05:24.370> that<00:05:24.400> neighborhood

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
arpeggio when you had that neighborhood

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.110 
arpeggio when you had that neighborhood
note<00:05:25.120> or<00:05:25.240> not

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.969 

you'll<00:05:29.660> find<00:05:29.900> that<00:05:30.110> if<00:05:30.229> you<00:05:30.350> start<00:05:30.620> thinking

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
you'll find that if you start thinking

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:33.159 
you'll find that if you start thinking
about<00:05:31.100> what<00:05:31.699> the<00:05:32.090> left<00:05:32.360> hand<00:05:32.630> has<00:05:32.810> in<00:05:32.960> common

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.200 
about what the left hand has in common
with<00:05:33.470> the<00:05:33.560> right<00:05:33.710> hand<00:05:33.979> when<00:05:34.250> most<00:05:34.940> of<00:05:35.120> the

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
with the right hand when most of the

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.939 
with the right hand when most of the
time<00:05:35.419> it's<00:05:35.630> using<00:05:35.960> notes<00:05:36.139> of<00:05:36.350> the<00:05:36.440> chord<00:05:36.770> or

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949 
time it's using notes of the chord or

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.250 
time it's using notes of the chord or
note<00:05:37.760> to<00:05:38.150> the<00:05:38.270> chord<00:05:38.510> plus<00:05:38.690> a<00:05:38.720> neighborhood

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
note then you're going to find it starts

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.140 
note then you're going to find it starts
to<00:05:41.150> get<00:05:41.270> a<00:05:41.300> lot<00:05:41.630> easier<00:05:42.040> to<00:05:43.040> stylize<00:05:43.699> a<00:05:43.760> song

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150
