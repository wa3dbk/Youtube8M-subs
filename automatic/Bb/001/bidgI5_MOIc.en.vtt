 the requirements for the receipt of 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.860
 milk in brass are dependent on the 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.840
 daily amount for establishments 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.470

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.570
 brass washing can be manual 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.700
 provided that the company has a 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.730
 steam installed on the

 reception for reception volumes of 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.570
 milk between 5 thousand and 10 thousand liters 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.160
 daily 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.230
 it is recommended to install 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.140
 automatic bottle cleaner 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.480
 being that in the last obligatory phase the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.520
 with dry air when the reception of the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.450
 between 10 thousand and 20 thousand liters of 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.820
 daily milk 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.310
 receipt will be accomplished through 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.159
 treadmill or roller conveyor for the 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.740
 container transport with bypass and 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.770
 acid milk tank swings to 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.310
 milk weighing game and machine 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.800
 reasons for receipt of more than one 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.590
 20 thousand liters per day will be required 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.590
 dual plate balance always protected 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.490
 with millimeter stainless steel screen 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.490
 fixed on metal support 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.240
 in the case of milk distribution in 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.360
 tanks must exist on the farm 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.640
 a cooled expansion tank 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.070
 immediately after milking it should be 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.759
 to the tanks of preference 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.590
 directly into stainless steel pipes 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.040
 at this moment it is with temperature 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.380
 around 37 degrees celsius and needs 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.659
 be cooled as quickly as possible to 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.869
 prevent the proliferation of bacteria 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.850
 so the agitator must be switched on 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.140
 so that the milk is homogenized and 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.140
 refrigerated evenly
