00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.200 
to show you a comparison of my chickens
eggs<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.470> regular<00:02:50.190> chicken<00:02:50.430> eggs<00:02:50.700> like<00:02:51.000> what

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
eggs to regular chicken eggs like what

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.390 
eggs to regular chicken eggs like what
you<00:02:51.330> have<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.540> but<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:52.320> is<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.530> standard<00:02:53.130> egg

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
you have a but this is a standard egg

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
you have a but this is a standard egg
here<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.200> this<00:02:55.200> is<00:02:55.500> one<00:02:56.070> of<00:02:56.100> my<00:02:56.340> chickens<00:02:56.940> eggs

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
here and this is one of my chickens eggs

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.540 
here and this is one of my chickens eggs
you<00:02:57.570> see<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.110> difference<00:02:58.500> here<00:02:58.709> like<00:02:59.310> the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
you see the difference here like the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.480 
you see the difference here like the
difference<00:02:59.910> there<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:01.220> we<00:03:02.220> have<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.690> fresh<00:03:03.690> eggs

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
difference there so we have a fresh eggs

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.940 
difference there so we have a fresh eggs
these<00:03:05.490> are<00:03:05.700> not<00:03:06.360> so<00:03:06.510> fresh<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:06.990> think<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.380> looks

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
these are not so fresh I think it looks

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.520 
these are not so fresh I think it looks
like<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.100> three<00:03:08.430> month<00:03:08.670> I'm<00:03:09.510> not<00:03:09.660> sure<00:03:09.870> exactly

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
like a three month I'm not sure exactly

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.080 
like a three month I'm not sure exactly
how<00:03:10.890> fresh<00:03:11.250> they<00:03:11.430> are<00:03:11.459> when<00:03:11.760> they<00:03:11.850> hit<00:03:11.970> the

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
how fresh they are when they hit the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.570 
how fresh they are when they hit the
supermarket<00:03:12.690> but<00:03:12.900> nothing<00:03:13.680> beats<00:03:13.920> having<00:03:14.070> a

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
supermarket but nothing beats having a

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.390 
supermarket but nothing beats having a
fresh<00:03:15.030> egg<00:03:15.360> like<00:03:15.660> that's<00:03:15.870> cool<00:03:16.140> it's<00:03:16.320> small<00:03:16.680> it

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
fresh egg like that's cool it's small it

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.220 
fresh egg like that's cool it's small it
takes<00:03:17.610> about<00:03:17.730> one<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.209> half<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.570> easy<00:03:18.720> cool

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
takes about one and a half it easy cool

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.400 
takes about one and a half it easy cool
like<00:03:19.440> on<00:03:19.620> these<00:03:19.830> big<00:03:20.160> humungous<00:03:20.970> eggs<00:03:21.239> so<00:03:22.200> I'm

like<00:03:28.080> when<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.160> take<00:03:29.520> them<00:03:29.670> out<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:30.090> would<00:03:30.330> have

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
like when you take them out I would have

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.940 
like when you take them out I would have
cracked<00:03:30.900> them<00:03:31.080> but<00:03:31.320> it's<00:03:31.440> hard<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.650> hold<00:03:31.800> a

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
cracked them but it's hard to hold a

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.250 
cracked them but it's hard to hold a
camera<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.459> crack<00:03:32.670> an<00:03:32.820> egg<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:33.209> guess<00:03:34.020> but<00:03:34.200> you

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
camera and crack an egg I guess but you

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.500 
camera and crack an egg I guess but you
can<00:03:34.440> see<00:03:34.530> they're<00:03:34.680> really<00:03:34.980> rich<00:03:35.700> like<00:03:36.090> yellow

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510

what I love about my band some chickens

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.100 
what I love about my band some chickens
eggs<00:03:39.570> is<00:03:40.020> like<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.590> shell<00:03:40.920> is<00:03:41.270> extremely<00:03:42.270> like

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
eggs is like the shell is extremely like

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.820 
eggs is like the shell is extremely like
thick<00:03:43.680> very<00:03:44.310> durable<00:03:44.640> so<00:03:45.200> very<00:03:46.200> rarely<00:03:46.500> do<00:03:46.770> I

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
thick very durable so very rarely do I

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.830 
thick very durable so very rarely do I
have<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.010> problem<00:03:47.520> with<00:03:47.700> like<00:03:47.880> breaking<00:03:48.390> eggs<00:03:48.570> I

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
have a problem with like breaking eggs I

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.600 
have a problem with like breaking eggs I
think<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:49.140> happened<00:03:49.620> one<00:03:49.800> time<00:03:49.830> in<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.370> cage

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
think it happened one time in the cage

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.520 
think it happened one time in the cage
where<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.570> you<00:03:51.630> know<00:03:51.750> they<00:03:51.870> run<00:03:52.080> around<00:03:52.200> in

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
where the you know they run around in

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.020 
where the you know they run around in
there<00:03:52.709> and<00:03:52.860> they<00:03:52.950> might<00:03:53.130> break<00:03:53.370> an<00:03:53.550> egg<00:03:53.700> but

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
there and they might break an egg but

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.510 
there and they might break an egg but
definitely<00:03:56.030> more<00:03:56.210> durable<00:03:56.800> then<00:03:57.800> you<00:03:58.400> know

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
definitely more durable then you know

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.550 
definitely more durable then you know
these<00:03:58.700> eggshells<00:03:59.270> and<00:03:59.690> you<00:03:59.810> crack<00:03:59.990> this<00:04:00.170> opens

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
these eggshells and you crack this opens

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.890 
these eggshells and you crack this opens
extremely<00:04:01.190> thin<00:04:01.460> so<00:04:02.180> that's<00:04:02.480> probably<00:04:02.750> the

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
extremely thin so that's probably the

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.320 
extremely thin so that's probably the
upside<00:04:03.380> of<00:04:03.410> having<00:04:03.590> a<00:04:03.980> smaller<00:04:04.330> smaller

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
upside of having a smaller smaller

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.860 
upside of having a smaller smaller
chicken<00:04:06.190> she<00:04:07.190> does<00:04:07.400> that<00:04:07.610> she'll<00:04:08.420> it's<00:04:08.600> very

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
chicken she does that she'll it's very

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.310 
chicken she does that she'll it's very
hard

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
hard

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.680 
hard
that's<00:04:10.010> that's<00:04:10.820> who<00:04:11.060> I<00:04:11.090> don't<00:04:11.240> know<00:04:11.450> if<00:04:11.510> that

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
that's that's who I don't know if that

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:12.730 
that's that's who I don't know if that
