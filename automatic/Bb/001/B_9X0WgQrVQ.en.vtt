00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.940
 Hello everyone, what a pleasure to greet you as 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.890
 I'm always going to present you today 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.980
 attempt to make a marble in my 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.019
 nail marbling is something I like 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.320
 very much in terms of designs and 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:28.820
 glazes I have not practiced it is my 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.259
 first try I get very bad but with 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.359
 this I want to show that if we want 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.570
 achieve some design you have to practice 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:39.170
 Many times you have to practice until 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.510
 get the desired result and the 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.719
 truth is that although it costs a little 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.359
 I work the subsequent cleaning as soon as 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:51.469
 al marmoleados refers well our 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:53.510
 good skin is worth a try and I 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.110
 use what is water at temperature 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.079
 ambient 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.559
 neither too hot nor too cold 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.839
 and apply colored drops as before 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.270
 we know that it is applied in marbling 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.149
 a drop of a color subsequently 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.420
 expands we apply another drop of another 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:15.720
 color and on this occasion only 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:20.690
 I introduced nunha from the half up 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.690
 Protecting the bottom with tape 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.090
 and this is how it is 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.920
 at the bottom was the blue color 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.479
 that I applied base that is a very color 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.490
 nice and top think 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.700
 although it was not the result that I 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.540
 you're not expecting bad to some 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.660
 point looks nice and I will continue 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.520
 trying the real girls there are 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.890
 than getting what we want 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.479
 in terms of nail designs many times 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.430
 we do not have the ability or we're going to 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.990
 have because we are not artists by 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.990
 example I'm not a professional in the 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.850
 matter the decoration of the nail and 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.920
 I just like to remember my nails 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.229
 and I like to share and in this case I 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.810
 I share with you the intent that I made 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.390
 to decorate with this waiter style 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.430
 who sent a very big kiss I give 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.739
