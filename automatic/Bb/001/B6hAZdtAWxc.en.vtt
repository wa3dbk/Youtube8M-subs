00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
up after just having handled the g2 you

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.060 
up after just having handled the g2 you
can<00:00:23.000> feel<00:00:23.210> that<00:00:23.900> it<00:00:23.990> is<00:00:24.110> a<00:00:24.140> bit<00:00:24.349> more<00:00:24.529> plasticy

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
can feel that it is a bit more plasticy

but it's got a lot of the features that

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.319 
but it's got a lot of the features that
the<00:00:26.990> g1<00:00:27.619> had<00:00:27.919> now<00:00:28.430> this<00:00:28.550> is<00:00:28.700> going<00:00:28.849> to<00:00:28.910> come<00:00:29.149> in

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:29.329 
the g1 had now this is going to come in

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.510 
the g1 had now this is going to come in
as<00:00:29.750> an<00:00:30.020> entry-level<00:00:30.349> model<00:00:30.919> so<00:00:31.310> that<00:00:31.430> will

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
as an entry-level model so that will

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.430 
as an entry-level model so that will
come<00:00:31.640> in<00:00:31.759> from<00:00:32.060> the<00:00:32.090> Neath<00:00:32.360> where<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:32.899> g1

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
camera has that the g1 doesn't have is

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.670 
camera has that the g1 doesn't have is

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
high-definition video that's at 720 now

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.310 
high-definition video that's at 720 now
unlike<00:00:46.130> the<00:00:46.340> g2<00:00:46.850> which<00:00:47.150> has<00:00:47.390> a<00:00:47.660> slot<00:00:47.990> for<00:00:48.020> an

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
unlike the g2 which has a slot for an

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
external microphone into this camera you

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.110 
external microphone into this camera you
do<00:00:53.210> have<00:00:53.330> the<00:00:53.420> same<00:00:53.980> 2.5<00:00:54.980> millimeter<00:00:55.730> socket

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
do have the same 2.5 millimeter socket

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.850 
do have the same 2.5 millimeter socket
here<00:00:56.300> but<00:00:56.750> that's<00:00:56.870> only<00:00:57.110> for<00:00:57.290> a<00:00:57.530> remote

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
here but that's only for a remote

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.990 
here but that's only for a remote
control<00:00:58.340> now<00:00:58.640> it's<00:00:59.270> got<00:00:59.390> a<00:00:59.420> 3-inch<00:01:00.200> LCD<00:01:01.000> like

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
control now it's got a 3-inch LCD like

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.319 
control now it's got a 3-inch LCD like
the<00:01:02.210> g2<00:01:02.750> has<00:01:03.110> but<00:01:03.860> it's<00:01:03.980> not<00:01:04.129> articulated<00:01:05.119> and

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
the g2 has but it's not articulated and

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.490 
the g2 has but it's not articulated and
there's<00:01:05.930> no<00:01:06.159> touchscreen<00:01:07.159> operation<00:01:07.850> either

there's no touchscreen operation either

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.530 
there's no touchscreen operation either
now<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.560> g10<00:01:10.070> has<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.460> same<00:01:10.700> processor<00:01:11.390> as

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
now the g10 has the same processor as

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.600 
now the g10 has the same processor as
the<00:01:11.960> g1<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:13.040> it's<00:01:13.130> going<00:01:13.220> to<00:01:13.280> be<00:01:13.369> slightly

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
the g1 so it's going to be slightly

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.649 
the g1 so it's going to be slightly
slower<00:01:14.299> than<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:14.810> new<00:01:14.960> processor<00:01:15.590> on<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.800> g2

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
slower than the new processor on the g2

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:22.450 
slower than the new processor on the g2
now<00:01:17.659> it's<00:01:18.020> also<00:01:18.290> got<00:01:18.620> this<00:01:19.600> SD<00:01:20.600> XC<00:01:21.560> or<00:01:21.590> extended
