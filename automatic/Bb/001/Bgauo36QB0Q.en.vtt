00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 to us he gives us the material 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.780
 the television then we 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.730
 we receive this material and we make a 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.910
 review to see in the conditions that 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.640
 they come because all the movies and 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.640
 all as are some movies are from 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.679
 goods are not direct at the premiere they 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.820
 do a review once this is done 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:29.699
 review we take and do the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.000
 copies then you have finished this 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.580
 process so we wet the director that 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.700
 we have chosen or directors that we have 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.190
 chosen then he gives them material sample 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.010
 this director Jorge who chooses the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.060
 characters that we sleep on for the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:52.020
 movie then already begin the dubbing 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:55.290
 once unit in room as we 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.740
 we take the product that has come from 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.890
 room they do with the sound mix of 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.589
 metal voice against in full review 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.750
 and this product goes to television that 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.220
 have not loaded it admit that despite 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.410
 All of me fulfilled my part of the deal and 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.090
 reflect a little we had agreed that 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.140
 nobody should know that they had been stolen 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.960
 the plans of the ministry gives silver 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.030
 but read this newspaper much more 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.920
 and it's much meaner you 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.159
 too much and I 've always said that his 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.840
 character does not count relaxed we had 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.580
 agreed that no one should know that 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.180
 they had stolen the plans of the ministry 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:40.700
 in parallel but read this newspaper 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.570
 reflect a little we had agreed that 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.060
 in principle the function of the director is 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.130
 a little coordinate a bit all this 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.549
 story a little crazy 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.130
 what is the dubbing and concrete the unit 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.689
 thematic is not that it is a call 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.020
 the chapter then has a series of 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.020
 characters 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.380
 first involves a deal knowing who 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.840
 is the most suitable for that cast 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.879
 within the set of voices that 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.640
 You can currently have it here in Seville 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:16.099
 and the only thing that is intended to be adapted 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.950
 as much as possible the face of the character to 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.670
 that then in the first function of the 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.319
 director is to make that deal and try 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.620
 coordinate as much as possible 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.349
 voices remain harmonic prior to this 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.660
 then installed address the setting that is 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.660
 the preparation of the work that either the 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.670
 directly does the director who leads 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.040
 the movie series according to what 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.329
 is doing or delegate in some 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.940
 of the adjusters that normally 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:48.130
 They are usually trusted or they are going 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.230
 to give the best possible result 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.510
 and then it enters the battle and 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.090
 The living room is usually the horse 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.710
 of the director's battle where 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.890
 usually what it's about is to do 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.990
 interpret the actor as much as possible 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.020
 so that it is credible so that after 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.870
 when it comes on screen 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.300
 the person who is watching it can be 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.590
 identify if not total if at least 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.670
 in a large part with the character that 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.670
 iron 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.200
 synchrony is a non-metallic issue 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.599
 that is acquired over time 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.849
 it's the metal in the mouth not the acquire 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.069
 that pace but it's a question 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.080
 practically mathematical and mechanical that 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.150
 it acquires with time maybe 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.370
 the most difficult thing about everything that 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.959
 think that in Andalusia he is in the 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.110
 addiction the possible smells of 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:38.560
 feces of the finals be a little out 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.660
 of the aspiration of some words and 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.720
 above all the most important thing is the 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.040
 interpretation for us is a lot 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.380
 more important than a thing is 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.030
 interpreted that is in the mouth because 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.250
 in the mouth you can leave but to the 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.720
 first the second or the third but if 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.160
 the tea and it's just read is 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.500
 said in people is not credible 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.989
 then that's the job maybe more 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.299
 important the interpretation but they are going to 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.670
 horse some other things in sync 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.769
 interpretation diction has to go very 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.560
 side and very coordinated because if not 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.750
 then you see a forced language 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.150
 I call him about the merchandise 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.490
 about it was a small delay but the 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.950
 received 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.350
 nobody else should know that we have the 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.750
 plans we will meet tomorrow by the 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.820
 night in the usual place 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.440
 ok, you do not have to see that if we 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.440
 let's go to 46 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.860
 it really is a totally world 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.340
 different let's go the interpretation does not 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.610
 has nothing to do with the theater of 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.670
 cinema with the dubbing because here is 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.110
 they play a little with tones and really what 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.420
 that you are going to do the work that you are going to 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.430
 to do is to 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.920
 that of an actor who has prepared that 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.180
 I work and you are going to do it 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.770
 in minutes 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.710
 [Music] 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:04.979
 police that come in every more and you're 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:06.870
 for the work that is done here in 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.790
 ANDALUSIA look more closely by the 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.669
 for the story of the accent 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.199
 but for the actors 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.910
 it really does not have to be any 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.650
 difficulty 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.860
 if from time to time you miss the 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:25.760
 accent but that's what the director is for 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.670
 to make you repeat the tea 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.409
 and leave it well if you catch Nazis that you bring 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.809
 free 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:37.659
 to change my physique and go to ash or 

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:37.659
 to nebraska or that was the deposit 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:45.110
 I go to study to either be realistic or 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.840
 even finish the institute 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.840
 and a trade 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.840
 beautician 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:58.140
 nurse because not a lawyer touched 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.820
 you have good understandings but there 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.409
 things that you do not understand because you 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:07.110
 undervalued 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:09.529
 it's a movie time like his word 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.300
 indicates it was a shot but really 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:16.199
 for us it serves us as a serving 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:20.060
 maximum 10 typed lines 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:23.050
 or a minute of time 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.050
 in the film 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:30.020
 they call me in cartoons for 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:32.080
 generate all kinds of types of animals and 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.090
 of bichejos people 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.880
 I like it a lot and it does not hurt me and then 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.620
 in flesh and bone 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.860
 I usually do what they come 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:45.010
 call them damn they are cook two 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:48.520
 men three policemen a fireman four 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:50.800
 and aside, I do not know, it's not that I'm 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.590
 specialized but they tend to give me 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:57.570
 also a little psychopath roles 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.570
 from uncle quite strange 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.270
 that was one of the most surprises 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.850
 tremendous that I took because of course 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:06.310
 by meeting the people here with 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.390
 his typical logical accent on the other hand 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.520
 which I'm used to because there 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.930
 women is Andalusian and I'm 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.900
 perfectly habitual accents I've 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:16.300
 Andalusia came many times and my 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.830
 surprise was tremendous when the 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.690
 natural conversation the anteroom of the 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.360
 room everybody talking things in 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.740
 all in graz I am so so peculiar and 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.990
 then at the time of putting on the lectern and 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.150
 say the dialogues in a Castilian 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:30.990
 Purest was a big surprise and very 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.990
 nice by the way
