00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
to act like it's back on a normal path

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.030 
to act like it's back on a normal path
now<00:02:20.670> something<00:02:21.240> has<00:02:21.390> happened<00:02:21.840> here<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.800> last

now something has happened here the last

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.020 
now something has happened here the last
video<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.940> i<00:02:24.480> showed<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.739> path<00:02:25.980> ended<00:02:26.640> right

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
video that i showed the path ended right

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.250 
video that i showed the path ended right
here<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.989> went<00:02:28.230> 20<00:02:28.709> feet<00:02:29.270> done<00:02:30.270> there's<00:02:30.959> no

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
here it went 20 feet done there's no

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.130 
here it went 20 feet done there's no
explanation<00:02:31.680> for<00:02:32.220> this<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:33.330> radar<00:02:33.600> anomaly

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
explanation for this this radar anomaly

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.670 
explanation for this this radar anomaly
now<00:02:35.090> where<00:02:36.090> we<00:02:36.239> thought<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.720> went<00:02:36.900> down<00:02:37.200> they

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
now where we thought it went down they

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.850 
now where we thought it went down they
have<00:02:37.950> redone<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.300> I'm<00:02:40.230> going<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.560> fast

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
have redone this and I'm going to fast

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.890 
have redone this and I'm going to fast
forward<00:02:41.250> here<00:02:41.519> because<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.910> flight<00:02:42.150> seems<00:02:42.450> to

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
forward here because the flight seems to

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.930 
forward here because the flight seems to
stay<00:02:43.110> on<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.350> normal<00:02:43.650> path<00:02:44.040> all<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.459> way<00:02:44.640> till

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
stay on a normal path all the way till

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.530 
stay on a normal path all the way till
gets<00:02:45.209> on<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.450> other<00:02:45.630> side<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.840> Vietnam<00:02:47.540> now

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
gets on the other side of Vietnam now

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.660 
gets on the other side of Vietnam now
here<00:02:49.080> on<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.290> other<00:02:49.320> side<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.709> Vietnam<00:02:50.250> I

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
here on the other side of Vietnam I

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.340 
here on the other side of Vietnam I
noticed<00:02:51.390> something<00:02:51.720> very<00:02:51.750> odd<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.799> this<00:02:53.220> s<00:02:54.350> 370

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
noticed something very odd it this s 370

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.470 
noticed something very odd it this s 370
has<00:02:55.560> another<00:02:55.890> airplane<00:02:56.580> another<00:02:57.090> craft

has another airplane another craft

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.560 
has another airplane another craft
tailing<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.410> very<00:02:58.950> closely<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.820> this<00:03:00.000> this

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
tailing it very closely in this this

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.310 
tailing it very closely in this this
craft<00:03:00.930> ales<00:03:01.640> 370<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:02.820> breaks<00:03:03.510> away<00:03:03.690> from<00:03:03.870> it

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
craft ales 370 and breaks away from it

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.140 
craft ales 370 and breaks away from it
and<00:03:04.440> then<00:03:04.830> right<00:03:05.010> as<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.280> breaks<00:03:05.430> away<00:03:05.640> from<00:03:06.030> it

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
and then right as it breaks away from it

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.270 
and then right as it breaks away from it
that's<00:03:06.420> when<00:03:07.019> they<00:03:07.200> show<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.470> disappearing

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
that's when they show it disappearing

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.810 
that's when they show it disappearing
this<00:03:08.760> time<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:10.010> we'll<00:03:11.010> run<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.370> here<00:03:11.610> so<00:03:11.730> you

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
this time so we'll run it here so you

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:32.180 
this time so we'll run it here so you
guys<00:03:12.000> can<00:03:12.180> see

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
stories here both being presented by

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.390 
stories here both being presented by
flight<00:04:37.200> radar<00:04:37.820> and<00:04:38.870> of<00:04:39.870> course<00:04:40.140> this<00:04:40.650> being

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
flight radar and of course this being

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.710 
flight radar and of course this being
the<00:04:41.640> newer<00:04:42.530> but<00:04:43.530> what<00:04:43.740> was<00:04:43.860> this<00:04:44.070> then<00:04:44.570> what<00:04:45.570> is

this<00:04:45.930> anomaly<00:04:46.620> where<00:04:46.980> it<00:04:47.100> disappeared<00:04:47.760> right

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
this anomaly where it disappeared right

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.540 
this anomaly where it disappeared right
off<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.540> coast<00:04:48.720> of<00:04:49.020> Malaysia<00:04:49.410> a<00:04:49.740> lot<00:04:50.400> of
