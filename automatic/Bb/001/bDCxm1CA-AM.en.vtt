00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.179 

these<00:00:05.879> are<00:00:06.210> termite<00:00:06.750> tunnels<00:00:06.960> coming<00:00:07.830> up<00:00:08.069> the

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
these are termite tunnels coming up the

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.419 
these are termite tunnels coming up the
side<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.610> slab<00:00:08.849> foundation<00:00:10.190> I'm<00:00:11.190> going<00:00:11.340> to

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
side of a slab foundation I'm going to

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.089 
side of a slab foundation I'm going to
zoom<00:00:11.639> in<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.230> open<00:00:13.230> up<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.590> couple<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.009> these

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
zoom in and open up a couple of these

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.970 
zoom in and open up a couple of these
tunnels<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:14.759> can<00:00:14.969> see<00:00:15.440> which<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.470> what<00:00:16.859> you

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
tunnels so you can see which is what you

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.390 
tunnels so you can see which is what you
look<00:00:17.160> for<00:00:17.600> it's<00:00:18.600> real<00:00:18.779> important<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:20.070> we<00:00:20.220> can

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
look for it's real important that we can

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.950 
look for it's real important that we can
see<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.789> slab<00:00:21.060> foundation<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.810> house

have visible around the entire home for

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.230 
have visible around the entire home for
visibility<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:28.199> possible<00:00:28.680> activity<00:00:29.240> we're

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
visibility of possible activity we're

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.550 
visibility of possible activity we're
going<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.420> open<00:00:30.480> up<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.869> termite<00:00:31.199> tunnel
