00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.620
 hello my name is anor I am the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.540
 creator of the brand hummingbird and co 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.969
 who publishes accessories and 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.849
 stationery and so today I'm going 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.699
 present you with ideas of realization 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.430
 from hummingbird papers and co and 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.230
 we will start with a garland of 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.869
 paper flowers to realize his 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.119
 garland you need a leaf 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.170
 of paper with flower shapes to 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.610
 cut out a special pair of scissors 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.870
 paper that only serves to cut out 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:40.739
 son paper coordinated pattern to 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.550
 cut out and a needle so the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.710
 first stage 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:53.760
 cut out the flowers that will be used to 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:55.770
 make the garland to cut out 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.050
 effectively by following the outline 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.750
 petals I advise you as and when 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.359
 as the scissors advance that this 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.479
 the other hand opposed to the scissors 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.880
 that turns the flower and that the 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.060
 chisel remains fixed like that we arrive 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.960
 good to follow the scissors blades 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.960
 and a time saving 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.540
 so when you estimate you have some 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.329
 cups and enough flowers - I 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.909
 advise you at least 25 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.520
 you can start making 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:37.399
 assembly the war mende we begin 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.399
 by piquÃ© lafleur in front at an angle 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.640
 in fact the only file then we transplant 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.640
 on the other side pretty close to the edge 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.649
 now i'm going to show you how 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.520
 stop the thread so that the garland 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.410
 stay well in place 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.380
 so we make a simple knot for 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.160
 stop the thread at the level of the first 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.160
 and the last flower 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.810
 then we cut the thread leaving a 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.910
 little bit of length on both sides and 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.450
 then it's more than just hanging 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.330
 garland 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.250
 for that we can use a pretty 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.959
 tape of colors in that I tell you 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.760
 repositionable now here you 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.090
 know how to make a garland of 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.100
 flowers 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.900
 if you need more 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.300

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.100
