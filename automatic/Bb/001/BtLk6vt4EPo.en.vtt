as<00:00:08.050> we<00:00:08.920> install<00:00:09.070> vinyl<00:00:09.310> all<00:00:10.030> of<00:00:10.389> us<00:00:10.510> get<00:00:10.750> the

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:10.870 
as we install vinyl all of us get the

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.930 
as we install vinyl all of us get the
odd<00:00:11.020> bubble<00:00:11.440> and<00:00:11.590> wrinkle<00:00:11.920> but<00:00:12.490> here<00:00:12.700> are<00:00:12.790> some

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
odd bubble and wrinkle but here are some

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.340 
odd bubble and wrinkle but here are some
techniques<00:00:13.330> to<00:00:13.480> make<00:00:13.660> your<00:00:13.930> bubbles<00:00:14.260> and

techniques to make your bubbles and

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:20.070 
techniques to make your bubbles and
wrinkles<00:00:14.410> go<00:00:14.980> away<00:00:18.119> first<00:00:19.119> let's<00:00:19.780> talk<00:00:20.020> about

vehicle before your squeegee places it
there<00:00:44.649> which<00:00:45.370> results<00:00:45.910> in<00:00:46.030> bubbles<00:00:47.579> here<00:00:48.579> we

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
there which results in bubbles here we

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.910 
there which results in bubbles here we
have<00:00:48.969> a<00:00:49.000> really<00:00:49.329> long<00:00:49.660> bubble<00:00:50.079> and<00:00:50.260> here<00:00:50.770> we

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
have a really long bubble and here we

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.319 
have a really long bubble and here we
have<00:00:51.129> something<00:00:51.430> that<00:00:51.609> could<00:00:51.850> turn<00:00:52.030> into<00:00:52.210> a

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
have something that could turn into a

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.330 
have something that could turn into a
wrinkle<00:00:52.780> and<00:00:53.050> here<00:00:53.890> as<00:00:54.010> well<00:00:56.160> let's<00:00:57.160> get

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
wrinkle and here as well let's get

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.680 
wrinkle and here as well let's get
started<00:00:57.730> with<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.969> long<00:00:58.149> bubble<00:01:00.539> ideally<00:01:01.539> you

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
started with the long bubble ideally you

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.209 
started with the long bubble ideally you
would<00:01:01.809> like<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:02.170> bubble<00:01:02.500> to<00:01:02.620> be<00:01:02.739> this<00:01:02.920> size

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
would like the bubble to be this size

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.520 
would like the bubble to be this size
because<00:01:04.000> if<00:01:04.150> it<00:01:04.300> were<00:01:04.510> you<00:01:04.960> could<00:01:05.140> just<00:01:05.350> touch

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
because if it were you could just touch

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.350 
because if it were you could just touch
it<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:05.890> it<00:01:06.010> would<00:01:06.130> disappear<00:01:06.250> due<00:01:07.090> to<00:01:07.240> the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
it and it would disappear due to the

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.999 
it and it would disappear due to the
area<00:01:07.720> grass<00:01:07.930> pattern<00:01:08.350> in<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.590> adhesive<00:01:11.009> when

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
area grass pattern in the adhesive when

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.219 
area grass pattern in the adhesive when
you<00:01:12.159> have<00:01:12.369> a<00:01:12.400> long<00:01:12.729> bubble<00:01:13.090> like<00:01:13.270> this<00:01:13.509> simply

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
you have a long bubble like this simply

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.520 
you have a long bubble like this simply
divide<00:01:14.619> it<00:01:14.770> up<00:01:14.860> into<00:01:15.009> smaller<00:01:15.460> bubbles<00:01:16.530> then

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
divide it up into smaller bubbles then

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.590 
divide it up into smaller bubbles then
when<00:01:18.070> all<00:01:18.250> you<00:01:18.460> have<00:01:18.700> are<00:01:18.909> smaller<00:01:19.180> bubbles

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
when all you have are smaller bubbles

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.749 
when all you have are smaller bubbles
simply<00:01:20.409> place<00:01:20.650> your<00:01:20.680> finger<00:01:21.159> or<00:01:21.310> thumb<00:01:21.340> on

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
simply place your finger or thumb on

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.340 
simply place your finger or thumb on
each<00:01:21.790> one<00:01:22.119> and<00:01:22.299> they<00:01:22.720> will<00:01:22.900> completely

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
each one and they will completely

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:32.880 
each one and they will completely
flatten<00:01:23.860> out

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.650 

if<00:01:33.890> you<00:01:34.160> have<00:01:34.370> a<00:01:34.400> potential<00:01:34.910> wrinkle<00:01:35.450> like

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
if you have a potential wrinkle like

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.110 
if you have a potential wrinkle like
this<00:01:35.960> start<00:01:36.740> working<00:01:37.250> it<00:01:37.400> with<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:37.670> Teflon

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
this start working it with the Teflon

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.870 
this start working it with the Teflon
squeegee<00:01:38.660> work<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.830> wrinkle<00:01:40.190> back<00:01:40.460> in<00:01:40.730> the

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
squeegee work the wrinkle back in the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:52.020 
squeegee work the wrinkle back in the
direction<00:01:41.030> it<00:01:41.420> came<00:01:41.600> from

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.149 

you<00:01:52.630> can<00:01:52.840> see<00:01:53.110> that<00:01:53.290> as<00:01:53.470> soon<00:01:53.710> as<00:01:53.830> you<00:01:53.979> get

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
you can see that as soon as you get

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.340 
you can see that as soon as you get
closer<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.640> its<00:01:54.909> origin<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.930> wrinkle

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
closer to its origin the wrinkle

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.969 
closer to its origin the wrinkle
develops<00:01:56.799> two<00:01:57.070> corners<00:01:57.610> as<00:01:57.850> you<00:01:58.840> continue<00:01:59.380> cut

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
develops two corners as you continue cut

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.130 
develops two corners as you continue cut
each<00:02:00.190> corner<00:02:00.580> off<00:02:00.880> at<00:02:01.119> a<00:02:01.210> 45-degree<00:02:02.110> angle

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
each corner off at a 45-degree angle

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.469 
each corner off at a 45-degree angle
until<00:02:02.650> you<00:02:03.159> work<00:02:03.369> it<00:02:03.549> back<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.060> edge<00:02:04.210> of

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
until you work it back to the edge of

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.229 
until you work it back to the edge of
the<00:02:04.570> application<00:02:08.069> seal<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.280> edge<00:02:09.429> and<00:02:09.759> the

the application seal the edge and the

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:18.760 
the application seal the edge and the
wrinkle<00:02:10.630> is<00:02:10.750> undetectable

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.440 

sometimes<00:02:19.770> we<00:02:20.010> may<00:02:20.160> drop<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.640> vinyl<00:02:21.030> onto<00:02:21.210> the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
sometimes we may drop the vinyl onto the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.510 
sometimes we may drop the vinyl onto the
vehicle<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.050> create<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.650> field<00:02:23.070> of<00:02:23.250> small

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
vehicle and create a field of small

vehicle and create a field of small
bubbles<00:02:23.760> that<00:02:24.090> don't<00:02:24.330> have<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.570> large<00:02:24.870> volume

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
bubbles that don't have a large volume

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.830 
bubbles that don't have a large volume
of<00:02:25.440> air<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:26.460> could<00:02:26.730> take<00:02:26.910> some<00:02:27.180> time<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.630> push

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
of air it could take some time to push

the vinyl is standing off the vehicle

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.709 
the vinyl is standing off the vehicle
quite<00:02:48.079> a<00:02:48.109> bit<00:02:48.609> it<00:02:49.609> also<00:02:49.819> has<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.120> potential

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:50.719 
quite a bit it also has a potential

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.679 
quite a bit it also has a potential

first<00:02:57.829> fix<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.819> largest<00:02:59.299> bubble<00:02:59.510> we<00:03:00.049> need<00:03:00.260> it

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
first fix the largest bubble we need it

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.050 
first fix the largest bubble we need it
to<00:03:00.470> be<00:03:00.620> round<00:03:03.250> start<00:03:04.250> with<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.549> end<00:03:04.730> of<00:03:04.939> the

to be round start with the end of the

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.059 
to be round start with the end of the
wrinkle<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.599> follow<00:03:06.140> it<00:03:06.319> all<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.590> way<00:03:06.739> back

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
wrinkle and follow it all the way back

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.280 
wrinkle and follow it all the way back
to<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.400> bubble<00:03:07.579> cutting<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.299> corners<00:03:08.689> at<00:03:08.840> 45

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:51.689 
we have a fair-sized bubble here - I

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:54.020 
we have a fair-sized bubble here - I
suggest<00:03:52.560> dividing<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.519> first<00:03:53.819> before

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
suggest dividing it first before

suggest dividing it first before
flattening<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:55.579> always<00:03:56.579> remember<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.299> round

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
flattening it always remember to round

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:04.000 
flattening it always remember to round
the<00:03:57.780> corners

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.949 

we'll<00:04:04.580> start<00:04:04.909> with<00:04:05.090> this<00:04:05.239> one<00:04:05.300> because<00:04:05.659> it<00:04:05.930> has
