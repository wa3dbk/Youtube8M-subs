for carbuncle again that's kind of a
silly<00:01:28.660> play<00:01:28.900> that<00:01:29.080> it's<00:01:29.200> literally<00:01:29.590> never

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.860 
not its effect release into merit for it
overall<00:01:36.310> though<00:01:36.430> I<00:01:36.460> think<00:01:36.730> just<00:01:36.940> one<00:01:37.450> is<00:01:37.660> fine

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
of both because this format is really

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.470 
of both because this format is really
weird<00:02:03.930> anyway<00:02:04.930> I<00:02:04.960> am<00:02:05.350> playing<00:02:05.650> three<00:02:05.950> Maroons

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
still really good card in the deck

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.320 
still really good card in the deck
especially<00:02:08.830> when<00:02:09.039> you<00:02:09.160> get<00:02:09.310> up<00:02:09.430> to<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.090> four

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
especially when you get up to the four

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.630 
especially when you get up to the four
and<00:02:10.450> five

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
and five

playing<00:02:12.640> three<00:02:12.930> crystal<00:02:13.930> beacon<00:02:14.380> because

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
playing three crystal beacon because

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.190 
playing three crystal beacon because
this<00:02:15.040> is<00:02:15.190> definitely<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.640> faster<00:02:16.150> version<00:02:16.330> you

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
this is definitely a faster version you

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.110 
this is definitely a faster version you
want<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.470> finish<00:02:17.590> your<00:02:17.709> point<00:02:18.010> quickly<00:02:18.190> and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
want to finish your point quickly and

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.699 
want to finish your point quickly and
especially<00:02:19.360> in<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.599> slower<00:02:19.870> format<00:02:20.380> right<00:02:20.560> now

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
especially in a slower format right now

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.729 
especially in a slower format right now
if<00:02:21.310> your<00:02:21.459> deck<00:02:21.610> can<00:02:21.880> be<00:02:22.630> really<00:02:22.930> fast<00:02:23.260> then<00:02:23.709> you

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
if your deck can be really fast then you

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.780 
if your deck can be really fast then you
are<00:02:24.250> pretty<00:02:24.819> good<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.150> set<00:02:25.330> up<00:02:25.480> or<00:02:26.349> to<00:02:26.500> win<00:02:26.790> I'm

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
are pretty good to set up or to win I'm

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.130 
are pretty good to set up or to win I'm
on<00:02:27.970> playing<00:02:28.209> through<00:02:28.360> crystal<00:02:28.630> promise<00:02:28.959> for

on playing through crystal promise for

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.600 
on playing through crystal promise for
the<00:02:29.200> same<00:02:29.410> reason<00:02:29.440> it's<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.040> really<00:02:30.220> good<00:02:30.310> card

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
the same reason it's a really good card

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.820 
the same reason it's a really good card
also<00:02:30.880> with<00:02:31.120> monster<00:02:31.450> reborn<00:02:31.569> ban<00:02:31.930> this

also with monster reborn ban this

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.380 
also with monster reborn ban this
basically<00:02:33.280> is<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.700> monster<00:02:33.880> II<00:02:34.060> wonder

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.540 
basically is the monster II wonder
crystal<00:02:34.690> beasts<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:35.110> it's<00:02:35.260> pretty<00:02:35.440> cool<00:02:35.620> I'm

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
crystal beasts so it's pretty cool I'm

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.580 
crystal beasts so it's pretty cool I'm
multiplying<00:02:36.790> one<00:02:37.150> crystal<00:02:37.510> blessing<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.019> one

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
multiplying one crystal blessing and one

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.930 
multiplying one crystal blessing and one
crystal<00:02:38.980> abundance<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:39.489> a<00:02:39.610> lot<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:39.819> people

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
crystal abundance and a lot of people

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.610 
crystal abundance and a lot of people
say<00:02:40.239> you<00:02:40.300> should<00:02:40.569> probably<00:02:40.750> 12<00:02:41.170> abundance<00:02:41.500> and

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
say you should probably 12 abundance and

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.949 
say you should probably 12 abundance and
no<00:02:41.739> blessing<00:02:42.300> blessing<00:02:43.300> comes<00:02:43.690> in<00:02:43.810> handy

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
no blessing blessing comes in handy

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.770 
no blessing blessing comes in handy
quite<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.500> bit<00:02:45.239> abundance<00:02:46.239> is<00:02:46.330> a<00:02:46.390> card<00:02:46.630> that<00:02:46.750> I

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
quite a bit abundance is a card that I

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.940 
quite a bit abundance is a card that I
keep<00:02:46.959> swapping<00:02:47.170> in<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:47.590> out<00:02:47.650> for

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
keep swapping in and out for

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.949 
keep swapping in and out for
terraforming<00:02:48.489> but<00:02:48.970> overall<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.720> think

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
terraforming but overall I think

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.449 
terraforming but overall I think
abundance<00:02:50.470> is<00:02:50.590> better<00:02:50.799> I<00:02:51.040> still<00:02:51.280> don't<00:02:51.430> like

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
abundance is better I still don't like

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.759 
abundance is better I still don't like
either<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:51.970> those<00:02:52.150> cards<00:02:52.540> very<00:02:53.290> much<00:02:53.500> but

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
either of those cards very much but

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.770 
either of those cards very much but
abundant<00:02:54.130> seems<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.549> work<00:02:54.670> I'm<00:02:55.390> playing<00:02:55.569> to

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
abundant seems to work I'm playing to

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.479 
abundant seems to work I'm playing to
Crystal<00:02:56.110> release<00:02:56.290> still<00:02:56.560> on<00:02:56.799> with<00:02:57.340> the

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
Crystal release still on with the

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.759 
Crystal release still on with the
banning<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.180> heavy<00:02:58.390> storm<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:59.170> rest<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.709> the

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
banning of heavy storm the rest of the

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.650 
banning of heavy storm the rest of the
deck<00:02:59.890> is<00:03:00.010> good<00:03:00.190> but<00:03:00.370> crystal<00:03:00.760> release<00:03:00.970> isn't

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
deck is good but crystal release isn't

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.080 
deck is good but crystal release isn't
quite<00:03:02.200> as<00:03:02.380> good<00:03:02.560> on<00:03:02.769> it<00:03:03.250> still<00:03:03.580> is<00:03:03.760> good<00:03:03.940> though

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
quite as good on it still is good though

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.330 
quite as good on it still is good though
because<00:03:04.269> you<00:03:04.510> can<00:03:04.660> set<00:03:04.959> it<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:05.230> if<00:03:06.190> your

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
because you can set it and if your

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.539 
because you can set it and if your
opponent<00:03:06.519> MST<00:03:07.390> is<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:07.980> they<00:03:08.980> are<00:03:09.040> taking<00:03:09.459> a

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
opponent MST is it they are taking a

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.890 
opponent MST is it they are taking a
minus<00:03:09.849> 1<00:03:10.150> which<00:03:10.180> is<00:03:10.420> pretty<00:03:10.720> cool<00:03:11.280> also<00:03:12.280> it

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
minus 1 which is pretty cool also it

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.660 
minus 1 which is pretty cool also it
makes<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:14.140> not<00:03:14.470> lose<00:03:14.709> card<00:03:14.920> advantage<00:03:15.099> when

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
makes you not lose card advantage when

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.830 
makes you not lose card advantage when
your<00:03:15.850> crystal<00:03:16.150> beast<00:03:16.299> monsters<00:03:16.660> get

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
your crystal beast monsters get

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.380 
your crystal beast monsters get
destroyed<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.440> you<00:03:17.530> can<00:03:17.650> equip<00:03:17.890> this<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.160> them

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
destroyed and you can equip this to them
