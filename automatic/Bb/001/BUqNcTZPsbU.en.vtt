00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.839 

so<00:03:51.480> do<00:03:51.629> you<00:03:51.719> have<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:52.079> message<00:03:52.409> to<00:03:52.920> all<00:03:53.129> the<00:03:53.430> few

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
so do you have a message to all the few

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.539 
so do you have a message to all the few
humans<00:03:54.359> left<00:03:54.599> and<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.049> all<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.349> zombies<00:03:55.739> for

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
humans left and to all the zombies for

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.280 
humans left and to all the zombies for
the<00:03:56.670> humans<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.420> would<00:03:57.569> say<00:03:57.719> invest<00:03:58.049> in<00:03:58.200> a

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
the humans I would say invest in a

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.949 
the humans I would say invest in a
shotgun<00:03:58.670> for<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.760> zombies<00:04:00.209> I<00:04:00.480> would<00:04:00.599> say<00:04:00.749> guys

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
shotgun for the zombies I would say guys

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.679 
well I think that zombies and humans can
be<00:04:05.280> friends<00:04:05.670> I<00:04:05.819> think<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:06.269> this<00:04:06.389> is<00:04:06.540> the

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:06.689 
be friends I think that this is the

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:10.190 
be friends I think that this is the
example

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:24.480
