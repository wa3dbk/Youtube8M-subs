 as we always do to cook 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.700
 10 minutes or that perfect cools the 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.830
 water here we have cold if you notice is the 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.140
 habitat of rice that we always throw or 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.100

 gold so is this is a little tea that tea 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.220
 is going to clarify how you're going to use it 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.649
 times a week or 30 hours at night 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.050

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.259

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.799
 very little water has to be left 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.410
