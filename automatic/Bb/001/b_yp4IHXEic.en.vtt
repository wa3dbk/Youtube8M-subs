00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
wasted money but it is still good for

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.170 
wasted money but it is still good for
people<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.020> save<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.800> preserve<00:00:41.219> capital<00:00:41.730> and

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
people to save and preserve capital and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.549 
people to save and preserve capital and
that's<00:00:42.300> what<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.480> think<00:00:42.719> people<00:00:42.899> want<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.410> do

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
that's what I think people want to do

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.400 
that's what I think people want to do
they're<00:00:43.770> recognizing<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:46.020> usual

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
they're recognizing that the usual

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.900 
they're recognizing that the usual
investments<00:00:46.950> don't<00:00:47.160> protect<00:00:47.579> them<00:00:47.789> and

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
investments don't protect them and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.790 
investments don't protect them and
they're<00:00:48.120> they're<00:00:48.390> trying<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.809> save<00:00:49.110> capital

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
they're they're trying to save capital

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.439 
they're they're trying to save capital
so<00:00:49.980> they're<00:00:50.219> trying<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.820> overcome<00:00:51.270> this

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
so they're trying to overcome this

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.319 
so they're trying to overcome this
notion<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:52.110> capitalism<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:53.010> moved<00:00:53.820> by<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
notion that capitalism is moved by the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.569 
notion that capitalism is moved by the
Fed<00:00:54.690> creating<00:00:55.199> credit<00:00:55.530> out<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.800> thin<00:00:56.039> air<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
Fed creating credit out of thin air and

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.849 
Fed creating credit out of thin air and
getting<00:00:56.789> consumers<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.480> spend<00:00:57.750> money<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.680> it's

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
getting consumers to spend money so it's

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.619 
getting consumers to spend money so it's
the<00:00:58.980> market<00:00:59.340> saying<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.000> should<00:01:00.210> save

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the market saying that you should save

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.660 
the market saying that you should save
and<00:01:00.960> preserve<00:01:01.140> your<00:01:01.410> capital<00:01:02.160> for<00:01:02.399> another

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
and preserve your capital for another

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.910 
and preserve your capital for another
day<00:01:02.969> when<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.570> might<00:01:03.750> take<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.500> tell

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
think its long-term it's a lot easier

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.870 
think its long-term it's a lot easier
one<00:01:33.119> year<00:01:33.360> or<00:01:33.479> two<00:01:33.509> years<00:01:33.890> difficult<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.520> you

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
one year or two years difficult but you

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.100 
one year or two years difficult but you
know<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> got<00:01:36.240> interested<00:01:36.540> when<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:36.990> was

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
know I got interested when it was

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.140 
know I got interested when it was
thirty-five<00:01:37.530> dollars<00:01:37.710> an<00:01:38.009> ounce<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
thirty-five dollars an ounce so the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.819 
thirty-five dollars an ounce so the
direction<00:01:39.450> was<00:01:39.750> awkward<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.350> continues

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
direction was awkward and it continues

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.710 
direction was awkward and it continues
upwards<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.430> when<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.729> think<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.450> when<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
upwards and when you think that when the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.480 
upwards and when you think that when the
Fed<00:01:42.899> was<00:01:43.049> created<00:01:43.470> was<00:01:43.560> twenty<00:01:43.950> dollars<00:01:44.280> now

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
Fed was created was twenty dollars now

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.370 
Fed was created was twenty dollars now
it's<00:01:44.640> twelve<00:01:44.909> hundred<00:01:45.090> dollars<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:46.200> a

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
it's twelve hundred dollars so it's a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.230 
it's twelve hundred dollars so it's a
good<00:01:46.560> measurement<00:01:46.979> i<00:01:47.220> don't<00:01:47.399> i<00:01:47.700> don't<00:01:47.729> buy

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
good measurement i don't i don't buy

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.350 
good measurement i don't i don't buy
gold<00:01:48.960> coins<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.770> an<00:01:49.950> investment<00:01:50.430> i<00:01:50.729> do<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.240> to

how do you do it well I've over the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.880 
how do you do it well I've over the
years<00:02:04.950> i<00:02:05.100> bought<00:02:05.280> coins<00:02:05.640> because<00:02:06.000> i<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.420> to

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
years i bought coins because i like to

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.449 
years i bought coins because i like to
you<00:02:07.890> know<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.520> possession<00:02:09.209> uh<00:02:09.679> but<00:02:10.679> but<00:02:10.950> no

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.140 
i'll buy some gold shares to
that's<00:02:13.590> closer<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.070> an<00:02:14.310> investment<00:02:15.000> because

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
that's closer to an investment because

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.210 
that's closer to an investment because
you're<00:02:15.480> dealing<00:02:15.870> with<00:02:15.900> management<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:17.100> you

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
you're dealing with management and you

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.990 
you're dealing with management and you
know<00:02:18.350> dealing<00:02:19.350> with<00:02:19.620> maybe<00:02:20.100> they<00:02:20.340> hit<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.610> hit<00:02:20.970> a

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
know dealing with maybe they hit a hit a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.970 
know dealing with maybe they hit a hit a
strike<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.260> that's<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.620> definite

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
strike and so that's a definite

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.590 
strike and so that's a definite
investment<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.730> have<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:23.970> evaluate<00:02:24.180> but

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
investment and you have to evaluate but

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.100 
investment and you have to evaluate but
but<00:02:25.080> coins<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:26.370> buying<00:02:26.640> gold<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.210> see<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.900> not

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
but coins and buying gold I see is not

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.550 
but coins and buying gold I see is not
so<00:02:28.770> much<00:02:29.010> as<00:02:29.190> buying<00:02:29.700> gold<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.690> betting<00:02:31.440> on

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
so much as buying gold and betting on

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.740 
so much as buying gold and betting on
the<00:02:31.650> price<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:32.040> gold<00:02:32.190> going<00:02:32.520> up<00:02:32.700> but<00:02:32.880> betting

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
the price of gold going up but betting

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.530 
the price of gold going up but betting
on<00:02:34.050> our<00:02:34.530> government<00:02:35.070> ruining<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.940> value<00:02:36.300> of

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
on our government ruining the value of

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.940 
on our government ruining the value of
our<00:02:36.720> money<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.430> really<00:02:39.120> is<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.620> negative

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
our money and so it really is a negative

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.580 
our money and so it really is a negative
toward<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:42.300> dollar<00:02:42.600> being<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.140> long-term

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
toward the dollar being a long-term

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.340 
toward the dollar being a long-term
hedge<00:02:44.370> against<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.090> higher<00:02:45.300> prices<00:02:45.960> because

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
hedge against the higher prices because

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.350 
hedge against the higher prices because
you<00:02:46.800> know<00:02:46.950> what<00:02:47.430> would<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:47.700> rather<00:02:47.850> do<00:02:48.150> would

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
you put ten thousand dollars of gold in

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.180 
you put ten thousand dollars of gold in
a<00:02:50.610> shoebox<00:02:50.850> or<00:02:51.300> 10,000<00:02:51.990> one<00:02:52.380> dollar<00:02:52.620> bills<00:02:52.980> in
