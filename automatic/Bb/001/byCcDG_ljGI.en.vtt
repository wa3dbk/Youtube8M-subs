 integral pasta of three spiral colors 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.470
 tell you that the wholemeal pasta is very 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.720
 healthy especially because it's going to 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.390

 regulate our gut that is very 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.580
 important we are going to do this is that 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.860
 let's bake let's cook 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.589
 for 10 minutes because this paste 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.809
 whole rice cooks very fast no 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.809
 it is necessary to have it too long 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.450

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.909

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.280
