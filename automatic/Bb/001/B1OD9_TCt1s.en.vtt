closely with Matt dowdy of onel designs
and<00:03:06.350> built<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.130> outerspace<00:03:07.610> men<00:03:08.000> on<00:03:08.210> the<00:03:08.870> glio

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
and built the outerspace men on the glio

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.140 
and built the outerspace men on the glio
system<00:03:10.070> oh<00:03:10.280> wait<00:03:10.910> it's<00:03:11.180> glass<00:03:11.530> sorry<00:03:12.530> my<00:03:12.950> bad

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
system oh wait it's glass sorry my bad

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.590 
system oh wait it's glass sorry my bad
that's<00:03:14.150> right

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
that's right

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.080 
that's right
just<00:03:15.260> like<00:03:15.530> those<00:03:15.740> glass<00:03:16.220> figures<00:03:16.700> we<00:03:16.850> loved

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
just like those glass figures we loved

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.930 
just like those glass figures we loved
so<00:03:17.420> much<00:03:17.690> all<00:03:18.320> of<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.860> outerspace<00:03:19.370> men<00:03:19.730> have

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
so much all of the outerspace men have

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.180 
so much all of the outerspace men have
interchangeable<00:03:20.510> parts<00:03:20.840> at<00:03:21.110> every<00:03:21.620> joint<00:03:21.980> on

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
interchangeable parts at every joint on

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.090 
interchangeable parts at every joint on
the<00:03:22.400> figure<00:03:22.930> that<00:03:23.930> makes<00:03:24.200> for<00:03:24.440> an<00:03:24.560> infinite

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
the figure that makes for an infinite

the<00:03:27.320> parts<00:03:27.620> among<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.160> figures<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:29.090> create

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
the parts among the figures to create

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.380
