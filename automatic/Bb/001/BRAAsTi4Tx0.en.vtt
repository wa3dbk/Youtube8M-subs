00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
oxide in it and zinc oxide it's

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.630

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
couple different mines and then also it

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.770

can be found in places in the u.s.
including<00:00:46.780> New<00:00:46.960> Jersey<00:00:47.519> it's<00:00:48.519> oddly<00:00:48.970> enough

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
including New Jersey it's oddly enough

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
the official gemstone of Massachusetts

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.130 
the official gemstone of Massachusetts
which<00:00:51.850> I<00:00:52.150> couldn't<00:00:52.449> find<00:00:52.600> anywhere<00:00:52.900> that<00:00:53.049> it

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
which I couldn't find anywhere that it

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.509 
which I couldn't find anywhere that it
actually<00:00:53.530> said<00:00:53.739> that<00:00:53.769> it<00:00:53.860> was<00:00:54.010> mined<00:00:54.280> there

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
actually said that it was mined there

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.520 
actually said that it was mined there
but<00:00:55.030> Massachusetts<00:00:55.780> adopted<00:00:55.869> it<00:00:56.320> it's<00:00:56.500> a

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
but Massachusetts adopted it it's a

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.710 
but Massachusetts adopted it it's a
pretty<00:00:56.680> stone<00:00:56.949> so<00:00:57.220> I<00:00:57.280> understand<00:00:57.729> why<00:00:57.850> it

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
pretty stone so I understand why it

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.780 
pretty stone so I understand why it
looks<00:00:58.960> a<00:00:59.080> lot<00:00:59.260> to<00:00:59.470> me<00:00:59.619> like<00:01:00.010> kind<00:01:00.190> of<00:01:00.369> roots

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
looks a lot to me like kind of roots

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.280 
looks a lot to me like kind of roots
when<00:01:01.089> you<00:01:01.210> look<00:01:01.390> at<00:01:01.510> those<00:01:01.659> different<00:01:02.110> black

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
when you look at those different black

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.359 
when you look at those different black
inclusions<00:01:03.129> and<00:01:04.650> what<00:01:05.650> it<00:01:05.740> pairs<00:01:05.979> really<00:01:06.220> well

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
inclusions and what it pairs really well

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.750 
inclusions and what it pairs really well
with<00:01:06.520> is<00:01:06.909> smoky<00:01:07.479> quartz<00:01:07.780> onyx<00:01:08.470> with<00:01:09.369> some<00:01:09.610> of

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
with is smoky quartz onyx with some of

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.149 
with is smoky quartz onyx with some of
the<00:01:10.150> darker<00:01:11.020> gemstones<00:01:11.530> because<00:01:11.830> it<00:01:11.950> does

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
the darker gemstones because it does

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.160 
the darker gemstones because it does
have<00:01:12.369> some<00:01:12.580> of<00:01:12.610> these<00:01:12.729> great<00:01:13.060> inclusions<00:01:13.689> the

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
have some of these great inclusions the

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.310

more<00:01:14.350> inclusions<00:01:14.830> it<00:01:15.130> has<00:01:15.340> actually<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.720> less

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
more inclusions it has actually the less

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.590 
more inclusions it has actually the less
of<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.920> high-end<00:01:18.460> gemstone<00:01:18.940> it<00:01:19.060> is<00:01:19.180> the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
of a high-end gemstone it is the

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.270 
of a high-end gemstone it is the
high-end<00:01:19.780> ones<00:01:20.110> you'll<00:01:20.260> see<00:01:20.500> will<00:01:20.710> have<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:20.920> lot

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
high-end ones you'll see will have a lot

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.340 
high-end ones you'll see will have a lot
more<00:01:21.310> of<00:01:21.580> just<00:01:21.850> straight<00:01:22.090> pink<00:01:22.450> I<00:01:22.690> tend<00:01:23.290> to

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
more of just straight pink I tend to

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.720 
more of just straight pink I tend to
like<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.740> inclusions<00:01:24.220> most<00:01:24.520> of<00:01:24.670> the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
like the inclusions most of the

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.430 
like the inclusions most of the
gemstones<00:01:25.180> that<00:01:25.300> I<00:01:25.420> look<00:01:25.690> for<00:01:25.930> are<00:01:26.110> ones<00:01:26.320> that

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
gemstones that I look for are ones that

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.590 
gemstones that I look for are ones that
are<00:01:26.530> really<00:01:26.830> unique<00:01:27.190> and<00:01:27.430> have<00:01:28.060> a<00:01:28.090> lot<00:01:28.570> of

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
are really unique and have a lot of

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.710 
are really unique and have a lot of
those<00:01:29.490> kind<00:01:30.490> of<00:01:30.550> inclusions<00:01:31.210> that<00:01:31.420> are<00:01:31.540> in

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
those kind of inclusions that are in

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.240 
those kind of inclusions that are in
them<00:01:31.930> and<00:01:32.110> just<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.320> different<00:01:32.500> masks<00:01:32.890> sing

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
them and just the different masks sing

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.190 
them and just the different masks sing
it<00:01:33.580> does<00:01:33.940> look<00:01:34.090> like<00:01:34.240> a<00:01:34.270> little<00:01:34.480> root<00:01:34.750> system

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200
