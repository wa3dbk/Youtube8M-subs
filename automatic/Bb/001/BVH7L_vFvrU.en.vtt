00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.100 
12 are actually bigger in size and the
previous<00:01:59.610> design<00:02:00.610> they've<00:02:01.270> improved<00:02:01.689> the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
previous design they've improved the

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.789 
previous design they've improved the
watch<00:02:02.680> band<00:02:03.039> it's<00:02:03.340> got<00:02:03.549> a<00:02:03.579> nice<00:02:03.840> soft<00:02:04.840> rubber

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
watch band it's got a nice soft rubber

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.370 
watch band it's got a nice soft rubber
band<00:02:06.299> they've<00:02:07.299> improved<00:02:07.659> it<00:02:07.899> by<00:02:08.020> actually

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
band they've improved it by actually

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.550 
band they've improved it by actually
putting<00:02:08.410> as<00:02:08.920> you<00:02:09.670> can<00:02:09.820> see<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.180> double<00:02:10.560> slots

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
putting as you can see the double slots

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.830 
putting as you can see the double slots
all<00:02:11.710> the<00:02:11.800> way<00:02:11.890> down<00:02:12.100> for<00:02:12.400> the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
all the way down for the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.720 
all the way down for the
pen<00:02:13.110> whereas<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.860> previous<00:02:13.890> model<00:02:14.400> had<00:02:14.700> a

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
pen whereas the previous model had a

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.059 
pen whereas the previous model had a
single<00:02:15.150> pin<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:15.629> all<00:02:16.260> these<00:02:16.470> little<00:02:16.680> factors

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
single pin so all these little factors

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.820 
single pin so all these little factors
give<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.430> more<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.819> more<00:02:18.780> manly<00:02:19.019> muscular

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
give it more of a more manly muscular

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.820 
give it more of a more manly muscular
sort<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.900> feeling<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.200> even<00:02:22.470> though<00:02:22.709> it

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
sort of a feeling to it even though it

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.250 
sort of a feeling to it even though it
is<00:02:22.920> technically<00:02:23.730> it's<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.120> military<00:02:24.780> design

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
is technically it's a military design

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.880 
is technically it's a military design
watch<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:26.400> has<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.580> be<00:02:26.760> hardcore<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.890> tough

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
watch so it has to be hardcore and tough

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.280 
watch so it has to be hardcore and tough

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
too far this way or too far the other

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.170 
too far this way or too far the other
way<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:46.980> gets<00:02:47.160> but<00:02:47.310> one<00:02:47.579> thing<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:47.819> a<00:02:47.940> lot<00:02:48.000> of

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
way and gets but one thing that a lot of

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.550 
way and gets but one thing that a lot of
mental<00:02:48.390> fund<00:02:48.630> appealing<00:02:49.049> about<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.410> watch

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
mental fund appealing about this watch

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.520 
mental fund appealing about this watch
as<00:02:49.769> well<00:02:49.950> as<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.310> fact<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:50.989> its<00:02:51.989> value<00:02:52.349> for

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
as well as the fact that its value for

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.850 
as well as the fact that its value for
money<00:02:52.680> these<00:02:53.579> watches<00:02:54.170> compared<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.260> a

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
money these watches compared to a

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.509 
money these watches compared to a
designer<00:02:56.730> watches<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:58.200> really<00:02:58.920> good<00:02:59.099> value<00:02:59.489> for

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
designer watches a really good value for

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.509 
designer watches a really good value for
money<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.090> I'm<00:03:01.019> sure<00:03:01.349> there<00:03:01.650> they<00:03:02.129> would<00:03:02.250> last

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
money and I'm sure there they would last

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.569 
money and I'm sure there they would last
a<00:03:02.700> lot<00:03:02.849> longer<00:03:02.930> than<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.650> Masters<00:03:05.010> watches<00:03:05.459> on

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
a lot longer than the Masters watches on

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.699 
a lot longer than the Masters watches on
the<00:03:05.700> market<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:06.329> it's<00:03:06.810> really<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.110> personal

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
the market so it's really a personal
