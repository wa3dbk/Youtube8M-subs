00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.299
 hamburg since my first car quartet 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.130
 i dream of it in the lamborghini 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.470
 Countach own this dream 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.849
 come true 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.410
 beginning of the seventies was this 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.010
 car fastest car with 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.310
 street use 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:31.450
 100 km h the v12 engine pushes the box 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.150
 with 375 ps and you get the and 6 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.280
 seconds from zero to 100 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.530
 but especially many degrees can be 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.540
 Conducting gas for me 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:48.030
 typical racecar the score points 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:48.030
 4000 solid heavy gas foot 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.410
 5,500 into hell 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.850
 the hell los that happens even if you 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.070
 the only one meter 7 high part on the 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.660
 public lets go of people 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.020
 arise wherever the customer with 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.190
 showing the scissors doors 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.050
 only concession to the driver the 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.840
 Air conditioning the pilot game door 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.940
 Otherwise, the second violin sets the tone 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.940
 the v12 engine with four liters of displacement 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.960
 in front 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.790
 reached its maximum output of 375 ps 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.450
 The coach at 8000 rpm 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.520
 minute 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.950
 the promised top speed 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.900
 By contrast, he never reaches 300 km / h 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.210
 but real 288 km reached 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.380
 1974 fastest for the title 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.820
 sports car with street legal 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.060
 I am very happy that the 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.830
 Air conditioning worked so well from here 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.990
 it is not because of the window 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.159
 really 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.390
 that 's it then you get 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.810
 just got my driving license through 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.090
 nothing else 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.420
 at all so with luxury looks very much here 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.700
 seems bad 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.410
 the fittings arrive here in front of me 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.040
 impressive is all somehow 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.629
 invited to the consultation noble is true 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.049
 but good with this car but also comes 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.049
 other values 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.330
 the intention of designer marcello 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.950
 gandini to design a car next to the 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.030
 the people are standing with their mouths open 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.760
 stay 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.670
 So this car is a real one 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.959
 Challenge 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.120
 if I have such a brutal tomorrow 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.670
 Muscular hangover inside, he is not 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.190
 so beautiful but outside one 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.840
 absolute sensation what concrete sheet metal 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.750
 master marcello gandini served 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.500
 has is really hard to compare the two 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.590
 must imagine 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.840
 The car was introduced in 1971 in 1973 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.410
 went into production and was until 1990 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.870
 built 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.970
 and honestly there is still today 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.200
 absolutely futuristic therefore has me 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.380
 just someone in the parking lot 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.550
 asked if that was the new lambo 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.660
 You can only say until the canteen was 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.310
 ahead of its time 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.900
 also as regards the engine the v12 of the 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.640
 was here for the first time along 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.170
 what he now also built 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.569
 Patent recipe for all Italian 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.370
 has become a super athlete and this 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.680
 motor is not only beautiful he 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.680
 Sounds sensational too 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.360
 twelve-cylinder have lamborghini 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:31.440
 tradition 1964 justified the 270 ps 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.819
 strong gran turismo 350 gt the myth around 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.819
 the brand with the bull in the coat of arms 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.209
 In 1966 lamborghini miura followed 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.069
 mounted in front of the rear axle 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.930
 Mid-engine, he gave the direction 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.030
 for future supersporters 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.319
 undoubtedly one of the jurassic 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.319
 most beautiful sports car ever 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.410
 the extreme wedge shape of his legitimate 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.580
 successor scrooge shocked against it 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.130
 especially when it comes to the 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:07.140
 widened and from cooling holes 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:09.660
 jagged last series deals with 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.580
 just two sticky coolers 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.490
 The line of the first flows 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.200
 contact series significantly more harmonious for 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.940
 the first tests had to be behind 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.400
 The cockpit is sitting the water cooler 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.470
 be set up vertically just like that 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.790
 could one the temperature budget of the 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.380
 mounted in front of the rear axle 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.380
 get a grip on the engine 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.860
 they were less worried 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.250
 engineers around the fuel consumption of the 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.020
 twelve cylinders of his food through 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.730
 645 weber carburettor hatches 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.410
 So who has a dog is driving 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.150
 within very short time a very tight 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.040
 relationship of trust with his gas station attendant 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.110
 develop because this box needs 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.170
 at least 20 liters but upwards 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.040
 there is a lot of space but the good is 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.440
 you can not look at either side 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.180
 Of course only the best there are two 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.520
 tanks and they are the same as a house 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.890
 connected hose 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.880
 But this selection has taken place 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.880
 pass years 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.550
 distribute a total of 120 liters of superplus 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.919
 turn on two left and right in the 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.479
 swell hidden tanks the customer 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.820
 at the same time from both sides 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:22.080
 So thank you is not showeinlage 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.080
 but time savings 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:31.750
 the tanks mounted on both sides 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:33.610
 reducing the focus can be on victory 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.129
 displacements by coat of arms of gasoline 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.650
 Thanks to the aluminum body, the collar weighs 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:40.690
 only 1300 75 kilograms 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.970
 in combination with racing 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.479
 Chassis creates an almost neutral 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.479
 curve behavior 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:53.240
 for tours for this author extremely 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.490
 unsuitable generally everything is very tight 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.380
 the disadvantage of this medium engine there 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.240
 if you divide the place masters with motor 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.810
 gear and the whole mechanical 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.670
 divide 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.230
 but wide 190 g 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.580
 just ideal for narrow mountain road 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.040
 because you want a beautiful here 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.860
 wide autostrada but 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.360
 hope you may have 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.010
 the autostrada forgives him his 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.520
 biggest weakness the nonexistent 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.520
 round visibility 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.809
 lamp 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:24.809
 ola
