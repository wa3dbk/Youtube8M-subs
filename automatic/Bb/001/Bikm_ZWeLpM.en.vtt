00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.500
 listening that arguing what to throw 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.050

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.840
 leave but whoever wants to argue with me 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.789
 facebook or twitter twitter or facebook 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.039
 vai l'aquila so I'll discuss with 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:51.420
 You more clear about this than 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:53.069
 it is good that this Alex released the first 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.140
 list of the beginning of this year we have here 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:02:00.330
 until all games properly that 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:05.420

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.420
 truth is a second medium of billboards 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:22.349
 good beauty even calm after 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:25.140
 we have 16 we analyze that begins a 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.000
 little strange because the first month until 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.379
 one month five all the games are being 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.819
 they gave the games is here on 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.480
 list were really the games that they 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.680
 gave 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.660

 and we have the next month that at least eight 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.000
 in the case that here is talking that they 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:01.740
 are going to give assassin's creed liberation 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:04.140
 hd talking that maybe it matters 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.910

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.790

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.590
 which was released to bring but only 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.830
 a list that to use it and this network 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.810

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.060

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.160

 we have 11 and 23 899 here and then 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.109
 started to err because they did not 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:40.250
 none of these games 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:40.250
