those variable fixed costs why is it

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.529

all<00:01:04.890> should<00:01:05.890> we<00:01:06.009> spend<00:01:06.369> some<00:01:06.550> time<00:01:06.820> on<00:01:06.850> it<00:01:07.090> and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
all should we spend some time on it and

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.359 
all should we spend some time on it and
I<00:01:07.420> think<00:01:07.479> we<00:01:07.869> shouldn't<00:01:08.320> let's<00:01:08.770> go<00:01:08.950> through<00:01:09.220> it

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
I think we shouldn't let's go through it

marketing<00:01:25.479> decisions<00:01:26.289> as<00:01:26.470> well<00:01:27.190> so<00:01:27.940> we're

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
marketing decisions as well so we're

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.790 
marketing decisions as well so we're
going<00:01:28.210> to<00:01:28.300> go<00:01:28.509> through<00:01:28.869> some<00:01:29.050> of<00:01:29.170> these<00:01:29.229> costs

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
going to go through some of these costs

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.100 
going to go through some of these costs
and<00:01:29.890> then<00:01:29.979> we'll<00:01:30.490> come<00:01:30.610> up<00:01:30.640> with<00:01:30.789> a<00:01:31.110> corn

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
and then we'll come up with a corn

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.570 
and then we'll come up with a corn
example<00:01:32.590> where<00:01:32.740> we<00:01:32.830> go<00:01:32.950> through<00:01:33.190> some<00:01:33.399> of<00:01:33.520> the

ultimately what your profit will be but

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.800 
ultimately what your profit will be but
it's<00:01:48.069> price<00:01:48.310> times<00:01:48.580> yield<00:01:48.880> minus<00:01:49.270> cost<00:01:49.539> when

five hundred and forty acres is what I'm
going<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.290> plant<00:03:10.590> I'm<00:03:11.010> going<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.280> assume<00:03:11.580> we

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
going to plant I'm going to assume we

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.520 
going to plant I'm going to assume we

got to assume a yield so I'm going to

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.830 
got to assume a yield so I'm going to
assume<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.830> yield<00:03:14.070> of<00:03:14.190> 180<00:03:14.760> per<00:03:15.360> bushel<00:03:15.510> now<00:03:15.780> you

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
assume a yield of 180 per bushel now you

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.140 
assume a yield of 180 per bushel now you
