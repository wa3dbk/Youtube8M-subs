 2.9 gigahertz quad core with a chip 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.229
 integrated graphics while the apu 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.850
 could work dedicated gpu set 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.430
 of the system the hd 6670 this is a 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.800
 direct x11 carrying card has a 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.820
 around a gigahertz with up to one 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.670
 gigabyte of dedicated ram hd the 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.530
 76-70 graphics card is a version of 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.990

 that the same card will be used 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.509
 for the next xbox I say all this 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.330
 information is taken from the page and 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.640
 vg247 whose source is ign one of 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.030
 the most important web pages of 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.850
 sector 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:12.400
 regarding its graphic chip on 83 38 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:14.470
 thousand 50 38 50 is a 6,550 high 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.500
 definition by which the appu would be 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.690
 able to play games in the 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.060
 reference specifications and 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.590
 lower resolutions without the help of 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.290
 the gpu is worth therefore the hd 76-70 the 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.989
 graphics card would use a 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.090
 symmetric crossfire configuration and it will be 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.190
 used to share the burden of 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.080
 real-time graphics processing 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.410
 of course all this is 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.320
 apart from the official, it is data that has 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.300
