00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
before you even start and also it will

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.420 
before you even start and also it will
randomly<00:00:30.810> generate<00:00:31.380> each<00:00:31.650> session<00:00:32.250> each

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
randomly generate each session each

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.220 
randomly generate each session each
universe<00:00:33.059> which<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.780> can<00:00:33.930> change<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
universe which you can change the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
settings for each time you play so if

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.060 
settings for each time you play so if
it's<00:00:36.840> like<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.200> don't<00:00:37.290> play<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.649> same<00:00:37.800> game

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
it's like you don't play the same game

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.340 
it's like you don't play the same game
twice<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:39.059> can<00:00:39.180> even<00:00:39.329> customize<00:00:39.600> ships<00:00:40.170> when

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
twice you can even customize ships when

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.780 
twice you can even customize ships when
you<00:00:40.440> actually<00:00:40.559> get<00:00:40.800> into<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.980> game<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.340> there

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
you actually get into the game and there

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.220 
you actually get into the game and there
will<00:00:41.969> be<00:00:42.000> modding<00:00:42.450> support<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> game

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
will be modding support for the game

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.619 
will be modding support for the game
later<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.399> star<00:00:44.610> Lords<00:00:44.910> will<00:00:45.210> also<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.600> a

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
later on so star Lords will also have a

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.510 
later on so star Lords will also have a
LAN<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.079> multiplayer<00:00:46.410> option<00:00:47.129> which<00:00:47.430> is

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
LAN and multiplayer option which is

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.580 
LAN and multiplayer option which is
really<00:00:47.940> exciting<00:00:48.300> for<00:00:48.329> me<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.570> see<00:00:48.690> I'm<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.379> big

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
really exciting for me to see I'm a big

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.500 
really exciting for me to see I'm a big
fan<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.980> there<00:00:50.640> are<00:00:50.670> also<00:00:50.879> generals

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
fan of that there are also generals

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.229 
fan of that there are also generals
which<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> specific<00:00:52.739> unit<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.460> grows<00:00:53.850> and

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
which is a specific unit that grows and

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.360 
which is a specific unit that grows and
can<00:00:54.719> become<00:00:54.899> very<00:00:55.199> strong<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.829> apparently

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
can become very strong and apparently

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.770 
can become very strong and apparently
can<00:00:56.579> turn<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.850> tide<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.239> match<00:00:57.390> according

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
can turn the tide of a match according

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.540 
can turn the tide of a match according
to<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> developers<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.620> also<00:00:59.190> like<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.520> fact

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
to the developers I also like the fact

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.760 
to the developers I also like the fact
that<00:00:59.850> civilizations<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:01.020> civil<00:01:01.500> wars

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
that civilizations can have civil wars

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.429 
that civilizations can have civil wars
so<00:01:02.399> if<00:01:02.489> there's<00:01:02.760> unrest<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.329> colonies<00:01:03.809> it

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
so if there's unrest in the colonies it

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.170 
so if there's unrest in the colonies it
could<00:01:04.589> cause<00:01:04.769> empires<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> fall<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.880> then

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
could cause empires to fall and then

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.940 
could cause empires to fall and then
even<00:01:06.390> entire<00:01:06.930> new<00:01:07.080> ones<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.470> created<00:01:07.799> from

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
even entire new ones to be created from

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.770 
even entire new ones to be created from
the<00:01:08.070> ashes<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.150> select<00:01:09.299> up<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.630> eight

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the ashes you can select up to eight

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.240 
the ashes you can select up to eight
races<00:01:10.350> which<00:01:10.590> all<00:01:10.770> have<00:01:10.979> their<00:01:11.100> own

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
races which all have their own

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.670 
races which all have their own
technologies<00:01:12.119> aesthetic<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.990> bonuses<00:01:13.470> and

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
technologies aesthetic and bonuses and

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.310 
technologies aesthetic and bonuses and
this<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> very<00:01:15.000> big<00:01:15.330> game<00:01:15.600> but<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.110> also

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
this is a very big game but it also

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.550 
this is a very big game but it also
requires<00:01:17.119> patience<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.299> would<00:01:19.140> honestly<00:01:19.320> not

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
requires patience I would honestly not

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.200 
requires patience I would honestly not
recommend<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.520> casual<00:01:21.000> players

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
recommend this to you casual players

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.359 
recommend this to you casual players
unless<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.840> are<00:01:22.140> really<00:01:22.590> fond<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.100> genre

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
unless you are really fond of the genre

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.310 
unless you are really fond of the genre
already<00:01:23.700> also<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.509> have<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.869> report<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
already also I have to report that the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.590 
already also I have to report that the
game<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.650> pretty<00:01:26.040> much<00:01:26.270> intensive<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.450> your

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
game is pretty much intensive on your

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.350 
game is pretty much intensive on your
machine<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.170> will<00:01:28.770> drop<00:01:29.040> frames<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:30.090> bombs

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
machine and will drop frames like bombs

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.969 
machine and will drop frames like bombs
pretty<00:01:30.900> much<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.560> could<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:31.799> later

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
pretty much but this could be later

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.069 
pretty much but this could be later
optimised<00:01:32.520> I'll<00:01:33.060> remember<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:33.900> game

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079
