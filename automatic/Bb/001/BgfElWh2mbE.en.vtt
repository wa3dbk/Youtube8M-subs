00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
they're like spread open for instance if

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.980 
they're like spread open for instance if
you<00:05:19.979> were<00:05:20.100> to<00:05:20.130> use<00:05:20.400> those<00:05:20.729> pink<00:05:21.090> roses<00:05:21.419> that<00:05:21.780> we

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
you were to use those pink roses that we

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.650

used earlier you need a lot more of them

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.620 
used earlier you need a lot more of them
because<00:05:25.050> they're<00:05:25.260> a<00:05:25.290> little<00:05:25.560> bit<00:05:25.710> skinny<00:05:26.010> so

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
because they're a little bit skinny so

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.150 
because they're a little bit skinny so
you<00:05:27.630> need<00:05:27.810> more<00:05:27.990> of<00:05:28.050> it<00:05:28.200> to<00:05:28.380> cover<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:28.830> surface

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
you need more of it to cover the surface

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.190 
you need more of it to cover the surface
area<00:05:29.550> of<00:05:29.580> the<00:05:29.910> sphere<00:05:29.970> so<00:05:30.630> just<00:05:30.870> keep<00:05:31.020> that<00:05:31.050> in
