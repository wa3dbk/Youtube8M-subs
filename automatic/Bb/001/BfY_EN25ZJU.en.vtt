this<00:00:34.899> board<00:00:35.170> was<00:00:35.350> overpriced<00:00:35.920> because<00:00:36.220> it

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
this board was overpriced because it

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.389 
this board was overpriced because it
came<00:00:36.489> to<00:00:36.610> $62<00:00:37.420> with<00:00:37.660> grip<00:00:37.930> after<00:00:38.770> got<00:00:38.890> mob<00:00:39.100> of

course<00:00:39.840> um<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:43.239> board<00:00:43.540> is<00:00:44.250> probably<00:00:45.250> one<00:00:45.550> of

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
course um this board is probably one of

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.130 
course um this board is probably one of
the<00:00:45.760> best<00:00:45.940> boards<00:00:46.239> I've<00:00:46.360> ever<00:00:46.540> had<00:00:46.719> even

pressure pack at all and the graphic was

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.289 
pressure pack at all and the graphic was
thin<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:07.990> wood<00:01:08.200> under<00:01:08.529> it<00:01:08.679> is<00:01:09.299> really

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
thin but the wood under it is really

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.599 
thin but the wood under it is really
slippery<00:01:10.630> so<00:01:11.439> it's<00:01:11.590> like<00:01:11.979> you're<00:01:12.189> signing<00:01:12.429> and

bearings<00:01:28.810> I<00:01:29.109> used<00:01:29.349> to<00:01:29.469> have<00:01:29.590> rides<00:01:29.889> but<00:01:30.279> I

00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:30.459 
bearings I used to have rides but I

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:38.809 
bearings I used to have rides but I
broke<00:01:30.669> the<00:01:30.849> whole<00:01:30.999> set<00:01:31.679> um<00:01:34.109> it<00:01:36.149> that's<00:01:37.149> my<00:01:37.359> tail

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
broke the whole set um it that's my tail

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.899 
broke the whole set um it that's my tail
that's<00:01:39.959> middle<00:01:40.959> of<00:01:41.109> the<00:01:41.229> board<00:01:41.729> that's<00:01:42.729> the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
that's middle of the board that's the

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.679 
that's middle of the board that's the
nose<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:45.159> board<00:01:45.489> has<00:01:45.759> only<00:01:46.149> chipped<00:01:46.509> a

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
nose this board has only chipped a

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.309 
nose this board has only chipped a
little<00:01:46.749> bit<00:01:47.279> but<00:01:48.279> it<00:01:49.270> was<00:01:49.450> like<00:01:49.539> really<00:01:49.959> really

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
little bit but it was like really really

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.969 
little bit but it was like really really
small<00:01:50.709> ships<00:01:51.039> but<00:01:51.489> like<00:01:51.759> nothing<00:01:52.149> substantial

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
small ships but like nothing substantial

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.519 
small ships but like nothing substantial
um<00:01:55.889> the<00:01:56.889> tail<00:01:57.099> concave<00:01:57.579> is<00:01:57.909> ok<00:01:58.529> because

00:01:59.519 --> 00:01:59.529 
um the tail concave is ok because

00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:01.559 
um the tail concave is ok because
obviously<00:01:59.979> you're<00:02:00.459> not<00:02:00.639> going<00:02:00.849> to<00:02:00.909> do<00:02:01.090> like

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
obviously you're not going to do like

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.589 
obviously you're not going to do like
skateboards<00:02:02.139> backwards<00:02:02.529> like<00:02:02.679> I<00:02:02.829> used<00:02:03.039> to<00:02:03.599> um

00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:04.599 
skateboards backwards like I used to um

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:09.300 
skateboards backwards like I used to um
and<00:02:05.319> then<00:02:05.590> that's<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.159> nose<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.920> nose<00:02:09.069> is

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
and then that's the nose the nose is

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.600 
and then that's the nose the nose is
actually<00:02:09.789> a<00:02:09.849> lot<00:02:10.090> bigger<00:02:10.360> than<00:02:10.569> tail<00:02:11.340> which<00:02:12.340> is

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
actually a lot bigger than tail which is

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.179 
actually a lot bigger than tail which is
kind<00:02:12.909> of<00:02:12.969> annoying<00:02:13.209> because<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.349> like<00:02:14.530> forward

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
kind of annoying because I like forward

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.959 
kind of annoying because I like forward
to<00:02:15.280> be<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.400> proportional<00:02:16.230> but<00:02:17.459> imma<00:02:18.459> making<00:02:18.909> the

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:18.969 
to be a proportional but imma making the

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:23.670 
to be a proportional but imma making the
board<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.719> can't<00:02:20.140> tell<00:02:20.319> them<00:02:20.469> it<00:02:22.409> as<00:02:23.409> you<00:02:23.530> can

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
board so I can't tell them it as you can

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.270 
board so I can't tell them it as you can
see<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:25.030> board<00:02:25.299> is<00:02:25.569> still<00:02:26.290> in<00:02:26.980> good<00:02:27.219> condition

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
see the board is still in good condition

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.390 
see the board is still in good condition
and<00:02:28.650> I'll<00:02:29.650> skate<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.069> until<00:02:30.430> it's<00:02:31.030> crap<00:02:32.400> cuz

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
and I'll skate it until it's crap cuz

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.399 
and I'll skate it until it's crap cuz
it's<00:02:34.060> still<00:02:34.269> good<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.420> little<00:02:34.569> concave<00:02:34.810> in<00:02:35.319> the

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
it's still good a little concave in the

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:45.229 
it's still good a little concave in the
middle<00:02:35.680> like<00:02:35.829> that<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:44.019> nose<00:02:44.349> is<00:02:44.379> big<00:02:44.890> enough

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
middle like that the nose is big enough

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.589 
middle like that the nose is big enough
so<00:02:46.239> when<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.659> do<00:02:46.980> flip<00:02:47.980> tricks<00:02:48.450> are<00:02:49.450> you

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
so when you do flip tricks are you

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.170

because i was a little bit curious when
it<00:03:09.249> came<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.549> buying<00:03:09.730> this<00:03:09.879> board<00:03:10.180> because<00:03:10.450> i

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
it came to buying this board because i

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.420 
it came to buying this board because i
heard<00:03:10.870> Carl<00:03:11.409> type<00:03:11.620> bored<00:03:11.799> sucked<00:03:12.540> but<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:14.430> went

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
heard Carl type bored sucked but I went

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.920 
heard Carl type bored sucked but I went
past<00:03:15.549> people's<00:03:15.939> opinions<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:16.540> bought<00:03:16.689> in<00:03:16.810> any

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
past people's opinions and bought in any

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.599 
past people's opinions and bought in any
way<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.530> I'm<00:03:17.980> actually<00:03:18.129> glad<00:03:18.370> I<00:03:18.489> bought<00:03:18.760> it

way and I'm actually glad I bought it
then<00:03:21.609> it'll<00:03:21.819> probably<00:03:22.120> get<00:03:22.329> another<00:03:22.599> scam

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
then it'll probably get another scam

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.899 
then it'll probably get another scam
mental<00:03:23.290> in<00:03:23.409> the<00:03:23.530> future<00:03:23.859> but<00:03:24.459> i'll<00:03:24.609> continue

half the board like on the tail on the

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.959 
half the board like on the tail on the
nose<00:03:37.480> was<00:03:38.079> actually<00:03:38.469> pretty<00:03:38.650> good<00:03:38.889> it<00:03:39.099> still

got<00:03:40.299> most<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:41.109> the<00:03:41.260> pop<00:03:41.469> it<00:03:41.650> had<00:03:41.829> when<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:42.099> was

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:42.219 
got most of the pop it had when it was

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:44.910 
got most of the pop it had when it was
new<00:03:42.519> and<00:03:43.049> once<00:03:44.049> I<00:03:44.139> started<00:03:44.439> skating<00:03:44.590> when<00:03:44.739> to

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
new and once I started skating when to

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.379 
new and once I started skating when to
close<00:03:45.129> it<00:03:45.340> felt<00:03:45.549> like<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:46.230> brand<00:03:47.230> new<00:03:47.290> board<00:03:48.389> so

close it felt like a brand new board so
i<00:03:49.810> highly<00:03:50.170> suggest<00:03:50.319> getting<00:03:50.889> escaped<00:03:51.249> mental
