00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
to play it as much as I used to unless

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.339 
to play it as much as I used to unless
of<00:02:21.030> course<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.329> gets<00:02:21.420> really<00:02:21.660> popular<00:02:22.200> and

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
of course it gets really popular and

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.690 
of course it gets really popular and
everybody<00:02:22.739> starts<00:02:23.010> going<00:02:23.250> back<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.579> it

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
everybody starts going back to it

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.309 
everybody starts going back to it

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
everybody starts trying to hit clips I

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.140 
everybody starts trying to hit clips I
highly<00:02:25.950> doubt<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.430> will<00:02:26.670> happen<00:02:26.700> just

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
highly doubt that that will happen just

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.460 
highly doubt that that will happen just
because<00:02:27.269> of<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.540> fact<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:28.110> lot<00:02:28.349> of<00:02:28.379> people

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
because of the fact that a lot of people

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.130 
because of the fact that a lot of people
really<00:02:29.129> dislike<00:02:29.670> ghosts<00:02:30.180> but<00:02:30.720> yeah<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.019> that
