00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
metal dragon so it's one of the only

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.910 
metal dragon so it's one of the only
maps<00:00:58.149> that<00:00:58.510> is<00:00:58.719> worth<00:00:59.050> running<00:00:59.500> on<00:00:59.800> the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
maps that is worth running on the

maps that is worth running on the
weekends<00:01:00.370> and<00:01:00.460> because<00:01:00.879> of<00:01:01.000> this<00:01:01.180> I<00:01:01.420> wanted<00:01:02.079> to

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
weekends and because of this I wanted to

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.439 
weekends and because of this I wanted to
develop<00:01:02.469> a<00:01:02.680> team<00:01:02.920> that<00:01:03.340> could<00:01:03.609> not

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
develop a team that could not

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.090 
develop a team that could not
necessarily<00:01:04.989> speedrun<00:01:05.560> this<00:01:05.710> dungeon

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
necessarily speedrun this dungeon

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.830 
necessarily speedrun this dungeon
because<00:01:06.250> it's<00:01:06.550> a<00:01:06.640> 10-round<00:01:06.940> dungeon<00:01:07.330> but<00:01:07.540> I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
because it's a 10-round dungeon but I

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.080 
because it's a 10-round dungeon but I
wanted<00:01:08.470> to<00:01:08.530> develop<00:01:09.250> a<00:01:09.430> team<00:01:09.610> that<00:01:09.790> could<00:01:09.940> take

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
wanted to develop a team that could take

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.360 
wanted to develop a team that could take
it<00:01:10.270> out<00:01:10.390> in<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:10.660> least<00:01:10.900> amount<00:01:11.110> of<00:01:11.230> time<00:01:11.440> so

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
it out in the least amount of time so

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.650 
it out in the least amount of time so
I'm<00:01:12.490> sitting<00:01:12.790> here<00:01:12.880> trying<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:13.210> think<00:01:13.300> of<00:01:13.570> a

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
I'm sitting here trying to think of a

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.780 
I'm sitting here trying to think of a
team<00:01:13.900> that<00:01:14.200> can<00:01:14.410> sweep<00:01:14.980> this<00:01:15.160> ocean<00:01:15.490> of<00:01:15.580> heaven

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
team that can sweep this ocean of heaven

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.240 
team that can sweep this ocean of heaven
dungeon<00:01:16.090> really<00:01:16.330> fast<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.860> most<00:01:18.010> obvious

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
dungeon really fast and the most obvious

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.880 
dungeon really fast and the most obvious
answer<00:01:18.970> is<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.900> kuchi<00:01:20.290> balanced<00:01:20.650> team

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
answer is the kuchi balanced team

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.550 
answer is the kuchi balanced team
because<00:01:21.430> this<00:01:22.210> is<00:01:22.360> a<00:01:22.390> team<00:01:22.690> that<00:01:22.720> has<00:01:23.080> an<00:01:23.380> easy

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
because this is a team that has an easy

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.470 
because this is a team that has an easy
time<00:01:23.860> beating<00:01:24.280> ocean<00:01:24.580> of<00:01:24.670> heaven<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.120> it's

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
time beating ocean of heaven and it's

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.990 
time beating ocean of heaven and it's
proven<00:01:25.870> by<00:01:26.050> a<00:01:26.350> lot<00:01:26.800> of<00:01:26.890> people<00:01:27.160> running<00:01:27.670> cute

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
proven by a lot of people running cute

the weekends for this ocean of heaven
dungeon<00:01:35.260> and<00:01:35.470> my<00:01:36.460> problem<00:01:37.090> with<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.630> team<00:01:37.840> is

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
dungeon and my problem with the team is

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.990 
dungeon and my problem with the team is
that<00:01:38.320> whenever<00:01:38.800> I<00:01:38.890> would<00:01:39.190> try<00:01:39.370> to<00:01:39.430> speed<00:01:39.790> roam

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
that whenever I would try to speed roam

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.560 
that whenever I would try to speed roam
the<00:01:40.120> dungeon

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
the dungeon

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.540 
the dungeon
I<00:01:40.600> wouldn't<00:01:41.320> have<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.710> necessary<00:01:41.860> skills

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
I wouldn't have the necessary skills

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.940 
I wouldn't have the necessary skills
charged<00:01:43.150> up<00:01:43.330> in<00:01:43.480> time<00:01:43.690> for<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.170> boss<00:01:44.350> Neptune

charged up in time for the boss Neptune

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.580 
charged up in time for the boss Neptune
so<00:01:45.790> I'm<00:01:46.240> sitting<00:01:46.780> there<00:01:46.810> trying<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.200> think<00:01:47.440> of

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
so I'm sitting there trying to think of

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.760
