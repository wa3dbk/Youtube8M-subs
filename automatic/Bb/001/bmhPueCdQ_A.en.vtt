00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.390
 resources and they threw the house for the 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.670

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.160
 instead of having sweet sprinkles they had 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.710
 gold nuggets and meanwhile there are 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.360

 Bieber is tired and fed up and needs 

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:39.639
