Nick knew Nick would be here just

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.910 
Nick knew Nick would be here just
because<00:00:50.699> you<00:00:50.910> know<00:00:51.690> he<00:00:52.050> was<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.230> team<00:00:52.440> first<00:00:52.710> guy

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
because you know he was a team first guy

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.799 
because you know he was a team first guy
just<00:00:53.250> always<00:00:53.460> did<00:00:53.730> his<00:00:53.820> job<00:00:53.879> every<00:00:54.269> single<00:00:54.629> day

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
just always did his job every single day

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.049 
just always did his job every single day
and<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.590> was<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.769> great<00:00:56.010> leader<00:00:56.190> I've<00:00:56.609> seen<00:00:56.910> these

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
and I was a great leader I've seen these

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.240 
and I was a great leader I've seen these
guys<00:00:57.300> since<00:00:57.750> they<00:00:57.929> were<00:00:57.989> rookies<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.980> didn't

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
guys since they were rookies and didn't

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.000 
guys since they were rookies and didn't
know<00:00:59.340> much<00:00:59.550> I<00:01:00.350> think<00:01:01.350> both<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.559> them<00:01:01.739> are

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
know much I think both of them are

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.479 
know much I think both of them are
similar<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.850> terms<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.179> very<00:01:03.359> genuine<00:01:03.809> and

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
similar in terms of the very genuine and

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.860 
similar in terms of the very genuine and
what<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.790> what<00:01:05.910> you<00:01:06.060> get<00:01:06.270> with<00:01:06.450> them<00:01:06.600> I

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
what you see is what you get with them I

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.540 
what you see is what you get with them I
think<00:01:07.260> these<00:01:07.380> two<00:01:07.620> have<00:01:07.740> been<00:01:07.860> very<00:01:08.100> real<00:01:08.310> from

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
think these two have been very real from

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.160 
think these two have been very real from
the<00:01:08.580> jump<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.270> knew<00:01:09.420> Kevin<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.780> little<00:01:10.050> bit

the jump and I knew Kevin a little bit

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
the jump and I knew Kevin a little bit

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
he's really worked hard to figure out

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.140 
he's really worked hard to figure out
some<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:55.890> other<00:01:56.010> things<00:01:56.100> now<00:01:56.580> as<00:01:56.850> he's

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
some of the other things now as he's

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.970 
some of the other things now as he's
gotten<00:01:57.330> older<00:01:57.480> and<00:01:57.660> I<00:01:58.020> used<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.650> be<00:01:58.800> really

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980
