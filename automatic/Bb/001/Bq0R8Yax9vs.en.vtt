00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.980
 Hello everyone, I’m quiet 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.290
 now show you lenovo s 90 in color 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.670
 Champagne is a goal that is, don't be fooled 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:18.060
 this color is not his now behind the scenes or 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.420
 more precisely the eye on but informally it is a copy 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.220
 iphone 6 at least like this 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.010
 called the country of origin China 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.849
 Well done either in all the same Chinese 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.790
 company 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.860
 it is real it is not a fake of genuine 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.520
 also so you understand it 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.489
 real cool lenovo from 90 though 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.660
 cool I do not know about because all 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.629
 everyone has his own priorities and criteria 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.430
 well no matter shorter let's look at 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.739
 him here he is 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.230
 and the device itself is my ear by the way 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.760
 cold such a plan I'm just from the street 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.760
 on our street plus 5 so up 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:06.060
 cool here further on that we have 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.350
 there is still documentation before quick start 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.479
 guide lenovo limited warranty 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.340
 There is a Russian user manual 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.380
 it pleases further we have an adapter 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.979
 massive enough big so straight 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:28.799
 giving teresa peter dactyl adapter yet 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:32.579
 soup so that we have on 1 and what is on 1 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.299
 amperes up to 5 volts 1 amperes on principle 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.880
 should quickly charge in 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:42.450
 In principle, the length we have lace 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.930
 somewhere meter twenty a little more than a meter 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.700
 it pleases and accordingly I think that 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.070
 we at least got it can 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.140
 get it though of course i am still 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.110
 I tend to have a little lace 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.920
 slightly longer 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:00.250
 and we still have headset headphones 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.210
 The headset is such that they are simple and 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.380
 cute as I understand it without a button 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.440
 answer the call 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.190
 although it is not a button to answer the call but 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.340
 without adjusting the volume damn hard 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.750
 hide I don't want to break 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.430
 okay, you can look like this 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.150
 just look here we have them 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.990
 vacuum nozzles like this 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.980
 I see additional unfortunately yes 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:36.040
 nothing's all empty but that's all that goes 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.530
 included is an usb headset adapter 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.660
 braid and documentation and also 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.350
 directly the device itself from and 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.100
 then i'm looking for a paper clip here that’s not a paper clip 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.860
 is here she is dear dear here she is 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.410
 I don’t know such a violinist with a logo 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.120
 lenovo and no no just the most ordinary 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.160
 no lenovo logo is simple 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.250
 the violinist also goes to the kit well I her 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.010
 I will not use it because I have mine 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.140
 paper clip so my cooked 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.170
 they will not be like that 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:16.180
 disperses and stays directly 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:18.160
 lenovo s 90 well thick enough not 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.890
 thin massive 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.049
 bottom well straight but it painfully reminds 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.860
 iphone now let's show see 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.430
 right really really very much 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.620
 the Chinese are very much decided 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.390
 borrow some ideas 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.100
 volume control power button 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.630
 from the top we go I understand for 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:44.709
 good connection for the antenna here so here 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.900
 the plastic part is yellow like that 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.920
 we have a microphone and a jack for 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.880
 headphone 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.360
 on the left we have it as I understand it for sim cards and 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.510
 slot 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.840
 Well, on the right, yes, there is nothing here 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.840
 all we have written 7 and another sim 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.110
 there are two sim cards as I understand it 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.260
 memory does not expand here at all 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:11.890
 the front of us goes flash 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:15.099
 front and then the speaker and also have 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.850
 us still goes to the front camera and 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:21.970
 sensors at the bottom of the front of us 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.660
 three touch buttons are taken out by the edges 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.780
 screen 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.990
 Well, what I said is similar to the iPhone 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.020
 these two speakers work or not 2 i don't 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.320
 I know that I can not see the microphone 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.450
 one how will it be just under the microphone yes 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.310
 then the microphone is nowhere that is, 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.669
 accordingly, most likely one 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:46.570
 it works and we check it too 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:50.200
 cogs and so on micro usb connector chick 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:54.180
 and such a distinctive design is also in 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:57.250
 principle chinese style iphone 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.850
 lenovo logo flash camera all 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.889
 there is 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.190
 Well, I would not say that it is straight some 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:08.470
 Champagne goal that is, he is less 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:10.150
 as if a goal that is more champagne that is 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.440
 iphone when it is a little bit more 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:17.050
 golden well, basically everything depends on 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.940
 of how you want it to be and under 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.650
 what angle of light are you looking at it 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.289
 if I change now 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:27.729
 some filters on the camera then he 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.349
 there will be a more yellow example now you 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.410
 see yes i mean he became more 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:35.110
 golden so ok i don't like all these 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.840
 I think it would be great 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:41.830
 take a look at it without any 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:45.370
 plenochka although of course everything is important here 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.590
 data let it be stored well here it is 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.340
 maybe let it be and the front 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:56.080
 plenochka too, I do not like it, we 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:57.340
 also remove the dry listen well, right away 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.910
 another phone 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.120
 x that's what you had to do initially 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.990
 immediately friend 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:09.500
 the device firstly of course glass is black 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:12.169
 and gs I think the opposite side too 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.440
 has become more presentable more 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:18.260
 attractive straight general dry 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.780
 friends this design is less 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.419
 interesting device I will tell you yes 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.750
 of course I had to borrow it 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:28.820

 let's look at the review 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.130
 more need to run the battery 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:53.720
 Camera rest then
