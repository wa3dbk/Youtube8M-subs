00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
bit of information and it leads me to

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.810 
bit of information and it leads me to
believe<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.110> rock<00:02:39.010> charts<00:02:39.280> working<00:02:39.610> on<00:02:39.700> the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
believe that rock charts working on the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.820 
believe that rock charts working on the
pc<00:02:40.210> version<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.750> might<00:02:41.230> be<00:02:41.410> porting

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
pc version and might be porting

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.890 
pc version and might be porting
everything<00:02:42.160> over<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.460> ps4<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.180> xbox<00:02:43.810> one

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
everything over to the ps4 and xbox one

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.870 
everything over to the ps4 and xbox one
and<00:02:44.170> that's<00:02:44.950> just<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.190> speculation<00:02:45.430> right<00:02:45.850> now

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
and that's just a speculation right now

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.670 
and that's just a speculation right now
but<00:02:46.030> we're<00:02:46.150> gonna<00:02:46.240> have<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.540> see<00:02:46.750> what<00:02:47.290> ends<00:02:47.650> up

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680
