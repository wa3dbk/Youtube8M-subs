00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.080
 hey people always have a video today 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.790
 I introduce you to some coal activities 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.800
 her company after school so 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.050
 So, from hobbies all the way to 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.840
 any funny things or 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.970
 next job ideas and if you eg in cool 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.350
 has a side job or a big hobby then 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.330
 likes to write it in the comments 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.710
 that would really interest me and 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.110
 Maybe that will inspire you too 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.809
 one or the other and otherwise we lay 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.700
 Now first with the video going on first 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.850
 I have some cool side jobs 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.310
 for you and the first one is flyers resp 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.570
 distribute flyers and I have it recently 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.550
 I also do it myself and I can 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.260
 say that makes so much fun though 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.970
 some people do not have your flyers 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.130
 you want to learn a lot of people 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.829
 know about it and have to 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.120
 overcome people and address her 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.880
 By the way, a little money 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.440
 Earn so definitely there are 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:13.500
 worse Nebenjobs and I think so 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:15.270
 just really fun and cool what 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.520
 we can do at all is tuition 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.840
 I also did that earlier 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.610
 and I can tell you that makes 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.810
 really fun even though you can 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.940
 maybe would not think so 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.220
 but he also learns himself 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.960
 a little something and learn for 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.540
 you guys like other people 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.950
 so you can transfer yes if you 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.190
 something good then can be gladly 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.380
 Tutoring is spice in clothing 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.850
 a great boredom and if you are 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.650
 that makes you really good then you can 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.720
 even make a little money 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.420
 I have such a spiderman here, for example 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.580
 bought a sticker and so easy my 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.200
 jeans are a little spiced up that goes 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.869
 Great people just need an iron 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.549
 and another cloth and then go with the 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.220
 iron a few times over it 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.619
 for about a minute and then 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.840
 is already the sticker on the pants 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.640
 and I think they are really cool 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.130
 from her you can also very cheesy stuff 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.740
 why hello kitty take and you can 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.390
 then your pants, for example, continue to pimp in 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.920
 any cracks or tears 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.460
 make it pure is currently synonymous 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.800
 totally hip 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.940
 rossini 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.890
 Here you can see my finished one 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.500
 result and I really think that the 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.450
 spiderman quite cool detail somehow 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.100
 is and if you then even this 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.380
 Slit a bit more out of French 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.380
 Meurer pants then sees the whole outfit 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.330
 really casual and casual somehow 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.300
 So I like it very well and that 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.209
 is also really comfortable but you can 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.860
 I also pimp hats for example 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.380
 always happy with earrings for 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.030
 example, this is also very easy and easy 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.560
 looks really cool from unfortunately the 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.900
 joke here still such a white poodle 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.390
 but otherwise I like that really well 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.640
 and you can do so much with it or 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.380
 just start blogging or 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.970
 youtube if you're bored you guys 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.739
 actually only needs one 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.440
 reasonably good camera this is for 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.180
 example the sony alpha 5100 things me 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.160
 always on my blog channel or the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.080
 know her 70 I take for mine 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.940
 then you only need other videos 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.670
 an area of ​​interest such as 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.310
 beauty or fake or even travel 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.810
 sports gaming and then you just have to 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.360
 still in the net and can you 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.080
 Always think new ideas and do it 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.459
 really great fun with the 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.410
 next thing you can unfortunately no 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.510
 but earn money if your room 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.000
 at least it looks tidy 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.040
 and he feels much more comfortable 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.239
 At home I like it a lot 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.400
 I myself just maybe another one 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.230
 buy some flowers and those in mine 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.030
 flat place or just that 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.920
 wash dishes what else they always do 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.330
 to push and then stromrechnung much 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.329
 better and you have time 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.160
 Killed new dishes to cook 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.680
 I try that too lately 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.720
 more often if it is really fun 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.420
 and it also a little bit to learn 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.810
 I have been using coconut milk recently and 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.310
 zucchini and tofu me such a curry 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.380
 cooked there you need one more 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.720
 bit of tomato paste for and 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.720
 logically then also corrie 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.970
 and then you just mix it up 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.200
 a bit and leave that for a few 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.660
 minutes cooking I still have it there 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.120
 glass noodles added and already have 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.590
 her a super delicious food and that 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.720
 I have never cooked before and came 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.970
 because somehow not on it but that 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.370
 Tastes really delicious and it always does 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.600
 good something new to try and the 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.120
 last thing I do against you 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.830
 recommend boredom is picnicking 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.170
 especially when the weather is nice outside 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.220
 it is just very pleasant and 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.930
 relaxing 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.230
 you just have to do a few things 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.600
 to prepare like candy salads 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.940
 any breads there are various 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.830
 recipes that you can easily make and 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.330
 somewhere you can take it with it 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.220
 Of course always delicious and then 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.630
 all you need is some girlfriend 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.150
 and then you sit down for example like 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.100
 me to the aachener weiher in cologne that 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.200
 is always really cool there and then you can 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.170
 in the evening or at noon there completely 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.420
