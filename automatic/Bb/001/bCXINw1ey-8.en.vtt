functionality of how the car works the
journey<00:01:18.260> started<00:01:18.830> early<00:01:19.400> on<00:01:19.610> with<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:19.850> mules

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
journey started early on with the mules

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.720 
journey started early on with the mules
and<00:01:20.300> we<00:01:20.510> did<00:01:20.690> testing<00:01:21.260> in<00:01:21.440> in<00:01:21.800> New<00:01:22.040> Zealand<00:01:22.400> as

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
and we did testing in in New Zealand as

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.880 
and we did testing in in New Zealand as
well<00:01:22.790> as<00:01:23.030> some<00:01:23.180> testing<00:01:23.540> in<00:01:23.660> Europe<00:01:24.200> officer

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
well as some testing in Europe officer

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.650 
well as some testing in Europe officer
that<00:01:25.010> was<00:01:25.160> from<00:01:25.400> our<00:01:25.729> perspective<00:01:26.450> to<00:01:26.479> get

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
that was from our perspective to get

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.510 
that was from our perspective to get
ready<00:01:26.900> for<00:01:27.110> someone<00:01:27.560> workstream<00:01:28.190> cold

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
ready for someone workstream cold

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.000 
ready for someone workstream cold
climate<00:01:28.940> testing<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:29.690> sweet<00:01:29.930> we're<00:01:30.860> also

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
climate testing and sweet we're also

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.080 
climate testing and sweet we're also
doing<00:01:31.220> hot<00:01:31.460> pilot<00:01:31.790> testing<00:01:32.180> in<00:01:32.300> in<00:01:32.540> Arizona

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
doing hot pilot testing in in Arizona

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.340 
doing hot pilot testing in in Arizona
everyone<00:01:35.090> call<00:01:35.240> it<00:01:35.390> torture<00:01:35.570> testing<00:01:36.140> but

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
everyone call it torture testing but

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.950 
everyone call it torture testing but
it's<00:01:36.650> really<00:01:36.920> testing<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.340> functionality<00:01:38.210> at

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
it's really testing the functionality at

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.480 
it's really testing the functionality at
the<00:01:39.080> edges<00:01:39.350> of<00:01:39.500> its<00:01:39.650> of<00:01:39.979> its<00:01:40.160> designed

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
the edges of its of its designed

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.660 
the edges of its of its designed
tolerance<00:01:41.950> specifically<00:01:42.950> in<00:01:43.040> China<00:01:43.280> we<00:01:43.490> know

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
tolerance specifically in China we know

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.210 
tolerance specifically in China we know
a<00:01:43.940> lot<00:01:44.210> of<00:01:44.330> very<00:01:44.509> unique<00:01:44.720> road<00:01:45.650> conditions

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
a lot of very unique road conditions

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.040 
a lot of very unique road conditions
some<00:01:46.880> of<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.030> highest<00:01:47.360> roads<00:01:47.600> in<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:47.869> world

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
some of the highest roads in the world

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.600 
some of the highest roads in the world
so<00:01:48.710> this<00:01:48.830> is<00:01:48.979> where<00:01:49.130> we<00:01:49.220> actually<00:01:49.310> do<00:01:49.580> our

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
so this is where we actually do our

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.160 
so this is where we actually do our
altitude<00:01:50.000> sign-off<00:01:50.509> globally<00:01:50.960> for<00:01:51.110> the

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
altitude sign-off globally for the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.670 
altitude sign-off globally for the
vehicle<00:01:51.530> as<00:01:51.619> well<00:01:52.960> and<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.050> data<00:01:54.259> that<00:01:54.440> we<00:01:54.530> get

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
vehicle as well and the data that we get

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.440 
vehicle as well and the data that we get
from<00:01:54.860> testing<00:01:55.340> I<00:01:55.460> mean<00:01:55.729> it's<00:01:55.940> crunched<00:01:56.330> in

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
from testing I mean it's crunched in

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.050 
from testing I mean it's crunched in
many<00:01:56.720> different<00:01:57.080> ways<00:01:57.200> as<00:01:57.860> a<00:01:57.920> company<00:01:58.430> we<00:01:58.880> have

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
many different ways as a company we have

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.330 
many different ways as a company we have
more<00:01:59.330> than<00:01:59.450> ever<00:01:59.600> learnt<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:00.380> use<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:01.009> data<00:02:01.190> we

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
more than ever learnt to use the data we

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.859 
more than ever learnt to use the data we
get<00:02:01.490> back<00:02:01.700> from<00:02:01.880> testing<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.570> make<00:02:02.720> our

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
get back from testing to make our
