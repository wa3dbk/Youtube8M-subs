here I went down at Trader Joe's and I
got<00:00:49.410> some<00:00:49.680> reduced<00:00:50.309> fat<00:00:50.610> buttermilk<00:00:51.090> now<00:00:51.780> this

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
got some reduced fat buttermilk now this

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.000 
got some reduced fat buttermilk now this
is<00:00:53.149> cultured<00:00:54.149> buttermilk<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:55.170> have<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.829> have

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
is cultured buttermilk you have to have

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.819 
is cultured buttermilk you have to have
live<00:00:57.000> cultures<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.809> there<00:00:58.020> let's<00:00:58.469> get<00:00:58.649> some

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
live cultures in there let's get some

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.369 
live cultures in there let's get some
focus<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.719> so<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.809> got<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.020> have<00:01:01.140> some

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
focus on that so you got to have some

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.719 
focus on that so you got to have some
live<00:01:02.190> cultures<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.350> cultured<00:01:04.350> buttermilk<00:01:04.739> and

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
live cultures in cultured buttermilk and

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.070 
live cultures in cultured buttermilk and
then<00:01:06.659> some<00:01:07.970> heavy<00:01:08.970> whipping<00:01:09.090> cream<00:01:09.299> now

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
then some heavy whipping cream now

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.500 
then some heavy whipping cream now
what's<00:01:10.350> really<00:01:10.770> key<00:01:11.130> about<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.880> right

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
what's really key about this is right

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.929 
what's really key about this is right
here<00:01:12.780> where<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.080> says<00:01:13.580> pasteurized

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
here where it says pasteurized

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.140 
here where it says pasteurized
it<00:01:15.060> doesn't<00:01:15.479> say<00:01:15.659> ultra<00:01:16.350> pasteurized<00:01:17.060> let<00:01:18.060> me

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
it doesn't say ultra pasteurized let me

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.570 
it doesn't say ultra pasteurized let me
show<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.380> some<00:01:19.650> here<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.369> is

show you that I have some here that is

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.440 
show you that I have some here that is
ultra<00:01:21.509> pasteurized<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.970> this<00:01:23.970> stuff<00:01:24.210> comes

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
to use because that won't work the whole

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.940 
to use because that won't work the whole
chemical<00:01:33.420> reaction<00:01:34.020> thing<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:34.770> actually

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
chemical reaction thing it's actually

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.679 
chemical reaction thing it's actually
not<00:01:35.280> really<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.579> chemical<00:01:36.000> reaction<00:01:36.270> what<00:01:36.570> it

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
not really a chemical reaction what it

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.870 
not really a chemical reaction what it
is<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.650> heavy<00:01:37.890> whipping<00:01:38.130> cream<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.700> take

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
is is the heavy whipping cream you take

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.120 
is is the heavy whipping cream you take
two<00:01:39.119> cups<00:01:39.390> which<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> 16<00:01:40.650> fluid<00:01:40.979> ounce

you know you can use you don't have to
use<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> reduced<00:01:50.070> fat<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.579> has<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.820> be

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
use a reduced fat but it has to be

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.780
