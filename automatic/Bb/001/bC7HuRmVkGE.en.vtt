00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.030
 carlos ghosn good evening welcome to the club 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.589
 science po tv then you were born at 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.269
 brazil you lived in lebanon of 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.289
 do your studies in France knew 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.030
 working in the united states were doing 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:18.060
 work in japan you feel more 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.349
 close to what country of all me I am 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.939
 meaning I feel comfortable in all these 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:25.080
 countries there must not think that because 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.929
 we lived in several countries there are 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.070
 which is preferred actually me these are 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.490
 rather cities to which I am 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.600
 attached 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.460
 rio de janeiro beirut paris tokyo 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.020
 green villa in the united states these are 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.940
 cities where I lived I have many friends 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.860
 and so today I have no 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.160
 preferably I like myself in all these 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.360
 cities 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.960
 it's more difficult boss in France 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.950
 that elsewhere it's different I can not 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.180
 to say it's harder 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.230
 I think it's different be not 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.940
 too much in France it's not the same thing 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.170
 that being a boss in japan is not the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.000
 same thing besides four bosses to 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.860
 united states these are these are three types 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.150
 of two I would say of commitment 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.590
 different what are you 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.300
 most proud to have accomplished during your 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.500
 career 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.760
 well, listen, we're always very proud 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.260
 to have accomplished something that 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.970
 nobody is challenging you one and in this 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.060
 case there is certainly the rebirth 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.950
 of nissan and 1 defeat accomplished am 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.210
 also proud to have contributed to 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.280
 reinforcement of renault to 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.010
 renault enrichment at the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.600
 globalization of renault sas is 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.980
 probably less visible but it's 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.120
 will see more and more in the future 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.500
 some say that you occupy 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.909
 maybe more nissan than renault 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.350
 I think of the bosses the cfdt by 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.110
 example laurent berger or answer it 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.520
 what but that's that that I think these are 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.380
 things that are more like lawsuits 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.979
 of intention am responsible for two 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.630
 business 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.430
 I also take care of both 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.820
 companies and I love as much as one that 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.680
 the other 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.810
 he enrolls at a salary level 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.820
 maximum for the bosses of the cac 40 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.830
 Oh well, I think it's more like 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.659
 legislator to decide what kind of 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.190
 things is to do it by 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.440
 intermediary including taxation 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.630
 I think that by taxation there is a 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.580
 leveling of compensation must 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.110
 let the companies decide what 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.180
 that they want to decide and behind 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.070
 correct what governments want 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.570
 to correct in particular by taxation and 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.210
 arnaud montebourg pierre moscovici who 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.320
 call you to lower your salary 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.940
 that they believe to be elected millions 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.860
 euros you answer them what in 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.450
 general a corporate boss does quote 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.869
 not his salary otherwise it would be too much 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.159
 easy 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.129
 it's the board of directors that 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:16.230
 decide salary of the boss of the mac in 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.010
 business with that is something else there 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.269
 it is necessary first that the council 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.630
 decided to then after 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.700
 you will see 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.370
 there is no social plan and there is no 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.380
 no there is no machined closing 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.880
 what we are dealing with these are 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.550
 problems essentially of 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.110
 competitiveness and if we want 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.420
 actually continue to increase 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.820
 our production and prosper in 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.770
 france landwell sure that the made in 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.330
 France is competitive and that's what 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.410
 we address in the plan that is 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.820
 besides in full negotiation 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.470
 today with organizations and 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.910
 employees who protest against this 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.620
 plan where you answer them what 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.820
 listen I think that when there are 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.230
 negotiations there is always a little bit of 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.430
 manifestations there are pressures from 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.740
 on both sides what seems to me 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.020
 important is that the negotiation is 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.670
 in good faith between different 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.190
 partners who are driven by the same 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.870
 by the same goal which is that of the 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.300
 of strength and corporate energy 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.010
 lighter question you ride in 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.150
 weekend car quest at least 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.230
 virulent several cars that's 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.700
 maybe one of the privileges of 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.710
 bosses of car manufacturers 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.060
 is that in general to use 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.090
 different cars virtually all 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.740
 three other favorite games then in 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.820
 France I like the vel satis because 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.960
 we are very well sitting 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.160
 the back and it's very special 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.160
 thank you very much carlos ghosn
