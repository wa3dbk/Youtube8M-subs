00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
trick is to always look in front and

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.210 
trick is to always look in front and
never<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.690> turn<00:02:58.870> around<00:02:59.260> I<00:02:59.500> think<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.980> trick

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
never to turn around I think the trick

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.130 
never to turn around I think the trick
is<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.400> fucking<00:03:00.820> look<00:03:00.970> in<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.210> forest<00:03:01.660> is<00:03:01.900> what

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
I think the dumbest thing ever is to

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.769 
I think the dumbest thing ever is to
look<00:06:43.599> behind<00:06:43.810> you<00:06:44.169> in<00:06:44.319> this<00:06:44.439> game<00:06:44.650> oh<00:06:45.120> is<00:06:46.120> that

00:06:48.769 --> 00:06:48.779
