 how our car of hers commented on 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.040
 good reasons for you to play 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.200
 souto storm 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.269
 here are some tips to play with 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.380
 some of the most peculiar characters 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.480
 about the game 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.610
 the act is a very different character from the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.410
 that you are accustomed to rather than 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.590
 together with other allies 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.990
 this series minhocÃ£o gets away or 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.060
 hidden standing in place controlling 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.430
 Far-away battlefield it produces 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.800
 grasshoppers to help in the lenses places 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.750
 mines of poison and can still be shaped 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.640
 with an ally giving him powers like 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.870
 shield a shot from a distance and a 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.880
 burst of barbs 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.710
 you can even come close to the base 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.200
 enemy with its moving power and 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.649
 if they mixed up lackey to push a law 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.530
 faster new is not yours sign 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.780
 standard is very weak in attacking lackeys is 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.000
 very bad for solar mercenaries dies with 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.010
 extreme ease but because of 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.680
 his constant invisibility direct damage 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.260
 very high it is the best finisher of the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.270
 game when play of new concentrate 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.920
 walking around the map bringing 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.570
 information from your team 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.540
 confused by them with clone and 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.710
 looking for unsuspecting foes 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.270
 especially those with little life to those 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.790
 who are fleeing and put a point 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.010
 end in their existence with a bullet 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.110
 in the middle of the face 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.850
 but the face is a specialist well 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.430
 interesting also one of the best 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.470
 characters to plot mercenaries and even 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.450
 even heroes enemies your powers 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.490
 call creatures follows as cockroaches 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.670
 hydraulics or fine for 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.729
 Destroy waves, minions, strong towers 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.110
 enemies and depending on your talents 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.759
 massacre heroes in one against one 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.250
 just remember to use your 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.079
 specialization of spreading goo always 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.630
 possible but now it moves more 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.750
 quickly regenerates more life and 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.399
 vision for all your friends 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.409
 the marquinhos the specialist well 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.899
 weird he is the hero with less life 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.299
 of all and so the most super fast 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.009
 but if his egg is whole he 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.990
 will be back in five seconds to 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.390
 continue to infer the life of the team 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.640
 opponent the egg is the key to play 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.680
 with it if you know how to position well on the map 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.930
 will cause a good headache 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.179
 for all the opponents because with him 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.520
 around you come back very fast to 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.120
 the goals or you can push a 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.290
 law n 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.840
 or even attack 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.329
 mind the enemy base depending on the 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.180
 talents it can cause damage and even 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:25.459
 solar heroes so do not underestimate him 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.459
 You can take a shark beating. 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.709
 finally the lost Vikings have a 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.450
 unique mechanics since it is not only a 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.220
 Hero but three 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.230
 You can leave it there together to 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.859
 increase the damage or use what they have 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.900
 of the best 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.879
 the capacity is in several places of the 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.010
 map at the same time as player has the 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.389
 option to control it separately if 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.549
 can use one to help the team in 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:49.379
 goals while using others to 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.540
 get more experience and with that 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.129
 achieved a good advantage but did not 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.439
 forget to pay attention to the 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.439
 all because they die super easy
