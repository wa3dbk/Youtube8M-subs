 Y 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.860
 hello friends friends welcome to me 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.300
 channel tutorials apm 81 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.310
 In this tutorial today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.210
 pass the games of the play to a disc 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.429
 external hard 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.169
 well let's go to it and to do this 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.260
 tutorial I will use a flash drive 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:34.350
 usb 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.610
 good to tell you that the unit can be 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.270
 also a hard drive that gives exactly 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.650
 same and it's the same process and good for 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.120
 do this tutorial so that the play or 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.270
 recognize the hard drive or the drive 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.260
 flash has to be alpha 32 form 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.629
 for it to know if you have it in 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.400
 fat32 or located above the unit pulses 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.890
 the right button and you give here to 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.899
 properties 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.970
 and will put file systems and here you will see 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.670
 what system do you have, I say you have to 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.470
 be for 32 if they are not 32 you click 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.659
 right on the unit and the dehesa 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:07.770
 formatting choose 32 6 good said this 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.320
 we open the unit 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.329
 and we created a folder here that is the one 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.979
 will recognize the play in our 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.799
 good games the play more than the play the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.760
 multi bad the folder can be called 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.400
 game or game with zeta 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.920
 but the new multi man recognizes it as 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.970
 game if I did not recognize you put it as 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.970
 with zeta 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.860
 you put it with dinner 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.450
 no matter how it works in the two ways I 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.750
 proven and it works at least in the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.060
 multi mandela version 4.20 a in 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.829
 ahead 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.240
 well we have created this folder and 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.560
 this is where the games will go 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.500
 simple 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.390
 then you have the game 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.700
 for example let's pass this 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.150
 When you unzip it, you will have one 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.420
 folder so to be so that with a 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.070
 this is the idea of ​​the game 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.490
 to know the idea of ​​the game if not what 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.530
 you have 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.250
 You can open this file with notepad 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.450
 notes you say edit 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:10.330
 and notice that here the title is 00 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.970
 461 then you could rename the 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.770
 folder and put it and you can put the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.720
 name of the game to know what game is 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.490
 when you have it on the hard drive and 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.770
 I can decide what I'm going to erase, I'm going to 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.570
 do whatever it is knowing that you play and 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.220
 it's very easy to pick up the folder 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:29.010
 that has the idea of ​​the game the vélez or 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.010
 even as the idea and drag it 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.150
 once we have passed the game to 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.930
 our external hard drive or pendrive or 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.140
 pen drive 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.190
 we go here to the games tab and 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.190
 we enter the multi man 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.190
 good for you to see is going to enter the 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.080
 file manager 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.410
 and I'm going to show you that I have it here in 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.410
 The pen drive 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.280
 here in the root unit as you see it puts 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.520
 here 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.670
 usb 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:13.870
 and here is the game folder and here it is 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:17.440
 the good skate once we have it 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.020
 let's go here if the game does not appear 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.080
 that we have introduced 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.180
 we can click here to update 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.130
 but good content and should 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.430
 get out 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.000
 as you see here we have it and we load it 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.000
 for something you see 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.010
 good as you see I had to install it 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.650
 for which you have been able to see first 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.180
 hand that was on the usb hard drive and 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.740
 nothing good I have to comment something 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.510
 very important about the file system 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.550
 fat32 and is that it has a drawback 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.710
 very big the truth is that I 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.540
 I recommend that if you want to change the 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.340
 internal hard disk of the pre- distension 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.830
 I have a tutorial so you can see how it works 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.230
 it is quite simple for another greater 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.810
 that supports up to one terabyte 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.090
 and good the problem that has the fa 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.190
 32 is that it does not support larger files than 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.810
 4 gigas what does this mean that although 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.820
 let's have a 2 terabyte hard drive 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.290
 For example, it will only be useful for 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.630
 store the games because we can not 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.460
 play through with files larger than 4 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.620
 gigas well I'm going to make you a 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.550
 show for example you have seen 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.139
 that the game that I put skateboarding 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.280
 do not have any file greater than 4 gigabytes 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.160
 that's why he has not given me any problems and 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.280
 we could execute it but well look 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.810
 this is the one with the glasses and it's dominated 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.660
 through the folders and I've seen that he had 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.320
 files larger than 4 gigs for example 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.690
 look at this 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.020
 has 10 gigs now now you are going to see the 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.940
 try the pendrive this I have 14 arrive 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.950
 free as you can can fit 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.580
 quietly the 10 gigas and I'm going to 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.050
 drag to see here is what happens 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.610
 note that says the file is 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.860
 too big for the system 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.710
 destination files this is what is 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.530
 explained the ones that you think that with the opel 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.289
 split can be split and then power 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.689
 playing is not like that because I already tell you the fat 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.729
 32 will never support a larger file 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:19.949
 4 gigas you can fill the disk but 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.229
 you can never have a file greater than 4 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:26.800
 gigas if this file instead of 10 gigas 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:29.020
 they were 399 with fit and could play 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.879
 and well so far the tutorial of 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.979
 today I hope you liked it and if you 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:35.400
 He likes to give one like and subscribe 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.400
 greeting friends 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.500
 I had not tried it and I feel like it 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.500
 to try them 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.460
 it has good graphics but this for 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.800
 move is a fucking shit like 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:55.770
 pick up speed with the X not now 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.770
 We are looking for I am liking 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.250
 for lack of work 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.910
 of your baby 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.020
 now 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.910
 saintly 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.910
 with the right bat 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.169
 what happens 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:24.430
 the monkey bunch I recommend it 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:24.430
 for example
