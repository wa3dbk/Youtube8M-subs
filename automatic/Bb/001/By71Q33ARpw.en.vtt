00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.080
 roj 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.829
 the trainer would be a cute at all costs 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:12.829
 tonight the two ajax team opposite each other what do you expect from that 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.630
 yes I think it was a nice first to see how fresh and beautiful yesterday 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.179
 still playing summer flowers against the large rowing boat 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.160
 and yes what do I expect one of the prisoners to be more fun what it is game 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.869
 will become 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.099
 all those against the smaller brother 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.339
 where you 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.679
 but were asked if there is still a contest the will spruce up 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:36.210
 signed Saturday fine saying 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.390
 its a number of guys i also count the van drivers that the ones we do one 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.030
 number of boys who come to us more than play can therefore be nice 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.020
 what to do rhythm so ideal actually how do you prepare your team for one 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.570
 match against ajax 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.430
 yes as usual mean 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.920
 We are not going to do crazy things because we happen to be competing against young Ajax 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.530
 take 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.680
 just the normal way one 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.050
 but on the other hand, going for us is also a good practice match 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.260
 to the next one stately later can lower boys 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.690
 those fighters against relegation 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.520
 yes what do you expect from the end of being 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.610
 yes we play six matches as positive look then there are three points 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.840
 in a safe place 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.660
 and that's how it should look 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.790
 it is that is mainly still as possible and 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.770
 yes we have to 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.550
 and we're just going to work 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.730
 alien jong nec plays monday against young sparta 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.730
 you are in the race to become a champion good papers for that 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.410
 to what extent is this a power measurement in between 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.850
 except 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.000
 This is just a practice match I had already indicated where the player is sitting on 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.979
 pure can do in that is why it is now our competition to enter 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.729
 So the tension might be around the first time they played the we can 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.710
 fight each other but this is just a white farm for us 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.700
 contest 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.070
 what I already indicate 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.720
 good prospects for waste was rolled up 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.090
 different for both teams 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.400
 yes but we will 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.110
 we will help them in the saddle and that is gaining some confidence plan 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.570
 hopefully 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.960
 ali finally play in your team k3 jan display and jan arie van der heijden 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.100
 those are now players who come back from injury tests on playing minutes 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.710
 definitely says something about it 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.060
 where johan leysen with a week back in full training so you will take half 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.590
 play game young boys I have a whole game play but it is 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.359
 edges of seeing how everything goes 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:19.239
 the show everything can be played a whole game all those years played in between 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.239
 to be 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.329
 the 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.319
 Hey 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.319
 Hey 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:06.089
 Hey 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:09.089
 Oh yeah 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.169
 you can use 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.119
 another half game in the legs that was a long time ago 

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:50.349
 Yes that's right 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.349
 the city last month less so the big work 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.899
 the turks sustained knee injury 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.689
 bouba the last assume the for you 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.979
 at first it seemed like it wasn't that heavy but in the end it was 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:06.489
 lasted back month and 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.859
 yes it was tough times sometimes it was the most difficult circumstances 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:13.249
 the portraits of still fixed 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:16.329
 in the end it turned out to be fine the first best friend 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.789
 a bit anxious inside the ring 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.180
 yes i think you can take it from 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.990
 at the last match in it was such a n 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.290
 the municipality of almere does not but it will eventually make up for it 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.289
 in addition, nothing was wrong 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.449
 Toby 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.210
 were arrested 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.210
 8 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.449
 This is particularly the case with the loss of young Ajax in the second half 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:19.309
 well absolutely not i think u 

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:23.589
 actually giving goals too easy, yes, such a quality of course 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:24.379
 from 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:28.479
 from young ajax who actually is a step faster and that kind 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.740
 things trader that is yes and then 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.789
 do you know if you do not pay attention for a moment and then go against two goals 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:34.889
 gets 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.749
 yes we are in the break with 3 0 behind 

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:41.159
 a very good goal from one out and two freebies 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:43.839
 and after that we also really start to mind after twenty minutes 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:48.219
 well the key the ball rolled good rescues had mail that you want too 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:50.259
 in the three countries where amy must be but 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.600
 it is known that of course not this quality has won 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.569
 apparently there is in advance 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:00.120
 previously thought getting used to it quickly 3 0 it was not about this is quite 

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:03.399
 they will be difficult this is missing this may be a fall is a happy one 

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:04.619
 we could ask ourselves 

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:08.779
 that we want to be able to get used to the terrain quickly at the fast pace that is on the 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.389
 young ajax van plays with a lot of quality 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:15.110
 yes and then the top not only give it a hold back but one could have a small one 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.659
 a bit with his teammates 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:18.830
 you only play sparta 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.749
 that is set aside 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:22.099
 well that 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:25.919
 that sir yet we don't have four games to go in 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:28.249
 we are seven points ahead 

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:29.659
 that the light of 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:33.229
 if she is going to lose our experiences on the list of points it looks quite 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:36.209
 good work for us but we are not there yet so we just have to 

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:37.599
 screens lower until then 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:38.550
 finally his 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.830
 the big one bumped into the little brother this match you know what that 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.330
 concerned 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:49.400
 yes that brought that it is nice to be against with both teams against 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.659
 playing soccer to each other 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:52.399
 and 

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:55.429
 all of them play young ajax against nando big league yes why not 

00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:58.809
 meet Ajax and luckily don't have that confidence at all 

00:06:58.809 --> 00:07:02.209
 the shame that it has become a decline that has become affectionate 

00:07:02.209 --> 00:07:03.740
 it has become a competition 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.150
 that has brought and I hope it is for stocks of parys 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:11.710
 back from an injury 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.800
 yes with the injury well 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.119
 displayed game can always be better and 

00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:19.469
 Japan is one of the ten Vandenbussche men that I am no longer bothered with 

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:22.469
 an exciting one so far is now doing the best 

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:27.279
 yes I have the rich groups of statues in bed 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.849
 much smaller and smaller 

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:33.029
 with all this match against plays it was nice weather and the circumstances 

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:34.369
 were fine 

00:07:34.369 --> 00:07:37.719
 yes you have to what football how do you see their real estate in the coming weeks 

00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:40.550
 both groups a baby lies without pain 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.830
 yes I do take a few days to install it 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.330
 yes there Sunday I don't know I have I am not talking about life and the 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.400
 trainers and I hope to be there with my part can contribute to the 

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.589
 matches 

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:53.719
 That is not the case a week earlier from the competition
