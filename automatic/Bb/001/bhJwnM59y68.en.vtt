00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.120
 0e tv all the high-tech news 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.099
 thank you for being with us as every day 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.990
 and today we are at the party 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.820
 launching a new leica and that's 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.920
 always an evening event in large 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.350
 pump gÃ©romin it's dancing it's singing it's 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.640
 cool is the layman atheist the new 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.010
 compact digital lens 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.630
 interchangeable from this great brand 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.080
 prestigious and you will see that that 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.080
 unleash passions 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.610
 if we had to summarize the upstream quests 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.910
 to say apple simply why 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.930
 apple because on the exterior design 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.300
 clearly an apple product because a 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.790
 famous mixture of aluminum ice cream 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.930
 call me adore then presented we have a 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.420
 screen that is acquired during the entire 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.059
 back side with a black anne side 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.020
 glossy we have a unibody shell which is the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.870
 trademark of industrial design 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.430
 apple that has been taken here and we have 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.399
 also an interesting positioning on 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.809
 the price that may interest luxury as 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.850
 chemical sensors and a tariff 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.070
 premium like apple does it today 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.030
 and so in fact we are left with 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.159
 a device that is in a philosophy 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.600
 very close to that of the apple 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.680
 because if we look inside and 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.360
 components that are known and 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.400
 shared by other brands just like 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.470
 does it apple and aprilia a dough and 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.549
 integration that cases I think is going 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.650
 try to work as much as possible 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.360
 in fact we buy a leica as we 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.950
 buy a rolex it's a point of view 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.450
 we do not buy a watch at 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.490
 night lights we do not buy a device 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.560
 photo we buy with yeah in bulk if 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.380
 you do not have the cases at 50 you are you are a 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.340
 looser what's that but it's 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.690
 true that it is a luxury product in 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.860
 made 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.960
 which sells very well in China 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.900
 besides, but the Chinese love by 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.760
 example have a cases around the neck 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.290
 with the louis vuitton bag and it's up to 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.760
 to say that now it is necessary to have 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.140
 a case on oneself even if one makes a 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.860
 picture with even if it is used 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.200
 exactly 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.480
 despite this there is always the very strong 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.090
 purist community of eca east 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.530
 as they say but who have a little trouble 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.230
 every time with the change and have 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.240
 hard to digest the transition to digital 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.320
 and there not sure that this new model their 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.150
 like it but that's when there is 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.410
 change they are not happy then 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.360
 the basic crates that scream at the 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.950
 betrayal of something that's of 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.470
 low the first action so this is 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.179
 true that the lakers who wanted a m in 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.440
 smaller and cheaper are for 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.940
 their costs since suddenly it's not m 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.280
 it's not the same sensor it's a full 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.780
 format it's not the same mount there 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.920
 will have a there will be a bridge between 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.000
 two old debate that will allow 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.530
 to adapt optics but overall 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.690
 this week it's another device 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.130
 on the other hand the fsa is interesting it is 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.900
 that I think it can be a good 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.730
 second case point the wine merchants and 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.230
 for them then its 1500 euros the case 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.950
 which is a substantial sum but 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.900
 point the cabistes 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.940
 it's almost an affair today 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.350
 who can live only with 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.820
 the silver film on the contrary it would have been 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.580
 too old fashion and we had taken a 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.140
 crucial turn and matmar happily 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.970
 deadly if we had focused and only 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.100
 on hard of a light on the film 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.290
 forgiveness the digital was inescapable 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.670
 and today we are very well 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.870
 and we are recognized and the proof we are 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.150
 present you something 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.920
 extremely early so everything is fine 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.840
 I come for Catholics ya 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.740
 actually you said it to a 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.360
 time we almost passed 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.860
 we almost missed the transition to 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.790
 digital but I insist that we 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.560
 was still the first to launch 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.660
 digital boxes 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.640
 already at the time and that's something 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.700
 that we quickly forgot today what 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.690
 I will tell people who are dissatisfied 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.640
 we continue to make boxes 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.810
 film so do not hesitate to buy 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.340
 silver-plated cameras because we are 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.800
 the last of the mohicans and we continue 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.330
 to make cases that it is the m7 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.010
 the countries are argentic so we have 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.480
 always silver casings for 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.130
 all those who want to continue doing 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.180
 of film and we have a case that 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.490
 is extraordinary called the ix 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:32.320
 monochrome that has it all wings and 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.860
 the ease of use of a housing 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.150
 digital 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.890
 but as its name indicates 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.840
 monochrome so it's only black and 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.090
 white but you have all the rendering 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.800
 the piquet of argentic but with 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.940
 all the facilities of the digital so 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.170
 still cqfd 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.400
 everyone can find his account 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.200
 at dalkia at our level are there 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.980
 that's it for this leica you are so his 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.740
 debut of history 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.090
 the test soon on 01net tv a test that 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.660
 is highly anticipated we find ourselves very 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.660
 hello to everyone
