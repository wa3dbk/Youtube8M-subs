00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
works well for this these for this

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.130 
works well for this these for this
headphone<00:03:05.250> would<00:03:05.550> be<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:06.180> weight<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.660> it

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
headphone would be the weight of it

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.860 
headphone would be the weight of it
I<00:03:07.170> don't<00:03:07.680> believe<00:03:07.920> just<00:03:08.460> by<00:03:08.550> looking<00:03:08.880> at<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.300> it

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
I don't believe just by looking at it it

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.080 
I don't believe just by looking at it it
would<00:03:10.110> be<00:03:10.260> very<00:03:10.410> very<00:03:10.830> evident<00:03:11.310> but<00:03:11.790> the

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
would be very very evident but the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.540 
would be very very evident but the
weight<00:03:12.390> of<00:03:12.600> this<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:13.020> only<00:03:13.200> three<00:03:13.590> grams<00:03:13.920> but

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
weight of this is only three grams but

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.240 
weight of this is only three grams but
it's<00:03:14.760> not<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.120> weight<00:03:15.330> on<00:03:16.050> paper<00:03:16.530> it's<00:03:16.890> how<00:03:17.070> it

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
it's not the weight on paper it's how it

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.040 
it's not the weight on paper it's how it
feels<00:03:17.550> in<00:03:17.730> your<00:03:17.760> ears<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.360> believe<00:03:18.870> it's

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
feels in your ears I believe it's

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.380 
feels in your ears I believe it's
because<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.740> plastic<00:03:20.340> construction<00:03:20.580> or

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
because of the plastic construction or

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.600 
because of the plastic construction or
something<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.320> do<00:03:22.500> with<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.800> but<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.280> feels

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
something to do with it but it feels

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.880 
something to do with it but it feels
really<00:03:24.060> lightweight<00:03:24.480> it's<00:03:25.020> it<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.650> so

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
really lightweight it's it is so

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.460 
really lightweight it's it is so
lightweight<00:03:26.400> that<00:03:26.810> you<00:03:27.810> feel<00:03:28.110> that<00:03:28.350> you're

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
lightweight that you feel that you're

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.350 
lightweight that you feel that you're
not<00:03:28.590> wearing<00:03:28.830> anything<00:03:29.250> in<00:03:29.790> your<00:03:30.030> ears<00:03:30.270> that

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
not wearing anything in your ears that

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.260 
not wearing anything in your ears that
it<00:03:30.840> feels<00:03:31.230> really<00:03:32.190> really<00:03:32.580> light<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.060> that's

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
it feels really really light and that's

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.930 
it feels really really light and that's
why<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.540> adds<00:03:33.990> to<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:34.920> musical<00:03:35.310> capabilities

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
why it adds to the musical capabilities

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.300 
why it adds to the musical capabilities
making<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.750> very<00:03:36.930> good<00:03:37.350> set<00:03:38.010> of<00:03:38.040> headphones

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
making it a very good set of headphones

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.790 
making it a very good set of headphones
like<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:40.110> next<00:03:40.380> thing<00:03:40.530> that<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.709> would

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
headphones here and as you can see it's

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.420 
headphones here and as you can see it's
really<00:03:48.120> really<00:03:48.300> long<00:03:48.870> it's<00:03:49.140> not<00:03:49.430> extremely

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
really really long it's not extremely

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.610 
really really long it's not extremely
long<00:03:50.610> but<00:03:50.820> it's<00:03:50.970> really<00:03:51.330> really<00:03:51.720> long<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.080> the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
long but it's really really long and the

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.510 
long but it's really really long and the
exact<00:03:53.100> length<00:03:53.310> is<00:03:53.550> a<00:03:53.959> 1.2<00:03:54.959> meters<00:03:55.920> so<00:03:56.310> that's

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
exact length is a 1.2 meters so that's

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.380 
exact length is a 1.2 meters so that's
not<00:03:56.700> bad

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
not bad

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.330 
not bad
considering<00:03:58.170> that<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.410> has<00:03:58.830> become<00:03:59.160> the

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
considering that it has become the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.610 
considering that it has become the
industry<00:03:59.370> standard<00:03:59.850> these<00:04:00.480> days<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:00.900> have<00:04:00.930> 1.2

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
industry standard these days to have 1.2

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.460 
industry standard these days to have 1.2
