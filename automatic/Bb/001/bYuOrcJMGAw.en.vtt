00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
water in it it'll get really messy let's

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.449 
water in it it'll get really messy let's

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
and then as you can see the chalk I like

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.550 
and then as you can see the chalk I like
absorbs<00:03:06.859> the<00:03:07.010> water<00:03:08.260> that's<00:03:09.260> why<00:03:09.410> you're

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
absorbs the water that's why you're

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.990 
absorbs the water that's why you're
going<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.769> need<00:03:09.889> to<00:03:10.010> put<00:03:10.190> like<00:03:10.310> a<00:03:10.370> lot<00:03:10.700> of<00:03:10.849> it

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.179 

okay<00:03:44.359> so<00:03:44.390> we<00:03:45.079> added<00:03:45.409> all<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.680> water<00:03:45.890> and<00:03:46.069> the

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:46.189 
okay so we added all the water and the

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:48.009 
okay so we added all the water and the
consistency<00:03:46.879> should<00:03:47.000> be<00:03:47.359> like<00:03:47.480> a<00:03:47.750> little

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
consistency should be like a little

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.929 
consistency should be like a little
squishy<00:03:48.439> but<00:03:48.829> not<00:03:48.980> that<00:03:49.310> well<00:03:49.549> it<00:03:49.700> sort<00:03:49.849> of

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:49.939 
squishy but not that well it sort of

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:51.970 
squishy but not that well it sort of
feels<00:03:50.150> like<00:03:50.359> if<00:03:50.540> you<00:03:50.629> poke<00:03:50.870> cornstarch<00:03:51.590> too

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
feels like if you poke cornstarch too

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.670 
feels like if you poke cornstarch too
soft<00:03:52.790> I<00:03:53.150> like<00:03:53.870> if<00:03:54.019> you<00:03:54.109> have<00:03:54.200> clothes<00:03:54.379> I<00:03:54.409> like

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
soft I like if you have clothes I like

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:02.369 
soft I like if you have clothes I like
goo<00:03:54.950> yeah<00:03:55.819> yes<00:03:56.120> so<00:03:56.709> you<00:03:57.709> just<00:03:57.920> pull<00:03:58.579> it<00:03:58.700> out

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.069 

it's<00:04:03.379> really<00:04:03.500> hard<00:04:04.159> and<00:04:05.060> I<00:04:05.510> think<00:04:05.629> you<00:04:05.900> should

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
it's really hard and I think you should

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.530 
it's really hard and I think you should
wear<00:04:06.170> gloves<00:04:06.409> for<00:04:06.709> this<00:04:06.859> but<00:04:07.359> we're<00:04:08.359> not

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
wear gloves for this but we're not

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.839 
wear gloves for this but we're not
wearing<00:04:08.780> gloves<00:04:09.040> it's<00:04:10.040> easier<00:04:10.340> to<00:04:10.519> mold<00:04:10.730> it

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
wearing gloves it's easier to mold it

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:11.830 
wearing gloves it's easier to mold it
without<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.209> gloves<00:04:11.420> because<00:04:11.510> then<00:04:11.720> you

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
without the gloves because then you

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.210 
without the gloves because then you
could<00:04:11.959> feel<00:04:12.170> what<00:04:12.349> you're<00:04:12.530> actually<00:04:12.650> molding

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
could feel what you're actually molding

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.699 
could feel what you're actually molding
so<00:04:14.000> you<00:04:14.480> roll<00:04:14.720> it<00:04:14.959> you<00:04:17.199> just<00:04:18.199> roll<00:04:18.380> into<00:04:18.560> the

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
so you roll it you just roll into the

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.229 
so you roll it you just roll into the
shape<00:04:18.919> you<00:04:19.099> want<00:04:19.220> I<00:04:19.489> mean<00:04:19.519> you<00:04:19.729> can<00:04:19.880> even<00:04:20.000> do<00:04:20.209> it

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
shape you want I mean you can even do it

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.700 
shape you want I mean you can even do it
into<00:04:20.510> a<00:04:20.570> heart<00:04:22.780> why<00:04:23.780> making<00:04:24.080> and<00:04:24.289> making<00:04:24.470> it

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
into a heart why making and making it

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.260 
into a heart why making and making it
into<00:04:24.860> like<00:04:25.009> a<00:04:25.039> little<00:04:25.160> block<00:04:27.880> so<00:04:28.880> there<00:04:29.120> it<00:04:29.210> is

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
into like a little block so there it is

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.010 
into like a little block so there it is
it's<00:04:29.780> sort<00:04:30.020> of<00:04:30.110> well<00:04:30.460> so<00:04:31.810> so<00:04:32.810> you're<00:04:32.930> just

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
it's sort of well so so you're just

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.100 
it's sort of well so so you're just
gonna<00:04:33.229> it'll<00:04:33.620> be<00:04:33.740> really<00:04:33.889> hard<00:04:33.979> to<00:04:34.160> move<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.370> few

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
gonna it'll be really hard to move a few

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.180 
gonna it'll be really hard to move a few
but<00:04:36.110> you<00:04:36.199> have<00:04:36.289> to<00:04:36.380> move<00:04:36.500> it<00:04:36.620> carefully<00:04:37.010> so

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
but you have to move it carefully so

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.100 
but you have to move it carefully so
then<00:04:37.820> you<00:04:38.030> just<00:04:38.060> put<00:04:38.270> it<00:04:38.479> somewhere<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.870> dry

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
then you just put it somewhere to dry

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.839 
then you just put it somewhere to dry
and<00:04:39.380> it'll<00:04:39.590> dry<00:04:39.889> up<00:04:39.919> and<00:04:40.310> then<00:04:40.490> you<00:04:40.580> could<00:04:40.729> use

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849 
and it'll dry up and then you could use

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.610 
and it'll dry up and then you could use
it<00:04:41.770> so<00:04:43.630> we're<00:04:44.630> going<00:04:44.720> to<00:04:44.810> give<00:04:44.930> some<00:04:45.110> examples

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
it so we're going to give some examples

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.170 
it so we're going to give some examples
on<00:04:45.770> what<00:04:45.979> you<00:04:46.159> can<00:04:46.340> like<00:04:46.490> put<00:04:46.729> it<00:04:46.849> on<00:04:46.940> like
