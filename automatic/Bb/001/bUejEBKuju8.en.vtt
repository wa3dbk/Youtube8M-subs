00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.540
 This is the bottom of the milk box 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.900
 We can use the bottom of the milk box to make the top 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.660
 Mother and baby will be very interesting to make together. 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.760
 Here are two layers, very hard, not easy to fold 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.940
 So we are folding around 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.500
 Fold twice 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.920
 So underneath it is a tip that treats him as the bottom of the "gyro" 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:50.420
 Then find the side of the shorter milk box 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.800
 Fold a little 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.120
 The part which is folded and the hard place here 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.960
 Stick together with tape 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.040
 Then, you can paint the pattern you like by painting the color you like. 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:38.900
 For example, put a red on the corner of this side 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.000
 Painted blue 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.120
 Can be painted in colorful 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.100
 Holding this top first, it will rotate very smoothly. 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.360
 It would be a bit difficult to turn this flat part up. 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.200
 If you hold the edges on both sides, it is easy to turn.
