render<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.140> those<00:02:16.650> light<00:02:16.890> players

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
render the those light players

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.150 
render the those light players
convincingly<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:17.940> Photoshop<00:02:18.570> as<00:02:18.720> well<00:02:19.160> but

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
convincingly in Photoshop as well but

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.760 
convincingly in Photoshop as well but
the<00:02:20.280> first<00:02:20.490> stop<00:02:20.700> on<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:22.020> way<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.260> achieving

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
the first stop on the way to achieving

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.040 
the first stop on the way to achieving
the<00:02:23.010> look<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.460> we<00:02:23.580> want<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:24.180> gonna<00:02:24.540> take<00:02:24.780> our

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
the look that we want is gonna take our

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.030 
the look that we want is gonna take our
exposure<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:26.030> bump<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.120> up<00:02:27.350> almost<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.770> full

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
exposure and bump that up almost a full

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.310 
exposure and bump that up almost a full
stop<00:02:29.370> probably<00:02:30.090> right<00:02:30.570> about<00:02:30.720> there

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
stop probably right about there

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.470 
stop probably right about there
now<00:02:32.190> what<00:02:32.370> you're<00:02:32.490> saying<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:32.820> that's<00:02:32.940> crazy

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
now what you're saying is that's crazy

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.210 
now what you're saying is that's crazy
bright<00:02:33.810> why<00:02:34.440> is<00:02:34.500> it<00:02:34.740> that<00:02:34.860> bright<00:02:35.070> it<00:02:35.190> looks

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
bright why is it that bright it looks

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.590 
bright why is it that bright it looks
horrible<00:02:35.490> alright<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.150> what<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.270> thing<00:02:36.480> we're

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
horrible alright and what a thing we're

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.670 
horrible alright and what a thing we're
gonna<00:02:36.720> do<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:37.110> we're<00:02:37.200> gonna<00:02:37.260> take<00:02:37.470> our

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
gonna do is we're gonna take our

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.710 
gonna do is we're gonna take our
highlights<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.360> bring<00:02:39.360> them<00:02:39.570> down

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
highlights and bring them down

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:49.610 
highlights and bring them down
probably<00:02:43.940> so<00:02:44.940> about<00:02:47.270> negative<00:02:48.270> 50<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.530> when

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
probably so about negative 50 and when

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.600 
probably so about negative 50 and when
you<00:02:49.680> do<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.860> same<00:02:50.010> thing<00:02:50.220> with<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.370> Knights

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
you do the same thing with the Knights

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.540 
you do the same thing with the Knights
the<00:02:51.030> whites<00:02:51.570> actually<00:02:52.250> down<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.280> about

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
the whites actually down to about

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.250 
the whites actually down to about
negative<00:02:53.910> 15<00:02:54.180> what<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.690> does<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:55.020> sort<00:02:55.170> of

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
negative 15 what that does is sort of

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.600 
negative 15 what that does is sort of
just<00:02:55.470> lowers<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.890> intensity<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.520> that

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
just lowers the intensity of that

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.300 
just lowers the intensity of that
spectrum<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:58.410> histogram<00:02:58.709> takes<00:02:59.190> down

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
spectrum of the histogram takes down

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.640 
spectrum of the histogram takes down
your<00:02:59.550> highlights<00:02:59.880> takes<00:03:00.150> down<00:03:00.239> your<00:03:00.450> whites

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
your highlights takes down your whites

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.720 
your highlights takes down your whites
takes<00:03:01.650> off<00:03:01.800> that<00:03:01.980> harshness<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.550> photo

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
takes off that harshness of the photo

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.380 
takes off that harshness of the photo
just<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:03.060> little<00:03:03.270> bit<00:03:04.880> trickier<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:05.910> do<00:03:06.209> the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
just a little bit trickier to do the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.460 
just a little bit trickier to do the
next<00:03:06.570> thing<00:03:06.690> we're<00:03:06.780> gonna<00:03:06.870> do<00:03:07.020> is<00:03:07.080> gonna<00:03:07.200> bring

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
up our blacks and our shadows just a

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.420 
up our blacks and our shadows just a
little<00:03:10.350> bit<00:03:10.440> about<00:03:10.850> 20-25<00:03:11.850> each<00:03:13.190> next<00:03:14.190> thing<00:03:14.310> I

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
little bit about 20-25 each next thing I

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.729 
little bit about 20-25 each next thing I
like<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.670> do<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:15.090> take<00:03:15.959> our<00:03:16.080> clarity<00:03:16.470> down<00:03:16.709> a

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
here our tone curve is where we're gonna

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.960 
here our tone curve is where we're gonna
sort<00:03:33.660> of<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:34.200> know<00:03:34.430> really<00:03:35.430> bring<00:03:35.640> up<00:03:35.820> the

just like that next we're gonna bring up
your<00:03:57.799> base<00:03:58.799> anchor<00:03:59.130> point<00:03:59.370> on<00:03:59.459> all<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.820> way<00:03:59.940> in

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
your base anchor point on all the way in

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.509 
your base anchor point on all the way in
the<00:04:00.120> bottom<00:04:00.239> left<00:04:00.600> of<00:04:00.720> your<00:04:00.780> curve<00:04:01.079> and<00:04:01.380> try<00:04:02.190> to

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
the bottom left of your curve and try to

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.800 
the bottom left of your curve and try to
bring<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:02.940> up<00:04:03.060> towards<00:04:03.390> that<00:04:03.450> anchor<00:04:03.780> point

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
bring it up towards that anchor point

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.600 
bring it up towards that anchor point
that<00:04:04.110> you<00:04:04.170> just<00:04:04.200> created<00:04:04.680> now<00:04:04.920> you<00:04:05.340> see<00:04:05.489> the

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
that you just created now you see the

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.310 
that you just created now you see the
difference<00:04:05.940> in<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.150> photo<00:04:06.390> it<00:04:06.720> basically

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
difference in the photo it basically

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.560 
difference in the photo it basically
just<00:04:07.579> destroys<00:04:08.579> the<00:04:08.790> blacks<00:04:09.030> in<00:04:09.209> your<00:04:09.329> photo

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
just destroys the blacks in your photo

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.920 
just destroys the blacks in your photo
and<00:04:10.040> really<00:04:11.600> treats<00:04:12.600> that<00:04:12.720> sort<00:04:12.900> of

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
and really treats that sort of

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.930 
and really treats that sort of
desaturate<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:13.860> ethereal<00:04:14.459> look<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:14.820> we're

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
desaturate and ethereal look that we're

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.300 
desaturate and ethereal look that we're
going<00:04:14.970> for<00:04:15.209> here<00:04:15.890> alright<00:04:16.890> so<00:04:17.010> let's<00:04:17.190> do<00:04:17.250> that

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
going for here alright so let's do that

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.580 
going for here alright so let's do that
right<00:04:17.549> there<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:18.510> should<00:04:18.630> have<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.810> resulting

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
right there you should have a resulting

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.400 
right there you should have a resulting
tone<00:04:19.769> curve<00:04:20.010> that<00:04:20.190> looks<00:04:20.400> somewhat<00:04:20.700> like<00:04:20.760> that

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
tone curve that looks somewhat like that

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.029 
tone curve that looks somewhat like that
and<00:04:22.410> our<00:04:22.560> next<00:04:22.770> stop<00:04:23.039> is<00:04:23.960> split<00:04:24.960> toning<00:04:25.200> you

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:53.629 
no noise reduction depending on the ISO
that<00:04:52.379> you<00:04:52.469> took<00:04:52.680> your<00:04:52.860> photo<00:04:53.069> at<00:04:53.250> I<00:04:53.280> think<00:04:53.430> this

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
that you took your photo at I think this

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.510 
that you took your photo at I think this
was<00:04:53.759> at<00:04:53.879> ISO<00:04:54.240> 100<00:04:54.479> which<00:04:55.259> is<00:04:55.409> great<00:04:55.740> if<00:04:56.430> you

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
was at ISO 100 which is great if you

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.520 
was at ISO 100 which is great if you
took<00:04:56.639> the<00:04:56.819> higher<00:04:56.969> at<00:04:57.120> ISO<00:04:57.449> you<00:04:58.110> might<00:04:58.289> start

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
took the higher at ISO you might start

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.929 
took the higher at ISO you might start
noticing<00:04:58.860> a<00:04:58.979> little<00:04:59.039> graininess<00:04:59.490> start<00:04:59.819> to<00:04:59.879> a

00:04:59.929 --> 00:04:59.939 
noticing a little graininess start to a

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:02.149 
noticing a little graininess start to a
fear<00:05:00.150> so<00:05:00.360> bumpier<00:05:00.750> your<00:05:01.349> noise<00:05:01.560> reduction<00:05:01.830> up

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:02.159 
fear so bumpier your noise reduction up

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:06.050 
fear so bumpier your noise reduction up
to<00:05:02.310> about<00:05:02.520> 15<00:05:02.909> or<00:05:03.090> 20<00:05:03.229> and<00:05:04.729> last<00:05:05.729> thing<00:05:05.939> before

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
to about 15 or 20 and last thing before

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.670 
to about 15 or 20 and last thing before
we<00:05:06.270> get<00:05:06.360> the<00:05:06.479> tone<00:05:06.659> curve<00:05:06.930> I<00:05:07.169> just<00:05:07.349> like<00:05:07.469> to<00:05:07.560> add

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
we get the tone curve I just like to add

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.769 
we get the tone curve I just like to add
a<00:05:07.710> little<00:05:08.189> bit<00:05:08.460> of<00:05:08.490> post<00:05:09.029> cropping<00:05:09.389> getting<00:05:09.659> in

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:09.779 
a little bit of post cropping getting in

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:12.529 
a little bit of post cropping getting in
there<00:05:10.460> that<00:05:11.460> adds<00:05:11.610> a<00:05:11.729> little<00:05:11.879> darkness<00:05:12.330> to<00:05:12.449> the

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
there that adds a little darkness to the

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:13.820 
there that adds a little darkness to the
photo<00:05:12.750> adds<00:05:13.080> that<00:05:13.289> to<00:05:13.439> that<00:05:13.529> sort<00:05:13.800> of

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
photo adds that to that sort of

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.149 
photo adds that to that sort of
cinematic<00:05:14.430> feel<00:05:14.639> darkness<00:05:15.599> to<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:15.960> edge

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:16.159 
cinematic feel darkness to the edge

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:19.540 
cinematic feel darkness to the edge
maybe<00:05:17.159> feather<00:05:17.490> it<00:05:17.699> just<00:05:17.909> a<00:05:18.000> little<00:05:18.210> bit<00:05:18.330> more

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
maybe feather it just a little bit more

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.140 
maybe feather it just a little bit more
there<00:05:20.550> you<00:05:20.729> go

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
alright so let's go back up to tone

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.330 
alright so let's go back up to tone
curve<00:05:23.629> now<00:05:24.629> what<00:05:24.960> tone<00:05:25.139> curve<00:05:25.379> is<00:05:25.560> or<00:05:25.919> I<00:05:25.979> mean

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
curve now what tone curve is or I mean

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.100 
curve now what tone curve is or I mean
split<00:05:26.639> toning<00:05:26.849> actually<00:05:27.270> sorry<00:05:27.509> what<00:05:28.080> the

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
all the highlights in our photo and

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.029 
all the highlights in our photo and
because<00:05:49.229> we<00:05:49.319> brought<00:05:49.500> up<00:05:49.620> the<00:05:49.650> exposure

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
because we brought up the exposure

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.100 
because we brought up the exposure
initially<00:05:50.669> that's<00:05:51.330> gonna<00:05:51.449> cover<00:05:51.659> a<00:05:51.779> large

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
initially that's gonna cover a large

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.990 
initially that's gonna cover a large
range<00:05:52.229> of<00:05:52.710> our<00:05:52.860> photo<00:05:53.099> which<00:05:53.400> is<00:05:53.520> good<00:05:53.699> for

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
range of our photo which is good for

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.360 
range of our photo which is good for
this<00:05:54.150> situation<00:05:54.740> let's<00:05:55.740> go<00:05:55.860> to<00:05:55.919> the<00:05:56.009> shadows

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
this situation let's go to the shadows

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.279 
this situation let's go to the shadows
as<00:05:56.550> well<00:05:56.580> and<00:05:57.180> for<00:05:57.689> this<00:05:57.750> one<00:05:57.930> let's<00:05:58.020> choose<00:05:58.259> a

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
as well and for this one let's choose a

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:00.499 
as well and for this one let's choose a
much<00:05:58.620> cooler<00:05:58.919> tone<00:05:59.339> and<00:05:59.879> basically<00:06:00.389> that's

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:00.509 
much cooler tone and basically that's

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:02.390 
much cooler tone and basically that's
gonna<00:06:00.719> add<00:06:00.839> it<00:06:00.990> to<00:06:01.110> all<00:06:01.289> the<00:06:01.500> shadows<00:06:01.860> in<00:06:02.310> the

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
gonna add it to all the shadows in the

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.459 
gonna add it to all the shadows in the
photo<00:06:02.610> which<00:06:02.879> are<00:06:03.599> not<00:06:03.810> really<00:06:04.199> present

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:04.469 
photo which are not really present

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:06.980 
photo which are not really present
because<00:06:04.860> of<00:06:04.889> the<00:06:05.099> way<00:06:05.219> we've<00:06:05.430> edited<00:06:05.990> the

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
because of the way we've edited the

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.420 
because of the way we've edited the
point<00:06:07.199> curve<00:06:07.439> and<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:07.860> way<00:06:07.949> we<00:06:08.099> brought<00:06:08.279> up

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
point curve and the way we brought up

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.540 
point curve and the way we brought up
our<00:06:08.580> blacks<00:06:08.849> and<00:06:09.029> shadows<00:06:09.330> are<00:06:09.569> they<00:06:10.080> wrong

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
our blacks and shadows are they wrong

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.800 
our blacks and shadows are they wrong
and<00:06:11.550> now<00:06:11.639> you<00:06:11.699> can<00:06:11.909> edit<00:06:12.089> these<00:06:12.330> if<00:06:12.569> you<00:06:12.659> feel

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
that blue is a little bit too strong you

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.950 
that blue is a little bit too strong you
can<00:06:14.490> go<00:06:14.580> down<00:06:14.699> to<00:06:14.819> the<00:06:14.909> saturation<00:06:15.449> slider<00:06:15.599> for

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
can go down to the saturation slider for

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.749 
can go down to the saturation slider for
the<00:06:16.020> shadows<00:06:16.409> here<00:06:16.800> bring<00:06:17.310> that<00:06:17.339> down<00:06:17.699> a

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 
the shadows here bring that down a

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.149 
the shadows here bring that down a
little<00:06:17.909> bit<00:06:18.319> if<00:06:19.319> you<00:06:19.409> feel<00:06:19.560> the<00:06:19.680> orange<00:06:19.919> is<00:06:20.009> too

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:20.159 
little bit if you feel the orange is too

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:21.679 
little bit if you feel the orange is too
strong<00:06:20.430> you<00:06:20.580> can<00:06:20.729> bring<00:06:20.879> that<00:06:20.939> down<00:06:21.330> just<00:06:21.360> a

00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:21.689 
strong you can bring that down just a

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:24.200 
strong you can bring that down just a
little<00:06:21.719> bit<00:06:22.020> in<00:06:22.139> the<00:06:22.199> same<00:06:22.379> way<00:06:22.800> and<00:06:23.180> sort<00:06:24.180> of

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
little bit in the same way and sort of

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.519 
little bit in the same way and sort of
just<00:06:24.360> mess<00:06:24.539> around<00:06:24.659> with<00:06:24.900> this<00:06:24.990> until<00:06:25.050> you<00:06:25.409> get

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:25.529 
just mess around with this until you get

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:27.920 
just mess around with this until you get
the<00:06:26.039> feel<00:06:26.400> that<00:06:26.460> you're<00:06:26.759> looking<00:06:27.029> for<00:06:27.300> and<00:06:27.539> the

00:06:31.429 --> 00:06:31.439 
balance bar that pretty much just shifts

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:33.320 
balance bar that pretty much just shifts
the<00:06:31.469> balance<00:06:31.979> of<00:06:32.069> tone<00:06:32.310> from<00:06:32.610> one<00:06:32.879> end<00:06:33.089> to<00:06:33.210> the
