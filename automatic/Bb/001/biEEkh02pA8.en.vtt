let's<00:00:46.950> find<00:00:47.129> out<00:00:47.370> zero<00:00:47.670> grams<00:00:48.000> pop<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
let's find out zero grams pop it on the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.680 
let's find out zero grams pop it on the
scale<00:00:49.440> 63<00:00:50.430> grams<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.030> what<00:00:51.210> we<00:00:51.329> are<00:00:51.449> talking

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
scale 63 grams is what we are talking

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.869 
scale 63 grams is what we are talking
about<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.530> let's<00:00:53.070> go<00:00:53.190> ahead<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.340> get<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.550> out

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
about so let's go ahead and get that out

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.880 
about so let's go ahead and get that out
of<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.090> way<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.719> can<00:00:54.840> see<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> inside<00:00:55.469> here

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
of the way you can see the inside here

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.979 
of the way you can see the inside here
it's<00:00:56.010> kind<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.250> got<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.670> shock<00:00:57.239> absorbency

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
it's kind of got this shock absorbency

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.319 
it's kind of got this shock absorbency
on<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.770> inside<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.520> it's<00:00:59.670> going<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.879> handle

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
on the inside so it's going to handle

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.720 
on the inside so it's going to handle
drops<00:01:00.719> pretty<00:01:01.109> darn<00:01:01.350> well<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.949> let's<00:01:02.640> go

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
drops pretty darn well and let's go

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.149 
drops pretty darn well and let's go
ahead<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:02.910> put<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.300> into<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:04.439> case<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.040> it

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
ahead and put this into the case and it

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.010 
ahead and put this into the case and it
just<00:01:05.339> pops<00:01:05.580> right<00:01:05.760> into<00:01:06.150> places<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.990> see
