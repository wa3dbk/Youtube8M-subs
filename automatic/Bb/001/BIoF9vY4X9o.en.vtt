00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
back up to the mine and next up we have

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.840 
back up to the mine and next up we have
to<00:00:50.739> take<00:00:50.829> a<00:00:50.860> quick<00:00:51.039> look<00:00:51.160> at<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.489> jumps<00:00:51.760> you

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
to take a quick look at the jumps you

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.060 
to take a quick look at the jumps you
can<00:00:51.969> do<00:00:52.090> around<00:00:52.239> the<00:00:52.750> key<00:00:52.960> so<00:00:53.500> you<00:00:53.559> can<00:00:53.800> see<00:00:53.920> now

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
can do around the key so you can see now

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.560 
can do around the key so you can see now
we're<00:00:54.190> on<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.370> platform<00:00:54.879> area<00:00:55.059> around<00:00:55.390> the

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
we're on the platform area around the

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.139 
we're on the platform area around the
back<00:00:56.050> of<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.379> key<00:00:56.620> as<00:00:56.860> jump<00:00:57.670> you<00:00:57.760> can<00:00:57.879> make<00:00:58.030> to

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
back of the key as jump you can make to

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:59.760 
back of the key as jump you can make to
get<00:00:58.270> across<00:00:58.690> from<00:00:59.020> one<00:00:59.199> side<00:00:59.440> to<00:00:59.469> the<00:00:59.649> other

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
get across from one side to the other

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.920 
get across from one side to the other
here<00:01:00.190> not<00:01:00.670> particularly<00:01:01.000> useful<00:01:01.300> but<00:01:01.660> can<00:01:01.840> be

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
here not particularly useful but can be

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.599 
here not particularly useful but can be
used<00:01:02.140> just<00:01:02.199> to<00:01:02.350> jump<00:01:02.649> away<00:01:02.770> from<00:01:03.340> a<00:01:03.430> quick

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
used just to jump away from a quick

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:04.770 
used just to jump away from a quick
attack<00:01:03.940> than<00:01:04.149> might<00:01:04.270> be<00:01:04.360> coming<00:01:04.690> your

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
attack than might be coming your

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.779 
attack than might be coming your
direction<00:01:04.839> there's<00:01:05.830> also<00:01:05.950> a<00:01:06.100> nice<00:01:06.310> nifty

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:06.789 
direction there's also a nice nifty

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:08.520 
direction there's also a nice nifty
little<00:01:06.940> jump<00:01:07.210> you<00:01:07.300> can<00:01:07.450> make<00:01:07.570> around<00:01:07.960> here<00:01:08.229> to

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
little jump you can make around here to

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.109 
little jump you can make around here to
get<00:01:08.920> up<00:01:09.070> onto<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.430> point<00:01:09.700> a<00:01:09.820> little<00:01:10.030> bit

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
get up onto the point a little bit

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.609 
get up onto the point a little bit
quicker<00:01:10.270> so<00:01:10.810> you<00:01:10.869> can<00:01:10.990> jump<00:01:11.140> up<00:01:11.289> onto<00:01:11.440> this

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
quicker so you can jump up onto this

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.350 
quicker so you can jump up onto this
ledge<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:12.099> get<00:01:12.250> up<00:01:12.369> there<00:01:12.580> and<00:01:12.610> cut<00:01:13.030> out<00:01:13.209> this

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
ledge to get up there and cut out this

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.880 
ledge to get up there and cut out this
corner<00:01:13.869> area<00:01:14.380> there<00:01:15.959> you<00:01:16.959> can<00:01:17.349> also<00:01:17.530> do<00:01:17.740> the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
corner area there you can also do the

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.919 
corner area there you can also do the
same<00:01:17.920> one<00:01:18.459> around<00:01:18.880> this<00:01:19.119> solve<00:01:19.390> area<00:01:19.630> here<00:01:19.899> to

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
same one around this solve area here to

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.050 
same one around this solve area here to
jump<00:01:20.319> up<00:01:20.470> right<00:01:21.069> at<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.250> back<00:01:21.490> there's

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
jump up right at the back there's

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.040 
jump up right at the back there's
obviously<00:01:22.300> she's<00:01:22.479> in<00:01:22.539> a<00:01:22.569> really<00:01:22.810> good

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
obviously she's in a really good

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.419 
obviously she's in a really good
position<00:01:23.200> so<00:01:23.709> you've<00:01:23.830> got<00:01:23.860> this<00:01:24.039> covering

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:24.429 
position so you've got this covering

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:25.740 
position so you've got this covering
from<00:01:24.610> here<00:01:24.789> as<00:01:24.910> well<00:01:25.030> so<00:01:25.090> you<00:01:25.330> can<00:01:25.360> fight<00:01:25.630> from

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
from here as well so you can fight from

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.330 
from here as well so you can fight from
range<00:01:26.080> if<00:01:26.259> you're<00:01:26.380> playing<00:01:26.679> there's<00:01:27.160> the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
range if you're playing there's the
