worry about that what i'm doing here is
i'm<00:03:06.090> making<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.330> selection<00:03:07.690> of<00:03:08.110> forests<00:03:08.500> and

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
i'm making a selection of forests and

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.860 
i'm making a selection of forests and
saving<00:03:10.060> it<00:03:10.180> so<00:03:10.930> i<00:03:11.260> can<00:03:11.560> place<00:03:12.190> a<00:03:12.610> large<00:03:13.480> amount

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
saving it so i can place a large amount

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.680 
saving it so i can place a large amount
of<00:03:13.990> trees<00:03:14.410> very<00:03:14.800> quickly<00:03:15.330> as<00:03:16.330> you<00:03:16.480> can<00:03:16.540> see

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
of trees very quickly as you can see

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.200 
of trees very quickly as you can see
here<00:03:16.900> I<00:03:17.110> mess<00:03:17.440> up<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.460> trees<00:03:18.730> are<00:03:18.760> looking

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
here I mess up and the trees are looking

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
here I mess up and the trees are looking
slightly<00:03:20.850> well<00:03:21.850> they're<00:03:22.030> floating<00:03:22.360> basically

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
slightly well they're floating basically

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.830 
slightly well they're floating basically
so<00:03:23.650> I<00:03:24.190> start<00:03:24.790> taking<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.210> little<00:03:25.300> bit<00:03:25.480> out<00:03:25.600> and

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
so I start taking a little bit out and

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.170 
so I start taking a little bit out and
then<00:03:25.930> I'm<00:03:26.050> thinking<00:03:26.170> it<00:03:26.470> is<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.620> big<00:03:26.830> job<00:03:27.070> so

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
then I'm thinking it is a big job so

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.430 
then I'm thinking it is a big job so
what<00:03:28.180> I<00:03:28.210> decide<00:03:28.600> to<00:03:28.630> do<00:03:28.930> is<00:03:29.970> make<00:03:30.970> it<00:03:31.440> an

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
what I decide to do is make it an

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.460 
what I decide to do is make it an
enchanted<00:03:33.160> forest<00:03:33.540> because<00:03:34.540> if<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.780> forest

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
enchanted forest because if the forest

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.790 
enchanted forest because if the forest
is<00:03:35.620> enchanted<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.910> trees<00:03:37.570> can<00:03:37.810> float<00:03:38.470> and

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
is enchanted the trees can float and

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.760 
is enchanted the trees can float and
that's<00:03:39.790> exactly<00:03:39.910> what<00:03:40.239> I<00:03:40.270> decided<00:03:40.540> to<00:03:40.690> do<00:03:40.900> so

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
that's exactly what I decided to do so

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.290 
that's exactly what I decided to do so
now<00:03:41.920> I'm<00:03:42.010> adding<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.370> finishing<00:03:42.640> touches

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
now I'm adding the finishing touches

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.920 
now I'm adding the finishing touches
such<00:03:43.930> as<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.910> keyline<00:03:45.910> colors<00:03:46.510> which<00:03:46.780> I'm

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
such as the keyline colors which I'm

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.630 
such as the keyline colors which I'm
just<00:03:47.110> about<00:03:47.320> to<00:03:47.380> do<00:03:47.770> and<00:03:49.590> we<00:03:50.590> are<00:03:50.770> very<00:03:50.800> shortly
