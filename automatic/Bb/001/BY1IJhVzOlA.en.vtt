 and there is one last message that you want 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.460
 dedicate to your audience then first that 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.190
 nothing to thank them for all the support because 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.770
 send me inbox on facebook are 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.270

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.180
 supporting my people that not even 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:07.080
 I know and they already trust me that I can 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.790
 get to do something for Mexico and then 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.830
 that gives me great satisfaction to see that 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.160
 I have many people who support me 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.050
 thanks last question, sorry 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.940
 I'm asking so many things but it 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.250
 it happened to me because it's important for a 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.770
 athlete of a country leave his circuit 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.500
 local and competed one class that another 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.600
 international tournament because they open you 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.690
 new expectations towards what you are looking for 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.680
 is to continue growing and therefore this event 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.340
 It is very high level 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.709
 in question bodybuilding and then 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.230
 what better to be where the 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.569
 better clear and I think so also by 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.659
 therefore the same delegation grows not 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.579
 because learning and athletes 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.620
 experience something new 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.709
 internationally they learn new things 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.409
 new energy and that's like a virus 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.739
 that hits all your delegation yes sure 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:02.170
 all this motivates them there and therefore every time 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.109
 I see that there are more competitors than who 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.389
 is in figure that they no longer have that 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:11.799
 Today 's mentality had believed 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:14.140
 that was more I do not know how muscular he 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.720
 I lost the feminine but 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.299
 and we show that it's not like that anymore 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.840
 sports consciousness if the public 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.400
 start learning learn about approaching little 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.070
 by little and the athletes who were more 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.890
 happy not yes yes 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.680
 then already opening roads for 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:36.790
 category of figures good this was 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:40.630
 sandra grajales romeros de veracruz 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:44.080
 but it lies in Chihuahua trained by 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:47.200
 Oscar yes and that's all we wish you 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.460

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.460
