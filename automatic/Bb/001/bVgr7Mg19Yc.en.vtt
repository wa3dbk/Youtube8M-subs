 it is possible to summarize the history of the internet and in two large participants 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.139
 and after the appearance of on the website 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.420

 the world's search site 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.220
 feeling that I prefer in my life that I worry 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.499
 goes that became synonymous with searches 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:42.059
 created a generation of drunkenness should be ashamed 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.220
 paulo - the internet in my 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.290
 in Brazil, nine out of ten searches are done by google 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.950
 among the youngest 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.950
 almost a sin or die in a cane 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.760
 gradually little by little and revolutionized not only the search engines but 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.959
 also to the worldwide computer network 

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:08.090
 the internet appeared as a window to the world but in the beginning was nothing 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.600
 easy to find what you are looking for 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.290
 the first search-and-win site was and why I chose 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.950
 manual form and look what a shaikh who used computer programs to catalog 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.049
 pages that are automatically dissatisfied with the results of the 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.420
 you look for milk and serguei brin have invented a little 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.210
 had as differential 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.420
 heidemann 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.850
 the pages are classified according to their importance 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.720
 the people interpret a link from the page to the open page with the vote of 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.240
 page to page as well as more votes and the more important sites indicate 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.430
 the page but it goes up in the market the business became profitable when the group 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.760
 ads to customers, for example if 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.369
 you type shoe appear shoe store ads on the same page 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.070
 of search results the brutal hugo of accesses to your search engine and 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.420
 blamed a lot of information about its users 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.159
 Ah the phorm abreu 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:15.509
 the course is focused on the second 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:19.059
 to flood the extremely segmented advertising 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.209
 quite successfully 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.239
 attack google dominated the search service and created an empire 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.029
 on the Internet 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:31.029
 the largest video posting site 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.129
 bet on social networks created interactive maps 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.659
 came to host votes organizing photos 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.889
 to do translations 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:45.269
 but we will not impose the cespe and cesgranrio space for the competitors 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.320
 Brazil because the liberators were not overtaken by facebook 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:50.730
 the power 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.069
 from users to twitter 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.279
 even a search service became the target of criticism 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:57.639
 the question now is 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:02.829
 as 'giant' will continue to innovate coincidence or not the command of the 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.189
 company will change 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:08.559
 the president-elect team that paid a lightning visit to brazil open a 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:11.629
 head the company board from April 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.400
 by the sea and will be occupied by larry page eighteen years younger 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:18.489
 the founders of the block 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.719
 the leixonense in the east of the state and there will be more in control of the businesses 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:24.719
 and I'll take care of customer and press partnerships 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.150
 it is brilliant more meticulous and detailed I think the products will be 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.150
 integrated and the carnival corso appeared more quickly 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.120
 next year to the new precedent to those adopted in Brazil 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.709
 where sales grew 80% last year is the same case of these people 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.349
 and the singer looks impressive with Brazil coming and growing with a lot of people 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.869
 reaching the middle class on the other hand, it is still necessary to move forward in 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:53.319
 internet so we see many opportunities on the horizon 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.319
 I was by the way the ruler. 

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:02.359
 despite the relaxed work environment the goal has been losing talent 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.569
 for competitors the warning signal for a company that needs to maintain the 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:07.619
 innovation 

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:12.139
 alexandrino vaga headed the Brazilian unit exchanged a bonbon for the 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.819
 facebook the diminution and luiz henrique with this indian to do with this dow jones 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:20.199
 we certainly do not want to lose any employees between competitors 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.199
 we are alexandre a great executive and we will miss you 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.830
 but we have a lot of talented people in bucks who hire more people in a 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.300
 what did you do because it took us through all your history this year so 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.319
 we're not worried about this if someone somewhere in the morning swims 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:40.480
 they do not even have Facebook method 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.070
 which surpassed in number of accesses in the united states and they although 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.250
 facebook not to go changing your winners you generate more requests from 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.320
 that in a research but the truth we compete with microsoft every day 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.060
 do not convince the other job milcos almeida iran the grÃªmio did 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.500
 just right behind the goal microsoft bingo search sites 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.139
 there is no space in the last months in the United States 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.940
 the two companies are also rivals in the billionaire mobile technology market 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:15.639
 the google android operating system facing a windows phone 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.490
 in other competing ports the nokia symbian blackberry and the system failed 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.819
 this time present on the iphone in a hectke menke borborema and salt many 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:30.169
 people including myself did not believe in the success of apple's 'tablet' 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:31.219
 that the 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:35.249
 now many companies offer competitors to pt that use our 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:38.769
 system 'android' January handsets are getting cheaper and more 

00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:42.459
 faster and more cute little the competition my focus is good for the 

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:45.459
 consumer in the house affected in the individual party 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:49.639
 how new technology will affect google searches 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.750
 the president's receipt of consensus is an unusual truth here absurd 

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:58.699
 Mercosur is very positive that people will do more research and that 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.699
 we make more money with morning advertising on the square 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.509
 retrospect the checks 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:08.229
 I guarantee that they will continue free. 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.699
 in exchange for hundreds of millions of people around the world, 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:17.889
 important information such as the name of places that 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.009
 I wish and here 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:25.439
 the state roughly we spend a lot of time with privacy that 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:29.069
 it would be terrible if this privacy were violated we are developing a 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:32.409
 tool where you can see what google knows about you 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:36.759
 and if you want to erase this information, just press a button 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:40.440
 if for your benefit we know something about you but if you 

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:44.030
 want to be completely anonymous we also support this kuito - 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.160
 very important
