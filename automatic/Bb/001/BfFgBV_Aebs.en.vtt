gets up the only manual hybrid on the
protein<00:02:06.289> at<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.470> moment<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:06.950> then<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.280> CVT

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
protein at the moment and then a CVT

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.359 
protein at the moment and then a CVT
automatic<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.530> Knicks<00:02:09.770> we<00:02:10.009> think<00:02:10.220> will

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
automatic and the Knicks we think will

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.150 
automatic and the Knicks we think will
be<00:02:10.459> about<00:02:10.670> thirty<00:02:10.940> percent<00:02:11.300> manuals<00:02:11.959> and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
be about thirty percent manuals and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.010 
be about thirty percent manuals and
seventy<00:02:13.160> percent<00:02:13.340> automatics<00:02:14.180> but<00:02:14.480> the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
seventy percent automatics but the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.540 
seventy percent automatics but the
manual<00:02:15.410> is<00:02:15.560> just<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:15.950> great<00:02:16.250> driving

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
manual is just a great driving

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.090 
manual is just a great driving
experience<00:02:17.090> really<00:02:17.180> fun<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:18.830> was<00:02:18.980> the

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
experience really fun that was the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.240 
experience really fun that was the
peloton<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:20.000> then<00:02:20.920> paddle<00:02:21.920> shifters<00:02:22.220> and

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
peloton and then paddle shifters and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.310 
peloton and then paddle shifters and
with<00:02:22.459> CVT<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.300> get<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.540> manual<00:02:23.870> driving

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
with CVT so you get the manual driving

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.850 
with CVT so you get the manual driving
experience<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.820> automatic<00:02:26.300> as<00:02:26.390> well<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:27.530> how

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
would you say that this compares to like

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.300 
would you say that this compares to like
the<00:02:29.989> insight<00:02:30.350> because<00:02:30.500> then<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.830> body<00:02:31.010> style

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
the insight because then the body style

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.870 
the insight because then the body style
is<00:02:31.610> similar<00:02:32.420> definitely<00:02:33.380> watch<00:02:34.280> your<00:02:34.580> sport
