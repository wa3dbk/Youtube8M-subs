have so as you can see I'm disconnecting
the<00:01:34.100> leads<00:01:34.509> from<00:01:35.509> the<00:01:35.720> car<00:01:35.899> battery<00:01:37.000> so<00:01:38.000> what

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
the leads from the car battery so what

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.460 
the leads from the car battery so what
we'll<00:01:38.240> do<00:01:38.390> is<00:01:38.540> we'll<00:01:38.690> go<00:01:38.869> ahead<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.200> put<00:01:39.350> on

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
we'll do is we'll go ahead and put on

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:50.010 
we'll do is we'll go ahead and put on
these<00:01:40.280> leads<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:42.860> what<00:01:42.979> we<00:01:43.100> disconnected<00:01:47.320> okay

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
these leads to what we disconnected okay

00:01:50.020 --> 00:02:01.490 
these leads to what we disconnected okay
see<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.050> little<00:01:51.259> bit<00:01:51.350> of<00:01:51.440> spark<00:01:51.770> here

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.370 

yeah<00:02:02.500> that's<00:02:02.740> on<00:02:02.979> there<00:02:03.990> double<00:02:04.990> check<00:02:05.229> to

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
yeah that's on there double check to

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.669 
yeah that's on there double check to
make<00:02:05.409> sure<00:02:05.590> we<00:02:05.860> got<00:02:06.009> contact<00:02:06.640> here<00:02:07.060> I<00:02:07.560> think<00:02:08.560> we

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
make sure we got contact here I think we

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:16.680 
make sure we got contact here I think we
do<00:02:11.640> fault<00:02:12.640> meter<00:02:12.910> shows<00:02:13.560> 14.3<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:16.120> negative

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
do fault meter shows 14.3 this negative

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.490 
do fault meter shows 14.3 this negative
may<00:02:17.080> not<00:02:17.410> be<00:02:17.650> connected<00:02:17.980> let's<00:02:18.819> give<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.180> try

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:35.399 

and<00:02:24.000> use<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.300> other<00:02:25.450> side<00:02:25.599> of<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.170> teeth

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.690 

so<00:02:36.409> s<00:02:36.950> connected<00:02:37.610> that's<00:02:38.510> connected<00:02:39.519> so<00:02:40.519> we

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
so s connected that's connected so we

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.809 
so s connected that's connected so we
have<00:02:40.909> this<00:02:41.060> voltmeter<00:02:41.510> shining<00:02:42.730> 14<00:02:43.730> 4<00:02:44.090> 14<00:02:44.720> 3<00:02:45.379> oh

start turn the car off go back to the

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.550 
start turn the car off go back to the
voltmeter<00:02:59.470> now<00:03:00.470> there<00:03:00.739> should<00:03:01.010> be<00:03:02.560> the

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
voltmeter now there should be the

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.050 
voltmeter now there should be the
voltmeter<00:03:03.890> it's<00:03:04.189> going<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.489> be<00:03:04.549> dropping

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
voltmeter it's going to be dropping

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.240 
voltmeter it's going to be dropping
their<00:03:05.209> see<00:03:05.510> we<00:03:05.720> have<00:03:05.870> 14<00:03:06.290> 31<00:03:08.980> it'll<00:03:09.980> go<00:03:10.099> down

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
their see we have 14 31 it'll go down

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.500 
their see we have 14 31 it'll go down
for<00:03:10.519> either<00:03:10.579> their<00:03:11.150> there<00:03:11.510> is<00:03:11.690> a<00:03:11.720> slight

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
for either their there is a slight

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.699 
for either their there is a slight
parasitic<00:03:14.510> load<00:03:15.879> naturally<00:03:16.879> with<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.150> car

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
parasitic load naturally with the car

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.339 
parasitic load naturally with the car
we<00:03:18.709> have<00:03:18.859> things<00:03:19.099> running<00:03:19.670> oh<00:03:19.700> so<00:03:20.659> slightly<00:03:20.959> so

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
we have things running oh so slightly so

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:31.809 
we have things running oh so slightly so
let's<00:03:22.069> start<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.430> up<00:03:29.650> start<00:03:30.650> it<00:03:30.950> right<00:03:31.069> up<00:03:31.250> no

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
let's start it up start it right up no

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.559 
let's start it up start it right up no
problem

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.699 

check<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.409> voltmeter<00:03:37.810> now<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:38.840> did<00:03:39.140> get<00:03:39.409> a

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
check the voltmeter now I did get a

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.699 
check the voltmeter now I did get a
little<00:03:40.280> bit<00:03:40.549> of<00:03:40.700> course<00:03:41.290> here<00:03:42.290> we<00:03:42.319> are<00:03:42.439> it's

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
little bit of course here we are it's

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.420 
little bit of course here we are it's
going<00:03:43.189> right<00:03:43.370> back<00:03:43.579> up

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.250 

so<00:03:47.269> there<00:03:47.450> you<00:03:47.569> have<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:49.060> ultra<00:03:50.060> capacitors<00:03:50.269> as

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
so there you have it ultra capacitors as

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.120 
so there you have it ultra capacitors as
a<00:03:52.250> car<00:03:52.939> battery
