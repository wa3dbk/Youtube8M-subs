00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.349
 hello my little lovers 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.300
 epic battles with you slayer and therefore 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.849
 my allowed as I managed to take 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.160
 Radley Walters on apt-1 tank 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:23.279
 Fight level 5 I KV-1S fugasnitsa it 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:27.539
 1110 cumulative checks and meet the first 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:31.109
 sacrifice called pc 1c she happily 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:35.130
 takes damage 1st cumulative check and was 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.530
 armor it does not have the word quite another 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.270
 little victim 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:44.340
 but unfortunately I have time to fall into balance 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.450
 suggests that we have a chance to win 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.000
 our 57 percent and basically this 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.410
 good balance 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.360
 send another cumulative to this 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.250
 time i took t1 heavy 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.489
 he is pleasant because he has frontal armor 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.579
 rather weak and accordingly 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.650
 cumulative despite his nerve 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.750
 even well past the forehead there 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.990
 the category was miracles you b and so 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.460
 that i didn't break the cover the cover didn't break 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.020
 general nonsense some settled in the area 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.479
 ammunition new payments did not explode 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.479
 You lived now 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.890
 in fact after the cumulative trip 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.200
 they have become less and less effective than 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.690
 you earlier you now have them government 40 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.390
 it was breaking through 160 and with this plan from 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.479
 grew up here this point of view is all 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:42.520
 certainly not as rosy as it was before 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:47.259
 before version 86, here comes version 87 and we 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.360
 see another guy on from 35 out of 35 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.380
 great foot machine and in that case 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.509
 when nazleet square 1 another 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.100
 suicide and another frag 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.710
 it took two very little time even 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.170
 fucked not yet I already filled five 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.410
 frags and from our team merged 10 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.440
 man of 15 maybe so sure 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.650
 saying strangely here I allowed a big 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.670
 mistake and profitable mistake are watching them 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.670
 in my back. 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.350
 that is, I chased after 34 and in the end 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.330
 grabbed a lot give 1 2 almost 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.270
 would die if my partner let me 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.920
 Now I not have been finished off although it may be 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.170
 either myself yes without me then 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.740
 more frags 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:41.700
 but somehow so me closed the engine would 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.140
 additional repair kit I'm here 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.110
 I do not have here still extinguisher 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.780
 It costs because apt-1 has such 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.430
 not weak prone to fading therefore 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.990
 I don't need 2 repair kits here 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.250
 now try to shoot sneeze it 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.250
 of course we will see 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.550
 I get into the building sneeze happily finishes 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.430
 pressed up to us is killing our stool and not 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:12.210
 watch case I switched to land mines 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.110
 and you just saw a shot of faith then 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.940
 have faith shot and bye 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.090
 see a horde without light without some 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.530
 even the information of the whole is not bad for us 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.650
 3 enemy vehicles left 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.780
 four cars that is, it is already clear that 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.110
 KV-1 is quite capable of dragging itself and 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.870
 the most funny thing is that looking at 2 penetration 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:38.130
 in the area of ​​the engine, I still spend 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.640
 the engine was not crit was not complete 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.490
 fire 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:46.590
 to take another one destroying 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.980
 a great distance of 300 3 meters this is very 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.810
 good condition for y-11 usual 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.030
 certainly not falling at that distance 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.100
 but it got here and like it more 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.270
 two thousand points of damage and mind serval seven 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.610
 enemy machines and now will 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.620
 almost final phase on here all those 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.480
 same three cars start with mutual 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.340
 capture 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.750
 one car for each of you is worth and 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.980
 let's see what this whole thing will end 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.850
 shoot at random 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.940
 without getting capture do not shoot down and completely 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.440
 my partner and I think what to do 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.630
 our frame 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.590
 Apt-1 and still standing on the grip on 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.800
 enemy base we are standing and trying 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.550
 protect our smear put 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.460
 and mx and he is a very successful shot. 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.470
 takes all the damage on yourself and crashes into 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.770
 hangar fills is experienced q-1 my 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.720
 the task to bring down the seizure on its own has become 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.460
 I hit our very little damage and shoot down 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.680
 the capture is exactly steve but there on the capture 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.180
 worth even this does not correspondingly 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:56.090
 now my buddy dad will be shot down 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:58.849
 capture from this does not look like 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.550
 him to do it in the meantime at the enemy 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:05.900
 Capturing two tanks from us one that is 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:09.199
 it is necessary by all means I need to bring down 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.789
 I charged the last cumulative by the way 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.330
 saying don't really like washing bins 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.469
 on whom 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:18.830
 especially in such a case when it is not clear 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:19.900
 what to expect if all the projectile is not clear 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.629
 where did you fly 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.719
 but the most important thing is that he managed a partner 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:28.370
 captured and, accordingly, mine now 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:30.770
 mission just as well shoot down the grip and 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.719
 hope that our little man is up to 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.229
 take the base 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:39.500
 someone we will now do it for me 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:41.569
 another landmine is loaded and there is no closer 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.639
 so that may even be at the cost of his death 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:45.979
 grab but not actually 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:49.000
 it took successfully captured 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:51.440
 enemy base and see the results of the year 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.169
 magnificent fight on apt-1 received 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.479
 awards redley walters steel medal 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:06:00.979
 wall warrior and spartan 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:03.590
 inflicted almost 2,700 damage hit 12 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:06.319
 once destroyed 8 enemy vehicles 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:10.129
 steel wall provided 20 hits 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:12.680
 at 2000 no clones as a whole would be 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:14.210
 very nice money again of course not 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.190
 earned a brain because bullet 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.259
 cumulative 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.990
 it was especially nice that this is the first 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:23.449
 the fight and even during the action was therefore 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.190
 even in the morning and put everything on like
