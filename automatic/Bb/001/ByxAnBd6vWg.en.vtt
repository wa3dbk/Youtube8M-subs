00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 because of this tutorial we have 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.580
 a problem almost always when we have 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:12.420
 a tablet like this in this case is a 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.280
 a little old tablet which made me 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.940
 try to look for the topic on the internet 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.070
 but I could not find it 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.440
 if you see me when I turn it on I had a 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:26.060
 problem I put it to load with a 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:28.050
 cell phone on top and the touchpad left 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.150
 to work 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.129
 you wait for the time to pass to see if 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.050
 that is fixed look about the subject 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.850
 I found in many videos the ones 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.320
 they talked about how to repair it by changing the 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.440
 blade that has internal 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.880
 but in this case I could not do it if 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.040
 you can not find the spare 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.610
 maybe they take too long or have 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.579
 than sending it to another country to ask the 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.340
 factories in this case I recommend them 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.540
 a temporary solution until they can 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.910
 find the solution 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.350
 as you can realize not 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.030
 they work stable 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.220
 I can not unlock the in this case 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.170
 I can only press the button 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.409
 home to find me on the page 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:15.479
 main and only strong movements are 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:19.659
 those who perceive the tablet but I can not 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.900
 type anything then I came up with the 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:26.080
 idea of ​​getting an adapter 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:30.310
 the one I had on hand was a usb to 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.600
 ps2 to be able to connect the keyboard of the 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.200
 desktop 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.939
 and the mouse then I was surprised the 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.310
 idea of ​​saying I do not know if they will work 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.880
 because the tablet handles with a 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.079
 too small current 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.050
 we try ready let's see what happens 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:53.400
 normally a keyboard 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.700
 connected here 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.500
 if it would work because they sell and sell in 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.420
 a kind of small keyboard for the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.300
 tablet with a portal that makes 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.830
 look like a netbook then the problem 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.830
 It was if I detected the mouse 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.520
 and we connect this 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.470
 let's check 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.140
 you can see the keyboard 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.620
 if I support it 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.989
 the flashing light 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.430
 and we also have on the focus of the 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.549
 mouse 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.680
 if you can see there is a cursor 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:35.300
 that almost can not be distinguished because 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:38.850
 It is transparent but works 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.069
 we enter to watch a video 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.749
 and how can you see 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.749
 the cursor can be moved 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.270
 I can select 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.270
 any video 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.390
 and will play it without any problem 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.990
 we can give them pause 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.450
 and we can go out with the sky key on 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.280
 keyboard means that this can be 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.090
 a temporary solution while you 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.350
 find the spare they need 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.740
 to 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:24.420
 fix fixing your tablet in the case 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:27.180
 that the touch of the same is damaged 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.910
 and in my case I do not know if I can 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.290
 get the spare I will get a 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.689
 USB adapter 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.060
 but not with ps2 but with webs that 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:41.040
 same entry and exit to put a 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.829
 small mouse and a small keyboard 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.439
 to make this video look more attractive 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.280
 is made only for the purpose of 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:50.740
 indicate 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.930
 What is an android system as what 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.030
 they work on the tablet effectively 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.100
 this can get us out of trouble 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.720
 thank you very much for another video in case of 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.720
 find interesting things like these
