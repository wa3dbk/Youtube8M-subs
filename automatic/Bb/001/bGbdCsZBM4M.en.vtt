00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.860 

so<00:00:01.530> I<00:00:01.560> decided<00:00:01.979> to<00:00:02.159> do<00:00:02.340> another<00:00:02.870> hydroponics

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
so I decided to do another hydroponics

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.880 
so I decided to do another hydroponics
experiment<00:00:04.410> this<00:00:04.529> one's

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
experiment this one's

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.589 
experiment this one's
nft<00:00:05.600> nutrient<00:00:06.600> film<00:00:06.839> technique<00:00:08.300> I'll<00:00:09.300> show

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
nft nutrient film technique I'll show

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.560 
nft nutrient film technique I'll show
you<00:00:09.660> around

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
you around

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.490 
you around
so<00:00:12.570> they<00:00:12.719> cost<00:00:12.929> me<00:00:13.080> 30<00:00:13.349> quid<00:00:13.679> until<00:00:15.500> thought

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
so they cost me 30 quid until thought

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.250 
so they cost me 30 quid until thought
why<00:00:16.680> not<00:00:16.740> have<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.190> blast<00:00:19.550> so<00:00:20.990> see<00:00:21.990> what<00:00:22.170> it's

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
why not have a blast so see what it's

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.640 
why not have a blast so see what it's
made<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.609> see<00:00:23.609> all<00:00:23.699> words<00:00:24.260> this<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.410> where<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
made of see all words this is where the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.589 
made of see all words this is where the
nutrients<00:00:26.070> come<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.340> yeah<00:00:26.910> well<00:00:27.240> at<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.390> start

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
nutrients come in yeah well at the start

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.419 
nutrients come in yeah well at the start
of<00:00:27.810> reservoir<00:00:28.289> they<00:00:28.710> get<00:00:28.859> pumped<00:00:29.160> down<00:00:29.279> this

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
of reservoir they get pumped down this

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.440 
of reservoir they get pumped down this
tube<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.480> back<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.900> comes<00:00:31.320> back<00:00:31.529> up<00:00:31.710> here

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
tube on the back that comes back up here

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.229 
tube on the back that comes back up here
goes<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.660> there<00:00:34.340> and<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.430> flows<00:00:35.700> back<00:00:35.940> through

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
goes in there and it flows back through

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.319 
goes in there and it flows back through
this<00:00:36.360> tube<00:00:37.940> back<00:00:38.940> into<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> reservoir<00:00:41.329> so

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
this tube back into the reservoir so

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.150 
this tube back into the reservoir so
I've<00:00:42.390> got<00:00:42.600> two<00:00:43.320> touch<00:00:43.530> points.the<00:00:43.920> now<00:00:44.070> I've

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
I've got two touch points.the now I've

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.360 
I've got two touch points.the now I've
got<00:00:44.340> peppers<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:46.219> it's<00:00:47.219> matters<00:00:49.010> I've<00:00:50.010> done

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
got peppers and it's matters I've done

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.639 
got peppers and it's matters I've done
them<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:50.879> because<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.989> experiments

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
them like this because the experiments

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.369 
them like this because the experiments
rarely<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.280> see<00:00:53.629> if<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.840> plants<00:00:55.170> growing

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
rarely to see if the plants growing

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:03.100 
rarely to see if the plants growing
better<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.640> deep<00:00:57.180> water<00:00:57.480> or<00:00:58.910> shallow<00:00:59.910> water<00:01:00.480> so

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.679 

I'll<00:01:04.110> show<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.350> first<00:01:08.119> as<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.390> see<00:01:09.570> it's

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
I'll show you first as you can see it's

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.789 
I'll show you first as you can see it's
on<00:01:09.840> an<00:01:09.960> angle<00:01:10.400> so<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> water<00:01:12.439> collects<00:01:13.439> here

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
on an angle so the water collects here

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.460 
on an angle so the water collects here
but<00:01:14.640> at<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.390> end<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:15.780> flows<00:01:16.140> straight

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
but at this end it just flows straight

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.859 
but at this end it just flows straight
past<00:01:16.740> until<00:01:17.159> about<00:01:17.310> here<00:01:17.640> where<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.600> starts

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
past until about here where it starts

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.570 
past until about here where it starts
collecting<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:19.979> deeper

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.130 

so<00:01:23.580> that's<00:01:23.730> why<00:01:23.880> I'm<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.060> punch<00:01:24.300> I<00:01:24.510> set<00:01:24.810> out<00:01:24.960> like

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
so that's why I'm a punch I set out like

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.570 
so that's why I'm a punch I set out like
that<00:01:25.520> I've<00:01:26.520> got<00:01:26.700> two<00:01:27.420> tomatoes<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.860> then<00:01:29.130> two

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
that I've got two tomatoes and then two

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.640 
that I've got two tomatoes and then two
peppers<00:01:33.050> show<00:01:34.050> you<00:01:34.110> what's<00:01:34.290> going<00:01:34.380> on

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
peppers show you what's going on

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:45.630 
peppers show you what's going on
underneath<00:01:39.530> there's<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.710> roots

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.870 

I<00:01:45.700> have

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.140 

don't<00:01:49.450> miss<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.659> different<00:01:50.020> way<00:01:50.200> I've<00:01:50.530> not

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
don't miss a different way I've not

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.990 
don't miss a different way I've not
grown<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:53.260> plants<00:01:53.409> in<00:01:54.130> Rockwall<00:01:54.640> straight

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
grown the plants in Rockwall straight

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.280 
grown the plants in Rockwall straight
away<00:01:55.270> I've<00:01:56.170> taken<00:01:56.590> them<00:01:56.770> from<00:01:56.979> soil<00:01:57.370> and<00:01:58.290> then

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
away I've taken them from soil and then

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.890 
away I've taken them from soil and then
clean<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.680> roots<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:01.180> is<00:02:01.390> what<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.660> start

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
clean the roots this is what the start

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.390 
clean the roots this is what the start
offers<00:02:04.350> these<00:02:05.350> need<00:02:05.560> me<00:02:05.710> planning<00:02:06.070> they're<00:02:06.369> a

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
offers these need me planning they're a

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.010 
offers these need me planning they're a
really<00:02:06.580> big<00:02:06.700> for<00:02:07.119> what<00:02:07.300> the<00:02:07.420> pots<00:02:07.630> are<00:02:07.840> but

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
really big for what the pots are but

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.570 
really big for what the pots are but
they're<00:02:08.830> in<00:02:08.920> soil<00:02:09.720> starting<00:02:10.720> in<00:02:10.869> soil<00:02:11.580> just

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
they're in soil starting in soil just

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.520 
they're in soil starting in soil just
standard<00:02:13.000> compost<00:02:14.550> clean<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.670> roots<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:17.020> put

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
standard compost clean the roots and put

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.620 
standard compost clean the roots and put
them<00:02:17.650> in<00:02:17.709> these<00:02:17.830> net<00:02:18.070> pops<00:02:18.390> dump<00:02:19.390> all<00:02:19.540> the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
them in these net pops dump all the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.020 
them in these net pops dump all the
routes<00:02:19.840> through<00:02:20.110> so<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.620> can<00:02:20.770> see<00:02:21.100> they've

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
routes through so you can see they've

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.960 
routes through so you can see they've
been<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.300> about<00:02:22.510> week<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.320> room<00:02:23.970> already

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
been is about week and the room already

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.430 
been is about week and the room already
starting<00:02:25.570> to<00:02:25.630> get<00:02:26.520> pretty<00:02:27.520> good<00:02:28.209> new<00:02:29.170> roots

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
starting to get pretty good new roots

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.990 
starting to get pretty good new roots
you<00:02:29.680> can't<00:02:29.920> really<00:02:30.100> see<00:02:30.400> sorry

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
you can't really see sorry

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.420 
you can't really see sorry
crap<00:02:31.600> camera<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:35.320> can<00:02:35.500> see<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.830> big<00:02:36.220> white

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
crap camera you can see the big white

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.710 
crap camera you can see the big white
roots<00:02:36.700> sticking<00:02:37.600> out<00:02:38.730> yeah<00:02:39.730> getting<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.510> bit<00:02:40.660> of

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
roots sticking out yeah getting a bit of

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.750 
roots sticking out yeah getting a bit of
an<00:02:40.840> algae<00:02:41.110> problem<00:02:41.530> which<00:02:41.739> I<00:02:41.920> believe<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.550> down

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
an algae problem which I believe is down

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:50.729 
an algae problem which I believe is down
to<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.700> reservoir<00:02:47.730> which<00:02:48.730> is<00:02:48.989> it<00:02:49.989> Switzer

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
to the the reservoir which is it Switzer

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.750 
to the the reservoir which is it Switzer
if<00:02:51.489> that's<00:02:51.760> got<00:02:51.940> something<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.300> do<00:02:52.600> with<00:02:52.630> it

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
if that's got something to do with it

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.430 
if that's got something to do with it
which<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:54.940> might<00:02:55.090> be<00:02:55.150> about<00:02:55.570> it's<00:02:56.019> anything<00:02:56.230> to

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
which it might be about it's anything to

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.080 
which it might be about it's anything to
do<00:02:56.530> with<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.739> little<00:02:56.980> gaff<00:02:57.220> there<00:02:57.549> cuz<00:02:57.880> that's

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
do with a little gaff there cuz that's

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.500 
do with a little gaff there cuz that's
so<00:02:58.330> small<00:03:00.330> so<00:03:01.380> there<00:03:02.380> you<00:03:02.440> go<00:03:02.620> more<00:03:03.040> all<00:03:04.000> that's

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
so small so there you go more all that's

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.350 
so small so there you go more all that's
new<00:03:05.079> roots<00:03:05.320> at<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.530> bottom<00:03:05.829> the<00:03:06.790> Brahma<00:03:07.060> stuff

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
new roots at the bottom the Brahma stuff

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.160 
new roots at the bottom the Brahma stuff
at<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.540> top<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:09.400> old<00:03:09.549> roots<00:03:09.910> so<00:03:10.630> yeah

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
at the top is the the old roots so yeah

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.319 
at the top is the the old roots so yeah
growing<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:13.860> nice<00:03:14.860> one<00:03:15.130> this<00:03:15.880> one's<00:03:16.090> grown

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
growing a nice one this one's grown

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.170 
growing a nice one this one's grown
roots<00:03:16.510> right<00:03:16.870> at<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.140> end<00:03:17.230> so<00:03:17.860> I<00:03:18.250> don't<00:03:19.090> know

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
roots right at the end so I don't know

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.000 
roots right at the end so I don't know
if<00:03:19.239> you<00:03:19.299> can<00:03:19.450> see<00:03:19.720> in<00:03:19.900> there<00:03:20.110> either<00:03:20.380> with<00:03:20.860> his

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
if you can see in there either with his

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.729 
if you can see in there either with his
third<00:03:21.430> camera<00:03:23.970> but<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.060> war<00:03:25.239> is<00:03:26.049> just<00:03:26.350> running

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
third camera but the war is just running

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.580 
third camera but the war is just running
straight<00:03:27.459> past<00:03:27.970> this<00:03:28.209> one<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:32.290> waters

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
straight past this one so the waters

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.120 
straight past this one so the waters
flowing<00:03:32.860> down<00:03:33.160> here<00:03:34.530> so<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.650> roots<00:03:35.860> here

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
flowing down here so the roots here

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.910 
flowing down here so the roots here
trying<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:36.760> go<00:03:36.880> towards<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.450> deeper<00:03:37.920> deeper

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
trying to go towards the deeper deeper

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.030 
trying to go towards the deeper deeper
end<00:03:39.220> enough<00:03:40.030> you'll<00:03:40.360> say<00:03:40.690> but<00:03:40.720> there's<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.769> lot

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
end enough you'll say but there's a lot

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.650 
end enough you'll say but there's a lot
more<00:03:42.070> water<00:03:42.640> of<00:03:42.850> this<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.269> it's<00:03:44.160> it's<00:03:45.160> about

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
more water of this and it's it's about

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:54.900 
more water of this and it's it's about
an<00:03:46.660> inch<00:03:46.810> deep<00:03:48.390> maybe<00:03:49.390> two<00:03:49.630> inches

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.730 

and<00:03:55.910> after<00:03:56.600> a<00:03:56.630> week<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:56.840> can<00:03:57.140> already<00:03:57.350> see

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
and after a week you can already see

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.550 
and after a week you can already see
that<00:03:59.800> the<00:04:00.800> two<00:04:01.130> in<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.400> shallow<00:04:01.670> end<00:04:02.560> will

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
that the two in the shallow end will

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.920 
that the two in the shallow end will
flow<00:04:03.830> in<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:05.440> there<00:04:06.440> are<00:04:06.890> a<00:04:07.100> lot<00:04:07.160> smaller<00:04:07.930> than

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
flow in and there are a lot smaller than

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.580 
flow in and there are a lot smaller than
these<00:04:09.170> ones<00:04:12.730> these<00:04:13.730> doing<00:04:14.120> really<00:04:14.300> well<00:04:14.990> these

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
these ones these doing really well these

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:24.460 
these ones these doing really well these
ones<00:04:15.830> are<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:16.460> lot<00:04:16.610> smaller<00:04:17.090> so<00:04:23.290> see<00:04:24.290> all<00:04:24.350> the

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
ones are a lot smaller so see all the

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:32.350 
ones are a lot smaller so see all the
six<00:04:24.680> very<00:04:25.010> good<00:04:28.810> thanks<00:04:29.810> for<00:04:29.840> watching
