00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
for tons of surprises and then I had a

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.740 
for tons of surprises and then I had a
few<00:00:26.310> clips<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.730> show<00:00:26.910> now<00:00:27.359> from<00:00:27.599> what<00:00:27.720> I

can<00:00:27.869> gather<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> live<00:00:29.010> show<00:00:29.310> that

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
can gather this is a live show that

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.519 
can gather this is a live show that
takes<00:00:29.699> place<00:00:29.970> between<00:00:30.179> actual<00:00:30.779> shows<00:00:31.199> on

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.219 
bad and if it just airs between episodes
then<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.530> can't<00:01:31.770> go<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:31.950> for<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.400> long<00:01:32.460> and

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
then it can't go on for that long and

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.390 
then it can't go on for that long and
from<00:01:34.229> what<00:01:34.439> I've<00:01:34.560> seen<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> Nickelodeon

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
from what I've seen on the Nickelodeon

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.280 
from what I've seen on the Nickelodeon
website<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.360> from<00:01:36.659> what<00:01:36.780> I've<00:01:36.900> seen<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
website and from what I've seen of the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.200 
website and from what I've seen of the
show<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.979> really<00:01:38.340> doesn't<00:01:38.610> look<00:01:38.729> like<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.060> is

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
show it really doesn't look like this is

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.670 
show it really doesn't look like this is
something<00:01:39.509> that's<00:01:39.600> gonna<00:01:39.780> last<00:01:39.869> very<00:01:40.380> long

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
something that's gonna last very long

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.410 
something that's gonna last very long
you<00:01:41.310> remember<00:01:41.579> when<00:01:41.700> Cartoon<00:01:42.030> Network<00:01:42.270> had

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
you remember when Cartoon Network had

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.090 
you remember when Cartoon Network had
the<00:01:42.509> thumb<00:01:42.780> wrestling<00:01:43.170> federation<00:01:43.829> thing

the thumb wrestling federation thing

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.580 
the thumb wrestling federation thing
between<00:01:44.280> episodes<00:01:44.850> no<00:01:45.420> that's<00:01:46.170> because<00:01:46.350> it

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
between episodes no that's because it

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.480 
between episodes no that's because it
didn't<00:01:46.799> last<00:01:46.920> very<00:01:47.070> long

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
didn't last very long

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.609 
didn't last very long
networks<00:01:48.270> do<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.659> from<00:01:48.810> time<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.200> time<00:01:49.229> they

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
networks do this from time to time they

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.289 
networks do this from time to time they
have<00:01:49.829> these<00:01:50.040> shows<00:01:50.340> between<00:01:50.610> segments

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
have these shows between segments

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.819 
have these shows between segments
usually<00:01:51.600> they<00:01:51.930> don't<00:01:52.049> last<00:01:52.290> very<00:01:52.439> long

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
usually they don't last very long

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.010 
usually they don't last very long

that
but<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.570> lot<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.899> cases<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.409> get<00:02:01.500> these

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
but in a lot of cases you get these

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.859 
but in a lot of cases you get these
segments<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.280> last<00:02:02.579> maybe<00:02:02.939> up<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.420> year<00:02:03.479> at

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
segments that last maybe up to a year at

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.770 
segments that last maybe up to a year at
most<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.799> yeah<00:02:05.280> as<00:02:05.610> far<00:02:05.880> as<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.149> see<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:06.600> is

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
most so yeah as far as I see it this is

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.330 
most so yeah as far as I see it this is
complete<00:02:07.200> mediocrity<00:02:07.920> here

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340
