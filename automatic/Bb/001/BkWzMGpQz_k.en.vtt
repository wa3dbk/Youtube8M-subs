00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.260
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.210
 show how to make a folding of 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.730
 rabbit napkins on the occasion of 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.500
 easter to realize this folding it you 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.470
 white towels are needed 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.700
 preferably I start by taking my 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.660
 white paper towel 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:32.000
 so I just unfold it in two and I 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.000
 the filled like this 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:40.179
 so we take the tip right and we 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.179
 there comes back to center 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.719
 I do the same thing on the other side 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.770
 I return my towel in this direction 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:03.860
 since also the other side we get 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.830
 this one 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:11.260
 and we just fold a second 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.260
 times in this sense 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.070
 we start to see the 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:27.580
 rabbit ears and now that we 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:33.610
 just close the little point we close 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:35.330
 in two the rabbit and we will come stuck 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.370
 inside 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:43.240
 the greenhouse quickly and then mobilize 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.240
 ears 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.940
 you get a little rabbit 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.310
 paper towel 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.510
