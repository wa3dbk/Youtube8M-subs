00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
because you're doing better than them

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.460

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
so I kill few people and then just go

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.130 
so I kill few people and then just go
elsewhere<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.920> do<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> lot<00:01:44.610> I'm<00:01:45.240> a

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
elsewhere and I do that a lot I'm a

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.050 
elsewhere and I do that a lot I'm a
Killa<00:01:46.380> person<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.009> I'll<00:01:47.189> go<00:01:47.399> around<00:01:47.520> and

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
Killa person and I'll go around and

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.670 
Killa person and I'll go around and
right<00:01:48.600> now<00:01:48.720> I'm<00:01:48.930> actually<00:01:49.079> just<00:01:49.320> going<00:01:49.500> around

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
right now I'm actually just going around

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.010 
right now I'm actually just going around
the<00:01:49.890> whole<00:01:50.040> outside<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.880> map<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.299> I

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
the whole outside of the map and I

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.480 
the whole outside of the map and I
usually<00:01:52.170> do<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.439> always<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.100> scrap<00:01:53.460> yard

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
usually do that always on a scrap yard

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.639 
usually do that always on a scrap yard
because<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.659> kind<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.990> small<00:01:55.200> map<00:01:55.409> and

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
because it's kind of a small map and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.990 
because it's kind of a small map and
like<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.890> said<00:01:56.009> if<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.250> go<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.579> middle<00:01:56.880> you

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
like I said if you go in the middle you

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.510 
like I said if you go in the middle you
will<00:01:57.149> die<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.659> do<00:01:58.049> use<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.680> tactical<00:01:59.130> layout<00:01:59.310> so

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
will die I do use the tactical layout so

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.370 
will die I do use the tactical layout so
a<00:01:59.549> knifing<00:02:00.030> for<00:02:00.240> me<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.420> beat<00:02:00.659> not<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.049> analog

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
a knifing for me is beat not the analog

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.410 
a knifing for me is beat not the analog
stick<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:02.250> do<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.579> because<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:03.270> makes

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
stick and I do this because it makes

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.749 
stick and I do this because it makes
actually<00:02:03.840> like<00:02:04.020> Crouching<00:02:04.860> ducking<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.610> all

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
actually like Crouching ducking and all

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.240 
actually like Crouching ducking and all
that<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.939> lot<00:02:06.149> easier<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.680> Killiks<00:02:08.069> i'm

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
that a lot easier and the Killiks i'm

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.170 
that a lot easier and the Killiks i'm
using<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:09.050> predator<00:02:10.050> harrier<00:02:10.410> pavelow

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
using is a predator harrier pavelow

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.240 
using is a predator harrier pavelow
I<00:02:11.420> like<00:02:11.989> to<00:02:12.019> use<00:02:12.260> these<00:02:12.409> because<00:02:12.680> that<00:02:13.010> way<00:02:13.099> I'm

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
I like to use these because that way I'm
