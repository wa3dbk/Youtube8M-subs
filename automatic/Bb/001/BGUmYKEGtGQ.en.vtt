00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:15.480
 I liked the Lord of Tube now. 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.490
 there are those who talk about xii is stockman for more 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.070
 a video for the channel nÃ© 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.930
 it was maybe I'm having a simple video 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.260
 here of pokÃ©mon make radio 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.310
 It is a question that many people have that it is 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:34.140
 as the codes side and 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:37.770
 hard walls says 737 is 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:43.620
 and I will now be doing this is with a 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:46.200
 Of the simplest ones to the USA can x Chile 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.250
 This is going to appear this is not 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.809
 unlikely 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.750
 now I'm in shock she appears this is the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.149
 line that will pick up those codes that I 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.859
 I will leave the link of this challenge here in 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.809
 subscription 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.890
 and you will get the codes for example 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.170
 master coaching 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.760
 you need to activate the hurt and 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.640
 propositive all other codes 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.710
 so if you copy this here is a control c 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.830
 control v edital other name but changed 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.570
 of putting his advice only that still gives 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:24.659
 touch warning codes cause you to do this 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.900
 game come are different codes 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.060
 may not work correctly ok under 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.100
 same with him 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.870
 and it will appear two here is normal and 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:43.030
 next but arrived late vagner love 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:46.450
 game tea and again, and put the code 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.430
 master entrance hall of the appliances is 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.360
 For you it produces power through the house. 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.360
 it's with the walls, right? 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.270
 You're ready to cross walls. 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.690
 no ok 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:06.330
 when activated and then go to code 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:12.880
 cross walls alone control c 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:17.590
 cross walls 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.840
 Okay, okay, go back to the game and try. 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:26.590
 cross the device when the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:29.920
 activated to accelerate from here 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:34.390
 fully functioning 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:38.610
 now we will come back here we will come back 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.690
 here we try to catch the code 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.310
 israel king 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.880
 I do not think they have tea in a file. 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.880
 code 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:03:06.630
 i heard endless copy that i picked there 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:08.630
 that end of the shock ok and come in 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.810
 zin time instead israel who are there 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.560
 they arrive here in the pokemon center 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:23.750
 here in the 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:23.750
 the situation here is so yes pc women 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:33.390
 to establish this purpose item that does not 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.300
 I do not think it's getting ready 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.930
 here is going to have the riches they are 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:43.980
 infinite 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:45.810
 if you pick up and can pick up any 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.660
 amount 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:53.760
 then it will appear 35 more by 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:58.860
 For example, just take one less than 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:03.930
 which appears to be clean 34 when it appears 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.830
 a handle a little more an affront to 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.930
 99 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.489
 just get caught getting yours 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:14.220
 bag will fill items out of here let's go 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:17.760
 here in the purse 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.979
 Take the one that's unleashed hot to 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.919
 who does not know what it is used for 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.190
 stage that mounts of hot pudahuel 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.960
 because sauce with level 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:33.630
 now let's try the marseille code 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:38.940
 ball pee all this in a mall here 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:42.900
 in the code of the infinite marcel ball you 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:45.990
 it's the same time male 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.380
 bought to see how ready it is from here 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:53.449
 corinthians but soccer or who here in the 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:59.520
 computer alone again the new there 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:05:04.470
 the cheap rude pc's bce and I'll be there 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.190
 dyetron here looks to be if not me 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:13.729
 mistake 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:16.260
 She goes straight to the bag but soccer 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:21.449
 You can use these good marches. 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:24.270
 fundamentals she goes she will they will 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:29.130
 we are going to use the new students need 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.870
 not even catch them is by example 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.050
 quantity as you pick up the 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:38.250
 riches is not only you using it will 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:40.349
 continue to appear then this is the 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:45.449
 basic is to put the codes and 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:49.020
 here pee all this and activated the game 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:52.289
 shock so basic in practice the codes 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.419
 then you can use this against 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:57.599
 codes for example I'll leave one with 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:06:01.680
 link of a website in the description is the site I 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:03.889
 I just got some and that's not what it is. 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.590
 so that you have learned to 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:10.849
 put the bodies a farrelly pokÃ©mon is 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.849
 said that
