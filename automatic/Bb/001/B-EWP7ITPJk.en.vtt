00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.379
 it is him everyone is Saturday 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:11.929
 boss today i'm going to give you a 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:14.460
 code or honda as you want it 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:24.180
 for the part you call it when you 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:26.430
 want and the code got there it's a 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.929
 super code that allows you to have the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:35.160
 LÃ¤nder gate is a village there 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.070
 no forge it's the only roof one 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.629
 death here this code 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.860
 is that there are no forges so 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.860
 you go to the well 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.870
 and for those who embarked if the same 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.219
 if it's the same village as the one in 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.649
 the video where I explain how 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.820
 multiply 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.449
 I will put maybe the link in the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:13.740
 description 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:16.610
 not sure I walked torch must be well 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.140
 the keys because otherwise the monsters 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.140
 they will easily bend themselves 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:34.150
 but here you continue here there is 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:38.690
 always the same stairs ah thin 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:43.460
 and a door and it's there with a sonar 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:46.220
 of silver son whose case it is 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.229
 a few times you undermine if the perfect 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.259
 I see it appear 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:55.850
 embarrassing 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:58.090
 ah yes so I have a mine behind there 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.090
 a mine 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.000
 there is also the wick not know if it's 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.000
 the same 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.410
 So here it is really a real 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.570
 minutes of the weight of the rails is all alone 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.560
 well here it was five thousand of our 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:22.750
 kids for a code it was very simple 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.750
 and the boss that's helping me
