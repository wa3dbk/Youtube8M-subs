00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.900
 but 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.050
 but 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.530
 but 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.180
 a and 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.660
 but 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.340
 not my man did not get along 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:44.920
 insolvent not too handsome he 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:48.020
 i'm just not worthy of a real goat 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.150
 how often do we women say such 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.489
 words and sometimes worse in address 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.130
 another chosen one who is not 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.070
 justified our hopes and dreams and here I am 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.670
 thought how to choose this 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.520
 a man 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.590
 According to psychologists, choose a satellite 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.690
 life is necessary on the grounds that 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.850
 point to your compatibility with it 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.740
 if the relationship doesn't suit 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.810
 for any reason do not be afraid of them 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.860
 break by what signs can 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.890
 judge the compatibility of your pair 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.440
 smell of course i'm not talking about smell 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.979
 perfume it comes to its natural 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.590
 smells 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.970
 according to biologists, we are unpleasant 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.290
 perceive the smell of man 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.140
 opposite sex 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.560
 possessing the most similar set 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.649
 genes 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.720
 on ours and with such a combination sharply 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.960
 increases the chance to transfer to posterity 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.759
 hereditary diseases and vice versa if 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.310
 we are attracted by the smell 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.149
 the opposite sex 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.880
 then the person is endowed 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.069
 genes as dissimilar to ours as possible. 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.440
 with such a partner, the children are healthy and 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:54.470
 beautiful and talented take only 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.560
 the best of life from parents 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.119
 values yes and no matter how much I was told 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.100
 that absolute opposites 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.860
 I pull into it 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.200
 I refuse to believe any life 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.810
 priorities must be the same 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.849
 After all, imagine if you have 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.099
 first plan love is yours 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.530
 chosen one it will be very difficult 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.250
 find a compromise in the value system and 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.340
 to find 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.709
 common point if a man 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.830
 radically different from you something he 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.860
 Probably all you do not fit and what 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.690
 the older you are and the man the less flexible those 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.360
 this rule is getting stronger and 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.459
 stronger to avoid such 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.769
 disappointments can talk to him on 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.050
 different topics from attitude to parents 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.270
 home owe 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.150
 steam parenting and movies and 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.100
 books even assure these few topics 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.310
 it will be quite enough to understand 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.290
 do you fit each other or not character 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.330
 and temperament 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.340
 a personâ€™s character is always important if 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.500
 any character traits chosen 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.500
 annoys you and you cannot now 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.410
 they put up then throw this thing is not 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.240
 it's worth breaking yourself and convincing the opposite 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.850
 also if you believe a psychologist is considered 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.640
 that most compatible people with similar 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.680
 temperaments for example choleric 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.810
 sanguine am sanguine with phlegmatic 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.550
 phlegmatic and melancholic just 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.550
 remember that fewer points 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:22.000
 the touch and interests of the more difficult 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:25.120
 find common ground and agree not 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.160
 build illusions before tackling 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.940
 searching for the one and only 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.920
 unique 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.340
 try to understand that men and women 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.570
 differ from each other not only 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.390
 physiological is very important 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.280
 feel that men and women 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.100
 different and learn to perceive men 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.950
 as they are and do not fall into 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.390
 illusions and pink dreams man difficult 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.730
 at the same time be strong and courageous 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.340
 earn good money and in doing so 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.310
 perfectly cook to understand fashion and 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.720
 accessories love TV shows 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.770
 do not like trousers 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.230
 football and beer 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.330
 he is what he is and important 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:06.400
 perceive love him exactly like this 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.560
 and love summer we so often confuse love 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.500
 and love try to understand 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.630
 whether you love or just in love if we 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.090
 in love, then we think only of our own 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.830
 comfort next to a partner and when we 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.109
 love someone I think first of all about 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.360
 the comfort of your soul mate next to 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.160
 us if you are ready to live with it 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.530
 man in grief and joy to the end 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.930
 life even if something happens 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.419
 bad then we can safely say that it is 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.300
 love and creepers with you who you are
