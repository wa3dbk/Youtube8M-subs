 let's put an onion a rich date 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.810
 so humble to remember for half of 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.690
 all ways simply because it's more 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.670
 cheap and there's not much with this either 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:23.180

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.670

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.240
 ingredient wonders the garlic a trick

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.369
 pose using a knife to process 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.410
