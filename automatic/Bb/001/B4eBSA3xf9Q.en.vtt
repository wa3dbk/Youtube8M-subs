00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
a cool figure to begin with so I had to

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.850 
a cool figure to begin with so I had to
have<00:00:52.469> him

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
have him

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.069 
have him
nothing<00:00:53.430> sculpted<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.090> him<00:00:54.539> everything's

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
nothing sculpted on him everything's

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.779 
nothing sculpted on him everything's
just<00:00:55.170> paint<00:00:55.500> lines<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.039> only<00:00:56.219> thing<00:00:56.399> sculpted

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
just paint lines the only thing sculpted

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.220 
just paint lines the only thing sculpted
obviously<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> head<00:00:57.600> otherwise<00:00:57.840> its

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
obviously is the head otherwise its

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.099 
obviously is the head otherwise its
standard<00:00:58.680> DC<00:00:59.010> Universe<00:00:59.340> Classics<00:00:59.550> body<00:01:00.109> with

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
standard DC Universe Classics body with

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.439 
standard DC Universe Classics body with
the<00:01:01.410> ring<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.520> his<00:01:02.760> finger

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the ring on his finger

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.170 
the ring on his finger
I<00:01:03.530> believe<00:01:04.530> all<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.920> Rings<00:01:05.189> are<00:01:05.580> sculpted<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
I believe all the Rings are sculpted the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.969 
I believe all the Rings are sculpted the
same<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.420> don't<00:01:06.600> think<00:01:07.020> any<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.530> different

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
same I don't think any of the different

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.130 
same I don't think any of the different
Lantern<00:01:08.430> rings<00:01:08.640> are<00:01:09.000> sculpted<00:01:09.720> differently

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
Lantern rings are sculpted differently

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.620 
Lantern rings are sculpted differently
so<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.770> all<00:01:10.890> standard<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:12.299> ring<00:01:12.479> is

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
so it's all standard the ring is

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.990 
so it's all standard the ring is
metallic<00:01:13.140> though<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:14.010> blue<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> you've

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
metallic though the blue is a you've

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.170 
metallic though the blue is a you've
relatively<00:01:15.540> uniform<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.229> all<00:01:16.380> seems<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.770> match

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
relatively uniform it all seems to match

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.330 
relatively uniform it all seems to match
pretty<00:01:18.180> nicely<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.930> lines<00:01:19.170> are<00:01:19.619> relatively

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
pretty nicely the lines are relatively

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.190 
pretty nicely the lines are relatively
crisp<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.000> no<00:01:21.150> complaints<00:01:21.630> there<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.080> not
