 exercise at home cardio does not have 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.450
 this change does not count then if it is of 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.119
 only cardio the first one not training 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.830

 time is that type 5 to 7 is there is for 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.010
 professional bodybuilding that go 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.290
 between 5 and 6 days of the week working 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.170
 a different muscle group per day 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.600
 let's choose the normal 2 to 3 here 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.080
 are the month March being Morphos is 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.660
 a normal person and the difficult ones of 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.280
 generate muscles we are forums the 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.930
 well-skinny people who do not get fat 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.820
 and endorses and that they have a structure of 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.940
 very thin body let's be saying 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.850
 with normal genetic normal while 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.040
 your stature give us in centimeters say 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.170
 what do you do put two centimeters and if 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.100
 you put in centimeters and vice versa in 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.050
 inches 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.390
 now let's interpret the information 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.010
 this part is very important this number 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.020
 from here is the amount of muscle that 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.440
 I would win if you were in growth be 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.510
 adolescents between 16 to 20 years 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.610
 they're going to find a number here that's the 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.890
 amount of pounds weight that you're going to 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.080
 win just for growth so do not go 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.150
 to the gym so do not do anything this 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.350
 second number here this is the amount 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.630
 of muscle that you go 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.160
 for being a novice in training 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.800
 weights or exercises at home 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.420
 muscle strengthening if you've never done 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.130
 done reinforcement exercise 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.930
 muscle this is the amount you 're going to 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.070
 win by being a rookie for being a 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.080
 person who is just entering the 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.880
 system your body reacts much more 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.250
 fast and earn much more muscle date 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.870
 account how we put up here less than 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.650
 two years of training that's why 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.750
 we have 2.1 extra pounds and here is your 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.030
 ordinary number to gain muscle that 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.120
 are 5.2 pounds of which he spoke 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.710
 then you have a total of 7.3 pounds 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.290
 that this person with these 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.939
 characteristics will win 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.680
 remember depending on the information 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.109
 that you have put your numbers up here 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.329
 they will vary and that gives you an estimate 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.969
 remember that being exact is not that 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.290
 it's the amount but it's very close to the 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:02.760
 amount of muscle you can earn 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.319
 depending on your training and your 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.379
 variables 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.079
 now this little board here is a 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.709
 prediction to the maximum amount of 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:15.780
 muscle that you can increase 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.549
