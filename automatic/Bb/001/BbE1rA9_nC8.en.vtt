the<00:00:36.360> garden<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.190> reason<00:00:38.460> why<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.579> haven't

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
the garden and the reason why I haven't

the garden and the reason why I haven't
is<00:00:39.059> because<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.390> first<00:00:39.600> time<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.079> put<00:00:41.010> these

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
is because the first time I put these

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.690 
is because the first time I put these
beds<00:00:41.370> together<00:00:42.379> it<00:00:43.379> was<00:00:43.559> quite<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> project<00:00:44.309> for

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.590 
husband actually held the saw and cut it
for<00:00:59.129> me<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.430> then<00:00:59.489> I<00:01:00.239> screwed<00:01:00.510> everything

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
for me and then I screwed everything

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.619 
for me and then I screwed everything
together<00:01:01.070> but<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.370> was<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.090> they<00:01:03.570> were

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
together but it was a and they were

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.329 
together but it was a and they were
still<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:04.019> fifty<00:01:04.379> dollars<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:05.010> for<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
still like fifty dollars just for the

still like fifty dollars just for the
materials<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.770> was<00:01:07.890> quite<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.189> project

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760

this and i think it was 69 and it was a

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.509 
this and i think it was 69 and it was a
composite<00:03:12.720> material<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.319> some<00:03:13.530> sort<00:03:13.829> and<00:03:14.040> it

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
composite material of some sort and it

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.759 
composite material of some sort and it
was<00:03:14.609> more<00:03:14.760> pretty<00:03:14.970> it's<00:03:15.359> like<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.569> like<00:03:16.530> redwood

very unusual for my area we might get

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.920 
very unusual for my area we might get
