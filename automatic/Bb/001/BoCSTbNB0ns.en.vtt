done with all that nonsense should be

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.000 
done with all that nonsense should be
set<00:05:40.220> up<00:05:40.460> and<00:05:41.080> you<00:05:42.080> go<00:05:42.229> back<00:05:42.260> to<00:05:42.470> your<00:05:42.620> flash

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
set up and you go back to your flash

i usually use VPS BP 6 frame rate i keep
at<00:05:59.259> 30<00:06:00.990> my<00:06:01.990> input<00:06:02.319> size<00:06:02.500> I<00:06:02.530> videos<00:06:03.069> on<00:06:03.250> your

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
at 30 my input size I videos on your

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.360 
at 30 my input size I videos on your
internet<00:06:03.699> connection<00:06:03.729> and<00:06:05.039> computer<00:06:06.039> i<00:06:06.069> guess

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
internet connection and computer i guess

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:14.059 
internet connection and computer i guess
i<00:06:07.800> keep<00:06:08.800> my<00:06:08.919> 960<00:06:09.610> x<00:06:09.759> 540<00:06:10.210> it's<00:06:10.479> half<00:06:10.659> of<00:06:11.470> 10<00:06:11.710> DDP

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:14.069 
i keep my 960 x 540 it's half of 10 DDP

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:16.800 
i keep my 960 x 540 it's half of 10 DDP
so<00:06:15.069> that's<00:06:15.280> 5<00:06:15.550> 40<00:06:15.849> p<00:06:15.940> i'm<00:06:16.060> guessing<00:06:16.419> the

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
so that's 5 40 p i'm guessing the

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.439 
so that's 5 40 p i'm guessing the
bitrate<00:06:17.770> i<00:06:17.949> have<00:06:18.159> a<00:06:18.190> 1500<00:06:18.940> but<00:06:19.150> that<00:06:19.270> also

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:19.449 
bitrate i have a 1500 but that also

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:22.830 
bitrate i have a 1500 but that also
varies<00:06:19.810> the<00:06:19.930> internet<00:06:20.229> connection<00:06:21.840> out

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
varies the internet connection out

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:29.159 
varies the internet connection out
besides<00:06:23.349> i<00:06:23.530> have<00:06:23.560> 640<00:06:24.130> x<00:06:24.310> 360<00:06:27.750> that's<00:06:28.750> about<00:06:29.139> it

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.169 
besides i have 640 x 360 that's about it

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:32.760 
besides i have 640 x 360 that's about it
i<00:06:29.620> got<00:06:29.770> the<00:06:29.919> audio<00:06:30.250> set<00:06:30.970> to<00:06:31.090> stereo<00:06:31.509> mix<00:06:31.780> pick

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
i got the audio set to stereo mix pick

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.930 
i got the audio set to stereo mix pick
