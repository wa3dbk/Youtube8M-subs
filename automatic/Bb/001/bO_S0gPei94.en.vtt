00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:03.110
 efe 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.110
 efe 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.130
 in that year simplifies the feel pressure that has to do with 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:14.389
 exponents 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.300
 so here he observed that we have a five and a seven in what in which to see 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.280
 with the bases 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.970
 3 and 13 5 and 23 and 23 and things these are going to be able to simplify each other these 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.179
 also this has nothing to do I do not know that I will leave it the same 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.829
 therefore recurrent in division or has the same base the exponents are 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.260
 subtract so let's put 5 and 7 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.830
 what we have here 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.130
 and we put the base 13 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.900
 and we're going to put the exponent above that binds us first x5 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.190
 and less because in division they are subtracted 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.530
 the exponent below that is a 2 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.530
 and we put it here the next base that is 23 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.690
 stephen that means multiply 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.690
 and I put the exponent above 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.730
 this - is from the division 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.040
 and we are going to put the sign the other number that is also a negative and 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.650
 noticed that put 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.750
 noted that no pot jan two signs together therefore he's going to have to 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.250
 apply the mayor of the exponents 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.240
 and I put 5 sevenths 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.340
 13 and here they are going to subtract these I have a 3 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.360
 pekin 23 and less for less is more so I would stay two +5 that gives a 7 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.690
 Reitzel 7 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.740
 efe then this was what can simplify des expression 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.120
 and so you want to multiply pc7 that is down 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.380
 let's put it like that 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.570
 frequent you have one below that has one below 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.540
 and the multiplication of fractions of this the top ones or the bottom ones as well 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.660
 that seven by one by one I have seven down 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.540
 the 5 that multiplies the thirteen the 3 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.540
 and he 23 at 7 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.340
 stoke garcÃ­a simplified quero 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.750
 as a comment when the arrest of exponents and they are negative 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.160
 means that if you have to go down for example your girlfriend was 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.169
 -7 then here at the time wrote this way down and 23 and I put 7 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.909
 because c-7 means that it does not go up if it does not go down that factor
