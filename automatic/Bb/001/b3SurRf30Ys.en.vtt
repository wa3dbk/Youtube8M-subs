I<00:03:41.739> can't<00:03:42.739> believe<00:03:43.069> to<00:03:43.310> be<00:03:43.430> honest<00:03:43.819> that<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.180> was

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
I can't believe to be honest that I was

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.140 
I can't believe to be honest that I was
that<00:03:44.959> much<00:03:45.109> bigger<00:03:45.379> I<00:03:45.799> had<00:03:46.159> kind<00:03:46.370> of<00:03:46.519> gotten<00:03:47.030> to

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
that much bigger I had kind of gotten to

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.210 
that much bigger I had kind of gotten to
the<00:03:47.269> point<00:03:47.450> where<00:03:47.569> I<00:03:47.720> was<00:03:47.989> I<00:03:48.290> guess<00:03:48.950> you<00:03:49.069> could

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
the point where I was I guess you could

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.399 
the point where I was I guess you could
say<00:03:49.250> I<00:03:49.400> was<00:03:49.519> used<00:03:49.760> to<00:03:49.909> myself<00:03:50.420> even<00:03:51.109> though<00:03:51.319> I

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
say I was used to myself even though I

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.339 
say I was used to myself even though I
actually<00:03:51.769> did<00:03:52.310> spend<00:03:53.180> most<00:03:53.569> of<00:03:53.840> my<00:03:53.989> teenage

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
actually did spend most of my teenage

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.119 
actually did spend most of my teenage
years<00:03:54.500> being<00:03:55.189> a<00:03:55.430> kind<00:03:55.730> of<00:03:55.819> a<00:03:55.909> thin<00:03:56.180> fit<00:03:56.510> person

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
years being a kind of a thin fit person

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.270 
years being a kind of a thin fit person
um<00:03:58.719> when<00:03:59.719> I<00:03:59.750> got<00:03:59.870> overweight<00:04:00.530> of<00:04:00.709> course<00:04:01.040> at

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
um when I got overweight of course at

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.530 
um when I got overweight of course at
first<00:04:01.489> when<00:04:01.760> I<00:04:01.819> first<00:04:02.090> started<00:04:02.389> gaining

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
first when I first started gaining

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.300 
first when I first started gaining
weight<00:04:02.689> it<00:04:02.989> was<00:04:03.079> really<00:04:03.379> devastating<00:04:04.069> for<00:04:04.280> me

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
weight it was really devastating for me

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.050 
weight it was really devastating for me
but<00:04:04.970> you<00:04:05.120> know<00:04:05.239> after<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.780> few<00:04:06.230> years<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:07.340> when

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
but you know after a few years and when

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.319 
but you know after a few years and when
it<00:04:08.209> became<00:04:09.099> when<00:04:10.099> I<00:04:10.129> got<00:04:10.370> into<00:04:10.579> the<00:04:10.700> situation

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
it became when I got into the situation

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.569 
it became when I got into the situation
where<00:04:11.540> I<00:04:11.900> really<00:04:12.439> couldn't<00:04:12.799> do<00:04:12.919> much<00:04:13.069> about<00:04:13.280> it

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
where I really couldn't do much about it

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.550 
where I really couldn't do much about it
I<00:04:13.700> had<00:04:13.909> very<00:04:14.239> bad<00:04:14.419> health<00:04:14.689> at<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.019> time<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:15.500> I

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
I had very bad health at the time and I

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.150 
I had very bad health at the time and I
couldn't<00:04:15.769> exercise<00:04:16.070> I<00:04:16.880> was<00:04:17.359> very<00:04:17.479> depressed

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
couldn't exercise I was very depressed

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.390 
couldn't exercise I was very depressed
and<00:04:19.160> so<00:04:19.459> um<00:04:20.329> basically<00:04:20.840> I<00:04:21.199> got<00:04:21.799> used<00:04:22.039> to<00:04:22.160> myself

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
and so um basically I got used to myself

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.210 
and so um basically I got used to myself
I<00:04:22.910> just<00:04:23.150> kind<00:04:23.570> of<00:04:23.599> adjusted<00:04:24.110> my<00:04:24.289> mindset<00:04:24.710> to

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
I just kind of adjusted my mindset to

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.820 
I just kind of adjusted my mindset to
just<00:04:25.849> feel<00:04:26.030> like<00:04:26.150> well<00:04:26.360> this<00:04:26.690> is<00:04:26.870> just<00:04:27.349> how<00:04:27.680> I'm
