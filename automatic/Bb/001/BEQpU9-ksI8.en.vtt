00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 at

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.870
 mainly on the nique jane so 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.840
 there you today look so lon 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.030
 was born on December 26 at 13h52 on 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.560
 the ps on the psn and I managed to me 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.480

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.500
 a gameplay so already there you can 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.570
 see at the same time about the gameplay that has 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.880
 a little problem there is more snow 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.690
 in gta 5 online frankly it's 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.280
 really disgusting 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.470
 so I will try to send a 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.120
 message on rockstar support for 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.670
 try to see if he could not 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.900
 to make a come on say a small gesture in 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.190
 putting the snow back for a little 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.600
 week of something like this because 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.220
 that really really is really 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.830
 disgusting people who do not have 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.090
 could play at the console on the 24th and the 25th and 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.979
 family time for the holidays and 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.780
 stuff like that they could not even 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.100
 play with the snow there are people 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.210
 who could not even have the gifts 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.789
 so the unpublished hood 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.140
 the pyrotechnic launcher the ammunition 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.549
 and all so it's little stuff to 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.039
 but it's still interesting to 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.079
 have and not have them because 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:28.450
 people have fun in the ddos 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.700
 so psn servers and xbox live 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.869
 so it's really disgusting that 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.249
 you do not hesitate to put in 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.679
 comment what you think about it all 

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:37.090
 therefore the situation of the attacks of 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.579
 lizards this code and because of the blow we 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.469
 could not take advantage of this dlc so that 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.969
 the snow has disappeared that it is not 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:44.229
 more there and that we are even frankly 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.189
 I did not even have time to do 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.210
 a video I wanted to do a little 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.590
 video drift on the snow 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.450
 I could not even find it 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.889
 really disgusting so you do not hesitate 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.499
 not also to put a little I like on 

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:54.939
 the video if you think like me here and 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:57.159
 if you find it normal then that 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.549
 rockstar adds a little week of 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.109
 snow 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.380
 for sure the problem is not coming 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:04.569
 directly from rockstar but moment one 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.920
 small compensation what and so here 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.149
 I will leave you in these pictures 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.020
 guys I'm not going to ask you if the 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.520
 video you call in my opinion 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.030
 the information is still pretty 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.740
 disgusting 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.050
 do not hesitate anyway dropped a little 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.310
 blue thumbs if you liked the video and 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.290

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.349
 I read them one of the times I do not answer 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.420
 but I read a lot of comments and 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.680
 I use it to make the videos of 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.780
 blow when I speak I can give 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.190
 really a common opinion of the community 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.140
 it's really more interesting 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.310

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.310
