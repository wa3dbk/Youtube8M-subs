absolute beast when it comes to

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.450 
absolute beast when it comes to
performance<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.660> it<00:00:07.319> really<00:00:07.560> shows<00:00:07.919> when<00:00:08.280> you

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
performance and it really shows when you

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.879 
performance and it really shows when you
do<00:00:10.700> virtualized<00:00:11.700> software<00:00:12.420> it's<00:00:12.660> insane<00:00:13.620> I

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
do virtualized software it's insane I

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.410 
do virtualized software it's insane I
mean<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.519> Xperia<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.089> windows

experience on the macbook pro

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.750 
experience on the macbook pro
virtualized<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.660> better<00:00:19.199> than<00:00:19.500> any<00:00:19.800> PC

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
virtualized is better than any PC

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.679 
virtualized is better than any PC
experience<00:00:21.000> i've<00:00:21.359> ever<00:00:21.539> used<00:00:22.820> mainly<00:00:23.820> because

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689

of the the responsiveness of the
multi-touch<00:00:30.330> trackpad<00:00:31.850> so<00:00:32.850> i<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.480> just

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
multi-touch trackpad so i can just

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.319 
multi-touch trackpad so i can just
double<00:00:35.160> tap<00:00:35.840> see<00:00:36.840> here<00:00:36.989> let<00:00:37.320> me<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.590> show<00:00:37.710> you

is a windows XP running on parallels
parallels<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> virtual<00:00:58.230> virtualization

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
parallels is a virtual virtualization

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.579 
parallels is a virtual virtualization
software<00:00:59.870> if<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:01.109> turn<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.770> window<00:01:02.070> nope<00:01:02.730> and

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
software if we turn the window nope and

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.039 
software if we turn the window nope and
it's<00:01:04.589> an<00:01:04.799> absolute<00:01:05.339> joy<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.030> must<00:01:06.600> say<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.990> is

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
it's an absolute joy I must say this is

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.990 
it's an absolute joy I must say this is
one<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.439> reasons<00:01:07.830> why<00:01:08.010> because<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.820> need

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
one of the reasons why because I need

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.060 
one of the reasons why because I need
some<00:01:09.260> business<00:01:10.260> software<00:01:10.439> running<00:01:10.890> on

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
some business software running on

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.219 
some business software running on
Windows<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:12.030> an<00:01:12.150> absolute<00:01:12.630> joy<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.900> use

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
Windows and it's an absolute joy to use

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.109 
Windows and it's an absolute joy to use
so<00:01:13.890> let's<00:01:14.130> let's<00:01:14.490> take<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> look<00:01:14.970> at<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
so let's let's take a look at the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.830 
so let's let's take a look at the
performance<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.990> I'm<00:01:16.140> opening<00:01:16.770> words<00:01:17.840> 2007

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
performance so I'm opening words 2007

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.560 
performance so I'm opening words 2007
BAM<00:01:21.290> Excel<00:01:22.290> BAM<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.390> mean<00:01:24.390> its<00:01:24.810> power<00:01:25.799> point

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
BAM Excel BAM I mean its power point

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.910 
BAM Excel BAM I mean its power point
what<00:01:27.570> else<00:01:28.970> BAM<00:01:30.770> it's<00:01:31.770> real<00:01:32.009> real<00:01:32.189> snappy<00:01:32.700> and

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
what else BAM it's real real snappy and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.840 
what else BAM it's real real snappy and
another<00:01:34.920> cool<00:01:35.189> thing<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.460> let's<00:01:36.119> turn<00:01:36.600> this

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
another cool thing is let's turn this

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.940 
another cool thing is let's turn this
virtualized<00:01:40.490> software<00:01:41.490> let's<00:01:42.180> suspend<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.950> so

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
virtualized software let's suspend it so

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.910 
virtualized software let's suspend it so
let<00:01:44.130> me<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.369> show<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.520> here<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.000> we've<00:01:45.920> quit

situations where you can notice a little

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.449 
situations where you can notice a little
bit<00:03:29.280> of<00:03:29.459> heating<00:03:30.269> is<00:03:30.480> when<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:30.959> play<00:03:31.459> games

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
bit of heating is when you play games

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.539 
bit of heating is when you play games
really<00:03:32.879> heavy<00:03:33.680> games<00:03:34.680> or<00:03:34.950> you're<00:03:35.099> watching

1080p flash for longer than a half an

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.909 
1080p flash for longer than a half an
hour<00:03:38.669> and<00:03:39.000> then<00:03:39.230> you<00:03:40.230> need<00:03:40.379> to<00:03:40.500> kick<00:03:40.680> on<00:03:40.889> the

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
hour and then you need to kick on the

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.650 
hour and then you need to kick on the
fan<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:41.459> I'm<00:03:41.549> going<00:03:41.699> to<00:03:41.730> turn<00:03:41.910> on<00:03:42.060> medium<00:03:42.419> on<00:03:42.540> up

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
and you can hear it still barely

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:57.740 
and you can hear it still barely
noticeable<00:03:51.799> let's<00:03:52.799> crank<00:03:53.489> it<00:03:53.639> up<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:56.750> higher

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
noticeable let's crank it up to higher

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:09.690 
noticeable let's crank it up to higher
rpm

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.170
