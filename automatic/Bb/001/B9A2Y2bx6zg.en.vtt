gotten with the plane and as you can see

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:07.760 
gotten with the plane and as you can see
he's<00:00:07.109> finished<00:00:07.410> it

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
he's finished it

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.620 
he's finished it
I've<00:00:08.460> just<00:00:08.670> been<00:00:08.820> by<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.090> other<00:00:09.300> field

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
I've just been by the other field

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.680 
I've just been by the other field
noticed<00:00:10.440> he's<00:00:10.559> halfway<00:00:10.800> down<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.250> so<00:00:11.790> he's

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
noticed he's halfway down that so he's

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.950 
noticed he's halfway down that so he's
not<00:00:12.840> done<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> bad<00:00:13.259> job<00:00:14.570> he's<00:00:15.570> finished<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
not done a bad job he's finished the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.230 
not done a bad job he's finished the
headland<00:00:16.520> it's<00:00:17.520> still<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> little<00:00:17.940> bit<00:00:18.150> of

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
headland it's still a little bit of

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.090 
headland it's still a little bit of
grass<00:00:18.390> sticking<00:00:18.750> up<00:00:18.990> there<00:00:19.170> but<00:00:19.410> that's<00:00:19.890> the

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
grass sticking up there but that's the

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.740 
grass sticking up there but that's the
way<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.310> goes<00:00:20.340> sometimes<00:00:20.520> as<00:00:21.180> he<00:00:21.359> was<00:00:21.570> saying

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
way it goes sometimes as he was saying

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.240 
way it goes sometimes as he was saying
to<00:00:21.869> me<00:00:21.900> earlier<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.320> quite<00:00:22.500> rocky<00:00:22.710> here<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.189> you

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
to me earlier is quite rocky here so you

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.359 
to me earlier is quite rocky here so you
can't<00:00:23.490> always<00:00:23.550> get<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> plow<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:25.250> but<00:00:26.250> it's

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
can't always get the plow in but it's

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.580 
can't always get the plow in but it's
looking<00:00:26.609> good<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.019> they'll<00:00:28.019> be<00:00:28.109> back<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.439> roll

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
looking good so they'll be back to roll

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.050 
looking good so they'll be back to roll
this<00:00:28.800> at<00:00:28.949> some<00:00:29.099> point<00:00:29.130> try<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.760> conserve<00:00:30.000> the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
this at some point try and conserve the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.600 
this at some point try and conserve the
moisture<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.929> then<00:00:31.710> they'll<00:00:31.859> rate<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.250> 8<00:00:32.430> it

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
moisture and then they'll rate of 8 it

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.190 
moisture and then they'll rate of 8 it
to<00:00:32.730> get<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> seed<00:00:33.180> bed<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.750> then<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.079> be

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
to get the seed bed and then it be

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.830 
to get the seed bed and then it be
drilled<00:00:34.440> with<00:00:34.590> maize<00:00:35.480> probably<00:00:36.480> not<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
drilled with maize probably not to the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.490 
drilled with maize probably not to the
end<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.170> month

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
end of the month

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.420 
the field again and Terry's now I got a
crumble<00:00:48.239> Iran<00:00:48.420> here<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:49.620> that's<00:00:49.920> gonna

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
crumble Iran here and that's gonna

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.170 
crumble Iran here and that's gonna
basically<00:00:51.210> break<00:00:51.690> down<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> plague<00:00:53.180> those

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
basically break down the plague those

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.990 
basically break down the plague those
Springs<00:00:54.780> or<00:00:55.140> things<00:00:55.440> at<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.649> front<00:00:56.000> they

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
Springs or things at the front they

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.119 
Springs or things at the front they
level<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.079> out<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.500> then<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> thing<00:00:58.920> behind

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
level it out and then the thing behind

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:11.679 
level it out and then the thing behind
break<00:00:59.430> fill<00:00:59.640> up<00:00:59.940> there<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:00.960> go

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.450 

it's<00:01:12.109> quite<00:01:12.289> a<00:01:12.320> big<00:01:12.530> hefty<00:01:12.740> machine<00:01:13.159> is<00:01:13.280> free

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
it's quite a big hefty machine is free

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.929 
it's quite a big hefty machine is free
wide<00:01:15.039> he's<00:01:16.039> already<00:01:16.189> been<00:01:16.369> over<00:01:16.520> it<00:01:16.759> a<00:01:16.789> couple

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
wide he's already been over it a couple

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.730 
wide he's already been over it a couple
of<00:01:17.240> times<00:01:17.479> so<00:01:17.810> it's<00:01:18.079> actually<00:01:18.350> pretty<00:01:18.499> broke

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
of times so it's actually pretty broke

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.960 
of times so it's actually pretty broke
broken<00:01:19.039> down

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.760 

when<00:01:25.900> you<00:01:25.990> think<00:01:26.140> that<00:01:26.200> would<00:01:26.320> supply<00:01:26.530> that

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
when you think that would supply that

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.290 
when you think that would supply that
field<00:01:27.040> that's<00:01:27.250> pretty<00:01:27.490> uneven<00:01:27.790> couldn't

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
field that's pretty uneven couldn't

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.640 
field that's pretty uneven couldn't
really<00:01:28.390> walk<00:01:28.600> on<00:01:28.780> it<00:01:28.870> very<00:01:28.960> easily<00:01:29.140> now<00:01:29.470> it's

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
really walk on it very easily now it's

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:36.380 
really walk on it very easily now it's
actually<00:01:30.040> quite<00:01:30.880> a<00:01:30.910> nice<00:01:31.060> seed<00:01:31.360> bed

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.160 

here<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.050> go<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:38.630> so<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.690> can<00:01:39.900> pretty<00:01:40.080> well

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
here we go that so you can pretty well

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.200 
here we go that so you can pretty well
you<00:01:40.710> know<00:01:40.860> we're<00:01:41.160> not<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.400> far<00:01:41.640> off<00:01:41.700> planning

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
you know we're not that far off planning

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.240 
you know we're not that far off planning
although<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.690> few<00:01:43.320> more<00:01:43.470> passes<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.040> think<00:01:44.160> he's

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
although a few more passes I think he's

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.740 
although a few more passes I think he's
gonna<00:01:45.440> top<00:01:46.440> rate<00:01:46.650> video<00:01:46.830> something<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.520> then

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
gonna top rate video something and then

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.750 
gonna top rate video something and then
