the<00:00:12.280> geometry<00:00:12.850> is<00:00:13.059> one<00:00:13.389> of<00:00:13.510> the<00:00:13.600> defining

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:13.959 
the geometry is one of the defining

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.920 
the geometry is one of the defining
elements<00:00:14.590> of<00:00:14.760> all<00:00:15.760> of<00:00:16.150> Breezer<00:00:16.480> bikes<00:00:16.660> but

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
elements of all of Breezer bikes but

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.749 
elements of all of Breezer bikes but
especially<00:00:17.529> these<00:00:17.770> longer<00:00:18.160> travel<00:00:18.580> all

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:18.759 
especially these longer travel all

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.050 
especially these longer travel all
mountain<00:00:19.240> and<00:00:19.420> duro<00:00:19.779> bikes<00:00:20.160> repack<00:00:21.160> is<00:00:21.310> 160

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
mountain and duro bikes repack is 160

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.870 
mountain and duro bikes repack is 160
millimeters<00:00:22.540> of<00:00:22.689> travel<00:00:22.950> 27<00:00:23.950> inch<00:00:24.099> 5<00:00:24.279> wheels

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
millimeters of travel 27 inch 5 wheels

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.089 
millimeters of travel 27 inch 5 wheels
so<00:00:25.300> you've<00:00:25.419> got<00:00:25.570> big<00:00:25.810> wheels<00:00:26.050> with<00:00:26.380> big<00:00:26.619> travel

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
so you've got big wheels with big travel

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:28.950 
so you've got big wheels with big travel
anyone<00:00:28.000> that's<00:00:28.149> gotten<00:00:28.390> a<00:00:28.419> chance<00:00:28.570> to<00:00:28.809> ride

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
anyone that's gotten a chance to ride

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.139 
anyone that's gotten a chance to ride
with<00:00:29.169> Joe<00:00:29.380> before<00:00:29.619> knows<00:00:30.130> Joe<00:00:30.730> doesn't<00:00:30.910> go

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:31.149 
with Joe before knows Joe doesn't go

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.270 
with Joe before knows Joe doesn't go
slow<00:00:31.419> down<00:00:31.660> hills<00:00:31.960> he<00:00:32.380> doesn't<00:00:32.680> want<00:00:32.860> to<00:00:32.950> and

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
slow down hills he doesn't want to and

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.319 
slow down hills he doesn't want to and
I'm<00:00:33.340> not<00:00:33.460> sure<00:00:33.790> you<00:00:33.910> really<00:00:34.120> know<00:00:34.239> how<00:00:34.420> to<00:00:34.480> but

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
I'm not sure you really know how to but

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.520 
I'm not sure you really know how to but
so<00:00:37.329> keeping<00:00:37.600> up<00:00:37.690> with<00:00:37.899> Joe<00:00:38.079> on<00:00:38.260> all<00:00:38.380> these

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
so keeping up with Joe on all these

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.029 
so keeping up with Joe on all these
trails<00:00:38.860> is<00:00:39.130> is<00:00:39.610> a<00:00:39.790> challenge<00:00:40.359> and<00:00:40.769> it<00:00:41.769> really

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
trails is is a challenge and it really

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.639 
trails is is a challenge and it really
vets<00:00:42.550> out<00:00:42.789> that<00:00:43.239> we're<00:00:43.899> making<00:00:43.989> a<00:00:44.230> bike<00:00:44.410> that's

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
vets out that we're making a bike that's

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.549 
vets out that we're making a bike that's
designed<00:00:45.129> to<00:00:45.280> go<00:00:45.460> fast<00:00:46.149> down<00:00:46.420> hills<00:00:46.719> to<00:00:47.410> keep

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
designed to go fast down hills to keep

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.069 
designed to go fast down hills to keep
all<00:00:47.769> that<00:00:47.949> chaos<00:00:48.190> under<00:00:48.699> control<00:00:49.120> as<00:00:49.329> you're

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
all that chaos under control as you're

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:57.509 
all that chaos under control as you're
trying<00:00:50.289> to<00:00:50.410> ride<00:00:50.620> that<00:00:50.829> razor's<00:00:51.249> edge<00:00:56.309> as<00:00:57.309> we

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
trying to ride that razor's edge as we

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:58.860 
trying to ride that razor's edge as we
look<00:00:57.670> at<00:00:57.789> what's<00:00:57.940> going<00:00:58.089> on<00:00:58.300> in<00:00:58.570> geometry

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
look at what's going on in geometry

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.989 
look at what's going on in geometry
especially<00:00:59.739> for<00:00:59.920> this<00:00:59.980> new<00:01:00.190> category<00:01:00.460> which

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:00.999 
especially for this new category which

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:03.329 
especially for this new category which
is<00:01:01.149> so<00:01:01.359> popular<00:01:01.899> the<00:01:02.170> 27<00:01:02.710> 5<00:01:02.859> inch<00:01:03.100> wheel

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
is so popular the 27 5 inch wheel

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:05.969 
is so popular the 27 5 inch wheel
they're<00:01:03.940> not<00:01:04.150> taking<00:01:05.140> advantage<00:01:05.230> of<00:01:05.860> that

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
they're not taking advantage of that

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.310 
they're not taking advantage of that
bigger<00:01:06.250> wheel<00:01:06.580> and<00:01:06.909> this<00:01:07.060> is<00:01:07.240> where<00:01:07.479> Joe<00:01:08.290> is

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
bigger wheel and this is where Joe is

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.260 
bigger wheel and this is where Joe is
such<00:01:08.710> an<00:01:08.860> advantage<00:01:09.159> for<00:01:09.460> us<00:01:09.550> because<00:01:09.610> he<00:01:10.150> was

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
such an advantage for us because he was

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.820 
such an advantage for us because he was

what<00:01:28.040> I<00:01:28.070> try<00:01:28.400> to<00:01:28.430> do<00:01:28.700> is<00:01:28.909> take<00:01:29.210> advantage<00:01:29.810> of

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
what I try to do is take advantage of

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.140 
what I try to do is take advantage of
those<00:01:30.409> big<00:01:30.680> wheels<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:31.250> there<00:01:31.729> are<00:01:31.790> a<00:01:31.850> lot<00:01:31.909> of

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
those big wheels and there are a lot of

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.719 
those big wheels and there are a lot of
advantages<00:01:32.570> to<00:01:33.320> be<00:01:33.440> had<00:01:33.470> it's<00:01:34.190> not<00:01:34.280> just<00:01:34.610> about

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
advantages to be had it's not just about

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.600 
advantages to be had it's not just about
the<00:01:35.030> rolling<00:01:35.390> diameter<00:01:35.930> of<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:36.140> wheel<00:01:36.490> one<00:01:37.490> of

the rolling diameter of the wheel one of
the<00:01:37.700> most<00:01:37.940> important<00:01:38.810> things<00:01:39.020> about<00:01:39.200> the

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
the most important things about the

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.030 
the most important things about the
larger<00:01:39.860> wheel<00:01:40.040> size<00:01:40.280> is<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:41.000> increased

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
larger wheel size is the increased

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.620 
larger wheel size is the increased
fulcrum<00:01:43.040> height<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:43.670> know<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:43.910> front<00:01:44.150> axle

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630

up when you're climbing a hill it keeps

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.540 
up when you're climbing a hill it keeps
you<00:01:53.960> your<00:01:54.470> front<00:01:54.770> wheel<00:01:54.890> planted<00:01:55.130> on<00:01:55.430> the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
this project we looked at all the full

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.570 
this project we looked at all the full
suspension<00:02:34.720> systems<00:02:35.560> out<00:02:35.800> there<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.370> we

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
suspension systems out there and we

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.190 
suspension systems out there and we
really<00:02:36.880> felt<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:37.180> we<00:02:37.300> could<00:02:37.570> improve<00:02:37.690> on<00:02:38.050> it

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
really felt that we could improve on it

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.930 
really felt that we could improve on it
and<00:02:38.290> we<00:02:38.350> wanted<00:02:38.710> to<00:02:38.830> improve<00:02:38.980> on<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.550> full

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
and we wanted to improve on it full

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.120 
and we wanted to improve on it full
suspension<00:02:40.450> has<00:02:40.600> moved<00:02:40.810> so<00:02:41.020> far<00:02:41.350> over<00:02:42.040> the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
suspension has moved so far over the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.180 
suspension has moved so far over the
last<00:02:42.280> ten<00:02:42.580> years<00:02:42.610> lucky<00:02:43.510> for<00:02:43.690> us<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:45.040> guys

Joe and I one day about making a full

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.810 
Joe and I one day about making a full
suspension<00:02:56.190> asked<00:02:57.190> if<00:02:57.250> you're<00:02:57.400> interested<00:02:57.760> in

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
suspension asked if you're interested in

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.699 
suspension asked if you're interested in
doing<00:02:57.940> full<00:02:58.209> suspension<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.080> boy<00:02:59.500> were

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
doing full suspension and and boy were

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.360 
doing full suspension and and boy were
we

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.880

that is a design company ultimately we

that is a design company ultimately we
by<00:03:06.159> default<00:03:06.480> specialize<00:03:07.480> in<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.590> bicycle

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
by default specialize in the bicycle

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.280 
by default specialize in the bicycle
industry<00:03:09.099> and<00:03:09.640> our<00:03:10.420> specialty<00:03:10.840> really<00:03:11.200> is

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
industry and our specialty really is

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.960 
industry and our specialty really is
suspension<00:03:11.890> there's<00:03:12.129> not<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.370> lot<00:03:12.489> of<00:03:12.610> people

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
suspension there's not a lot of people

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.490 
suspension there's not a lot of people
that<00:03:13.090> know<00:03:13.239> a<00:03:13.269> lot<00:03:13.420> about<00:03:13.450> suspension<00:03:14.080> we<00:03:14.349> know

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
that know a lot about suspension we know

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.410 
that know a lot about suspension we know
a<00:03:14.530> lot<00:03:14.709> about<00:03:14.739> suspension<00:03:15.340> I<00:03:15.670> think<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.239> big

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
a lot about suspension I think the big

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.320 
a lot about suspension I think the big
thing<00:03:16.450> is<00:03:16.599> we<00:03:16.810> have<00:03:16.959> had<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:18.330> unsuccessful

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
thing is we have had a unsuccessful

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.770 
thing is we have had a unsuccessful
system<00:03:19.750> yeah<00:03:19.930> they<00:03:21.209> get<00:03:22.209> better<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.659> better

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
system yeah they get better and better

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.360 
system yeah they get better and better
the<00:03:23.049> more<00:03:23.079> that<00:03:23.349> we<00:03:23.470> develop<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.069> more<00:03:24.250> we

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
the more that we develop and the more we

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.190 
the more that we develop and the more we
learn<00:03:24.549> but<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.060> real<00:03:25.209> success<00:03:25.420> we've<00:03:25.810> had<00:03:25.840> is

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
learn but the real success we've had is

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.649 
learn but the real success we've had is
that<00:03:26.230> pretty<00:03:26.799> much<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:27.190> first<00:03:27.459> design<00:03:28.150> of<00:03:28.480> all

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:28.659 
that pretty much the first design of all

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.000 
that pretty much the first design of all
these<00:03:28.840> bikes<00:03:29.200> after<00:03:29.440> they<00:03:29.620> come<00:03:29.769> off<00:03:29.860> the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
these bikes after they come off the

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.240 
these bikes after they come off the
computer<00:03:30.629> does<00:03:31.629> what<00:03:31.840> we<00:03:31.959> expected<00:03:32.379> it<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.590> do

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.180 

as<00:03:36.569> we've<00:03:37.569> looked<00:03:37.720> at<00:03:37.930> how<00:03:38.410> full<00:03:38.650> suspension

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
as we've looked at how full suspension

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.559 
as we've looked at how full suspension
has<00:03:39.310> evolved<00:03:39.790> over<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.090> last<00:03:40.150> 10<00:03:40.540> years

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
has evolved over the last 10 years

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.110 
has evolved over the last 10 years

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
long link to super super short links

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.039 
long link to super super short links
where<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.670> pivot<00:03:49.030> locations<00:03:49.659> are<00:03:49.780> up<00:03:49.870> by<00:03:49.989> the

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
bottom bracket even so short that now

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.500 
bottom bracket even so short that now
the<00:03:52.359> pivot<00:03:52.629> is<00:03:52.959> an<00:03:53.109> eccentric<00:03:53.470> which<00:03:54.269> is<00:03:55.269> very

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
the pivot is an eccentric which is very

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.229 
the pivot is an eccentric which is very
short<00:03:55.680> with<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.799> M<00:03:56.920> link<00:03:57.129> system<00:03:57.370> it<00:03:57.940> keeps

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
short with the M link system it keeps

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.960 
short with the M link system it keeps
all<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.720> attributes<00:03:58.900> of<00:03:59.470> a<00:04:00.010> welded<00:04:00.609> fixed

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
all the attributes of a welded fixed

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.640 
all the attributes of a welded fixed
rear<00:04:01.150> triangle<00:04:01.480> which<00:04:01.930> is<00:04:02.079> a<00:04:02.109> rigid<00:04:02.349> system

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
rear triangle which is a rigid system

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.130 
rear triangle which is a rigid system
but<00:04:03.459> backs<00:04:03.849> away<00:04:04.090> from<00:04:04.239> the<00:04:04.599> super<00:04:04.900> short

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
but backs away from the super short

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.899 
but backs away from the super short
links<00:04:05.530> so<00:04:05.650> that<00:04:05.769> longer<00:04:06.069> link<00:04:06.459> gives<00:04:06.760> you<00:04:06.879> a

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
links so that longer link gives you a

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.559 
links so that longer link gives you a
much<00:04:07.180> smoother<00:04:07.889> plusher<00:04:08.919> travel<00:04:09.579> and<00:04:09.790> the

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
much smoother plusher travel and the

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.089 
much smoother plusher travel and the
bearings<00:04:10.930> actually<00:04:11.230> move<00:04:11.440> a<00:04:11.560> smaller<00:04:11.859> amount

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
bearings actually move a smaller amount

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.979 
bearings actually move a smaller amount
for<00:04:12.549> the<00:04:12.639> same<00:04:12.819> amount<00:04:13.090> of<00:04:13.150> rear-wheel<00:04:13.510> travel

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
for the same amount of rear-wheel travel

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.009 
for the same amount of rear-wheel travel
and<00:04:14.459> that's<00:04:15.459> a<00:04:15.790> great<00:04:16.120> system<00:04:16.510> for<00:04:16.570> keeping

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
and that's a great system for keeping

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.750 
and that's a great system for keeping
things<00:04:17.289> durable<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.039> for<00:04:18.280> keeping<00:04:18.579> them

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
things durable and for keeping them

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.659 
things durable and for keeping them

could<00:04:43.110> achieve<00:04:43.230> and<00:04:43.710> then<00:04:43.830> we<00:04:43.980> took<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.700> for<00:04:44.850> a

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
could achieve and then we took it for a

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.630 
could achieve and then we took it for a
spin<00:04:45.120> up<00:04:45.330> at<00:04:45.510> Tamarack<00:04:45.870> oh<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.440> and<00:04:46.740> oh<00:04:47.010> my

climb isn't this supposed to be more

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.910

like a downhill bike you know and and
and<00:04:53.310> then<00:04:53.490> we<00:04:53.670> went<00:04:53.760> downhill<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.390> it's<00:04:54.480> like

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
and then we went downhill and it's like

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.690 
and then we went downhill and it's like
holy<00:04:54.810> cow<00:04:55.140> it's<00:04:55.410> like<00:04:55.560> it<00:04:55.680> really<00:04:55.710> go<00:04:56.040> down<00:04:56.070> too

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
holy cow it's like it really go down too

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.990 
holy cow it's like it really go down too
and<00:04:57.200> and<00:04:58.200> it<00:04:58.380> just<00:04:58.410> seemed<00:04:58.740> like<00:04:58.770> this<00:04:59.460> is<00:04:59.610> a<00:04:59.640> do

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
and and it just seemed like this is a do

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.839 
and and it just seemed like this is a do
it<00:05:00.150> all<00:05:00.270> by

the engineers at Soto delivered such an
efficient<00:05:09.550> platform<00:05:10.150> for<00:05:10.599> going<00:05:10.870> uphill<00:05:11.020> and

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
efficient platform for going uphill and

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.890 
efficient platform for going uphill and
downhill<00:05:11.669> that<00:05:12.669> we<00:05:12.849> were<00:05:13.210> really<00:05:13.389> able<00:05:13.629> to

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
downhill that we were really able to

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.239 
downhill that we were really able to
create<00:05:14.139> a<00:05:14.169> bike<00:05:14.409> that<00:05:14.620> we<00:05:14.710> felt<00:05:14.979> didn't

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:15.249 
create a bike that we felt didn't

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.610 
create a bike that we felt didn't
sacrifice<00:05:15.759> anything<00:05:16.120> and<00:05:16.479> that's<00:05:17.080> fairly

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
sacrifice anything and that's fairly

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.439 
sacrifice anything and that's fairly

you have to give up some other component
of<00:05:26.409> how<00:05:26.560> it<00:05:26.710> rides<00:05:26.919> but<00:05:27.699> in<00:05:27.819> our<00:05:27.939> case<00:05:28.409> we<00:05:29.409> feel

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
of how it rides but in our case we feel

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.659 
of how it rides but in our case we feel
that<00:05:29.740> we've<00:05:29.830> been<00:05:29.979> able<00:05:30.069> to<00:05:30.189> create<00:05:30.400> a<00:05:30.490> bike

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
that we've been able to create a bike

that we've been able to create a bike
where<00:05:30.879> you<00:05:30.969> sacrifice<00:05:31.449> nothing

this bike spent two years in the making
for<00:05:39.040> us<00:05:39.190> so<00:05:39.400> it's<00:05:39.670> been<00:05:39.820> a<00:05:39.850> big<00:05:40.060> secret<00:05:40.330> and<00:05:40.720> to
