00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
use this called Tyvek tape because my

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.490 
use this called Tyvek tape because my
dad<00:00:52.829> works<00:00:53.100> for<00:00:53.219> them<00:00:53.870> this<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.079> right

dad works for them this is that right
here<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:55.920> very<00:00:55.980> strongly<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.210> kind<00:00:57.360> of

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
here it's very strongly it's kind of

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.950 
here it's very strongly it's kind of
like<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.750> packing<00:00:58.530> tape<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:59.100> much<00:00:59.820> more<00:01:00.660> sticky

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
like a packing tape but much more sticky

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.700 
like a packing tape but much more sticky
so<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.270> put<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> old<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.409> slosh

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
so it it we put it on the old can slosh

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.840 
so it it we put it on the old can slosh
bottle<00:01:05.129> opener<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:06.570> yeah<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.830> let<00:01:08.580> me<00:01:08.610> show

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
bottle opener and yeah so let me show

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.420 
bottle opener and yeah so let me show
you<00:01:08.880> how<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:09.630> did<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.080> all<00:01:10.650> right<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.189> with<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
you how we did it all right so with the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.480 
you how we did it all right so with the
magic<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.880> video<00:01:12.030> editing<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:13.310> went<00:01:14.310> back<00:01:14.460> to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
magic of video editing I went back to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.340 
magic of video editing I went back to
the<00:01:14.760> back<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.090> machine<00:01:15.450> where<00:01:15.780> we<00:01:16.020> see

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
the back of the machine where we see

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.130 
the back of the machine where we see
this<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.400> behind<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.939> old<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.840> size

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
this is the behind the old can size

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.149 
this is the behind the old can size
bottle<00:01:19.439> opener<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.799> can<00:01:19.890> see<00:01:20.330> that<00:01:22.159> there's

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
bottle opener you can see that there's

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.510 
bottle opener you can see that there's
the<00:01:23.310> old<00:01:23.430> box<00:01:23.700> down<00:01:24.000> there<00:01:24.170> well<00:01:25.170> since<00:01:26.070> you

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
the old box down there well since you

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.090 
the old box down there well since you
know<00:01:26.549> we<00:01:26.729> don't<00:01:26.880> need<00:01:27.060> those<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.570> anymore

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
know we don't need those that anymore

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.230 
know we don't need those that anymore
these<00:01:29.100> two<00:01:29.369> holes<00:01:29.549> which<00:01:29.790> were<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> back

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
these two holes which were in the back

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.460 
these two holes which were in the back
we<00:01:30.900> conveniently<00:01:31.229> put<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:33.659> data<00:01:34.170> cable

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
we conveniently put the the data cable

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.109 
we conveniently put the the data cable
and<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.610> power<00:01:35.820> cable<00:01:36.000> right<00:01:36.450> there<00:01:38.060> okay<00:01:39.060> so

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
and the power cable right there okay so

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.679 
and the power cable right there okay so
now<00:01:40.020> we're<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:40.530> up<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:41.040> door<00:01:41.509> this<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.659> the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
now we're at up to this door this is the

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.249 
now we're at up to this door this is the
door<00:01:42.750> with<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:44.540> coin<00:01:45.540> mechanism<00:01:45.810> and

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
door with the coin mechanism and

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.859 
door with the coin mechanism and
everything<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.890> well<00:01:47.700> we<00:01:48.119> open<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.570> and

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
everything in it well we open that and

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.630 
everything in it well we open that and
I'm<00:01:49.350> going<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.500> show<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.680> how<00:01:50.340> everything

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
I'm going to show you how everything

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.569 
I'm going to show you how everything
works<00:01:51.110> so<00:01:52.110> if<00:01:52.470> your<00:01:52.829> vending<00:01:53.220> machine<00:01:53.460> does

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
works so if your vending machine does

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.100 
works so if your vending machine does
not<00:01:53.610> have<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.000> cable<00:01:54.450> coming<00:01:54.630> from<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.960> coin

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
not have this cable coming from the coin

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.190 
not have this cable coming from the coin
mechanism<00:01:55.369> this<00:01:56.369> trick<00:01:57.180> will<00:01:57.360> probably<00:01:58.049> not

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
mechanism this trick will probably not

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.280 
mechanism this trick will probably not
work<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:59.119> sorry<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.329> those<00:02:00.479> that's<00:02:00.990> called<00:02:01.200> a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
work so sorry to those that's called a

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.910 
work so sorry to those that's called a
jones<00:02:01.530> plug<00:02:01.860> by<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.070> way<00:02:02.390> so<00:02:03.390> well<00:02:04.320> what<00:02:04.799> is

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
jones plug by the way so well what is

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.249 
jones plug by the way so well what is
this<00:02:05.219> prior<00:02:05.549> proprietary<00:02:06.329> connector<00:02:06.750> that

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
this prior proprietary connector that

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.229 
this prior proprietary connector that
goes<00:02:07.320> into<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.009> coin<00:02:08.489> mechanism<00:02:08.729> which<00:02:09.090> is

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
goes into the coin mechanism which is

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.820 
goes into the coin mechanism which is
probably<00:02:09.629> pretty<00:02:09.840> much<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.170> whole<00:02:10.319> brains<00:02:10.649> of

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
probably pretty much the whole brains of

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.280 
probably pretty much the whole brains of
the<00:02:10.890> machine<00:02:11.250> there's

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
the machine there's

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.320 
the machine there's
you<00:02:12.620> know<00:02:12.739> there's<00:02:12.980> that's<00:02:13.580> that<00:02:13.909> and<00:02:14.180> then

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
you know there's that's that and then

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.940 
you know there's that's that and then
you<00:02:14.689> know<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.989> coin<00:02:15.170> mechanism<00:02:15.409> controls

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
you know the coin mechanism controls

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.380 
you know the coin mechanism controls
everything<00:02:16.310> do<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.459> little<00:02:16.640> relay<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.269> then

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
everything do a little relay and then

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.509 
everything do a little relay and then
it's<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.230> very<00:02:18.379> simple<00:02:18.650> machine<00:02:18.920> I'll<00:02:19.250> tell<00:02:19.430> you

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
it's a very simple machine I'll tell you

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.429 
it's a very simple machine I'll tell you
that<00:02:19.549> much<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:20.569> it's<00:02:20.599> kind<00:02:21.049> of<00:02:21.079> hard<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.260> see

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:21.439 
that much so it's kind of hard to see

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.800 
that much so it's kind of hard to see
but<00:02:21.560> there's<00:02:21.769> two<00:02:21.920> rows<00:02:22.189> and<00:02:23.150> two<00:02:23.450> loading

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
but there's two rows and two loading

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.350 
but there's two rows and two loading
steps<00:02:24.049> came<00:02:24.409> a<00:02:24.470> little<00:02:24.739> bit<00:02:24.860> better<00:02:25.060> okay<00:02:26.060> so

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
steps came a little bit better okay so

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.759 
steps came a little bit better okay so
that's<00:02:26.510> probably<00:02:27.110> better

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
that's probably better

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.619 
that's probably better
now<00:02:28.310> there's<00:02:28.519> two<00:02:28.700> rows<00:02:28.909> and<00:02:29.269> then<00:02:29.360> there's<00:02:29.540> a

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
now there's two rows and then there's a

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.619 
now there's two rows and then there's a
ground<00:02:29.840> cook<00:02:30.200> plug<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.030> left<00:02:32.299> so<00:02:32.480> we're

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
ground cook plug to the left so we're

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.259 
ground cook plug to the left so we're
going<00:02:32.750> left<00:02:33.049> and<00:02:33.230> right<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.860> left<00:02:33.890> two<00:02:34.819> four

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
going left and right to left two four

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.259 
going left and right to left two four
six<00:02:35.599> eight<00:02:35.840> one<00:02:36.620> three<00:02:36.950> five<00:02:37.280> seven<00:02:37.340> that's

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
six eight one three five seven that's

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.030 
six eight one three five seven that's
the<00:02:38.450> numbers<00:02:38.780> or<00:02:39.109> of<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.920> pins<00:02:40.489> we<00:02:40.790> have<00:02:40.940> and

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
the numbers or of the pins we have and

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.130 
the numbers or of the pins we have and
that's<00:02:43.040> just<00:02:43.489> pretty<00:02:43.819> much<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.269> so<00:02:44.930> like<00:02:45.049> I

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
that's just pretty much that so like I

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.500 
that's just pretty much that so like I
said<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.379> front<00:02:45.620> four<00:02:46.220> are<00:02:46.819> two<00:02:47.090> four<00:02:47.329> six

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
said the front four are two four six

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.780 
said the front four are two four six
eight<00:02:47.659> they're<00:02:47.840> even<00:02:48.220> one<00:02:49.220> three<00:02:49.579> five<00:02:49.730> seven

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
eight they're even one three five seven

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.449 
eight they're even one three five seven
in<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.299> back<00:02:50.480> coming<00:02:51.019> from<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.319> right<00:02:51.530> so

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
in the back coming from the right so

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.129 
in the back coming from the right so
what<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:52.849> want<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.090> do<00:02:53.209> is<00:02:53.540> pretty<00:02:53.810> much<00:02:53.900> just

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
what you want to do is pretty much just

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:58.390 
what you want to do is pretty much just
connect<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:55.599> cable<00:02:56.599> I'm<00:02:56.900> using<00:02:57.319> a<00:02:57.500> 110<00:02:58.010> cable

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
connect a cable I'm using a 110 cable

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.339 
connect a cable I'm using a 110 cable
for<00:02:58.579> this<00:02:58.670> bit<00:02:58.940> because<00:02:59.480> this<00:02:59.720> is<00:02:59.840> all<00:03:00.019> running

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
for this bit because this is all running

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.059 
for this bit because this is all running
off<00:03:00.440> it's<00:03:00.829> all<00:03:00.950> running<00:03:01.190> off<00:03:01.370> 110<00:03:01.970> volts<00:03:02.239> ac

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
off it's all running off 110 volts ac

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.569 
off it's all running off 110 volts ac
connect<00:03:04.069> one<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:05.030> seven<00:03:05.299> okay<00:03:06.109> just<00:03:06.950> no<00:03:07.250> switch

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
connect one to seven okay just no switch

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.300 
connect one to seven okay just no switch
no<00:03:07.819> I<00:03:07.849> know<00:03:08.389> nothing<00:03:08.590> then<00:03:09.590> what<00:03:09.739> you<00:03:09.920> do<00:03:10.069> is

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
no I know nothing then what you do is

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.849 
no I know nothing then what you do is
you<00:03:10.430> take<00:03:10.639> any<00:03:11.450> cable<00:03:11.930> I'm<00:03:12.019> using<00:03:12.200> a<00:03:12.319> 12<00:03:12.590> volt

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
you take any cable I'm using a 12 volt

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.050 
you take any cable I'm using a 12 volt
cable<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:14.450> hook<00:03:15.019> hook<00:03:15.500> 1<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.190> 3<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.940> each

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
cable and hook hook 1 and 3 to each

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.610 
cable and hook hook 1 and 3 to each
other<00:03:17.299> and<00:03:17.569> it's<00:03:17.720> kinda<00:03:17.900> hard<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.109> see<00:03:18.349> but

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
other and it's kinda hard to see but

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.830 
other and it's kinda hard to see but
that's<00:03:18.889> pretty<00:03:19.190> much<00:03:19.370> what<00:03:19.549> you<00:03:19.669> do<00:03:19.879> 1<00:03:20.660> &amp;<00:03:20.810> 3

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
that's pretty much what you do 1 &amp; 3

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.780 
that's pretty much what you do 1 &amp; 3
together<00:03:21.139> but<00:03:21.500> don't<00:03:21.739> hook<00:03:21.949> it<00:03:22.129> in<00:03:22.310> the

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
together but don't hook it in the

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.430 
together but don't hook it in the
directly<00:03:23.239> to<00:03:23.299> each<00:03:23.389> other<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.780> earlier<00:03:24.049> to

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
directly to each other and earlier to

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.909 
directly to each other and earlier to
probably<00:03:24.709> break<00:03:24.919> your<00:03:24.949> relay<00:03:25.370> now<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:27.500> pretty

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:27.919 
probably break your relay now you pretty

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.500 
probably break your relay now you pretty
much<00:03:28.040> one<00:03:28.220> hook<00:03:28.400> up<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.730> a<00:03:28.760> momentary<00:03:29.180> switch

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
much one hook up to a momentary switch

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.729 
much one hook up to a momentary switch
or<00:03:29.690> in<00:03:29.750> my<00:03:29.900> case<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:31.599> RFID<00:03:32.599> keypad<00:03:33.230> which<00:03:33.440> I

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
or in my case the RFID keypad which I

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.970 
or in my case the RFID keypad which I
think<00:03:34.250> stays<00:03:35.030> on<00:03:35.180> for<00:03:35.209> 2<00:03:35.599> or<00:03:35.810> 3<00:03:35.840> seconds<00:03:36.410> after

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
think stays on for 2 or 3 seconds after

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.740 
think stays on for 2 or 3 seconds after
you<00:03:37.280> swept<00:03:37.579> your<00:03:38.079> key<00:03:39.280> I'm<00:03:40.280> hit<00:03:40.489> your<00:03:40.669> RFID<00:03:41.449> key

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
you swept your key I'm hit your RFID key

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.520 
you swept your key I'm hit your RFID key
up<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:42.079> it<00:03:42.199> or<00:03:42.699> enter<00:03:43.699> your<00:03:43.879> passcode<00:03:44.090> so<00:03:44.660> so

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
up to it or enter your passcode so so

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.530 
up to it or enter your passcode so so
that's<00:03:45.859> and<00:03:46.190> then<00:03:46.280> it'll<00:03:46.489> activate<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.239> relay

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
that's and then it'll activate the relay

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.839 
that's and then it'll activate the relay
so<00:03:47.599> that's<00:03:48.560> pretty<00:03:48.919> much<00:03:49.010> that<00:03:49.129> it's<00:03:49.549> very

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
so that's pretty much that it's very

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.580 
so that's pretty much that it's very
simple<00:03:50.239> like<00:03:50.449> I<00:03:50.540> said<00:03:50.720> anybody<00:03:51.290> could<00:03:51.440> really

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
simple like I said anybody could really

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.339 
simple like I said anybody could really
do<00:03:51.829> it<00:03:51.980> it<00:03:52.129> doesn't<00:03:52.489> require<00:03:53.139> really<00:03:54.139> anything

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
do it it doesn't require really anything

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.349 
do it it doesn't require really anything
it's<00:03:54.859> cheating<00:03:55.220> really<00:03:55.609> inexpensive<00:03:56.120> to<00:03:56.209> do

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
it's cheating really inexpensive to do

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.839 
it's cheating really inexpensive to do
so<00:03:57.099> let's<00:03:58.099> get<00:03:58.220> back<00:03:58.400> to<00:03:58.699> the<00:03:58.879> RFID<00:03:59.659> keypad<00:04:00.109> so

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
so let's get back to the RFID keypad so

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.409 
so let's get back to the RFID keypad so
this<00:04:01.849> keypad<00:04:02.799> like<00:04:03.799> I<00:04:03.889> said<00:04:04.069> very<00:04:04.609> inexpensive

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419 
this keypad like I said very inexpensive

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:07.030 
this keypad like I said very inexpensive
you<00:04:05.750> know<00:04:05.840> it's<00:04:06.019> really<00:04:06.349> easy<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.769> hook<00:04:06.859> up

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
you know it's really easy to hook up

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.120 
you know it's really easy to hook up
it's<00:04:07.190> very<00:04:07.790> simple<00:04:08.620> you

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
it's very simple you

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.470 
it's very simple you
just<00:04:10.250> have<00:04:10.490> to<00:04:10.670> know<00:04:10.820> a<00:04:10.850> little<00:04:11.300> bit<00:04:11.420> of

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
just have to know a little bit of

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.210 
just have to know a little bit of
working<00:04:11.990> with<00:04:12.140> electricity<00:04:12.560> and<00:04:12.920> know<00:04:13.070> what

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
working with electricity and know what

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.620 
working with electricity and know what
everything<00:04:13.430> means<00:04:13.730> but<00:04:14.030> that's<00:04:14.180> pretty<00:04:14.510> much

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
everything means but that's pretty much

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.199 
everything means but that's pretty much
it<00:04:15.010> if<00:04:16.010> you<00:04:16.130> really<00:04:16.340> want<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.670> go<00:04:16.760> simple<00:04:17.090> you

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
it if you really want to go simple you
