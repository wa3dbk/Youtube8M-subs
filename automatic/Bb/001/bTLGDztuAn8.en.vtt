stronger and people
prove<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.470> then<00:02:11.620> obviously<00:02:12.549> the<00:02:12.939> younger

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
prove and then obviously the younger

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.259 
prove and then obviously the younger
guys<00:02:13.480> start<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:15.250> know<00:02:15.370> start<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.819> grow

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
guys start to you know start to grow

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.569 
guys start to you know start to grow
into<00:02:16.569> their<00:02:16.989> bodies<00:02:17.379> more<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.250> know<00:02:18.370> get

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
into their bodies more and you know get

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.250 
into their bodies more and you know get
stronger<00:02:18.879> and<00:02:19.269> you<00:02:19.510> know<00:02:19.629> physically<00:02:20.110> are

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
stronger and you know physically are

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.160 
stronger and you know physically are
able<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.010> compete<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:22.750> know<00:02:22.870> in<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:23.019> more

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
able to compete you know in a more

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.910 
able to compete you know in a more
consistent<00:02:23.560> basis<00:02:24.129> and<00:02:24.159> that's<00:02:24.849> what<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.269> think

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
consistent basis and that's what I think

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.330 
consistent basis and that's what I think
you<00:02:26.920> see<00:02:27.129> more<00:02:27.579> upsets<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:29.040> yeah<00:02:30.040> it's<00:02:30.220> going

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
you see more upsets and yeah it's going

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.069 
you see more upsets and yeah it's going
to<00:02:30.400> be<00:02:30.489> like<00:02:30.730> that<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.180> think<00:02:31.480> more<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:31.989> more

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
to be like that I think more and more

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.649 
to be like that I think more and more
now<00:02:32.439> because<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:33.430> level<00:02:33.790> of<00:02:33.819> tennessee's<00:02:34.390> has

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
now because the level of tennessee's has

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.630 
now because the level of tennessee's has
improved<00:02:35.019> and<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:35.500> depth<00:02:35.739> is<00:02:36.010> has<00:02:36.220> got<00:02:36.430> much

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
improved and the depth is has got much

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.480 
improved and the depth is has got much
much<00:02:37.180> stronger
