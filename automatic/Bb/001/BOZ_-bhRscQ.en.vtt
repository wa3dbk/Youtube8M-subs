00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.010

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.019
 Everyone is Chapter 1 Kon'nichiwae

 Though I think a with'm going to be in almost 3 years and started to use chasing me yamaha 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.989
 Oh I used why 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.780
 Its performance as a very tool 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.530
 that is 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.640
 Of the tone 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.060
 The nature of the basic fee we went to in the modern era 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.840
 Such as an exact benefit 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.100
 As a very amazed c accuracy 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.440
 Holding the main gate of the day after 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.070
 Products that are there 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.100
 There's a cancer called an instrument to erase 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.640
 It went so 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.119
 If it is an individuality including good and bad 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:23.240
 After all Tee certainly as its performance 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:26.450
 The exact things but I think that's where the controversial quite opinion of February also I live performance 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.200
 By'm Tteyuu budget only 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.200
 You can get a mountain 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:41.050
 And this is 82 z though 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.010
 When the performance is very high as a product 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.010
 However, 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.429
 That 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:53.090
 For example, this is for low brain f 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:55.290
 It seems made to durability person one very soon toys 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.050
 The a such a performance 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:02.200
 It is a stage to pursue 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:08.260
 It's like hitting something like becoming something 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.119
 Something like good response has been lost for a while This is not limited to Yamaha but 10,000 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.080
 Gacky 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.660
 It can be said in common with 20%, but 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.900
 Vintage 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.290
 What is called an instrument 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.569
 A good exhibition talks with Sosono Kokon 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.560
 Half of you 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:30.250
 That said so on this 82 z 6 performance 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.310
 All the goodness of the reaction 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.410
 It means that you can not save 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.910
 I 'm doing a lot with the developers 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.190
 For example 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.990
 To reduce the weight of various parts 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.700
 Or standing Buddha welding Kata 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.959
 Various patterns 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:55.220
 Review things and little by little 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:58.640
 It's like getting rid of two days early 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.740
 It's a kind of audit, but it's a reaction 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.730
 Logo and come in 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.030
 A little in the world I used to think of that vintage 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.600
 On the other hand the kana not hurt near 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.600
 think 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.379
 Well, it is already great to say that markers 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.379
 That popular 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.220
 Anus is this 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.090
 It is a good Toite taken by endlessly also Oh people 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:34.690
 Weight saving 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:36.510
 That which saxophone called vintage of iris has 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.210
 Good response 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.580
 Especially because it is approaching 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.580
 So spray gar 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.500
 Oh 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.350
 The kana not it very nice for those who aim to 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:54.050
 I am thinking 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.680
 Well but that something Gakki of vintage is really okay ho much place is 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.330
 Also 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.660
 For example, Toka pitch there is really a variation Attari 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:07.460
 When it comes to the point where you don't speak too 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:09.210
 There is also a story that it is okay to include such rose lovers too 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:14.400
 This 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:21.299
 Uniformity and accuracy class that comes 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:26.270
 Z all means that in this new end you know you have also felt the goodness of reaction 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.270
 To the person who aims to jazz player 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.240
