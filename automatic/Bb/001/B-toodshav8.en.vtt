00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 hey 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.779
 as we all know is streaming 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.999
 The multiroom is a huge part of that 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.560
 music boxes actually do it too 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:30.149
 knowing very much okay that person 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.529
 of course other brand say that too 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.260
 the city but now to my bad luck too 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.399
 see me here at the 2014 convention 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.640
 I now come with three different ones 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.949
 devices and two boxer the all 8 all 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.449
 three and a professor who join 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.440
 show on your own geering that I 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.440
 that's all because 7 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.570
 loose room music systems what are the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.060
 car weather those are just speakers 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.250
 that you put everywhere in your house and with which 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.930
 you just have music with case straps and that 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.129
 you see it on provide your phone 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.540
 via an app 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.890
 and so you can listen to any music 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.600
 room and it can all be different 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.670
 but music is also the same 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.979
 this huge tunnel of course through the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.150
 boxes spotify and panasonic step is now 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.430
 also in 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.200
 next to me is the al 8 that's the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.330
 biggest speaker of the bunch 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.280
 it is meant for large living rooms i 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.690
 the five of them are in a network and that 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.190
 actually me so much i have a lot of noise 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.619
 after the we put them a bit 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.270
 that from now on you only 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.220
 cannot stream from your computer yet 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.570
 with them and not with spotify 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.430
 they are in negotiation again 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.619
 that stubborn can't steam too 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.479
 I did stream with Napster and still 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.130
 another small streaming services that 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.960
 is not very popular 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.640
 but it is actually waiting for that 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.200
 other so god device and the services of 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.380
 this world 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.850
 yes look in terms of design, it is quite a bit 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.720
 of course passed on so such 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.560
 devices with such whim and with great hope 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.210
 well 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.700
 He is silver , you have to 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.420
 keep oh my god yes 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.250
 cindy ugly this is the already three it 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.489
 little brother of the already behind that we 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.959
 just have seen something smaller so what 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.280
 easier to put down but that is possible 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.170
 namely in two ways 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.880
 upright and on its side 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.880
 or what is life for a beautiful adventure 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.180
 this is the all of the sea ​​and connect that 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.180
 or your own circulation in it 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.680
 beautiful is that can stream in high old 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.330
 quality so close to here is very 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.710
 have perfect sound that is natural 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.360
 very nice if you are very expensive 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.700
 installation story of perfect sound 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.930
 well what we get to the big benefits 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.330
 comparison with sonos 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.770
 parasol you do two first of all 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.240
 there is no need for a special network for this 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.680
 to create the you have a loaf of bread in you 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.730
 existing network and that just works 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.860
 fine 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.420
 therefore you can just and with you 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.200
 phone that is already connected to the network 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.660
 on your ipad or any other device 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.640
 new standard is happy with that 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.350
 you can just play the music and 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.030
 in addition , panasonic also he sounds 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.620
 much better after that we hear here 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.600
 of course in this over busy stock market from 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.800
 not so we need as we promise to 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.780
 to believe 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.220
 The big question, of course, is what these 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.360
 appliances windows will cost but then 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.500
 they can on that did not look very good 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.239
 say a lot about it 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.220
 was allowed in the time that we are here 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.690
 and that the video upload that price 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:23.600
 well known to the cyrus goes here 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:23.600
 walk on somewhere in the picture
