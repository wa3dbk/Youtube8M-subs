introductory level getting started
getting<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.029> tree<00:00:18.240> farm<00:00:18.420> going<00:00:21.020> right<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.109> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
getting the tree farm going right in the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.779 
getting the tree farm going right in the
beginning<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.590> game<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.250> first<00:00:23.550> off

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
beginning of the game so first off

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.310 
beginning of the game so first off
obviously<00:00:24.300> you're<00:00:24.420> going<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.600> need<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.960> cart

simple PVC very easy to make you'll also

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.500 
simple PVC very easy to make you'll also
need<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.649> cargo<00:00:41.070> manager<00:00:41.910> which<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.360> going<00:00:42.450> to

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
need the cargo manager which is going to

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.940 
need the cargo manager which is going to
take<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> little<00:00:42.960> bit<00:00:43.079> more<00:00:43.260> work<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.530> burn

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
take a little bit more work to burn

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.220 
take a little bit more work to burn
through<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.760> make<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:45.989> made<00:00:46.110> out

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
through to make but this just made out

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.060 
through to make but this just made out
of<00:00:46.260> wood<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.649> iron<00:00:46.980> basically<00:00:47.930> but<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.590> the

took about 16 and a half minutes to make
and<00:01:09.659> used<00:01:10.170> up<00:01:10.820> 59<00:01:11.820> coal<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.960> that's<00:01:13.110> how<00:01:13.200> long

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
and used up 59 coal so that's how long

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.850 
and used up 59 coal so that's how long
it<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.650> going<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.450> -<00:01:15.450> how<00:01:16.290> long<00:01:16.470> does<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.619> take

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
it is going to - how long does it take

make the most expensive thing is the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.719 
make the most expensive thing is the
basic<00:01:31.619> wood<00:01:31.770> cutter<00:01:31.979> which<00:01:32.159> takes<00:01:32.340> about<00:01:32.460> five

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.920 
of these to grow so that you can see
what<00:03:46.420> happens<00:03:47.370> now<00:03:48.370> my<00:03:48.790> other<00:03:48.940> design<00:03:49.360> didn't

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
what happens now my other design didn't

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.470 
what happens now my other design didn't
have<00:03:50.110> two<00:03:50.380> stops<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:50.920> only<00:03:51.070> had<00:03:51.190> one<00:03:51.330> so<00:03:52.330> he

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
have two stops and only had one so he

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.150 
have two stops and only had one so he
would<00:03:52.600> just<00:03:52.630> dump<00:03:53.050> everything<00:03:53.380> out<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:53.950> dump

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
would just dump everything out and dump

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.640 
would just dump everything out and dump
and<00:03:54.370> pull<00:03:55.239> but<00:03:55.450> you'd<00:03:55.540> have<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:55.810> either<00:03:56.110> refuel

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
and pull but you'd have to either refuel

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.830 
and pull but you'd have to either refuel
him<00:03:56.830> or<00:03:57.010> he<00:03:57.160> would<00:03:57.280> pull<00:03:57.459> back<00:03:57.640> in<00:03:57.850> so<00:03:58.660> now<00:03:58.780> he

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
him or he would pull back in so now he

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.449 
him or he would pull back in so now he
stops<00:03:59.290> there<00:03:59.500> he<00:03:59.680> didn't<00:03:59.860> have<00:03:59.980> anything<00:04:00.190> on

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
stops there he didn't have anything on

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.490 
stops there he didn't have anything on
him<00:04:00.610> to<00:04:00.880> dump<00:04:01.150> so<00:04:01.390> he's<00:04:01.510> gonna<00:04:01.630> just<00:04:02.380> continue

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
him to dump so he's gonna just continue

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.500 
him to dump so he's gonna just continue
on<00:04:02.770> he<00:04:03.190> does<00:04:03.370> make<00:04:03.580> the<00:04:03.730> stop<00:04:03.940> though

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.220 

and<00:04:09.510> he's<00:04:09.900> just<00:04:09.990> going<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.170> continue<00:04:10.620> going

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.330 

when<00:04:16.230> he<00:04:16.290> gets<00:04:16.440> back<00:04:16.560> around<00:04:16.829> to<00:04:17.010> this<00:04:17.130> other

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
when he gets back around to this other

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.449 
when he gets back around to this other
side<00:04:17.760> now<00:04:18.359> design<00:04:19.139> you<00:04:19.470> can<00:04:19.650> whatever<00:04:20.070> layout

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
side now design you can whatever layout

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.680 
side now design you can whatever layout
I<00:04:20.489> just<00:04:20.730> made<00:04:20.850> like<00:04:21.030> this<00:04:21.150> kind<00:04:21.389> of<00:04:21.450> weird

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
I just made like this kind of weird

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.080 
I just made like this kind of weird
figure<00:04:22.139> 8<00:04:22.290> infinity<00:04:22.919> symbol<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.820> want<00:04:23.940> to

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
figure 8 infinity symbol you want to

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.390 
figure 8 infinity symbol you want to
make<00:04:24.180> sure<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.450> have<00:04:24.570> two<00:04:24.900> stops<00:04:25.230> if<00:04:26.070> you<00:04:26.250> have

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
make sure you have two stops if you have

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.250 
make sure you have two stops if you have
more<00:04:26.790> desire<00:04:27.240> for<00:04:27.690> anything<00:04:27.870> else<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.169> can

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
more desire for anything else you can

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.830 
more desire for anything else you can
obviously<00:04:28.620> put<00:04:28.830> more<00:04:29.040> on<00:04:29.250> here<00:04:29.660> but<00:04:30.660> now<00:04:30.780> you

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
obviously put more on here but now you

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.480 
obviously put more on here but now you
can<00:04:31.050> see<00:04:31.169> right<00:04:31.380> now<00:04:31.440> he's<00:04:31.950> grabbing<00:04:32.280> the

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
can see right now he's grabbing the

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.460 
can see right now he's grabbing the
stuff<00:04:32.820> that's<00:04:33.090> inside<00:04:33.330> of<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:33.840> red<00:04:34.020> slot<00:04:34.260> in

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
stuff that's inside of the red slot in

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.820 
stuff that's inside of the red slot in
the<00:04:34.620> cargo<00:04:34.950> manager<00:04:35.810> and<00:04:36.810> putting<00:04:37.500> it<00:04:37.590> into

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
the cargo manager and putting it into

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.640 
the cargo manager and putting it into
his<00:04:38.550> engine<00:04:38.880> compartment<00:04:39.300> so<00:04:40.260> now<00:04:40.410> he's<00:04:40.560> going

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
his engine compartment so now he's going

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.110 
his engine compartment so now he's going
to<00:04:40.710> go<00:04:40.860> around<00:04:41.130> and<00:04:41.460> he's<00:04:41.610> going<00:04:41.760> to<00:04:41.820> cut<00:04:41.970> down

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
to go around and he's going to cut down

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.490 
to go around and he's going to cut down
these<00:04:42.300> trees<00:04:44.419> the<00:04:45.419> benefit<00:04:45.960> of<00:04:45.990> having<00:04:46.260> a

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
these trees the benefit of having a

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.290 
these trees the benefit of having a
smaller<00:04:46.919> track<00:04:47.220> like<00:04:47.430> this<00:04:47.580> is<00:04:47.729> that<00:04:47.790> he's

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
smaller track like this is that he's

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.780 
smaller track like this is that he's
going<00:04:48.630> to<00:04:48.690> cut<00:04:48.930> down<00:04:49.160> multiple<00:04:50.160> trees<00:04:50.550> at<00:04:50.760> a

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
going to cut down multiple trees at a

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.580 
going to cut down multiple trees at a
time<00:04:51.090> every<00:04:51.300> time<00:04:51.479> he<00:04:51.600> steps<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:51.930> bigger<00:04:52.290> the

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
time every time he steps the bigger the

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.379 
time every time he steps the bigger the
circle<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:53.520> longer<00:04:53.850> it's<00:04:53.940> going<00:04:54.030> to<00:04:54.090> take<00:04:54.180> him

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
circle the longer it's going to take him

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:55.879 
circle the longer it's going to take him
he's<00:04:54.510> going<00:04:54.660> to<00:04:54.720> stop<00:04:54.960> at<00:04:55.139> every<00:04:55.290> individual

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
he's going to stop at every individual

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:57.710 
he's going to stop at every individual
tree<00:04:56.190> or<00:04:56.340> every<00:04:56.520> couple<00:04:56.820> of<00:04:56.910> trees<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.270> chop

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
tree or every couple of trees to chop

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.240 
tree or every couple of trees to chop
them<00:04:57.900> down<00:04:58.080> so<00:04:58.530> you<00:04:58.590> can<00:04:58.740> see<00:04:58.830> he<00:04:58.889> did<00:04:59.070> a<00:04:59.100> little

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
them down so you can see he did a little

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.190 
them down so you can see he did a little
bit<00:04:59.370> of<00:04:59.460> work<00:04:59.700> on<00:04:59.910> this<00:05:00.150> guy<00:05:00.360> right<00:05:00.570> here<00:05:00.600> while

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
bit of work on this guy right here while

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.340 
bit of work on this guy right here while
he<00:05:01.380> was<00:05:01.410> chopping<00:05:01.889> down<00:05:02.130> the<00:05:02.250> tree<00:05:02.460> right<00:05:02.580> here

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
he was chopping down the tree right here

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.390 
he was chopping down the tree right here
and<00:05:04.350> you<00:05:04.440> can<00:05:04.560> see<00:05:04.680> that<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:04.979> internal

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
and you can see that the internal

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.310 
and you can see that the internal
storage<00:05:05.729> is<00:05:06.000> starting<00:05:06.240> to<00:05:06.300> fill<00:05:06.479> up<00:05:06.510> any

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
storage is starting to fill up any

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.870 
storage is starting to fill up any
saplings<00:05:08.130> that<00:05:08.220> he<00:05:08.400> grabs<00:05:08.639> will

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
saplings that he grabs will

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.480 
saplings that he grabs will
automatically<00:05:09.510> go<00:05:09.660> into<00:05:10.169> the<00:05:10.620> this<00:05:10.979> be

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
automatically go into the this be

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.750 
automatically go into the this be
storage<00:05:11.880> slots<00:05:12.120> right<00:05:12.300> here<00:05:12.510> and<00:05:13.550> once<00:05:14.550> these

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
storage slots right here and once these

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.370 
storage slots right here and once these
are<00:05:14.940> full<00:05:15.180> it'll<00:05:15.510> just<00:05:15.660> go<00:05:15.750> into<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:15.990> internal

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
are full it'll just go into the internal

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.340 
are full it'll just go into the internal
storage<00:05:16.530> so<00:05:17.510> now<00:05:18.510> we're<00:05:18.810> going<00:05:18.900> to<00:05:18.960> notice

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
storage so now we're going to notice

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.200 
storage so now we're going to notice
when<00:05:19.919> he<00:05:20.010> gets<00:05:20.160> over<00:05:20.370> here<00:05:22.850> he's<00:05:23.850> gonna<00:05:23.970> stop

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
when he gets over here he's gonna stop

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.860 
when he gets over here he's gonna stop
again<00:05:24.479> he's<00:05:25.110> going<00:05:25.260> to<00:05:25.350> check<00:05:25.530> and<00:05:26.690> he's<00:05:27.690> gonna

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
again he's going to check and he's gonna

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.810 
again he's going to check and he's gonna
say<00:05:28.080> oh<00:05:28.260> I've<00:05:28.620> got<00:05:28.830> stuff<00:05:29.100> in<00:05:29.280> my<00:05:29.400> internal

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
say oh I've got stuff in my internal

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.640 
say oh I've got stuff in my internal
storage<00:05:30.180> I'm<00:05:30.390> going<00:05:30.810> to<00:05:30.900> start<00:05:31.110> dumping<00:05:31.289> it<00:05:31.530> in

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
storage I'm going to start dumping it in

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.920 
storage I'm going to start dumping it in
here

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.860 

and<00:05:36.140> he'll<00:05:36.590> just<00:05:36.620> continue<00:05:37.130> on<00:05:37.280> a<00:05:38.120> little<00:05:38.720> bit

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
and he'll just continue on a little bit

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.260 
and he'll just continue on a little bit
