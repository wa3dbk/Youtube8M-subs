inverter<00:00:21.610> which<00:00:22.610> is<00:00:22.790> connected<00:00:23.300> to<00:00:23.330> an

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
inverter which is connected to an

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.440 
inverter which is connected to an
oscilloscope<00:00:24.369> East<00:00:25.369> a<00:00:25.490> pocket<00:00:25.880> oscilloscope

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
oscilloscope East a pocket oscilloscope

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.979 
oscilloscope East a pocket oscilloscope
that<00:00:26.720> will<00:00:27.619> basically<00:00:27.800> show<00:00:29.290> the<00:00:30.290> waveform

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989 
that will basically show the waveform

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:34.150 
that will basically show the waveform
which<00:00:32.989> is<00:00:33.110> what<00:00:33.320> you're<00:00:33.500> seeing<00:00:33.739> and<00:00:34.010> what

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
which is what you're seeing and what

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.630 
which is what you're seeing and what
they<00:00:34.280> call<00:00:34.550> a<00:00:34.790> modified<00:00:35.739> sine<00:00:36.739> wave<00:00:39.430> this<00:00:40.430> was

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
they call a modified sine wave this was

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.950 
they call a modified sine wave this was
done<00:00:40.820> on<00:00:40.940> a<00:00:40.969> little<00:00:41.300> mini<00:00:41.750> personal<00:00:42.320> scope<00:00:43.960> and

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
done on a little mini personal scope and

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.489 
done on a little mini personal scope and
that's<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:45.530> waveform<00:00:46.039> that<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:46.399> will<00:00:46.579> get<00:00:47.499> of

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:48.499 
that's the waveform that you will get of

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:52.540 
that's the waveform that you will get of
AC<00:00:48.739> from<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:49.850> inverter<00:00:51.129> this<00:00:52.129> is<00:00:52.339> what

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
AC from the inverter this is what

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.479 
AC from the inverter this is what
actually<00:00:52.780> AC<00:00:53.780> power<00:00:54.199> looks<00:00:54.530> like<00:00:54.769> on<00:00:55.210> the

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
actually AC power looks like on the

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.840 
actually AC power looks like on the
oscilloscope<00:00:59.469> at<00:01:00.469> 120<00:01:01.219> volts<00:01:01.489> I'm<00:01:01.640> going<00:01:01.760> to

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
oscilloscope at 120 volts I'm going to

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.450 
oscilloscope at 120 volts I'm going to
show<00:01:01.999> you<00:01:02.030> where<00:01:02.329> I<00:01:02.359> connected<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.460> probe

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
show you where I connected the probe

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.320 
show you where I connected the probe
wires<00:01:05.120> up<00:01:05.540> to<00:01:05.750> right<00:01:06.080> down<00:01:06.290> there<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:07.120> a<00:01:08.120> power

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
wires up to right down there and a power

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.540 
wires up to right down there and a power
strip<00:01:08.659> so<00:01:09.590> that's<00:01:09.800> for<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.010> record

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
strip so that's for the record

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.360 
strip so that's for the record
okay<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.600> next<00:01:11.990> test<00:01:12.200> we're<00:01:12.500> going<00:01:12.680> to<00:01:12.800> see<00:01:13.220> if

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
okay the next test we're going to see if

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.200 
okay the next test we're going to see if
the<00:01:13.520> inverter<00:01:14.320> Harbor<00:01:15.320> Freight<00:01:15.910> can<00:01:16.910> power

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
the inverter Harbor Freight can power

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:25.780 
the inverter Harbor Freight can power
both<00:01:17.600> a<00:01:17.900> Dell<00:01:18.380> XPS<00:01:20.380> with<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.560> core<00:01:24.070> i7<00:01:25.070> processor

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
both a Dell XPS with a core i7 processor

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.180 
both a Dell XPS with a core i7 processor
in<00:01:25.970> it<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.900> an<00:01:27.650> eye<00:01:27.890> ink<00:01:28.330> monitor<00:01:29.950> I'm<00:01:30.950> going

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
in it and an eye ink monitor I'm going

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.399 
in it and an eye ink monitor I'm going
to<00:01:31.310> go<00:01:31.430> ahead<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.820> plug<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:33.710> devices<00:01:34.280> in

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.469 

and<00:01:38.409> in<00:01:38.619> just<00:01:38.770> a<00:01:38.950> moment<00:01:42.090> we're<00:01:43.090> going<00:01:43.210> to<00:01:43.270> see

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
and in just a moment we're going to see

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.520 
and in just a moment we're going to see
if<00:01:43.570> they<00:01:43.659> both<00:01:43.810> powerup

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.620 

okay<00:01:49.100> we're<00:01:49.280> starting<00:01:49.670> with<00:01:49.760> the<00:01:49.880> computer

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.510 

and<00:01:54.750> computers<00:01:55.350> got<00:01:55.560> its<00:01:55.770> normal<00:01:56.159> boot<00:01:56.340> up

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520

the light bulb lights just fine the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.660 
the light bulb lights just fine the
noise<00:03:22.170> you're<00:03:22.380> hearing<00:03:22.410> is<00:03:23.010> actually

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
noise you're hearing is actually

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.490 
noise you're hearing is actually
the<00:03:24.970> fan<00:03:25.240> in<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.570> inverter<00:03:25.900> kicking<00:03:26.320> on

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
the fan in the inverter kicking on

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.880 
the fan in the inverter kicking on
so<00:03:28.130> what<00:03:28.340> you're<00:03:28.490> looking<00:03:28.610> at<00:03:28.940> is<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.120> light

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
so what you're looking at is the light

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.140 
so what you're looking at is the light
from<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.820> hundred<00:03:32.120> watt<00:03:33.010> Phillips<00:03:34.010> bowl<00:03:34.520> and

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
from the hundred watt Phillips bowl and

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.960 
from the hundred watt Phillips bowl and
the<00:03:35.270> inverter<00:03:35.570> handles<00:03:36.020> that<00:03:36.170> just<00:03:36.770> fine<00:03:37.040> the

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
the inverter handles that just fine the

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.250 
the inverter handles that just fine the
next<00:03:38.000> test<00:03:38.540> is<00:03:38.780> a<00:03:39.740> 500<00:03:40.640> watt<00:03:41.800> halogen<00:03:42.800> light

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
next test is a 500 watt halogen light

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
next test is a 500 watt halogen light
