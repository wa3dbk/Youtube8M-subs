now if your boil is not in a place that

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.470 
now if your boil is not in a place that

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
you can soak it in water then you can

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.860 
you can soak it in water then you can
also<00:00:54.629> use<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.379> warm<00:00:56.039> damp<00:00:56.370> clean<00:00:57.000> compact<00:00:57.690> to

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
also use a warm damp clean compact to

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.139 
also use a warm damp clean compact to
the<00:00:57.989> skin<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.859> hopefully<00:00:59.340> produce<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.969> same

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the skin to hopefully produce the same

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.139 
the skin to hopefully produce the same
effect<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.809> would<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.160> for<00:01:02.460> around<00:01:02.940> about

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
effect I would do this for around about

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.600 
effect I would do this for around about
20<00:01:03.840> minutes<00:01:04.199> 3<00:01:04.470> or<00:01:04.589> 4<00:01:04.769> times<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.189> day<00:01:05.369> and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
20 minutes 3 or 4 times a day and

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.880 
20 minutes 3 or 4 times a day and
hopefully<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.750> will<00:01:06.930> also<00:01:07.320> reduce<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
hopefully this will also reduce the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.740 
hopefully this will also reduce the
amount<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.250> pain<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.490> you're<00:01:08.729> experiencing

amount of pain that you're experiencing

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.289 
amount of pain that you're experiencing
once<00:01:10.200> your<00:01:10.409> boil<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.799> burst<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.090> use

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
once your boil is burst then you can use

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.440 
once your boil is burst then you can use
an<00:01:12.450> antibacterial<00:01:12.810> soap<00:01:13.680> or<00:01:14.250> iodine<00:01:14.880> to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
an antibacterial soap or iodine to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.539 
an antibacterial soap or iodine to
protect<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.990> skin<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.560> reduce<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.100> chances

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
protect the skin and reduce the chances

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.670 
protect the skin and reduce the chances
of<00:01:17.610> any<00:01:17.909> other<00:01:18.299> bacteria<00:01:18.930> from<00:01:19.140> coming<00:01:19.530> into

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
of any other bacteria from coming into

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.240 
of any other bacteria from coming into
the<00:01:19.920> skin<00:01:20.420> now<00:01:21.420> magnesium<00:01:21.960> sulfate<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.799> a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
the skin now magnesium sulfate is a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.969 
the skin now magnesium sulfate is a
natural<00:01:23.909> antiseptic<00:01:24.150> agent<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.799> can

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
natural antiseptic agent and you can

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.039 
natural antiseptic agent and you can
usually<00:01:26.130> get<00:01:26.490> hold<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.299> paste<00:01:27.689> form

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
usually get hold of that in paste form

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.010 
usually get hold of that in paste form
from<00:01:28.619> your<00:01:28.710> local<00:01:28.979> pharmacy<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.840> can

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
from your local pharmacy and you can

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.230 
from your local pharmacy and you can
make<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> paste<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.890> water<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.520> put<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.000> on

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
make a paste with water and put it on

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.910 
make a paste with water and put it on
the<00:01:33.509> boil<00:01:33.810> as<00:01:33.960> well<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.650> should<00:01:34.829> also

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
the boil as well and that should also

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.749 
the boil as well and that should also
reduce<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.579> chances<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.360> any<00:01:36.930> further

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
reduce the chances of any further

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.880 
reduce the chances of any further
staphylococcal<00:01:38.759> infection

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890
