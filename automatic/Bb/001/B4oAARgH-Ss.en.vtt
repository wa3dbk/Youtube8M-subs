Hondo<00:00:05.729> doesn't<00:00:06.060> really<00:00:06.210> go<00:00:06.420> in<00:00:06.569> for<00:00:06.599> boxy<00:00:07.290> and

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
Hondo doesn't really go in for boxy and

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.840 
Hondo doesn't really go in for boxy and
conventional<00:00:07.920> as<00:00:08.010> far<00:00:08.219> as<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.459> styling<00:00:08.820> of

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:08.850 
conventional as far as the styling of

conventional as far as the styling of
its<00:00:09.000> Civic<00:00:09.299> hatchback<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.900> concerned<00:00:10.350> so<00:00:10.620> it

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
its Civic hatchback is concerned so it

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.950 
its Civic hatchback is concerned so it
follows<00:00:11.280> that<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.670> torah'<00:00:11.940> version<00:00:12.420> or<00:00:12.570> state

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
follows that the torah' version or state

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.900 
follows that the torah' version or state
doesn't<00:00:13.620> really<00:00:13.889> go<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.219> for<00:00:14.250> run-of-the-mill

either but all those swooping lines can
look<00:00:17.669> pretty<00:00:17.880> they<00:00:18.390> can<00:00:18.570> also<00:00:18.720> have<00:00:19.169> a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
look pretty they can also have a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.929 
look pretty they can also have a
knock-on<00:00:19.619> effect<00:00:19.980> on<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.250> amount<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.669> space

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
knock-on effect on the amount of space

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.389 
knock-on effect on the amount of space
that<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.390> get<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.840> car<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:23.070> all<00:00:23.220> those

that you get in the car and all those
concerns<00:00:23.820> disappear<00:00:24.480> as<00:00:24.689> soon<00:00:24.960> as<00:00:25.169> you<00:00:25.290> open

boot<00:00:27.719> it<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.110> massive<00:00:28.890> much<00:00:29.130> more<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.610> than

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
boot it is massive much more so than

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.880 
boot it is massive much more so than
pretty<00:00:30.360> much<00:00:30.480> all<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> Honda's<00:00:31.050> rivals<00:00:31.439> and

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
pretty much all the Honda's rivals and

this loading lip is pretty much
non-existent<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.500> kind<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.739> really

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
non-existent and it's a kind of really

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:36.740 
non-existent and it's a kind of really
wide<00:00:35.430> opening<00:00:36.000> as<00:00:36.090> well<00:00:36.240> which<00:00:36.420> makes<00:00:36.600> it

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
wide opening as well which makes it

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.990 
wide opening as well which makes it
really<00:00:36.780> easy<00:00:37.080> for<00:00:37.350> palling<00:00:38.130> big<00:00:38.310> heavy<00:00:38.550> items

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000

these seat bases they flip up kind of

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.399 
these seat bases they flip up kind of
like<00:01:20.670> cinema<00:01:21.149> seats<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.719> then<00:01:21.840> lock<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.229> place

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
the very easy movement give you a very

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.649 
the very easy movement give you a very
tall<00:01:25.259> loading<00:01:26.009> space<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.670> back<00:01:26.880> here<00:01:27.149> if

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
tall loading space in the back here if

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.819 
tall loading space in the back here if
you're<00:01:27.840> going<00:01:27.929> to<00:01:28.020> use<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.380> seats<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.679> a<00:01:28.740> more

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
you're going to use the seats in a more

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.620 
you're going to use the seats in a more
conventional<00:01:29.100> manner<00:01:29.459> and<00:01:29.639> actually<00:01:29.850> sitting

conventional manner and actually sitting

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.529 
conventional manner and actually sitting
them<00:01:31.039> you<00:01:32.039> also<00:01:32.189> get<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.609> very<00:01:32.880> generous<00:01:33.270> amount

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
them you also get a very generous amount

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.319 
them you also get a very generous amount
of<00:01:33.569> headroom<00:01:33.749> and<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.799> decent<00:01:35.069> if<00:01:35.459> not<00:01:35.789> massive

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
of headroom and a decent if not massive

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.309 
of headroom and a decent if not massive
amount<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.779> legroom

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
amount of legroom

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.499 
amount of legroom
so<00:01:37.649> all<00:01:37.770> those<00:01:37.920> swooping<00:01:38.520> lines<00:01:38.639> don't<00:01:39.090> affect

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
then the diesel engine because if it's

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
extra oomph load down is the one that

extra oomph load down is the one that

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
makes the most sense

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.789 
makes the most sense
it<00:03:14.609> is<00:03:14.849> quite<00:03:15.480> noisy<00:03:15.840> when<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.319> compare<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.739> to

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
it is quite noisy when you compare it to

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.649 
it is quite noisy when you compare it to
its<00:03:16.950> rivals<00:03:17.400> though<00:03:17.579> especially<00:03:18.209> when<00:03:18.450> you

its rivals though especially when you

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.020 
its rivals though especially when you
were<00:03:18.870> kick<00:03:19.109> without<00:03:19.260> bit<00:03:19.530> harder<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.159> you<00:03:20.879> get

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
were kick without bit harder and you get

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.460 
were kick without bit harder and you get
quite<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.269> lot<00:03:21.389> of<00:03:21.419> road<00:03:21.659> noise<00:03:21.689> at<00:03:22.199> higher

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
quite a lot of road noise at higher

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.710 
quite a lot of road noise at higher
speeds<00:03:22.829> as<00:03:22.979> well<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.849> petrol<00:03:24.209> engine<00:03:24.269> is<00:03:24.659> a

speeds as well the petrol engine is a

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.899 
speeds as well the petrol engine is a
fair<00:03:25.229> bit<00:03:25.349> quieter<00:03:25.739> most<00:03:25.949> of<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.159> time<00:03:26.370> but

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
fair bit quieter most of the time but

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.149 
fair bit quieter most of the time but
you<00:03:27.569> do<00:03:27.750> have<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.139> work<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.530> pretty<00:03:28.799> hard<00:03:28.979> as

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
you do have to work that pretty hard as

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:35.140 
you do have to work that pretty hard as
well<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.639> make<00:03:29.819> much<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.269> way<00:03:30.359> of<00:03:30.479> progress

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.640 

it's<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.209> real<00:03:36.389> shame<00:03:36.659> that<00:03:36.840> those<00:03:36.959> cabin<00:03:37.379> organ

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
it's a real shame that those cabin organ

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.229 
it's a real shame that those cabin organ
all<00:03:37.739> mixing<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.099> refinement<00:03:38.639> let<00:03:38.819> the<00:03:38.970> Civic

all mixing the refinement let the Civic
tourer<00:03:39.479> down<00:03:39.750> because<00:03:40.019> in<00:03:40.139> many<00:03:40.290> ways<00:03:40.409> it's

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
tourer down because in many ways it's

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.670 
tourer down because in many ways it's

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
and there's some really clever touches

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.539

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
do have to bear in mind that it's quite

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.180 
do have to bear in mind that it's quite
pricey<00:03:51.629> compared<00:03:52.109> to<00:03:52.199> rivals<00:03:52.349> but<00:03:52.799> if<00:03:52.919> space
