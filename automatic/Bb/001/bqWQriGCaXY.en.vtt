00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.929
 hello everyone of you tenderly 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.929
 tried to draw on dota 2 minimap 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.920
 and you probably did something like 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.110
 such so here if you want to surprise 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.129
 all with your drawings 2 then us 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.860
 need a program called 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.220
 dota2 minimap painter she is absolutely 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.689
 free of charge from the window and and i will leave a description 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.430
 I want to go see what uses and 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.519
 the program will not ban you as it does 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.500
 not connected with the stim or with the game dota 2 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.750
 of share is such a window 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.030
 where on the right we can choose the desired 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.559
 we draw a picture very quickly that 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.110
 you looked at the list of these drawings also 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.390
 you can make your picture but so 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.100
 masturbation I did not continue to do you 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.790
 should set the draw key for 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.960
 me this is the unit on us keyboard and 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.290
 select a delay for each pattern 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.610
 its delay well, on average, it is equal to 60 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.110
 you can change it a little 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.760
 necessary for drawing 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.979
 to draw 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.290
 draw completely here we assume 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:06.049
 chose drawing this is batman i want 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.460
 draw batman why not run 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.530
 in order for your image 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.479
 appeared need to hover the mouse on 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.110
 mini map area and push preset 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.910
 they key 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.560
 preferably there is a mouse on the day of the settlement 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.710
 minimap for drawing 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.930
 it is completely possible that there will be 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.610
 that one who likes your drawing and that 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.560
 quite a good way to make money 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.540
 a couple of likes to your account 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.970
 The main thing is not to move the mouse while it is drawn 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.080
 image otherwise she doesn't 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.760
 work out and never draw 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.120
 during kneading because you can't 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.180
 control your cursor is equally important 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.340
 pick up a delay whether some drawings 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.370
 initially it costs 60 but given 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.690
 drawing called fu 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.100
 part of it disappears faster than 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.670
 appears for this is necessary 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.620
 reduce the delay example to 50 so what 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.050
