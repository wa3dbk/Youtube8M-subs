00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
rocks at me I've become a hero it's that

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.410 
rocks at me I've become a hero it's that
simple<00:00:54.019> okay<00:00:55.019> so<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:55.979> are<00:00:56.010> looking<00:00:56.190> at<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.550> wsa

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
simple okay so we are looking at the wsa

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.770 
simple okay so we are looking at the wsa
and<00:00:57.659> little<00:00:58.379> prediction<00:00:59.339> we<00:00:59.970> had<00:01:00.149> double

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
and little prediction we had double

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.310 
and little prediction we had double
coronal<00:01:01.320> mass<00:01:01.470> ejections<00:01:02.040> semi<00:01:02.610> earth-facing

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
coronal mass ejections semi earth-facing

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.270 
coronal mass ejections semi earth-facing
launched<00:01:04.320> around<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.739> fourth<00:01:04.949> fifth<00:01:05.160> and

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
launched around the fourth fifth and

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.340 
launched around the fourth fifth and
sixth<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.789> are<00:01:06.119> headed<00:01:06.420> towards<00:01:07.289> Earth

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
sixth and are headed towards Earth

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.160 
sixth and are headed towards Earth
getting<00:01:07.979> here<00:01:08.160> right<00:01:08.820> about<00:01:09.030> now<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:10.110> I'm

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
getting here right about now and I'm

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.990 
getting here right about now and I'm
wondering<00:01:10.380> because<00:01:10.979> no<00:01:11.190> matter<00:01:11.310> what<00:01:11.399> those

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
wondering because no matter what those

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.870 
wondering because no matter what those
are<00:01:12.179> pushing<00:01:12.509> solar<00:01:13.470> wind<00:01:13.800> and<00:01:14.009> space<00:01:14.550> in

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
are pushing solar wind and space in

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.889 
are pushing solar wind and space in
front<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:17.429> burst<00:01:17.729> will<00:01:18.390> probably

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
front of it so the burst will probably

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:20.930 
front of it so the burst will probably
be<00:01:19.050> causing<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.560> push<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:20.070> Earth's<00:01:20.640> upper

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
be causing a push on Earth's upper

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.480 
be causing a push on Earth's upper
atmosphere<00:01:21.259> and<00:01:22.259> think<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> balloon

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
atmosphere and think of like a balloon

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.180 
atmosphere and think of like a balloon
so<00:01:24.360> when<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.570> press<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.050> balloon<00:01:25.289> cause

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
so when you press in a balloon cause

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.580 
so when you press in a balloon cause
tornadoes<00:01:26.550> and<00:01:27.000> right<00:01:27.390> okay<00:01:28.289> that's<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
tornadoes and right okay that's a

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.950 
tornadoes and right okay that's a
theory<00:01:28.800> it's<00:01:29.159> Thor<00:01:29.490> news<00:01:29.700> theory<00:01:29.970> but<00:01:30.929> I

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
theory it's Thor news theory but I

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.940 
theory it's Thor news theory but I
predicted<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.560> tornado<00:01:32.399> alley<00:01:33.000> torn

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
predicted this tornado alley torn

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.530 
predicted this tornado alley torn
terminada<00:01:35.240> terminada<00:01:36.500> tornado<00:01:37.520> city<00:01:38.540> when

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
terminada terminada tornado city when

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.310 
terminada terminada tornado city when
zilla<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.380> coming<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:41.299> live<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.390> Dallas<00:01:42.810> so

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
zilla that is coming I live in Dallas so

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.910 
zilla that is coming I live in Dallas so
I'm<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> danger<00:01:44.880> zone<00:01:45.020> top<00:01:46.020> gun<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.619> man

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
I'm in the danger zone top gun in it man

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.190 
I'm in the danger zone top gun in it man
so<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.850> know<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.119> tornadoes<00:01:48.899> are<00:01:49.020> very

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
so I know that tornadoes are very

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.530 
so I know that tornadoes are very
serious<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.770> people<00:01:50.490> lose<00:01:50.700> their<00:01:50.729> lives<00:01:50.969> and

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
serious and people lose their lives and

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.719 
serious and people lose their lives and
people<00:01:52.500> may<00:01:52.619> lose<00:01:52.829> their<00:01:52.979> lives<00:01:53.159> today<00:01:53.399> and

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729
