00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
out of like nowhere and a bunch of

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.610 
out of like nowhere and a bunch of
support<00:01:48.760> and<00:01:48.910> then<00:01:49.420> samurais<00:01:49.870> got<00:01:50.080> a<00:01:50.110> Nixie

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
support and then samurais got a Nixie

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.350 
support and then samurais got a Nixie
and<00:01:50.650> a<00:01:50.890> structure<00:01:51.340> that<00:01:51.370> can<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.910> bunch<00:01:52.240> of

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
and a structure that can a bunch of

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.210 
and a structure that can a bunch of
random<00:01:52.660> out<00:01:53.020> of<00:01:53.290> nowhere<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.800> bunch<00:01:54.160> of

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
random out of nowhere a bunch of

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.070 
random out of nowhere a bunch of
support<00:01:54.580> like<00:01:54.760> and<00:01:55.060> each<00:01:55.420> time<00:01:55.660> they<00:01:55.840> got

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
support like and each time they got

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.900 
support like and each time they got
random<00:01:56.680> support<00:01:57.070> they<00:01:57.190> want<00:01:57.370> to<00:01:57.460> watch<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.760> s

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
random support they want to watch the s

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.480 
random support they want to watch the s
shortly<00:01:58.270> after<00:01:58.600> so<00:01:58.780> go<00:01:59.470> figure<00:01:59.620> anyways<00:02:00.310> back

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
shortly after so go figure anyways back

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.600 
shortly after so go figure anyways back
to<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.700> point<00:02:00.870> so<00:02:01.870> it's<00:02:02.380> interesting<00:02:02.620> and<00:02:03.220> I'm

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
to the point so it's interesting and I'm

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.730 
to the point so it's interesting and I'm
starting<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.240> think<00:02:04.330> of<00:02:04.720> you<00:02:05.020> know<00:02:05.140> Dex<00:02:05.500> that

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
starting to think of you know Dex that

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.999 
starting to think of you know Dex that
could<00:02:05.890> potentially<00:02:06.060> not<00:02:07.060> only<00:02:07.480> get<00:02:08.009> synchro

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
could potentially not only get synchro

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.130 
could potentially not only get synchro
monsters<00:02:09.519> but<00:02:10.000> that's<00:02:10.179> that<00:02:10.360> really<00:02:10.660> needham

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
monsters but that's that really needham

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.110 
monsters but that's that really needham
like<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:11.800> then<00:02:12.069> some<00:02:12.340> of<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.550> most<00:02:12.760> feasible

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
like and then some of the most feasible

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.270 
like and then some of the most feasible
decks<00:02:13.599> like<00:02:14.079> I<00:02:14.290> would<00:02:14.469> not<00:02:14.620> be<00:02:14.799> shocked<00:02:15.099> if

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
decks like I would not be shocked if

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.280 
decks like I would not be shocked if
heroes<00:02:15.730> got<00:02:15.939> um<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:16.659> synchro<00:02:17.260> monster

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
heroes got um a synchro monster

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.410 
heroes got um a synchro monster
obviously<00:02:18.040> heroes<00:02:18.400> were<00:02:18.549> obvious<00:02:18.969> they<00:02:19.329> were

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
obviously heroes were obvious they were

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.179 
obviously heroes were obvious they were
supposed<00:02:19.629> to<00:02:19.659> be<00:02:19.810> fusion<00:02:20.230> based<00:02:20.409> you<00:02:20.859> know<00:02:20.890> all

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
supposed to be fusion based you know all

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.009 
supposed to be fusion based you know all
the<00:02:21.310> way<00:02:21.430> back<00:02:21.549> into<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.999> GX<00:02:22.299> era<00:02:22.510> but<00:02:22.930> the

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
the way back into the GX era but the

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.899 
the way back into the GX era but the
thing<00:02:23.049> about<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:24.010> thing<00:02:24.189> about<00:02:24.340> heroes<00:02:24.730> is

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
thing about the thing about heroes is

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.300 
thing about the thing about heroes is
much<00:02:25.060> like<00:02:25.239> samurai<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:26.469> game<00:02:26.769> is<00:02:27.010> basically

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
much like samurai the game is basically

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.179 
much like samurai the game is basically
shown<00:02:28.060> Konami<00:02:28.569> that<00:02:28.930> players<00:02:29.709> just<00:02:30.010> aren't

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189 
shown Konami that players just aren't

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:31.500 
shown Konami that players just aren't
gonna<00:02:30.459> drop<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.879> deck<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:31.180> doesn't<00:02:31.420> matter

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
gonna drop the deck it doesn't matter

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.809 
gonna drop the deck it doesn't matter
what<00:02:31.659> they<00:02:32.049> do<00:02:32.109> you<00:02:32.950> know<00:02:33.069> if<00:02:33.280> they<00:02:33.400> hit<00:02:33.609> these

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
what they do you know if they hit these

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.280 
what they do you know if they hit these
cards<00:02:34.299> if<00:02:34.420> they<00:02:34.540> don't<00:02:34.810> want<00:02:35.019> you<00:02:35.109> playing

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
cards if they don't want you playing

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.140 
cards if they don't want you playing
them<00:02:35.650> people<00:02:36.249> are<00:02:36.340> pretty<00:02:36.519> much<00:02:36.670> gonna<00:02:36.879> play

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
them people are pretty much gonna play

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.089 
them people are pretty much gonna play
heroes<00:02:37.480> forever<00:02:37.989> as<00:02:38.230> long<00:02:38.260> as<00:02:38.530> straddles<00:02:38.950> is

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
heroes forever as long as straddles is

legal<00:02:39.459> you<00:02:39.879> know<00:02:40.030> I<00:02:40.209> think<00:02:40.299> that<00:02:40.659> glads<00:02:40.959> even

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
legal you know I think that glads even

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.989 
legal you know I think that glads even
have<00:02:41.469> a<00:02:41.499> chance<00:02:41.590> of<00:02:41.950> getting<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.249> synchro<00:02:42.609> you

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:42.999 
have a chance of getting a synchro you

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:44.640 
have a chance of getting a synchro you
know<00:02:43.150> didn't<00:02:43.510> as<00:02:43.689> a<00:02:43.719> dollar<00:02:44.079> you<00:02:44.230> kind<00:02:44.439> of<00:02:44.499> just

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
felt needed the most support right now

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.959 
felt needed the most support right now
it's<00:03:15.430> also<00:03:15.549> dark<00:03:16.079> it's<00:03:17.079> a<00:03:17.319> requires<00:03:18.040> one<00:03:18.549> tuner

use<00:04:54.370> it<00:04:54.490> from<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.730> graveyard<00:04:54.970> and<00:04:55.420> you<00:04:55.660> can

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
use it from the graveyard and you can

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.450 
use it from the graveyard and you can
use<00:04:55.900> it<00:04:55.930> on<00:04:56.080> both<00:04:56.230> turn<00:04:56.440> so<00:04:56.650> that's<00:04:57.190> definitely

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
use it on both turn so that's definitely

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.850 
use it on both turn so that's definitely
cool<00:04:57.880> and<00:04:58.450> use<00:04:58.900> your<00:04:59.050> opponent's<00:04:59.170> hand<00:04:59.620> to<00:04:59.740> do

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
cool and use your opponent's hand to do

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.230 
cool and use your opponent's hand to do

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.810 
it you know they trying some the monster
if<00:05:02.140> for<00:05:02.440> some<00:05:02.500> reason<00:05:02.680> you<00:05:03.070> know<00:05:03.430> you<00:05:03.490> haven't

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
if for some reason you know you haven't

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.490 
if for some reason you know you haven't
won<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.150> game<00:05:04.300> already<00:05:04.630> you<00:05:04.780> just<00:05:04.990> bounce

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.560 
won the game already you just bounce
that<00:05:05.770> card<00:05:06.040> back<00:05:06.520> to<00:05:06.670> their<00:05:06.820> hand<00:05:07.060> using<00:05:07.450> their

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
that card back to their hand using their

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.570 
that card back to their hand using their
own<00:05:07.690> cars<00:05:07.990> so<00:05:08.230> I<00:05:08.440> mean<00:05:08.860> it's<00:05:08.980> definitely<00:05:09.190> gonna

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
own cars so I mean it's definitely gonna

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.220 
own cars so I mean it's definitely gonna
be<00:05:09.640> good<00:05:09.790> but<00:05:09.970> it's<00:05:10.210> only<00:05:10.330> once<00:05:10.600> per<00:05:10.690> turn<00:05:10.810> so<00:05:11.170> I

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
be good but it's only once per turn so I

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.960 
be good but it's only once per turn so I
feel<00:05:11.530> like<00:05:11.560> it's<00:05:11.770> not<00:05:11.980> really<00:05:12.250> like<00:05:12.280> that<00:05:12.460> Opie

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
feel like it's not really like that Opie
