1977 when the Star Wars first came out

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.910 
1977 when the Star Wars first came out
and<00:00:13.830> became<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.309> phenomenon<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.920> so

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
and became the phenomenon that it is so

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.550 
and became the phenomenon that it is so
all<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.760> movies<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:19.020> hear<00:00:19.289> and

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
their byproducts if you will that main

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.230 
their byproducts if you will that main
theme<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:23.010> what<00:00:23.310> we're<00:00:23.460> going<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.609> learn<00:00:23.730> today

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
theme is what we're going to learn today

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.089 
theme is what we're going to learn today
so<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:25.230> key<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.529> we're<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.769> do<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:25.980> in

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
so the key that we're going to do it in

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:38.189 
so the key that we're going to do it in
is<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.550> key<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.730> G<00:00:26.970> K<00:00:27.480> G<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.080> G

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.369 

okay<00:00:38.980> this<00:00:39.609> is<00:00:39.760> actually<00:00:40.149> a<00:00:40.179> March<00:00:40.929> it's

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
okay this is actually a March it's

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.049 
okay this is actually a March it's
supposed<00:00:41.589> to<00:00:41.620> be<00:00:41.739> very<00:00:41.800> majestic<00:00:42.160> and<00:00:42.909> you

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
supposed to be very majestic and you

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.200 
supposed to be very majestic and you
know<00:00:43.149> somewhat<00:00:43.600> moderate<00:00:44.109> as<00:00:44.320> far<00:00:44.530> as<00:00:44.620> a<00:00:44.649> tempo

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
know somewhat moderate as far as a tempo

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.180 
know somewhat moderate as far as a tempo
well<00:00:46.210> we'll<00:00:46.449> take<00:00:46.750> it<00:00:46.899> off<00:00:47.050> very<00:00:47.440> slow<00:00:47.829> and

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
well we'll take it off very slow and

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.180 
well we'll take it off very slow and
then<00:00:48.820> maybe<00:00:49.359> kind<00:00:49.600> of<00:00:49.659> speed<00:00:49.899> it<00:00:49.989> up<00:00:50.140> to<00:00:50.320> almost

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
then maybe kind of speed it up to almost

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.649 
then maybe kind of speed it up to almost
where<00:00:51.640> it<00:00:51.729> needs<00:00:51.879> to<00:00:52.000> be<00:00:52.210> here<00:00:52.329> that<00:00:52.479> way<00:00:52.600> you

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
where it needs to be here that way you

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.649 
where it needs to be here that way you
can<00:00:52.870> kind<00:00:53.079> of<00:00:53.109> play<00:00:53.260> along<00:00:53.589> and<00:00:54.119> somewhere<00:00:55.119> be

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
can kind of play along and somewhere be

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:57.509 
can kind of play along and somewhere be
where<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.229> the<00:00:56.559> main<00:00:56.739> tempo<00:00:57.100> is<00:00:57.159> supposed<00:00:57.460> to

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
where the the main tempo is supposed to

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.389 
where the the main tempo is supposed to
be<00:00:57.699> so<00:00:58.269> let's<00:00:58.960> learn<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.379> right<00:00:59.680> hand<00:01:00.010> for<00:01:00.309> the

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
be so let's learn the right hand for the

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.759 
be so let's learn the right hand for the
first<00:01:00.640> two<00:01:00.909> a<00:01:00.939> few<00:01:01.239> measures<00:01:02.140> and<00:01:02.439> then<00:01:02.530> we'll

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
first two a few measures and then we'll

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.189 
first two a few measures and then we'll
go<00:01:03.579> back<00:01:03.760> and<00:01:03.789> add<00:01:04.119> the<00:01:04.239> left<00:01:04.449> hand<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:05.110> then

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
go back and add the left hand and then

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.749 
go back and add the left hand and then
try<00:01:05.409> to<00:01:05.470> put<00:01:06.009> it<00:01:06.100> all<00:01:06.189> together<00:01:06.399> in<00:01:06.700> that

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
try to put it all together in that

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.399 
try to put it all together in that
aspect<00:01:07.149> and<00:01:07.509> take<00:01:07.659> a<00:01:07.689> kind<00:01:07.990> of<00:01:08.020> chunk<00:01:08.229> at<00:01:08.380> a

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
aspect and take a kind of chunk at a

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.029 
aspect and take a kind of chunk at a
time<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.820> written<00:01:10.090> in<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.690> form<00:01:11.050> of<00:01:11.170> a<00:01:11.440> ABA

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
time it's written in the form of a ABA

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.480 
time it's written in the form of a ABA
the<00:01:12.580> B<00:01:12.880> being<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.300> bridge<00:01:13.569> so<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.679> a<00:01:14.710> section

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
the B being the bridge so the a section

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.570 
the B being the bridge so the a section
gets<00:01:15.970> repeated<00:01:16.360> twice<00:01:16.720> a<00:01:17.110> a<00:01:17.500> and<00:01:18.039> then<00:01:18.369> it<00:01:18.460> goes

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
gets repeated twice a a and then it goes

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.370 
gets repeated twice a a and then it goes
to<00:01:18.759> the<00:01:18.850> bridge<00:01:19.060> which<00:01:19.750> you<00:01:19.869> really<00:01:20.110> hear<00:01:20.259> the

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
to the bridge which you really hear the

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.260 
to the bridge which you really hear the
bridge<00:01:20.590> only<00:01:20.830> once<00:01:21.250> and<00:01:21.610> then<00:01:21.789> it<00:01:21.880> comes<00:01:22.060> back

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
bridge only once and then it comes back

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.719 
bridge only once and then it comes back
to<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:22.720> a<00:01:23.080> section<00:01:23.740> which<00:01:23.890> is<00:01:24.039> our<00:01:24.190> main<00:01:24.399> thing

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
to the a section which is our main thing

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.490 
to the a section which is our main thing
that<00:01:24.759> theme<00:01:25.390> that<00:01:25.600> we<00:01:25.720> recognized<00:01:26.229> throughout

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
that theme that we recognized throughout

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.070 
that theme that we recognized throughout
the<00:01:26.560> whole<00:01:26.830> thing<00:01:27.069> okay<00:01:27.909> so<00:01:28.090> it<00:01:28.569> starts<00:01:28.899> off

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
the whole thing okay so it starts off

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.440 
the whole thing okay so it starts off
basically<00:01:29.649> on<00:01:29.890> a<00:01:29.920> pickup<00:01:30.250> measure<00:01:30.880> pickup

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
basically on a pickup measure pickup

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.340 
basically on a pickup measure pickup
notes<00:01:31.750> which<00:01:32.110> is<00:01:32.350> for<00:01:32.679> triplets<00:01:33.250> or<00:01:34.049> cap<00:01:35.049> for

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
notes which is for triplets or cap for

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.430 
notes which is for triplets or cap for
three<00:01:36.130> triplets<00:01:36.549> so<00:01:37.240> a<00:01:37.479> big<00:01:37.720> four<00:01:38.020> triplet

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
three triplets so a big four triplet

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.120 
three triplets so a big four triplet
that's<00:01:39.340> all<00:01:39.580> DS<00:01:39.970> one<00:01:40.720> two<00:01:41.080> three<00:01:41.590> now<00:01:41.860> here's

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
that's all DS one two three now here's

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:56.109 
that's all DS one two three now here's
the<00:01:42.310> downbeat

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.300 

okay<00:01:56.780> so<00:01:56.840> what<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.350> heck<00:01:57.500> is<00:01:57.649> all<00:01:57.799> that<00:01:58.039> all

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
okay so what the heck is all that all

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.330 
okay so what the heck is all that all
right<00:01:58.369> so<00:01:59.030> it's<00:01:59.299> three<00:01:59.630> DS<00:01:59.840> one<00:02:00.500> two<00:02:00.890> three

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
right so it's three DS one two three

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.149 
right so it's three DS one two three
which<00:02:01.549> is<00:02:01.579> four<00:02:01.759> triplet<00:02:02.299> then<00:02:02.840> down<00:02:03.679> B<00:02:03.920> that's

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
which is four triplet then down B that's

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.040 
which is four triplet then down B that's
B<00:02:04.929> D<00:02:05.929> G<00:02:06.729> that<00:02:07.729> pulls<00:02:08.000> off<00:02:08.149> for<00:02:08.330> two<00:02:08.450> counts<00:02:08.660> and

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
B D G that pulls off for two counts and

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.440 
B D G that pulls off for two counts and
then<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:09.379> have<00:02:09.649> three<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.550> go<00:02:10.729> up<00:02:10.910> basically<00:02:11.390> an

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
then I have three you go up basically an

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.890 
then I have three you go up basically an
inversion<00:02:11.870> of<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:13.010> G<00:02:13.190> triad<00:02:13.879> so<00:02:14.360> now<00:02:14.540> it's<00:02:14.750> in

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
inversion of the G triad so now it's in

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.869 
inversion of the G triad so now it's in
root<00:02:15.140> position<00:02:15.170> G<00:02:15.980> B<00:02:16.790> D<00:02:17.980> next<00:02:18.980> measure<00:02:19.250> you're

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
root position G B D next measure you're

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.119 
root position G B D next measure you're
doing<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.180> triplet<00:02:20.629> on<00:02:20.750> count<00:02:21.019> one<00:02:21.349> off<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:22.010> a

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
doing a triplet on count one off of a

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.020 
doing a triplet on count one off of a
seat<00:02:22.370> try<00:02:22.819> it<00:02:22.879> so<00:02:23.269> C<00:02:23.660> is<00:02:24.049> going<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.379> Eve<00:02:24.560> G<00:02:25.160> C<00:02:25.760> and

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
seat try it so C is going to Eve G C and

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.100 
seat try it so C is going to Eve G C and
the<00:02:26.780> melodies<00:02:27.200> on<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:27.440> top<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:29.780> can<00:02:29.840> whole

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
the melodies on the top so you can whole

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.080 
the melodies on the top so you can whole
long<00:02:30.290> those<00:02:30.530> notes<00:02:30.890> until<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.400> get<00:02:31.880> to<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.060> a

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
long those notes until you get to the a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.830 
long those notes until you get to the a
and<00:02:32.390> lift<00:02:32.540> up<00:02:32.660> on<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:32.840> G<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:36.950> is<00:02:37.130> C<00:02:37.730> be<00:02:38.540> a

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
and lift up on that G so that is C be a

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.770 
and lift up on that G so that is C be a
no<00:02:39.610> another<00:02:40.610> inversion<00:02:41.030> of<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.569> G<00:02:41.780> triad<00:02:42.760> B<00:02:43.780> D

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
no another inversion of the G triad B D

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.280 
no another inversion of the G triad B D
G<00:02:45.079> and<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:46.910> holds<00:02:47.299> for<00:02:47.480> two<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:48.019> then<00:02:48.170> I'll

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
G and that holds for two and then I'll

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.809 
G and that holds for two and then I'll
count<00:02:48.560> before<00:02:48.709> you<00:02:49.040> come<00:02:49.250> down<00:02:49.280> another

G triad in root position here's new

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.309 
G triad in root position here's new
information<00:03:12.470> at<00:03:12.680> F<00:03:13.099> triad<00:03:14.049> basically<00:03:15.049> after

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
information at F triad basically after

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.630 
information at F triad basically after
they<00:03:15.680> see

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.020 

toggles<00:03:19.510> back<00:03:19.660> between<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.080> C<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.680> beam

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
toggles back between the C and the beam

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:28.710 
toggles back between the C and the beam
C<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.760> D<00:03:25.000> triad<00:03:25.569> the<00:03:26.200> F<00:03:26.560> sharp<00:03:27.180> they<00:03:28.180> and

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
C to the D triad the F sharp they and

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.210 
C to the D triad the F sharp they and
then<00:03:29.680> it<00:03:29.800> does<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.100> pick<00:03:30.310> up<00:03:30.520> for<00:03:32.069> so<00:03:33.069> it's

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
then it does the pick up for so it's

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.820 
then it does the pick up for so it's
part<00:03:33.490> of<00:03:33.550> a<00:03:33.640> triplet<00:03:33.940> if<00:03:34.209> you<00:03:34.330> will<00:03:34.540> on<00:03:34.830> didi

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
part of a triplet if you will on didi

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.610 
part of a triplet if you will on didi
and<00:03:35.860> it's<00:03:36.640> all<00:03:36.850> that<00:03:37.030> information<00:03:37.570> again<00:03:37.870> okay

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
and it's all that information again okay

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.180 
and it's all that information again okay
so<00:03:38.650> let's<00:03:39.100> start<00:03:39.610> on<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.760> second<00:03:40.090> half<00:03:41.190> two

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
so let's start on the second half two

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.640 
so let's start on the second half two
three<00:03:43.120> four<00:03:43.810> years<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.080> see<00:03:45.480> two<00:03:46.480> three<00:03:47.440> I'm

sorry so tempeh three three three and

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.430 
sorry so tempeh three three three and
new<00:03:57.190> information<00:03:57.700> at<00:03:57.850> that<00:03:57.880> point<00:03:58.360> okay<00:03:59.170> so

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
new information at that point okay so

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.780 
new information at that point okay so
what's<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.800> left<00:03:59.980> hand<00:04:00.190> doing<00:04:00.310> well<00:04:00.550> it's

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
what's the left hand doing well it's

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.229 
what's the left hand doing well it's
basically<00:04:01.090> doing<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:02.500> two<00:04:02.769> below<00:04:03.519> cello

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
basically doing the the two below cello

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.870 
basically doing the the two below cello
based<00:04:05.170> double<00:04:05.680> bass<00:04:05.830> line<00:04:06.160> and<00:04:06.489> it's<00:04:06.610> walking

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
based double bass line and it's walking

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.720 
based double bass line and it's walking
down<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:08.739> scale<00:04:09.040> backwards

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
down the scale backwards

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.100 
down the scale backwards
so<00:04:10.239> it's<00:04:10.390> G<00:04:10.810> f-sharp<00:04:11.530> E<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:13.450> at<00:04:13.570> this<00:04:13.810> point

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
so it's G f-sharp E and at this point

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.870 
so it's G f-sharp E and at this point
you<00:04:14.290> want<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.530> tuck<00:04:14.739> your<00:04:14.920> thumb<00:04:15.160> under<00:04:15.610> and

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
you want to tuck your thumb under and

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.940 
you want to tuck your thumb under and
this<00:04:16.000> is<00:04:16.150> a<00:04:16.180> finger<00:04:16.480> I<00:04:16.510> would<00:04:16.780> suggest<00:04:16.930> so<00:04:17.829> it

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
this is a finger I would suggest so it

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.460 
this is a finger I would suggest so it
does<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.310> D<00:04:18.579> that<00:04:18.970> way<00:04:19.209> you<00:04:19.269> can<00:04:19.690> go<00:04:20.109> to<00:04:20.140> where

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
does the D that way you can go to where

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.920 
does the D that way you can go to where
all<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.859> notes<00:04:21.070> are<00:04:21.360> see<00:04:22.360> is<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:22.660> next

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
all the notes are see is the next

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.470 
all the notes are see is the next
measure

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.830 

see<00:04:28.040> me

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.860 

now<00:04:32.290> this<00:04:32.560> is<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:32.980> F<00:04:33.160> chord<00:04:33.610> F<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:35.590> then<00:04:35.830> 13

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
now this is the F chord F and then 13

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.690 
now this is the F chord F and then 13
and<00:04:37.870> then<00:04:37.990> octave<00:04:38.380> DS<00:04:38.560> on<00:04:38.830> count<00:04:39.100> three<00:04:39.190> so

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
and then octave DS on count three so

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.590 
and then octave DS on count three so
that's<00:04:39.870> one<00:04:40.870> two<00:04:41.740> three<00:04:42.610> seconds<00:04:43.030> under<00:04:43.360> four

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
that's one two three seconds under four

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.700 
that's one two three seconds under four
one<00:04:44.440> two

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
one two

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.820 
one two
or<00:04:46.979> CLX<00:04:47.669> measure<00:04:47.910> too

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.610 

one<00:04:51.430> to<00:04:52.270> notice<00:04:52.780> on<00:04:53.050> my<00:04:53.580> pinky<00:04:54.580> over<00:04:55.470> that<00:04:56.470> way
