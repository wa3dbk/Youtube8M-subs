00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hey guys how are you this is ro I'm

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.059 
hey guys how are you this is ro I'm
bringing<00:00:03.330> another<00:00:03.659> review<00:00:04.110> and<00:00:04.319> this<00:00:04.830> time

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
bringing another review and this time

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.619 
bringing another review and this time
for<00:00:05.339> a<00:00:05.370> brand<00:00:05.850> that<00:00:05.940> we<00:00:06.029> already<00:00:06.299> know

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
for a brand that we already know

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.290 
for a brand that we already know
ballistic<00:00:07.319> this<00:00:07.950> review<00:00:08.280> is<00:00:08.519> on<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.000> shell

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
ballistic this review is on the shell

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.259 
ballistic this review is on the shell
gel<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.870> series<00:00:10.410> of<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.280> ballistic<00:00:11.820> cases

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
gel a series of the a ballistic cases

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.940 
gel a series of the a ballistic cases
and<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.690> fits<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.080> blackberry<00:00:13.500> curve<00:00:13.740> as

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
and this fits the blackberry curve as

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.620 
and this fits the blackberry curve as
you<00:00:14.099> can<00:00:14.219> see<00:00:14.400> 9315<00:00:15.330> 9360<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.340> 9370<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:18.000> um<00:00:18.240> as

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
you can see 9315 9360 and 9370 so um as

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.330 
you can see 9315 9360 and 9370 so um as
always<00:00:19.109> ballistic<00:00:19.650> delivers<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.130> great

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
always ballistic delivers a great

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.849 
always ballistic delivers a great
presentation<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.359> box<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.810> really<00:00:22.260> nice<00:00:22.470> it

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
presentation the box is really nice it

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.279 
presentation the box is really nice it
shows<00:00:23.250> some<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.449> information<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:25.109> how

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
shows some of the information on how

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.070 
shows some of the information on how
ballistic<00:00:25.800> cases<00:00:26.189> work<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.029> already<00:00:27.570> tested

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
ballistic cases work so I already tested

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.439 
ballistic cases work so I already tested
this<00:00:28.230> case<00:00:28.529> but<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.099> wanted<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.849> show<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.060> how

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
this case but I wanted to show you how

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.810 
this case but I wanted to show you how
the<00:00:30.510> package<00:00:31.050> comes<00:00:31.349> as<00:00:31.619> always<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> really

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
the package comes as always is a really

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.120 
the package comes as always is a really
nice<00:00:32.940> presentation<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.170> up<00:00:34.350> case<00:00:34.860> really

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
nice presentation on it up case really

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.490 
nice presentation on it up case really
solidly<00:00:35.579> plays<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.210> some<00:00:36.780> instruction<00:00:37.320> how<00:00:37.469> to

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
solidly plays in some instruction how to

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.799 
solidly plays in some instruction how to
mount<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.000> get<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.329> first<00:00:39.540> layer

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
mount it so you get the first layer

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.200 
mount it so you get the first layer
which<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.469> actually<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.129> silicon<00:00:41.610> really

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
which is actually the silicon really

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.270 
which is actually the silicon really
high<00:00:42.360> quality<00:00:42.390> silicon<00:00:43.260> with<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:44.070> logo

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
high quality silicon with the logo

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.580 
high quality silicon with the logo
ballistic<00:00:44.820> here<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.450> signature<00:00:45.870> for<00:00:46.350> our

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
ballistic here and the signature for our

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.400 
ballistic here and the signature for our
corners<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.340> realistic<00:00:47.850> corners<00:00:48.300> then<00:00:49.230> you

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
corners the realistic corners then you

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.200 
corners the realistic corners then you
get<00:00:49.620> our<00:00:49.800> later<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.219> one<00:00:50.340> layer<00:00:50.520> 3<00:00:50.879> which<00:00:51.180> is

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
get our later to one layer 3 which is

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.389 
get our later to one layer 3 which is
the<00:00:51.510> impact<00:00:51.840> resistant<00:00:52.379> polycarbonate<00:00:52.620> shell

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
the impact resistant polycarbonate shell

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.479 
the impact resistant polycarbonate shell
and<00:00:53.670> also<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> polymer<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.980> also<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.309> can

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and also the polymer and also you can

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.760 
and also the polymer and also you can
see<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.820> rug<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.390> firm<00:00:57.840> surface<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.590> back

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
see the rug of firm surface in the back

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.160 
see the rug of firm surface in the back
with<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.160> ballistic<00:00:59.760> logo<00:01:00.000> makes<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.960> case

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
with the ballistic logo makes the case

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.810 
with the ballistic logo makes the case
you<00:01:01.320> look<00:01:01.469> really<00:01:01.739> good<00:01:01.949> while<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.309> delivered

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
you look really good while I delivered

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.060 
you look really good while I delivered
an<00:01:02.940> extra<00:01:03.270> protection<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.379> let's<00:01:04.890> go<00:01:05.040> ahead

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
an extra protection so let's go ahead

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.890 
an extra protection so let's go ahead
and<00:01:05.280> mount<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.790> now<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> good<00:01:06.630> thing<00:01:06.810> about

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
and mount this now the good thing about

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.070 
and mount this now the good thing about
is<00:01:07.200> these<00:01:07.380> features<00:01:08.310> fits<00:01:08.670> three<00:01:09.210> devices<00:01:09.510> so

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
is these features fits three devices so

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.719 
is these features fits three devices so
any<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.470> blackberry<00:01:11.010> guys<00:01:11.340> definitely

seen<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.790> my<00:01:17.909> other<00:01:18.090> reviews<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:19.170> silicon

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
seen on my other reviews the silicon

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.580 
seen on my other reviews the silicon
work<00:01:20.460> basilicum<00:01:21.150> buttons<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.810> ballistic

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
work basilicum buttons in this ballistic

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.580 
work basilicum buttons in this ballistic
cases<00:01:22.920> are<00:01:23.100> amazing<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.119> once<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> silicon

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
cases are amazing so once the silicon

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.679 
cases are amazing so once the silicon
part<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.640> then<00:01:27.030> we're<00:01:27.180> going<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.390> insert

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
part is in then we're going to insert

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.530 
part is in then we're going to insert
the<00:01:27.900> second<00:01:28.259> part<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.970> start<00:01:30.270> from<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
the second part so I just start from the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.950 
the second part so I just start from the
side<00:01:30.890> it's<00:01:31.890> really<00:01:32.369> easy<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.610> put<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.270> once

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
side it's really easy to put in and once

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.410 
side it's really easy to put in and once
you<00:01:34.110> go<00:01:34.290> sin<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:35.070> stays<00:01:35.340> there<00:01:35.369> guys<00:01:35.759> so

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
you go sin it just stays there guys so

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.960 
you go sin it just stays there guys so
as<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.560> see<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.430> how<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> case

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
as you can see this is how the case

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.450 
as you can see this is how the case
looks<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.780> see<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.229> corners<00:01:40.890> really

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
looks you can see the corners really

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.960 
looks you can see the corners really
reinforced<00:01:42.360> corners<00:01:42.720> for<00:01:43.200> any<00:01:43.409> drops<00:01:43.970> camera

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
reinforced corners for any drops camera

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.990

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
ballistic always gives a really good

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.469 
ballistic always gives a really good
feeling<00:02:01.530> on<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> phone<00:02:02.130> because<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.360> know

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.789 
feeling on the phone because of you know
blackberries<00:02:03.960> for<00:02:03.990> me<00:02:04.290> there<00:02:04.439> are<00:02:04.590> sometimes

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
blackberries for me there are sometimes

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.010 
blackberries for me there are sometimes
a<00:02:05.040> little<00:02:05.189> too<00:02:05.310> small<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.600> ballistic

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
a little too small and the ballistic

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.380 
a little too small and the ballistic
case<00:02:07.200> make<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.590> feel<00:02:07.799> right<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.819> perfect

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
case make you feel right the perfect

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.780 
case make you feel right the perfect
size<00:02:09.569> now<00:02:10.140> in<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.679> case<00:02:11.039> what<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.340> see<00:02:11.730> in

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
size now in this case what I see in

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.920 
size now in this case what I see in
pretty<00:02:12.120> interesting<00:02:12.660> that

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
pretty interesting that

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.750 
pretty interesting that
top<00:02:13.049> and<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.439> bottom<00:02:13.650> they're<00:02:14.400> very

top and the bottom they're very

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.089 
top and the bottom they're very
reinforced<00:02:15.629> and<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.409> something<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.829> is

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
reinforced and that is something that is

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.470 
reinforced and that is something that is
really<00:02:17.280> important<00:02:17.819> blackberrys<00:02:18.269> because

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
really important blackberrys because

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.240 
really important blackberrys because
usually<00:02:18.629> when<00:02:18.989> you<00:02:19.140> drop<00:02:19.379> the<00:02:19.530> blackberry<00:02:19.950> to

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
usually when you drop the blackberry to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.830

the top and the bottom of the parts that

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.130 
the top and the bottom of the parts that
are<00:02:21.989> really<00:02:22.379> really<00:02:23.069> easy<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.579> crack<00:02:23.819> now<00:02:24.480> as

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
are really really easy to crack now as

press it one of the things that I felt
when<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.579> press<00:02:50.939> it<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.599> silicon<00:02:52.169> moves<00:02:52.409> a

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
when you press it the silicon moves a

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.460 
when you press it the silicon moves a
little<00:02:52.769> bit<00:02:53.069> but<00:02:53.939> it<00:02:54.480> gets<00:02:54.659> you<00:02:54.810> get<00:02:55.109> used<00:02:55.349> to

the way that you need to press the
buttons<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:58.500> back<00:02:58.709> part<00:02:59.040> it's<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.669> really<00:02:59.909> uh

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
buttons the back part it's a really uh

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.659 
buttons the back part it's a really uh
no<00:03:00.599> fingerprints<00:03:01.260> at<00:03:01.349> all<00:03:01.500> no<00:03:02.219> reset<00:03:02.639> Oh

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
either and as you can see the texture

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.159 
either and as you can see the texture
part<00:03:05.219> prevents<00:03:05.790> from<00:03:05.909> the<00:03:06.090> phone<00:03:06.329> sliding<00:03:07.019> it

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169 
part prevents from the phone sliding it

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.409 
part prevents from the phone sliding it
feels<00:03:07.769> really<00:03:07.980> good<00:03:08.219> in<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.489> hand<00:03:08.790> as<00:03:09.090> well

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
now the protection of this case delivers

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.289 
now the protection of this case delivers
is<00:03:12.510> great<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:13.459> did<00:03:14.459> a<00:03:14.519> couple<00:03:14.700> tests<00:03:15.120> on

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
is great I did a couple tests on

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.000 
is great I did a couple tests on
dropping<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.780> phone<00:03:16.019> and<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.469> top<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.889> the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
dropping the phone and the top and the

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.789 
dropping the phone and the top and the
bottom<00:03:17.040> part<00:03:17.579> are<00:03:18.139> really<00:03:19.139> really<00:03:19.379> extra

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
bottom part are really really extra

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.289 
bottom part are really really extra
secure<00:03:20.159> that's<00:03:20.370> something<00:03:20.790> really

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
secure that's something really

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.509 
secure that's something really
interesting<00:03:21.599> and<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.109> absorbs<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.889> lot<00:03:22.919> of<00:03:23.370> the

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
interesting and it absorbs a lot of the

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.080 
interesting and it absorbs a lot of the
of<00:03:23.699> the<00:03:24.329> of<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.959> shock<00:03:25.290> on<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:26.159> silicon<00:03:26.819> part

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
of the of the shock on the silicon part

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.569 
of the of the shock on the silicon part
then<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.900> polymer<00:03:28.379> of<00:03:28.470> course<00:03:28.739> is<00:03:28.949> for<00:03:29.159> for

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
then the polymer of course is for for

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.429 
then the polymer of course is for for
the<00:03:29.669> proof<00:03:29.879> now<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.329> ballistic<00:03:30.810> k<00:03:30.989> is<00:03:31.049> coming

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:31.439 
the proof now this ballistic k is coming

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.469 
the proof now this ballistic k is coming
with<00:03:31.560> something<00:03:31.949> called<00:03:32.099> lay<00:03:32.879> on<00:03:33.060> table

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:33.479 
with something called lay on table

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.719 
with something called lay on table
feature<00:03:33.689> which<00:03:34.290> means<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:34.949> when<00:03:35.159> we<00:03:35.340> put<00:03:35.609> the

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:35.729 
feature which means that when we put the

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:38.449 
feature which means that when we put the
phone<00:03:36.120> down<00:03:36.150> if<00:03:36.750> your<00:03:37.139> screen<00:03:37.500> does<00:03:37.769> not<00:03:38.099> touch

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
phone down if your screen does not touch

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.050 
phone down if your screen does not touch
the<00:03:39.269> table<00:03:39.720> itself<00:03:40.379> so<00:03:40.949> as<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:41.609> can<00:03:41.759> see<00:03:41.970> it

freedom of it while the screen is
getting<00:04:03.299> protected<00:04:03.659> by<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.049> silicon<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:04.919> by

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
getting protected by the silicon and by

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.059 
getting protected by the silicon and by
the<00:04:05.939> polymer<00:04:06.569> over<00:04:06.689> here<00:04:07.049> you<00:04:07.590> can<00:04:07.769> find<00:04:07.949> this

the polymer over here you can find this

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.129 
the polymer over here you can find this
case<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:08.489> three<00:04:08.669> different<00:04:08.879> colors<00:04:09.239> which<00:04:09.959> is

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
case in three different colors which is

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.229

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
black and grey the silicon always stays

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:15.800 
black and grey the silicon always stays
the<00:04:13.979> same<00:04:14.220> color<00:04:14.519> it<00:04:14.790> is<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.299> plastic<00:04:15.780> part

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
the same color it is the plastic part

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.890 
the same color it is the plastic part
that<00:04:16.680> changes<00:04:17.750> definitely<00:04:18.750> good

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
that changes definitely good

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.509 
that changes definitely good
combinations<00:04:19.560> really<00:04:19.889> professional-looking

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
combinations really professional-looking
