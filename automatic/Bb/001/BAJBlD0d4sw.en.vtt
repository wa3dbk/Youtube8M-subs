00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.039 

we're<00:00:11.790> gonna<00:00:11.880> be<00:00:12.090> taking<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.509> look<00:00:12.660> at<00:00:12.809> how<00:00:12.990> to

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
we're gonna be taking a look at how to

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.079 
we're gonna be taking a look at how to
make<00:00:13.259> your<00:00:13.469> minor<00:00:13.740> pentatonic<00:00:14.160> scale<00:00:14.820> work

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
make your minor pentatonic scale work

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.019 
make your minor pentatonic scale work
over<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.420> dominant<00:00:16.020> chord<00:00:16.340> the<00:00:17.340> big<00:00:17.520> issue<00:00:17.730> is

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
over a dominant chord the big issue is

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.400 
over a dominant chord the big issue is
that<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.270> dominant<00:00:18.660> chord<00:00:18.840> isn't<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.199> minor

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
that the dominant chord isn't a minor

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.140 
that the dominant chord isn't a minor
chord<00:00:19.740> but<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.220> use<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.460> from<00:00:20.550> clothes<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.060> we

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
chord but we use it from clothes and we

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.849 
chord but we use it from clothes and we
end<00:00:21.270> up<00:00:21.390> using<00:00:21.570> minor<00:00:22.050> sounds<00:00:22.680> like<00:00:22.830> a

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
end up using minor sounds like a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.560 
end up using minor sounds like a
pentatonic<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.670> blues<00:00:23.880> scale<00:00:24.029> over<00:00:24.359> it

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
pentatonic and the blues scale over it

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.300 
pentatonic and the blues scale over it
so<00:00:25.019> we're<00:00:25.140> gonna<00:00:25.230> take<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.470> look<00:00:25.710> at<00:00:25.859> how<00:00:26.250> to

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
so we're gonna take a look at how to

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.250 
so we're gonna take a look at how to
make<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:26.760> fit<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.449> also<00:00:27.779> which<00:00:27.900> notes<00:00:28.170> to

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
make this fit in and also which notes to

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.830 
make this fit in and also which notes to
stay<00:00:28.529> away<00:00:28.710> from<00:00:28.939> so<00:00:29.939> what<00:00:30.300> we're<00:00:30.449> gonna<00:00:30.510> do

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
stay away from so what we're gonna do

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.849 
stay away from so what we're gonna do
today<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.140> we're<00:00:31.320> actually<00:00:31.410> going<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> take<00:00:31.800> a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
today is we're actually going to take a

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.790 
today is we're actually going to take a
look<00:00:32.099> at<00:00:32.219> making<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.820> scale<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.870> doesn't<00:00:34.710> have

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
look at making a scale that doesn't have

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.590 
look at making a scale that doesn't have
all<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.070> same<00:00:35.280> notes<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.180> chord<00:00:36.450> you're

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
all the same notes as the chord you're

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.729 
all the same notes as the chord you're
playing<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.899> over<00:00:36.989> fit

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
playing it over fit

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.560 
playing it over fit
that's<00:00:38.070> essentially<00:00:38.520> what<00:00:38.550> happens<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.180> lot<00:00:39.390> of

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
that's essentially what happens a lot of

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.860 
that's essentially what happens a lot of
people<00:00:39.899> when<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.200> play<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> blues<00:00:41.329> or<00:00:42.329> any<00:00:42.570> kind

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
people when you play a blues or any kind

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.979 
people when you play a blues or any kind
of<00:00:43.050> like<00:00:43.260> dominant<00:00:43.770> chord<00:00:44.120> rhythm<00:00:45.120> they<00:00:45.780> think

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
of like dominant chord rhythm they think

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.569 
of like dominant chord rhythm they think
well<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.110> can<00:00:46.289> play<00:00:46.410> an<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.710> blues<00:00:47.010> or<00:00:47.190> an<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.370> minor

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
well I can play an a blues or an a minor

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.369 
well I can play an a blues or an a minor
pentatonic<00:00:47.910> scale<00:00:48.539> over<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:49.020> it's<00:00:49.260> gonna

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
pentatonic scale over that it's gonna

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.560 
pentatonic scale over that it's gonna
work<00:00:49.670> but<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.789> problem<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.360> doesn't

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
work but the problem is it doesn't

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.189 
work but the problem is it doesn't
entirely<00:00:51.930> work<00:00:52.289> we<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.280> chord<00:00:55.070> that<00:00:56.070> has<00:00:56.340> a

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
entirely work we have a chord that has a

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.150 
entirely work we have a chord that has a
root<00:00:58.199> C<00:00:59.129> sharp<00:00:59.489> which<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.300> major<00:01:00.570> third

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
root C sharp which is the major third

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.109 
root C sharp which is the major third
key<00:01:02.160> which<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.550> v<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.799> G<00:01:04.799> which<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
key which is v and G which is the the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.080 
key which is v and G which is the the
minor<00:01:06.330> 7th<00:01:06.810> those<00:01:06.960> are<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.140> Northeast<00:01:07.470> gather

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
minor 7th those are the Northeast gather

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.120 
minor 7th those are the Northeast gather
make<00:01:09.090> up<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.720> seven<00:01:10.140> chord<00:01:10.439> but<00:01:10.920> then<00:01:11.040> you

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
make up in a seven chord but then you

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.200 
make up in a seven chord but then you
have<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> scale<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:12.000> has<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.720> good<00:01:13.500> common<00:01:13.890> note

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
have a scale that has a good common note

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.390 
have a scale that has a good common note
C<00:01:15.210> natural<00:01:15.390> not<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.560> same<00:01:16.770> as<00:01:16.920> playing<00:01:17.100> C

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
C natural not the same as playing C

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.700 
C natural not the same as playing C
sharp<00:01:17.700> but<00:01:17.820> when<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.000> play<00:01:18.210> them<00:01:18.330> together

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
sharp but when you play them together

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.749 
sharp but when you play them together
you<00:01:19.710> get<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.979> kind<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.280> sound<00:01:21.380> d<00:01:22.380> natural<00:01:22.759> you

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
you get that kind of sound d natural you

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.840 
you get that kind of sound d natural you
know<00:01:23.790> once<00:01:24.090> again<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.689> get<00:01:25.549> that<00:01:26.549> kind<00:01:26.790> of

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
know once again we get that kind of

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.870 
know once again we get that kind of
sound<00:01:27.439> all<00:01:28.439> right<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.710> then<00:01:28.890> you've<00:01:29.340> got<00:01:29.579> e

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
sound all right and then you've got e

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.380 
sound all right and then you've got e
aren't<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:31.170> which<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> fifth<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.430> then

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
aren't you which is a fifth and then

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.749 
aren't you which is a fifth and then
you've<00:01:33.540> got<00:01:33.689> G<00:01:33.960> which<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.650> seventh<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
you've got G which is the seventh so the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.850 
you've got G which is the seventh so the
scale<00:01:36.090> mostly<00:01:36.720> fits<00:01:37.049> over<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> seven

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
scale mostly fits over that a seven

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.530 
scale mostly fits over that a seven
except<00:01:38.159> for<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.610> little<00:01:38.880> zone<00:01:39.090> where<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
except for in this little zone where the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.030 
except for in this little zone where the
this<00:01:39.810> court<00:01:40.680> itself

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
this court itself

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.270 
this court itself
has<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.520> c-sharp<00:01:43.030> and<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:44.050> scale<00:01:44.290> has<00:01:44.560> notes

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
has the c-sharp and the scale has notes

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.920 
has the c-sharp and the scale has notes
on<00:01:45.430> either<00:01:45.550> side<00:01:45.910> so<00:01:46.150> I've<00:01:46.540> got<00:01:46.690> this<00:01:46.780> little

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
on either side so I've got this little

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.780 
on either side so I've got this little
loop<00:01:47.200> here<00:01:47.230> that<00:01:47.710> I'm<00:01:47.920> gonna<00:01:48.040> happen<00:01:48.310> play<00:01:50.790> all

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
loop here that I'm gonna happen play all

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.670 
loop here that I'm gonna happen play all
right<00:01:51.820> just<00:01:52.150> a<00:01:52.330> seven<00:01:52.690> chord<00:01:52.930> looks<00:01:53.530> like<00:01:53.740> a

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.540 

I'm<00:01:59.680> just<00:01:59.830> using<00:01:59.980> a<00:02:00.100> seventh<00:02:00.400> chord

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
I'm just using a seventh chord

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.400 
I'm just using a seventh chord
moistening<00:02:00.940> do<00:02:01.270> I<00:02:01.330> have<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.660> c-sharp<00:02:02.110> in<00:02:02.320> the

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
moistening do I have the c-sharp in the

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.670 
moistening do I have the c-sharp in the
rhythm<00:02:02.680> now<00:02:02.890> if<00:02:03.460> I<00:02:03.550> play<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.850> root<00:02:04.680> sounds

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
rhythm now if I play the root sounds
