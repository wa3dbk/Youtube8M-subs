I think we're like 300 the other day we

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.899 
I think we're like 300 the other day we
should<00:01:10.799> be<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> little<00:01:11.250> closer<00:01:11.490> now<00:01:11.670> we're<00:01:11.850> like

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
should be a little closer now we're like

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.070 
should be a little closer now we're like
probably<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.540> something<00:01:13.640> to<00:01:14.640> 83<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.299> we're<00:01:15.450> 83

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
probably to something to 83 so we're 83

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.260 
probably to something to 83 so we're 83
away<00:01:16.290> from<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> top<00:01:16.920> 200<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.610> don't<00:01:18.150> know<00:01:18.240> like

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
away from the top 200 I don't know like

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.850 
away from the top 200 I don't know like
what<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.750> difference<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.320> don't<00:01:19.590> know<00:01:19.740> how

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
what the difference is I don't know how

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.200 
what the difference is I don't know how
they<00:01:19.890> calculate<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.549> trophies<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.970> don't<00:01:21.119> know

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
they calculate the trophies I don't know

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.560 
they calculate the trophies I don't know
if<00:01:21.270> its<00:01:21.390> top<00:01:21.570> 10<00:01:21.780> or<00:01:21.900> what<00:01:22.850> top<00:01:23.850> 20<00:01:24.210> because<00:01:24.450> it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
if its top 10 or what top 20 because it

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.179 
if its top 10 or what top 20 because it
can't<00:01:24.750> be<00:01:24.869> all<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.020> them<00:01:25.229> combined<00:01:25.409> right<00:01:25.890> I

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
can't be all of them combined right I

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.010 
can't be all of them combined right I
don't<00:01:27.090> think<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.330> all<00:01:27.450> then<00:01:27.659> combined<00:01:27.930> I

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
don't think it's all then combined I

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.630 
don't think it's all then combined I
think<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.229> do<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.500> different<00:01:28.680> way<00:01:28.829> but<00:01:29.460> I

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
think they do it a different way but I

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.770 
think they do it a different way but I
want<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.939> get<00:01:30.000> my<00:01:30.119> trophies<00:01:30.420> up<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.600> want<00:01:30.720> to
