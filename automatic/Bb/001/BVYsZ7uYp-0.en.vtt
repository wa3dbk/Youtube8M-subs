00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
of it through time but we had an

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.740 
of it through time but we had an
opportunity<00:00:39.370> to<00:00:39.730> create<00:00:40.060> a<00:00:40.210> really<00:00:40.540> unique

original vision of a monster world and

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.560 
original vision of a monster world and
it<00:00:44.470> was<00:00:44.560> a<00:00:44.590> lot<00:00:44.830> of<00:00:44.860> fun<00:00:44.980> because<00:00:45.670> in<00:00:46.000> computer

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
it was a lot of fun because in computer

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.900 
it was a lot of fun because in computer
graphics<00:00:46.690> we<00:00:47.320> have<00:00:47.530> to<00:00:47.710> create<00:00:48.070> every<00:00:48.700> last

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
graphics we have to create every last

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.000 
graphics we have to create every last
little<00:00:49.150> detail<00:00:49.270> every<00:00:49.900> prop<00:00:50.170> every<00:00:50.530> building

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
little detail every prop every building

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.640 
little detail every prop every building
down<00:00:51.670> to<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:51.910> tiniest<00:00:52.150> detail<00:00:52.840> so<00:00:53.380> somebody

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
down to the tiniest detail so somebody

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.350 
down to the tiniest detail so somebody
has<00:00:53.800> to<00:00:53.950> think<00:00:54.160> about<00:00:54.400> all<00:00:54.520> those<00:00:54.670> details<00:00:55.150> and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
has to think about all those details and

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.180 
has to think about all those details and
it<00:00:55.420> was<00:00:55.540> great<00:00:55.750> fun<00:00:56.020> to<00:00:56.080> think<00:00:56.560> them<00:00:56.800> all<00:00:56.950> up

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
it was great fun to think them all up

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.800 
it was great fun to think them all up
and<00:00:57.430> to<00:00:57.790> create<00:00:58.030> a<00:00:58.120> world<00:00:58.360> that<00:00:58.510> not<00:00:58.690> only

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
and to create a world that not only

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.800 
and to create a world that not only
looked<00:00:59.200> cool<00:00:59.500> but<00:01:00.310> made<00:01:00.610> sense<00:01:01.030> that<00:01:01.570> was<00:01:01.690> one

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
looked cool but made sense that was one

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.640 
looked cool but made sense that was one
of<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:01.930> criterias<00:01:02.530> to<00:01:02.740> have<00:01:02.890> some<00:01:03.390> relatable

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
of the criterias to have some relatable

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.649 
of the criterias to have some relatable
connection<00:01:05.650> to<00:01:05.800> our<00:01:05.980> world<00:01:06.250> and<00:01:06.730> also<00:01:06.909> it

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
connection to our world and also it

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:08.790 
connection to our world and also it
could<00:01:07.900> be<00:01:08.020> designed<00:01:08.290> this<00:01:08.409> way<00:01:08.560> for<00:01:08.740> the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
could be designed this way for the

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.410 
could be designed this way for the
monsters<00:01:09.190> it<00:01:09.370> has<00:01:09.490> to<00:01:09.580> be<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.700> real<00:01:10.000> reason<00:01:10.240> for

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
monsters it has to be a real reason for

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.880 
monsters it has to be a real reason for
we<00:01:10.659> have<00:01:10.780> to<00:01:10.870> really<00:01:11.110> kind<00:01:11.320> of<00:01:11.380> think<00:01:11.650> it<00:01:11.740> out

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
we have to really kind of think it out

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.960 
we have to really kind of think it out
as<00:01:12.159> opposed<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.730> this<00:01:13.120> looks<00:01:13.360> neat<00:01:13.600> we<00:01:14.380> kind<00:01:14.620> of

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
as opposed to this looks neat we kind of

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.610 
as opposed to this looks neat we kind of
wound<00:01:15.970> up<00:01:16.270> thinking<00:01:16.750> of<00:01:16.840> Monstropolis<00:01:17.260> is

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
wound up thinking of Monstropolis is

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.530 
wound up thinking of Monstropolis is
kind<00:01:17.860> of<00:01:17.950> almost<00:01:18.250> a<00:01:18.490> parallel<00:01:18.850> universe<00:01:18.880> with

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
kind of almost a parallel universe with

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.520 
kind of almost a parallel universe with
the<00:01:19.930> human<00:01:20.740> world<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:22.270> at<00:01:22.420> first<00:01:22.630> glance<00:01:22.990> it

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
the human world that at first glance it

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.760 
the human world that at first glance it
looks<00:01:24.190> like<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.370> regular<00:01:24.700> city<00:01:25.180> it's<00:01:25.450> not<00:01:25.770> so

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
looks like a regular city it's not so

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.980 
looks like a regular city it's not so
bizarre<00:01:27.190> that<00:01:27.220> you<00:01:27.550> can't<00:01:27.790> figure<00:01:28.060> out<00:01:28.240> what

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
bizarre that you can't figure out what

with<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.650> story<00:03:42.920> reels<00:03:43.250> we<00:03:43.549> move<00:03:43.730> on<00:03:43.849> into

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
with the story reels we move on into

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.300 
with the story reels we move on into
layout<00:03:44.480> that's<00:03:45.079> where<00:03:45.349> we<00:03:45.530> determine<00:03:46.129> the

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
layout that's where we determine the

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.699 
layout that's where we determine the
compositions<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.569> the<00:03:47.810> visual<00:03:47.989> structure<00:03:48.470> of

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
compositions and the visual structure of

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.470 
compositions and the visual structure of
the<00:03:48.799> movie<00:03:49.099> we<00:03:49.640> work<00:03:49.910> with<00:03:50.090> little<00:03:50.299> virtual

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
the movie we work with little virtual

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.479 
the movie we work with little virtual
sets<00:03:50.959> with<00:03:51.140> a<00:03:51.170> virtual<00:03:51.410> camera<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.160> we<00:03:52.250> figure

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
sets with a virtual camera and we figure

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:53.920 
sets with a virtual camera and we figure
out<00:03:52.519> how<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.790> cameras<00:03:53.209> going<00:03:53.329> to<00:03:53.480> move<00:03:53.690> and

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
out how the cameras going to move and

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.869 
out how the cameras going to move and
basically<00:03:54.530> do<00:03:54.829> everything<00:03:55.129> that<00:03:55.489> we<00:03:55.549> can<00:03:55.640> to

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
basically do everything that we can to

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:01.360 
basically do everything that we can to
make<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.299> film<00:03:56.510> very<00:03:57.019> visually<00:03:57.590> dynamic<00:04:00.370> this

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
make the film very visually dynamic this

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.920 
make the film very visually dynamic this
part<00:04:01.579> of<00:04:01.639> aggression<00:04:02.030> real<00:04:02.239> I'm<00:04:02.600> going<00:04:02.810> to

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
part of aggression real I'm going to

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.349 
part of aggression real I'm going to
talk<00:04:03.079> a<00:04:03.139> little<00:04:03.380> bit<00:04:03.620> about<00:04:03.920> animation<00:04:04.549> Leia

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
talk a little bit about animation Leia

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.360 
talk a little bit about animation Leia
basically<00:04:05.959> provide<00:04:06.319> us<00:04:06.500> with<00:04:06.590> a<00:04:06.709> blueprint<00:04:07.250> of

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
basically provide us with a blueprint of

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.670 
basically provide us with a blueprint of
how<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.609> shot<00:04:07.940> will<00:04:08.090> work<00:04:08.269> we're<00:04:09.260> concerned

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
how the shot will work we're concerned

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.250 
how the shot will work we're concerned
with<00:04:09.889> is<00:04:10.069> bringing<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:10.519> characters<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:11.090> life

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
with is bringing the characters to life

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.390 
with is bringing the characters to life
first<00:04:12.260> thing<00:04:12.440> we<00:04:12.560> do<00:04:12.680> is<00:04:12.709> we<00:04:12.950> listen<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.370> the

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
first thing we do is we listen to the

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.000 
first thing we do is we listen to the
dialogue<00:04:13.790> of<00:04:14.359> the<00:04:14.389> actors<00:04:15.230> portraying<00:04:15.889> these

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
dialogue of the actors portraying these

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.069 
dialogue of the actors portraying these
characters<00:04:16.459> again<00:04:17.120> and<00:04:17.419> again<00:04:17.630> and<00:04:17.870> again

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
characters again and again and again

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.560 
characters again and again and again
let's<00:04:18.440> do<00:04:18.560> a<00:04:18.590> hundreds<00:04:19.010> of<00:04:19.070> times<00:04:19.510> trying<00:04:20.510> to

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
let's do a hundreds of times trying to

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.690 
let's do a hundreds of times trying to
figure<00:04:20.720> out<00:04:20.870> what<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.769> right<00:04:21.950> gestures<00:04:22.340> what

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
figure out what the right gestures what

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.129 
figure out what the right gestures what
the<00:04:22.789> right<00:04:22.910> performance<00:04:23.450> for<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:23.930> shot

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
the right performance for the shot

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.350 
the right performance for the shot
should<00:04:24.320> be<00:04:24.500> some<00:04:25.400> animators<00:04:25.849> just<00:04:26.150> sit<00:04:26.300> at

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
should be some animators just sit at

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.230 
should be some animators just sit at
their<00:04:26.419> desk<00:04:26.660> and<00:04:26.900> act<00:04:27.080> it<00:04:27.260> out<00:04:27.349> like<00:04:27.620> madmen

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
their desk and act it out like madmen

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.510 
their desk and act it out like madmen
other<00:04:29.240> animators<00:04:29.840> use<00:04:30.410> video<00:04:30.889> reference<00:04:31.310> the

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
other animators use video reference the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.940 
other animators use video reference the
videotape<00:04:32.120> themselves<00:04:32.360> acting<00:04:33.139> it<00:04:33.260> out<00:04:33.380> just

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
videotape themselves acting it out just

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.980 
videotape themselves acting it out just
to<00:04:34.130> get<00:04:34.280> clear<00:04:34.580> their<00:04:34.789> own<00:04:34.910> minds<00:04:35.210> what<00:04:35.870> the

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
to get clear their own minds what the

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.020 
to get clear their own minds what the
performance<00:04:36.500> should<00:04:36.680> be<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:37.340> last<00:04:37.580> thing<00:04:37.880> we

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
performance should be the last thing we

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.560 
performance should be the last thing we
do<00:04:38.180> is<00:04:38.780> work<00:04:38.990> on<00:04:39.110> the<00:04:39.169> characters<00:04:39.680> face<00:04:40.570> we

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
do is work on the characters face we

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.420 
do is work on the characters face we
find<00:04:41.870> that<00:04:42.050> if<00:04:42.229> we<00:04:42.349> can<00:04:42.380> communicate<00:04:42.860> an<00:04:43.310> idea

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
find that if we can communicate an idea

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.330 
find that if we can communicate an idea
through<00:04:44.389> pantomime<00:04:44.990> using<00:04:45.650> Sully's<00:04:46.039> entire

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
through pantomime using Sully's entire

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.790 
through pantomime using Sully's entire
body<00:04:46.669> when<00:04:47.630> we<00:04:47.750> finally<00:04:47.990> go<00:04:48.229> into<00:04:48.440> the<00:04:48.530> face

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
body when we finally go into the face

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.770 
body when we finally go into the face
we're<00:04:49.400> really<00:04:49.610> only<00:04:49.820> plussing<00:04:50.389> something

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
we're really only plussing something

cut
the<00:05:06.720> next<00:05:06.990> step<00:05:07.140> is<00:05:07.380> when<00:05:07.620> the<00:05:07.920> shot<00:05:08.100> leaves

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
the next step is when the shot leaves

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.620 
the next step is when the shot leaves
animation<00:05:08.820> and<00:05:08.970> comes<00:05:09.120> into<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.420> shots

Department and in particular for this

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.680 
Department and in particular for this
shot<00:05:11.550> we're<00:05:11.760> going<00:05:11.880> to<00:05:11.940> be<00:05:12.060> simulating

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
shot we're going to be simulating

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.300 
shot we're going to be simulating
Sullivan's<00:05:13.140> fur<00:05:13.350> it's<00:05:13.620> an<00:05:13.740> important<00:05:14.100> part

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
Sullivan's fur it's an important part

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.860 
Sullivan's fur it's an important part
it's<00:05:14.520> a<00:05:14.580> part<00:05:14.820> of<00:05:14.880> Sullivan's<00:05:15.270> look<00:05:15.540> to<00:05:15.750> put

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
it's a part of Sullivan's look to put

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.750 
it's a part of Sullivan's look to put
all<00:05:15.960> that<00:05:16.110> fur<00:05:16.350> on<00:05:16.500> it<00:05:16.530> but<00:05:17.160> most<00:05:17.340> importantly

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
all that fur on it but most importantly

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.460 
all that fur on it but most importantly
simulation<00:05:18.360> is<00:05:18.450> really<00:05:18.690> where<00:05:18.840> we're<00:05:19.020> adding

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
simulation is really where we're adding

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.950 
simulation is really where we're adding
the<00:05:20.310> overlapping<00:05:20.760> action<00:05:21.060> in<00:05:21.390> the<00:05:21.480> animation

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
the overlapping action in the animation

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.360 
the overlapping action in the animation
so<00:05:22.140> we're<00:05:22.290> really<00:05:22.440> breathing<00:05:22.830> an<00:05:22.980> additional

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
so we're really breathing an additional

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.460 
so we're really breathing an additional
amount<00:05:23.610> of<00:05:23.700> life<00:05:23.910> into<00:05:24.120> that<00:05:24.270> character<00:05:24.480> by

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
amount of life into that character by

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.320 
amount of life into that character by
having<00:05:25.800> that<00:05:25.830> for<00:05:26.190> reacting<00:05:26.730> to<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:26.940> motion

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
having that for reacting to the motion

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.390 
having that for reacting to the motion
the<00:05:27.900> hair<00:05:28.110> there<00:05:28.320> is<00:05:28.350> really<00:05:28.740> flouncing<00:05:29.340> and

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
the hair there is really flouncing and

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.790 
the hair there is really flouncing and
reaction<00:05:29.880> it<00:05:30.000> adds<00:05:30.180> a<00:05:30.300> lot<00:05:30.420> of<00:05:30.570> life<00:05:30.780> it<00:05:31.560> really

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
reaction it adds a lot of life it really

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.680 
reaction it adds a lot of life it really
conveys<00:05:32.190> is<00:05:32.400> emotion<00:05:32.820> of<00:05:32.880> being<00:05:32.940> bouncing<00:05:33.570> in

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
conveys is emotion of being bouncing in

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.740 
conveys is emotion of being bouncing in
that<00:05:33.810> same<00:05:34.610> after<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.730> animation<00:05:36.210> is<00:05:36.330> final

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
that same after the animation is final

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.870 
that same after the animation is final
we<00:05:37.050> still<00:05:37.290> have<00:05:37.410> to<00:05:37.530> add<00:05:37.560> the<00:05:37.710> shaders<00:05:38.580> which

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
we still have to add the shaders which

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.180 
we still have to add the shaders which
is<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:39.300> textures<00:05:39.990> and<00:05:40.080> the<00:05:40.260> colors<00:05:40.320> basically

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
is the textures and the colors basically

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.130 
is the textures and the colors basically
and<00:05:41.370> the<00:05:41.970> lighting<00:05:42.210> which<00:05:42.450> is<00:05:42.600> the<00:05:42.720> shadows

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
and the lighting which is the shadows

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.660 
and the lighting which is the shadows
and<00:05:43.290> the<00:05:43.350> depth<00:05:43.620> it's<00:05:44.040> only<00:05:44.220> after<00:05:44.550> these

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.670 
and the depth it's only after these

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.120 
and the depth it's only after these
shaders<00:05:45.090> and<00:05:45.270> lighting<00:05:46.080> is<00:05:46.200> finished<00:05:46.590> that

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
shaders and lighting is finished that

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.650 
shaders and lighting is finished that
