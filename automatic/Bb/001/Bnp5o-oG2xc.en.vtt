00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
you can bend it hovering the way you

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:07.870 
you can bend it hovering the way you
want<00:06:01.139> it<00:06:01.349> I'm<00:06:01.560> not<00:06:01.919> sure<00:06:04.070> can't<00:06:05.070> sketchy

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.250 

let's<00:06:08.450> see<00:06:08.780> what<00:06:08.990> sounds<00:06:09.440> like<00:06:09.670> full<00:06:10.670> quarter

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
let's see what sounds like full quarter

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:28.830
