bit<00:03:40.959> I<00:03:41.459> just<00:03:42.459> crimp<00:03:44.370> see

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:04:02.330 

great<00:03:50.000> under<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:51.860> male<00:03:52.069> crimp

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:10.709 

and<00:04:03.340> see<00:04:03.879> if<00:04:04.090> it's<00:04:04.239> right<00:04:06.959> ok<00:04:09.180> so<00:04:10.180> next<00:04:10.420> what<00:04:10.659> I

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:10.719 
and see if it's right ok so next what I

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:19.289 
and see if it's right ok so next what I
do<00:04:10.840> is<00:04:12.209> I<00:04:13.209> take<00:04:13.719> the<00:04:14.019> the<00:04:14.379> sleeve<00:04:14.680> and<00:04:16.650> I<00:04:18.180> put<00:04:19.180> it

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
do is I take the the sleeve and I put it

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.719 
do is I take the the sleeve and I put it
in<00:04:19.539> the<00:04:19.989> middle<00:04:20.259> there<00:04:21.870> then<00:04:22.870> I<00:04:22.900> take<00:04:23.169> and

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
in the middle there then I take and

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:29.990 
in the middle there then I take and
measure<00:04:24.729> it<00:04:25.139> all<00:04:26.139> the<00:04:26.530> way<00:04:26.710> to<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.430> other<00:04:28.030> side

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
measure it all the way to the other side

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.040 
measure it all the way to the other side
in<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.660> middle<00:04:31.900> there<00:04:32.080> I<00:04:36.210> usually<00:04:37.210> do<00:04:37.599> this<00:04:37.630> a

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.170 

little<00:04:41.050> differently<00:04:41.229> but<00:04:42.449> yeah<00:04:43.449> and<00:04:43.660> make<00:04:43.900> the

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
little differently but yeah and make the

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.300 
little differently but yeah and make the
cut<00:04:46.979> as<00:04:47.979> straight<00:04:48.460> as<00:04:48.639> you<00:04:48.669> can<00:04:49.470> now<00:04:50.470> use<00:04:50.500> the

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
cut as straight as you can now use the

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:57.200 
cut as straight as you can now use the
pic<00:04:51.669> lighter<00:04:51.970> I<00:04:52.680> use<00:04:53.680> the<00:04:54.509> blue<00:04:55.509> part<00:04:55.810> of<00:04:55.960> flame

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
pic lighter I use the blue part of flame

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:07.770 
pic lighter I use the blue part of flame
to<00:04:58.210> melt<00:04:58.360> it<00:04:58.570> a<00:04:58.630> little<00:04:58.750> bit<00:04:58.960> so<00:04:59.259> it

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:17.120 

yep<00:05:08.380> okay<00:05:08.860> i<00:05:10.830> just<00:05:11.830> put<00:05:12.220> the<00:05:12.400> sleeve<00:05:12.610> on<00:05:15.180> and

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
yep okay i just put the sleeve on and

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:23.159 
yep okay i just put the sleeve on and
then<00:05:18.130> I<00:05:18.520> check<00:05:19.770> if<00:05:20.770> it's<00:05:21.220> a<00:05:21.550> fit<00:05:21.820> yeah<00:05:22.419> looks

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
then I check if it's a fit yeah looks

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.740 
then I check if it's a fit yeah looks
like<00:05:23.290> it's<00:05:23.590> a<00:05:23.710> perfect<00:05:24.070> fit<00:05:24.270> then<00:05:25.270> I<00:05:25.360> take<00:05:25.540> out

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
like it's a perfect fit then I take out

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.080 
like it's a perfect fit then I take out
the<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.290> heat<00:05:26.470> shrink<00:05:26.770> just<00:05:29.580> took<00:05:30.580> justice<00:05:31.060> a

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
the the heat shrink just took justice a

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:41.670 
the the heat shrink just took justice a
little<00:05:31.389> bit

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.180 

and<00:05:42.550> again<00:05:43.509> I<00:05:43.539> use<00:05:43.810> the<00:05:44.050> blue<00:05:44.410> part<00:05:44.710> of<00:05:44.830> the<00:05:44.889> pic

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
and again I use the blue part of the pic

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:54.920 
and again I use the blue part of the pic
lighter<00:05:46.979> to<00:05:47.979> melt<00:05:48.759> this

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.810 

and<00:05:55.530> I<00:05:55.620> do<00:05:55.680> this<00:05:55.949> until<00:05:56.400> I<00:05:56.970> start<00:05:57.690> seeing<00:05:58.820> some

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
and I do this until I start seeing some

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:08.870 
and I do this until I start seeing some
bubbles<00:06:00.690> in<00:06:00.990> the<00:06:01.650> rubber<00:06:05.720> and<00:06:06.720> I<00:06:06.810> just<00:06:07.850> tap<00:06:08.850> it

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
bubbles in the rubber and I just tap it

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.230 
bubbles in the rubber and I just tap it
a<00:06:09.090> little<00:06:09.240> bit<00:06:10.729> then<00:06:11.729> I<00:06:11.759> remove<00:06:12.180> it<00:06:13.009> so<00:06:14.240> now

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
a little bit then I remove it so now

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.200 
a little bit then I remove it so now
it's<00:06:15.449> completely<00:06:15.660> stuck<00:06:16.380> on<00:06:16.590> there<00:06:17.210> there's

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
it's completely stuck on there there's

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.570 
it's completely stuck on there there's
no<00:06:18.389> way<00:06:18.570> you<00:06:18.630> can<00:06:18.990> remove<00:06:19.710> it<00:06:19.949> without<00:06:20.130> cutting

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
no way you can remove it without cutting

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.129 
no way you can remove it without cutting
it<00:06:20.759> off<00:06:21.710> so<00:06:22.710> then<00:06:23.009> to<00:06:23.460> the<00:06:23.610> other<00:06:23.729> end<00:06:24.139> stretch

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 
it off so then to the other end stretch

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:35.170 
it off so then to the other end stretch
it<00:06:27.020> put<00:06:28.020> on<00:06:28.139> the<00:06:28.320> heat<00:06:28.470> shrink<00:06:33.259> melt<00:06:34.259> it<00:06:34.470> on

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
it put on the heat shrink melt it on

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:53.970 
it put on the heat shrink melt it on
with<00:06:36.180> a<00:06:36.210> blue<00:06:36.570> part<00:06:36.900> of<00:06:36.990> the<00:06:37.979> flame

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:53.980 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:07:01.070 

and<00:06:54.550> cut<00:06:54.940> it<00:06:55.060> off<00:06:56.790> so<00:06:58.770> now<00:06:59.770> we<00:06:59.830> have<00:06:59.950> one<00:07:00.310> wire

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
and cut it off so now we have one wire

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:07.440 
and cut it off so now we have one wire
but<00:07:02.080> what<00:07:02.260> I<00:07:02.290> do<00:07:03.300> to<00:07:04.300> make<00:07:04.990> like<00:07:05.850> 24<00:07:06.850> the<00:07:07.210> same

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:07.450 
but what I do to make like 24 the same

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.870 
but what I do to make like 24 the same
length<00:07:07.750> and<00:07:08.080> they<00:07:08.350> have<00:07:08.500> to<00:07:08.650> be<00:07:08.860> exactly<00:07:09.670> the

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:09.880 
length and they have to be exactly the

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.070 
length and they have to be exactly the
same<00:07:10.680> when<00:07:11.680> I<00:07:11.710> cut<00:07:12.100> one<00:07:12.130> like<00:07:12.670> 20<00:07:13.240> let's<00:07:13.630> say<00:07:13.750> 20

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 
same when I cut one like 20 let's say 20

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.690 
same when I cut one like 20 let's say 20
centimeters<00:07:14.560> I<00:07:16.170> ok<00:07:17.170> let's<00:07:18.130> just<00:07:18.220> say<00:07:18.520> I'm

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:18.700 
centimeters I ok let's just say I'm

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:25.920 
centimeters I ok let's just say I'm
gonna<00:07:20.040> make<00:07:21.040> this<00:07:21.070> length<00:07:21.520> I<00:07:22.800> take<00:07:23.800> that<00:07:24.040> and<00:07:24.930> I

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:25.930 
gonna make this length I take that and I

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.520 
gonna make this length I take that and I
measure<00:07:26.200> it<00:07:26.640> just<00:07:27.640> against<00:07:28.120> the<00:07:28.360> wire<00:07:28.750> again

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:29.530 
measure it just against the wire again

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:34.650 
measure it just against the wire again
and<00:07:30.070> again<00:07:30.400> and<00:07:30.670> again<00:07:30.940> until<00:07:31.720> I<00:07:32.650> have<00:07:33.660> the

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:34.660 
and again and again until I have the

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.480 
and again and again until I have the
amount<00:07:34.900> of<00:07:35.050> wire<00:07:35.290> and<00:07:35.320> eat<00:07:36.720> that<00:07:37.720> way<00:07:38.020> they're

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:38.490 
amount of wire and eat that way they're

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:44.670 
amount of wire and eat that way they're
all<00:07:39.490> the<00:07:40.090> same<00:07:40.120> length<00:07:42.660> and<00:07:43.660> I<00:07:44.380> do<00:07:44.440> the<00:07:44.650> same

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680 
all the same length and I do the same

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.140 
all the same length and I do the same
with<00:07:45.070> a<00:07:45.100> heat<00:07:45.310> shrink<00:07:45.610> I<00:07:47.190> after<00:07:48.190> i<00:07:48.220> put<00:07:49.000> the

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:49.150 
with a heat shrink I after i put the

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.100 
with a heat shrink I after i put the
crimp<00:07:49.390> on<00:07:49.980> i'm<00:07:50.980> messing<00:07:51.340> it<00:07:51.430> up<00:07:51.520> against<00:07:51.910> it

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.110 
crimp on i'm messing it up against it

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.580 
crimp on i'm messing it up against it
cut<00:07:53.110> it<00:07:53.340> and<00:07:54.340> then<00:07:54.700> I<00:07:54.790> measured<00:07:55.270> it<00:07:55.300> again<00:07:55.630> and

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:56.590 
cut it and then I measured it again and

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:04.170 
cut it and then I measured it again and
again<00:07:59.220> ok<00:08:00.220> so<00:08:00.660> this<00:08:01.660> is<00:08:01.870> basically<00:08:02.020> it<00:08:03.090> if<00:08:04.090> you

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:04.180 
again ok so this is basically it if you

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.120 
again ok so this is basically it if you
