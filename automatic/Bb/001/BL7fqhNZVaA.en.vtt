00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.800
 the captain of fc twente stadion in darfur 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.400
 the result fought a lot 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.949
 but that is not enough 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:11.909
 renÃ© danen even think that we too 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:14.909
 all the best 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.499
 getting a good chance afterwards came out of nowhere 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:21.010
 but you actually know that 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.009
 two even years 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.269
 who look forward to having to create a maximum of two chances at level 2 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.789
 and therefore all victim had from a net game situation that happened so 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:32.330
 not 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.920
 I also feel a bit nervous 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.410
 someone from the night away and 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.410
 what do you think of a fun year may this year dallas 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.060
 and he never never without because later 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.290
 this sees 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.400
 If we had agreed after three minutes, we should be boss red here as frustrating 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.100
 you are nice 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.970
 they see what they had to do and then you have to let go of it as rafael nadal 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:55.760
 know 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.750
 yes to indonesia our members says paul play very sloppy i think 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.330
 but through south, which allowed her to walk a little further 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.690
 but once in a while even the play very well after a sunny day 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.060
 life came 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.800
 of course you always have until the last minute is always played 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.369
 a chance 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.909
 you also have ninety minutes more than seven hundred but the club what is it 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.360
 perspective how would you stumble that 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.740
 after a solution then one for this competition but yes then we have them 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.970
 all doing 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.050
 and the five minutes involved 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.330
 he could have known that we could do that 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.680
 NATO done after it expressed a little sympathy 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.580
 and i looked okada arrived bother yes you say neighborhood you are the captain 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.620
 from fc twente I just have to inform she has a piece 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.360
 journalism 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.650
 and current affairs you go 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.640
 we are with twente is sure you will stay with twente this season 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.620
 because Ajax really wanted to have it 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.110
 yes but I also start right away says eric there permanent solution 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.000
 twente 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.070
 nice that the clubs come out then immediately talk to ajax 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.700
 not before and he will remain the fans 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.460
 is still spoken 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.510
 I would tell my life I said you would not want to stand out anyway and 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
 thus his Nma's judgment is not to say that 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:12.529
 thank you for your ticket
