scrunch it like when jail looks better
but<00:04:30.940> I'm<00:04:31.940> showing<00:04:32.419> you<00:04:32.509> what<00:04:33.319> you<00:04:33.470> can<00:04:33.889> do<00:04:34.250> just

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
but I'm showing you what you can do just

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.909 
but I'm showing you what you can do just
get<00:04:35.419> a<00:04:35.479> little<00:04:35.720> of<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.400> sea<00:04:37.400> salt<00:04:37.759> spray<00:04:38.919> and

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
get a little of the sea salt spray and

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.960 
get a little of the sea salt spray and
just<00:04:39.949> go<00:04:40.789> easy<00:04:40.940> with<00:04:41.210> this<00:04:41.360> because<00:04:41.810> it<00:04:42.970> the

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
just go easy with this because it the

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.999 
just go easy with this because it the
number<00:04:44.240> one<00:04:44.300> ingredient<00:04:44.590> besides<00:04:45.590> water<00:04:45.860> I

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
number one ingredient besides water I

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:52.240 
number one ingredient besides water I
think<00:04:46.370> yeah<00:04:46.960> is<00:04:47.960> sea<00:04:48.289> salt<00:04:50.889> so<00:04:51.889> it<00:04:51.979> can<00:04:52.130> be

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
think yeah is sea salt so it can be

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.600 
think yeah is sea salt so it can be
pretty<00:04:52.430> dry<00:04:53.740> if<00:04:54.740> you<00:04:54.889> use<00:04:55.039> too<00:04:55.190> much<00:04:55.220> like

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
pretty dry if you use too much like

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.629 
pretty dry if you use too much like
gently<00:04:56.150> scrunch<00:04:56.750> it<00:04:57.020> just<00:04:57.590> like<00:04:57.800> really

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
gently scrunch it just like really

gently scrunch it just like really
gently<00:05:01.030> so<00:05:03.910> because<00:05:04.910> it<00:05:05.120> is<00:05:05.150> gonna<00:05:05.479> frizz

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
gently so because it is gonna frizz

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.909
