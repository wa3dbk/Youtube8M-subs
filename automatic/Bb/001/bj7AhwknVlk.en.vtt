00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.970
 very good friends and friends 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.070
 you are clear although games I come 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.660
 today with a classic game of the company 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.730
 is from the year 1995 double puzzles 2 ago 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.169
 very much time I went up the first part 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.940
 a little one who used to talk about the same thing 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.250
 but I'm going to fight against 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.590
 machine to see if I am able to win at 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.620
 one with tremendous null activities in 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.630
 this game and I will insert the credit and 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.180
 I'm going to player versus computer, I'm going to 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.809
 put in normal because doing this 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.570
 game 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:54.730
 it's crazy this is the whale's 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:58.269
 bubble bublé what happens but because 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.400
 Touch the tongue but do not touch it 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.739
 the language has to make the spill 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.290
 well, that's what I have to do 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.490
 here is to fix fast and ostia not see no 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.250
 what the first enemy sent me 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.200
 You could send me so many things and leave me 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.910
 do something 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.650
 I have to pay attention not to screw up because 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.930
 Then I will have a problem 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.590
 quite fat and more when it starts to 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.020
 download everything well 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.229
 here we need a good concentration 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.149
 and make a good good combo really 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.520
 what I have to do is combine and 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.200
 throwing all the possible balls seems 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.579
 very easy but I think I was 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.829
 starting at them I 'm not going to look at 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.869
 rival throughout the game because I think that 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.469
 enough I have to look at my board 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:45.799
 and that the game is announcing to me that 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:49.009
 thing here, he said he waited not 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.479
 see do not see it do not see it is not you 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.659
 taking us mates you're 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.970
 celebrating you are taking with me that 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.229
 I did not do anything good then to see if I 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.430
 I can observe with him from some 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.590
 way 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.840
 this way of doing here is throwing 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.150
 here is here is here 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.220
 OK 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:13.770
 I'm perfect in this and the yellow one takes 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.810
 everything is for you everything is for you 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.500
 even if it fails it can only cost the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.430
 starting game is red here in the 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.950
 yellow I'm going to move there 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.549
 I just messed up if it does not cost me so expensive 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.549
 OK 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.110
 one 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.940
 with more luck than anyone's hope and 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.980
 we're going against this happy kitten that 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.900
 it's a happy free clock tower it 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.730
 He falls head car stays 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.700
 saying what the fuck is this 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:49.500
 well come you have to win this kitten or 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:56.750
 whatever I do not even know what it is seems 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:03:00.230
 a cat seems like there is a good combo 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.250
 here I just started shitting 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.840
 so all the means 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.630
 I hope the game does not get too 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.380
 farruco 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.290
 good triumph, it must be said 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:19.410
 play that has gone well and I miss 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:22.410
 more flowers that is speed is not worth it 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.620
 Okay, well, let's go for the girl 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.030
 is 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.610
 what a hairy sheep looks at 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.069
 seems to elevate the subject falls in love with 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.830
 she exercises so much in love already 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.319
 that we are going to crochet to hit him is 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.470
 Well, well, we're not going to hit a lot 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.470
 cane 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.160
 and he sent me shit 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.640
 for what I have to do is clear 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:55.170
 now this part because I see that it can 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.170
 be my great ruin 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.800
 I do not see it not sure that it is my great ruin 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.640
 how it goes like this 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.640
 very dirty 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:10.840
 God, get out of here, get out of here, no, no, no, 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.840
 coña you see the story 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.670
 ostias sends it or more still but 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.670
 but it will be 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:23.219
 It is impossible and impossible if I am 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.629
 the plague good too much you get to 3 

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:27.060
 the truth that I had no hope of 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:28.830
 move from the first what is a game that 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.810
 I will have to practice in the rival mode 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.310
 and good friends, I say goodbye 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.020
 here I hope you like it if we see the 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.020
 next video greetings to all and all
