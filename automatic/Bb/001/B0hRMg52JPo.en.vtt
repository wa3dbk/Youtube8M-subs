00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello everybody on our last video we 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.670
 We asked what you wanted to know. 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.429
 about kings 4 x hd 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.510
 the newest super smartphone from LG 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.460
 a few weeks of a ton and a half 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.950
 of questions after we are ready 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.759
 to give answers but to pec 15 and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.650
 to prepare 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.410
 the result is a roller coaster in 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.570
 some points really optimus 4gb 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.020
 impresses but in others it points 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.020
 enough 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.260
 let's start with the features 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.300
 or lg optimus 4x ht measures about 13 per 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.969
 7 centimeters has eight points nine 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.719
 millimeters thick and weighs 133 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.430
 grams 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.730
 the front is all dominated by a 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.870
 beautiful 4.7 inch lcd screen with 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.239
 hd resolution 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.070
 she uses the same ips technology used 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.780
 by apple on iphone and ipad not 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.329
 matter from which angle you look at the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.710
 the screen image is never distorted 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.649
 heart of the device is a processor 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.039
 1.5 ghz quad core nvidia tegra 3 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.809
 accompanied by 1 GB RAM and 16 GB 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.299
 gb of internal memory that can be 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.159
 expanded with micro sd cards inserted 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.820
 into a slot under the rear cover of the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.560
 appliance 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.020
 next to a slot for a sim card 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.509
 normal size the only connectors on the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.590
 handset are the headset on top 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.900
 and usb 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.240
 down there in this usb connector too. 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.979
 an mhl adapter can be plugged into 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.409
 hdmi so that you can connect the 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.250
 smartphone to a high definition tv 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.590
 but you'll have to buy one 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.509
 adapter separately the only things 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.729
 that you will find inside the box and 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.100
 are the device a usb cable 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.869
 the charger and a pair of headphones 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.479
 You'll also find two labels 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.860
 nfc that can be used to modify 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.270
 the behavior of the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.090
 device whenever he approaches 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.189
 some adjustments in pre-defined and 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.290
 you can modify it and save this new 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.079
 setting back on the label using 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.990
 the lgt class application for example the 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.120
 Office mode connects wi fi e 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.860
 puts it in silent mode 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.110
 but if I want I can keep the sound 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.520
 connected and active also bluetooth 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.820
 talking in software the system 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.980
 operating system is android 4.0 point 3 or 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.479
 but the interface was slightly 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.130
 modified by LG 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.760
 but nothing that deserves to highlight the reach 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.920
 lg optimus bother 4gb hd is not a 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.540
 compatible device with 4g networks 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.190
 but for now this does not have much 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.890
 importance because there is no 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.450
 4g network in commercial operation in brazil 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.420
 the first networks will only start to 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.880
 to run until April 2013 initially 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.280
 in the host city of the Confederations Cup 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.500
 and other cities may take even longer 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.510
 the 8-megapixel camera has flash and 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.120
 various interesting features with the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.620
 and hdr mode which is very useful 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.540
 for them the situations of contrast 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.460
 between light and shadow as a picture of a 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.590
 cloudy sky over a city under the light 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.750
 from the sun the photos are great but 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.640
 unfortunately in low light situations 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.560
 camera has difficulty maintaining focus 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.900
 and the images have a lot of noise 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.430
 even in the most illuminated areas the camera 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.490
 also has a continuous shooting mode 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.709
 or boost that makes six photos and fast 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.640
 sequence at the touch of a button is a 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.680
 so that it is becoming quite 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.140
 popular in the smartphone cameras 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.810
 sophisticated and very useful for taking 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.560
 photos of sports children or animals 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.470
 love 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.330
 the problem is that in the optimus 4x HD 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.610
 is practically useless because the 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:22.200
 resolution of the images is only 640 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.580
 by 480 pixels or 0.3 megapixels 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.040
 the photos are too small for 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.080
 put on the web how much more to print 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.870
 for you to have an idea samsung galaxy 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.630
 s 3 has a unique mode that makes eight 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.850
 8-megapixel photos each in three 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.760
 seconds that are much better 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.010
 time to record video optimus 4gb does 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.350
 images with resolution of 1920 by 1080 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.450
 pixels or full hd 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.670
 gives to use the zoom while shooting do 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.170
 a tweezing gesture on the screen and adjusting 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.820
 focus is automatic 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.950
 You asked me a lot about the 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.150
 performance in an act that our 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.860
 standard tool for measuring the 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.790
 android smartphone performance 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.890
 the optimus 4x HD reached 12,193 points 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.989
 a little ahead of the galaxy 3 of the 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.730
 samsung that so far is the smartphone 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.739
 faster than had passed by 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.510
 our hands but does not get too involved 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.840
 because the difference between the two is 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.000
 only 148 points and in no way will it 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.090
 be perceived during day- to- day use 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.630
 at this great point 4 ghz also turned out 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.250
 good 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.470
 we had no problem working 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.930
 with multiple applications to switch between 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.560
 they surf the web or watch videos 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.630
 in hd 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.490
 but what do you really want to know about 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.050
 performance in games and here I have 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.840
 a good and bad news 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.910
 The bad news is that it really chokes 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.370
 gameloft games as a knight of 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.350
 darkness the good news reappears is that 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.180
 to be the fault of gameloft who does not 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.500
 correctly used their games in 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.430
 instead of a problem with 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.050
 appliance 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.820
 I say this because I did not have any 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.820
 problem with other games 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.280
 developers like racing 2 lift 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.250
 arts or you should tread on the average daughter 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.050
 They all played really well anyway. 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.880
 frustrating to buy a top smartphone 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.650
 line and see what some popular games 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.650
 in the forum right to battery life 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.900
 is the weakness of optimus 4 gb 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.509
 in the video test and made with 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.410
 50% screen the device in airplane mode up to 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:12.990
 that he did well 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.419
 were ten hours of continuous production the 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.900
 problem was in the practical test on 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.180
 day 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.370
 we achieved on average 13 hours and 30 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.020
 minutes over several days 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.250
 is a low result even more 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.430
 whereas the main competitor 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.030
 the galaxy s 3 reached just over 20 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.800
 hours 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.060
 we expected more from the battery of the 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.620
 optimus 4x hd 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.660
 further considering that the 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.970
 Tegra 3 processor has a fifth core 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.500
 low energy consumption that assumes the 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.600
 smartphone when the others 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.789
 four cores are not needed 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.740
 in theory this would increase the 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.229
 autonomy but not what happened 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.120
 Overall optimus 4x HD is a good 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:51.449
 smartphone even more considering the 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.400
 price suggested by the manufacturer of 1,699 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.289
 but to answer the question the 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.300
 What else have you done to me in the last weeks? 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:00.150
 I still do not consider he overcame the 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.949
 galaxy 3 that has a better camera and a 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.720
 longer battery life 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:06.389
 This is it folks if you still have 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.250
 any questions about lg optimus 4x hd 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.990
 stirring here in the comments of the 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.460
 do not forget to follow the 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.440
 people on twitter to take our 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.610
 other kids here on youtube and visit 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.610
 on the site even more
