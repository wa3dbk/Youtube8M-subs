00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
there are cubes and parts everywhere

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.259 
there are cubes and parts everywhere
fear<00:00:22.740> not<00:00:23.010> just<00:00:23.400> simply<00:00:23.670> disconnect<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
fear not just simply disconnect the

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.089 
fear not just simply disconnect the
pilot<00:00:24.600> C<00:00:24.750> from<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.050> vehicle<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.590> try<00:00:26.039> to

pilot C from the vehicle and try to

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.560 
pilot C from the vehicle and try to
enter<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> battle<00:00:26.730> there<00:00:27.300> should<00:00:27.449> be<00:00:27.539> a

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
enter a battle there should be a

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.029 
enter a battle there should be a
notification<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.439> comes<00:00:28.680> up<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.980> says

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
notification that comes up that says

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.439 
notification that comes up that says
that<00:00:29.400> some<00:00:29.609> part<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.910> your<00:00:30.029> vehicle<00:00:30.390> is

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
that some part of your vehicle is

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.330 
that some part of your vehicle is
disconnected<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:31.679> ignore<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.099> and

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
disconnected but ignore that and

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.729 
disconnected but ignore that and
continued<00:00:32.850> forward<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.480> there<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.500> have<00:00:34.559> it

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
continued forward and there you have it

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.530 
continued forward and there you have it
another<00:00:35.219> empty<00:00:35.520> bay<00:00:35.730> for<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.239> mess<00:00:36.420> around

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
another empty bay for you to mess around

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.690 
another empty bay for you to mess around
with<00:00:36.809> moving<00:00:37.739> on<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> next<00:00:38.280> step<00:00:38.520> will<00:00:38.670> be

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
with moving on to the next step will be

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.790 
with moving on to the next step will be
try<00:00:39.000> forcing<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.629> what<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.899> basically<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.350> at

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
try forcing and what it basically is at

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.770 
try forcing and what it basically is at
least<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.160> my<00:00:41.340> definition<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.120> armor

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
least in my definition is armor

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.630 
least in my definition is armor
placement<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.410> redirects<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.040> damage<00:00:44.340> away

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
placement that redirects the damage away

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.880 
placement that redirects the damage away
from<00:00:44.850> critical<00:00:45.329> components<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.680> very

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
from critical components it's a very

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.319 
from critical components it's a very
beneficial<00:00:47.129> trait<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.149> your<00:00:48.300> vehicle

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
beneficial trait to have on your vehicle

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.970 
beneficial trait to have on your vehicle
as<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.809> generally<00:00:49.230> makes<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.770> lighter

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
as it generally makes it lighter

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.950 
as it generally makes it lighter
stronger<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.850> sometimes<00:00:51.270> harder<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.780> hit

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
stronger and sometimes harder to hit

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.750 
stronger and sometimes harder to hit

a very quick overview of try forcing and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.950 
a very quick overview of try forcing and
some<00:00:55.890> easy<00:00:56.070> techniques<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.850> building<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.420> but

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
some easy techniques on building one but

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.630 
some easy techniques on building one but

way<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.430> do<00:01:05.670> try<00:01:05.880> forcing<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.540> simply<00:01:06.900> use

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
way to do try forcing is to simply use

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.990 
way to do try forcing is to simply use
the<00:01:07.200> prisms<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.740> tetras<00:01:08.280> they<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.820> same

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
the prisms and tetras they have the same

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.820 
the prisms and tetras they have the same
armor<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> regular<00:01:10.049> cube<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:10.650> they<00:01:10.710> are

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
armor as a regular cube but they are

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.620 
armor as a regular cube but they are
much<00:01:10.979> lighter<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.549> sleeker<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.240> gives<00:01:12.479> your

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
much lighter and sleeker it gives your

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.480 
much lighter and sleeker it gives your
vehicle<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.049> cooler<00:01:13.409> sharper<00:01:13.860> design<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.400> is

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
vehicle a cooler sharper design that is

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.429 
vehicle a cooler sharper design that is
much<00:01:14.700> lighter<00:01:14.970> than<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.720> viewer<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.170> use<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
much lighter than a viewer to use the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.050 
much lighter than a viewer to use the
cubes<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.250> best<00:01:17.490> part<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:17.909> you

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
cubes and the best part is that you

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.149 
cubes and the best part is that you
don't<00:01:18.299> have<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.509> sacrifice<00:01:18.780> defense<00:01:19.619> for<00:01:19.979> it

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
don't have to sacrifice defense for it

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.010 
don't have to sacrifice defense for it
sometimes<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.060> makes<00:01:21.180> part<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.570> your<00:01:21.689> vehicle

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
sometimes it makes part of your vehicle

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.570 
sometimes it makes part of your vehicle
harder<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.409> hit<00:01:22.590> because<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:23.070> how<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.250> Tri

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
harder to hit because of how the Tri

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.789
