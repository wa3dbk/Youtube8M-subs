00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
as much luck as I'd like with the

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.920 
as much luck as I'd like with the
buffing<00:03:00.550> compound<00:03:00.670> so<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.060> switch<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.570> red

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
buffing compound so I switch to the red

to the white polishing compound so

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.060 
to the white polishing compound so
hopefully<00:03:05.350> that<00:03:05.710> will<00:03:05.800> make<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:05.980> difference

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
hopefully that will make a difference

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
you know that it was just in from the

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.590 
you know that it was just in from the
parking<00:03:20.890> brake<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.610> know<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.940> left<00:03:22.120> side<00:03:22.420> is

parking brake you know the left side is
good<00:03:22.840> but<00:03:23.500> I'm<00:03:23.650> going<00:03:23.770> to<00:03:23.830> check<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.070> right

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
good but I'm going to check the right

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.210 
good but I'm going to check the right
side<00:03:24.459> now<00:03:24.610> so<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.480> clean<00:03:26.290> your<00:03:26.410> clean<00:03:27.130> the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
inside of the rear wheels off while I'm

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.240 
inside of the rear wheels off while I'm
at<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:30.239> upon<00:03:31.239> close<00:03:31.540> inspection<00:03:31.780> I<00:03:32.620> think<00:03:33.100> we

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
at it upon close inspection I think we

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.390 
at it upon close inspection I think we
see<00:03:33.580> that<00:03:33.850> there's<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.209> good<00:03:35.280> quarter<00:03:36.280> of

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
see that there's a good quarter of

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.699 
see that there's a good quarter of
three-eighths<00:03:36.790> of<00:03:36.940> an<00:03:37.090> inch<00:03:37.470> brake<00:03:38.470> pad

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
three-eighths of an inch brake pad

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.560 
three-eighths of an inch brake pad
material<00:03:39.220> so<00:03:39.550> there's<00:03:39.760> no<00:03:39.940> need<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.180> replace

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
material so there's no need to replace

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.160 
material so there's no need to replace
the<00:03:40.720> brake<00:03:40.900> pads<00:03:41.140> on<00:03:41.800> this<00:03:42.220> side<00:03:42.810> all<00:03:43.810> right<00:03:43.930> so

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
the brake pads on this side all right so

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.949 
the brake pads on this side all right so
it<00:03:44.980> looks<00:03:45.010> pretty<00:03:45.520> bad<00:03:45.820> right<00:03:46.090> now<00:03:46.300> because

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
it looks pretty bad right now because

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.720 
it looks pretty bad right now because
the<00:03:47.140> wheels<00:03:47.350> are<00:03:47.560> off<00:03:47.650> i'm<00:03:47.860> washing<00:03:48.130> them<00:03:48.459> they

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
the wheels are off i'm washing them they

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.020 
the wheels are off i'm washing them they
cumin<00:03:48.940> clean<00:03:49.270> but<00:03:50.110> later<00:03:50.590> on<00:03:50.680> they'll<00:03:51.580> all<00:03:51.790> be

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
cumin clean but later on they'll all be

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.699 
cumin clean but later on they'll all be
back<00:03:52.060> together<00:03:52.360> let's<00:03:52.959> see<00:03:53.080> how<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.320> hood

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
back together let's see how the hood

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.300 
back together let's see how the hood
looks<00:03:55.110> it's<00:03:56.110> really<00:03:56.440> hard<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.739> tell<00:03:56.980> over

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
looks it's really hard to tell over

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.610 
looks it's really hard to tell over
there<00:03:58.270> is<00:03:58.390> where<00:03:58.540> I<00:03:58.600> tried<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:58.989> polish<00:03:59.320> it<00:03:59.350> it's

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
there is where I tried to polish it it's

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.100 
there is where I tried to polish it it's
not<00:03:59.709> going<00:03:59.920> very<00:04:00.040> well<00:04:00.220> you'll<00:04:01.120> see<00:04:01.300> alright

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
not going very well you'll see alright

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.020 
not going very well you'll see alright
so<00:04:02.620> this<00:04:02.800> is<00:04:02.950> probably<00:04:03.160> wrong<00:04:03.550> for<00:04:03.820> me<00:04:03.880> to<00:04:03.910> say

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
so this is probably wrong for me to say

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.910 
so this is probably wrong for me to say
but<00:04:04.239> when<00:04:05.200> she's<00:04:05.440> wet<00:04:05.680> she<00:04:06.040> looks<00:04:06.250> pretty<00:04:06.459> good

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
but when she's wet she looks pretty good

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.580 
but when she's wet she looks pretty good
that<00:04:08.920> means<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:09.370> hood<00:04:09.670> is<00:04:10.019> still<00:04:11.019> oxidized

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
that means the hood is still oxidized

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.930 
that means the hood is still oxidized
but<00:04:12.570> he<00:04:13.570> reminds<00:04:14.380> me<00:04:14.620> when<00:04:15.190> it's<00:04:15.310> washed<00:04:15.550> like

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
but he reminds me when it's washed like

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.900 
but he reminds me when it's washed like
this<00:04:16.120> how<00:04:16.390> nice<00:04:16.870> it<00:04:17.109> looked<00:04:17.410> when<00:04:18.310> I

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
this how nice it looked when I

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.260 
this how nice it looked when I
had<00:04:19.420> a<00:04:19.450> good<00:04:19.630> coat<00:04:19.870> of<00:04:19.900> paint<00:04:20.080> on<00:04:20.200> it<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:21.280> taking

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
had a good coat of paint on it so taking

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.900 
had a good coat of paint on it so taking
the<00:04:22.330> wheels<00:04:22.510> off<00:04:22.690> wash<00:04:23.560> them<00:04:23.950> wash<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.550> inside

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
the wheels off wash them wash the inside

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.550 
the wheels off wash them wash the inside
behind<00:04:25.180> them<00:04:25.390> checked<00:04:25.690> for<00:04:26.550> brake<00:04:27.550> pads<00:04:27.790> and

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
behind them checked for brake pads and

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.660 
behind them checked for brake pads and
