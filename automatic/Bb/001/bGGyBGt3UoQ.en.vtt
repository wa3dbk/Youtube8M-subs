Walt knew the filmmaking process and

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.250 
Walt knew the filmmaking process and
that's<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:40.160> way<00:00:40.310> he<00:00:41.180> built<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:41.960> entire

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
that's the way he built the entire

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.190 
that's the way he built the entire
Empire<00:00:42.800> as<00:00:43.070> opposed<00:00:43.550> to<00:00:43.610> deals<00:00:43.910> and<00:00:44.180> and<00:00:44.900> and

Empire as opposed to deals and and and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.020 
Empire as opposed to deals and and and
salaries<00:00:46.040> and<00:00:46.220> stuff<00:00:46.430> like<00:00:46.550> that<00:00:46.730> he<00:00:46.850> dealt

with<00:00:47.180> that<00:00:47.270> later<00:00:47.510> on<00:00:47.720> and<00:00:47.870> I<00:00:47.930> think<00:00:48.170> that's

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
with that later on and I think that's

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.270 
with that later on and I think that's
why<00:00:48.880> everybody<00:00:49.880> felt<00:00:50.840> as<00:00:51.080> though<00:00:51.350> that<00:00:51.740> they

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
why everybody felt as though that they

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.600 
why everybody felt as though that they
were<00:00:52.550> valued

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.340 

you<00:00:58.330> know<00:00:58.420> they<00:00:58.510> didn't<00:00:58.720> like<00:00:58.840> each<00:00:59.020> other<00:00:59.230> I

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
you know they didn't like each other I

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.280 
you know they didn't like each other I
mean<00:00:59.620> right<00:01:00.190> up<00:01:00.340> to<00:01:01.090> the<00:01:01.240> end<00:01:01.420> they<00:01:01.810> did<00:01:02.110> not

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
mean right up to the end they did not

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.810 
mean right up to the end they did not
like<00:01:02.560> each<00:01:02.590> other<00:01:02.980> and<00:01:03.100> I<00:01:03.220> think<00:01:03.250> that<00:01:03.490> the

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
like each other and I think that the

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.730 
like each other and I think that the
screenplay<00:01:04.420> actually<00:01:04.780> does<00:01:04.900> a<00:01:04.930> good<00:01:05.140> job<00:01:05.199> of

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
screenplay actually does a good job of

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.180 
screenplay actually does a good job of
capturing<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.940> essence<00:01:07.270> of<00:01:07.420> that<00:01:07.630> without

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
capturing the essence of that without

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.710 
capturing the essence of that without
making<00:01:09.190> it<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:09.880> then<00:01:10.090> they<00:01:10.270> all<00:01:10.450> lived

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
making it and then they all lived

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.590 
making it and then they all lived
happily<00:01:10.840> ever<00:01:11.380> after<00:01:11.800> she<00:01:12.640> was<00:01:12.790> a<00:01:12.820> she<00:01:13.450> was<00:01:13.540> a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600
