00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
basically that's what a dagger for

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.310 
basically that's what a dagger for
clothes<00:01:26.210> I'm<00:01:27.210> hoping<00:01:27.480> I<00:01:27.600> still<00:01:27.810> might<00:01:27.990> benefit

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
clothes I'm hoping I still might benefit

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.160 
clothes I'm hoping I still might benefit
the<00:01:28.380> dagger<00:01:28.650> board<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.130> here<00:01:29.900> and<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:31.020> get

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the dagger board in here and we get

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.070 
the dagger board in here and we get
extra<00:01:31.350> moment<00:01:31.740> here<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:32.760> this<00:01:32.970> hull<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.810> stay

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
extra moment here but this hull you stay

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.290 
extra moment here but this hull you stay
in<00:01:34.200> there<00:01:34.350> because<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.580> way<00:01:35.760> any<00:01:35.910> water<00:01:36.180> I

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
in there because that way any water I

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.300 
in there because that way any water I
guess<00:01:36.480> in<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.900> see<00:01:37.170> I've<00:01:37.740> got<00:01:37.920> back<00:01:38.100> into

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
guess in on this see I've got back into

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.290 
guess in on this see I've got back into
the<00:01:38.460> war<00:01:38.580> and<00:01:38.900> you'll<00:01:39.900> always<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.230> with<00:01:40.890> a

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
the war and you'll always be with a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.430 
the war and you'll always be with a
wetsuit<00:01:42.300> on<00:01:42.480> when<00:01:42.750> you're<00:01:42.870> paddling<00:01:43.140> us

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
wetsuit on when you're paddling us

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.300 
wetsuit on when you're paddling us
anyway<00:01:45.200> right<00:01:46.200> now<00:01:46.380> I've<00:01:46.500> been<00:01:46.530> thinking

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
anyway right now I've been thinking

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.660 
anyway right now I've been thinking
about<00:01:48.110> -<00:01:49.110> fiberglass<00:01:49.800> though<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
about - fiberglass though the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.310 
about - fiberglass though the
daggerboard<00:01:51.000> hole<00:01:51.420> would<00:01:51.600> be<00:01:51.630> staying<00:01:51.990> there

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
daggerboard hole would be staying there

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.220 
daggerboard hole would be staying there
it'll<00:01:52.890> be<00:01:52.980> acting<00:01:53.070> as<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.400> drain<00:01:53.610> off<00:01:54.080> and<00:01:55.080> I'm

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
it'll be acting as a drain off and I'm

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.640 
it'll be acting as a drain off and I'm
thinking<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.650> putting<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.950> backrest<00:01:56.580> on

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
thinking of putting a backrest on

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.710 
thinking of putting a backrest on
so<00:01:58.280> you<00:01:58.610> don't<00:01:58.760> want<00:01:58.970> it<00:01:59.030> on<00:01:59.090> that<00:01:59.270> permanent

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
so you don't want it on that permanent

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.640 
so you don't want it on that permanent
because<00:01:59.900> you<00:01:59.960> want<00:02:00.080> me<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:00.200> drive<00:02:00.410> with<00:02:00.440> your

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
because you want me to drive with your

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.620 
because you want me to drive with your
car<00:02:00.830> look<00:02:01.790> at<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.090> back<00:02:02.240> end<00:02:02.480> of<00:02:02.540> the

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
car look at the back end of the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.980 
car look at the back end of the
daggerboard<00:02:03.190> fit<00:02:04.190> in<00:02:04.370> and<00:02:05.950> that<00:02:06.950> now<00:02:07.160> fits<00:02:08.090> in

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
daggerboard fit in and that now fits in

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.220 
daggerboard fit in and that now fits in
there<00:02:11.470> okay<00:02:12.790> I'm<00:02:13.790> gonna<00:02:13.940> make<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.150> board<00:02:14.480> fit

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
there okay I'm gonna make a board fit

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.410 
there okay I'm gonna make a board fit
end<00:02:15.410> it<00:02:15.530> go<00:02:15.650> on<00:02:15.770> there<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.160> when<00:02:16.400> when<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.240> want

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
end it go on there so when when you want

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
this order to be on that and you just

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.280 
this order to be on that and you just
take<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:20.680> put<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:21.740> on<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:23.420> slide<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:23.930> in<00:02:24.080> and
