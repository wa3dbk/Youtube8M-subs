over<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.769> design<00:00:25.920> it's<00:00:26.760> hard<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.119> explain<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
over the design it's hard to explain the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.839 
over the design it's hard to explain the
design<00:00:28.080> yeah<00:00:28.710> those<00:00:28.949> nice<00:00:29.279> sophisticated

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
design but at the same time it has a

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.150 
design but at the same time it has a
really<00:00:32.880> modern<00:00:33.239> look<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.620> tracks<00:00:34.980> air

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
there's one flaw I found in the design

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.770

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
magnet and once I see these smudges my

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.869 
magnet and once I see these smudges my
OCD<00:00:45.989> really<00:00:46.530> kicks<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.250> i<00:00:47.460> found<00:00:47.730> myself

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
OCD really kicks in and i found myself

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.330 
OCD really kicks in and i found myself
cleaning<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> lot<00:00:49.170> while<00:00:50.039> we're<00:00:50.160> talking

one ear cup to another while we're
talking<00:01:22.439> about<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.979> design<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.549> looks<00:01:23.820> let's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
talking about the design it looks let's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.719 
talking about the design it looks let's
look<00:01:24.479> at<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> build<00:01:25.080> quality<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:26.280> entire

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
look at the build quality the entire

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.120 
look at the build quality the entire
half<00:01:27.030> bowl<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.450> made<00:01:27.750> out<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.990> plastic<00:01:28.530> but

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
half bowl is made out of plastic but

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.770 
half bowl is made out of plastic but
doesn't<00:01:29.490> feel<00:01:29.610> cheap<00:01:29.640> like<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.270> plastic<00:01:30.509> you

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
doesn't feel cheap like the plastic you

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.630 
doesn't feel cheap like the plastic you
find<00:01:31.049> from<00:01:31.229> something<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.100> beat<00:01:32.310> solo

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
find from something like the beat solo

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.270 
find from something like the beat solo
it's<00:01:33.630> definitely<00:01:33.930> not<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.650> best<00:01:34.979> build

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
it's definitely not the best build

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.510 
it's definitely not the best build
quality<00:01:35.460> I've<00:01:35.790> ever<00:01:36.030> seen<00:01:36.299> but<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.079> not<00:01:37.170> bad

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
quality I've ever seen but it's not bad

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.730 
quality I've ever seen but it's not bad
but<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.670> head<00:01:38.850> back<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.630> most<00:01:39.900> flexible

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
but the head back is the most flexible

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.340 
but the head back is the most flexible
thing<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.369> ever<00:01:41.549> seen<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.990> really

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
thing I have ever seen and it really

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.940 
thing I have ever seen and it really
freaks<00:01:44.159> me<00:01:44.310> out<00:01:44.869> literally<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.110> reminds<00:01:46.770> me

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
freaks me out literally it reminds me

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.950 
freaks me out literally it reminds me
one<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.250> those<00:01:47.460> freakish<00:01:48.030> gymnasts<00:01:48.570> that

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
one of those freakish gymnasts that

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.880 
one of those freakish gymnasts that
could<00:01:49.170> bend<00:01:49.409> their<00:01:49.590> body<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.250> weird<00:01:50.490> way<00:01:50.610> ooh

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
could bend their body in a weird way ooh

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.429 
could bend their body in a weird way ooh
but<00:01:53.210> but<00:01:54.210> seriously<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.960> thing<00:01:55.020> is

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
but but seriously this thing is

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.060 
but but seriously this thing is
extremely<00:01:56.369> flexible<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:58.049> case<00:01:58.320> included<00:01:58.979> in

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
extremely flexible the case included in

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.840 
extremely flexible the case included in
the<00:01:59.189> box<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.670> also<00:02:00.180> extremely<00:02:00.659> flexible<00:02:01.850> just

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
the box is also extremely flexible just

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.810 
the box is also extremely flexible just
kidding<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.409> nice<00:02:04.649> case<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.670> a

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
kidding but it is a nice case it's a

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.910 
kidding but it is a nice case it's a
fairly<00:02:06.090> simple<00:02:06.420> looking<00:02:06.990> case<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.770> has<00:02:07.890> a

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
fairly simple looking case it has a

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.160

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
clarity department but I would say that

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.620 
clarity department but I would say that
my<00:04:47.230> music<00:04:47.680> came<00:04:47.889> out<00:04:48.040> pretty<00:04:48.250> clear<00:04:48.700> these
