00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
know that there is a new stance inside

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.830 
know that there is a new stance inside
of<00:00:21.640> the<00:00:21.730> game<00:00:21.939> called<00:00:22.210> the<00:00:22.330> four<00:00:22.570> riders

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
of the game called the four riders

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.109 
of the game called the four riders
stance<00:00:23.289> is<00:00:23.560> actually<00:00:24.220> two<00:00:24.339> variations<00:00:24.699> of

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
stance is actually two variations of

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.029 
stance is actually two variations of
that<00:00:25.179> stance<00:00:25.599> I<00:00:25.779> do<00:00:25.869> not<00:00:26.169> have<00:00:26.439> that<00:00:26.679> stance

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
that stance I do not have that stance

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.700 
that stance I do not have that stance
yet<00:00:27.310> one<00:00:27.609> variation<00:00:27.880> is<00:00:28.269> for<00:00:28.509> claws<00:00:28.779> and<00:00:29.109> one

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
yet one variation is for claws and one

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.890 
yet one variation is for claws and one
is<00:00:29.859> for<00:00:29.890> fists<00:00:30.550> but<00:00:31.210> I<00:00:31.390> don't<00:00:31.630> have<00:00:31.869> that

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
is for fists but I don't have that

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.720 
is for fists but I don't have that
stance<00:00:32.410> so<00:00:32.710> we're<00:00:33.040> basing<00:00:33.489> this<00:00:33.550> off

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
stance so we're basing this off

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.580 
stance so we're basing this off
malicious<00:00:34.239> Raptor<00:00:34.660> which<00:00:34.810> we<00:00:34.930> all<00:00:35.079> know<00:00:35.110> for

running 30 35 like I am on here near you
can<00:00:51.670> do<00:00:51.820> you're<00:00:52.449> gonna<00:00:52.570> require<00:00:53.019> a<00:00:53.460> warframe

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
can do you're gonna require a warframe

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.009 
can do you're gonna require a warframe
that<00:00:54.730> it's<00:00:54.820> going<00:00:54.940> to<00:00:55.030> be<00:00:55.120> suitable<00:00:55.359> to<00:00:55.629> fit

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
that it's going to be suitable to fit

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.470 
that it's going to be suitable to fit
melee<00:00:56.410> my<00:00:57.340> current<00:00:57.579> build<00:00:57.820> on<00:00:57.969> chroma<00:00:58.239> right

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
melee my current build on chroma right

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.479 
melee my current build on chroma right
now<00:00:58.600> is<00:00:58.780> just<00:00:58.809> not<00:00:59.140> that<00:00:59.379> suitable<00:01:00.039> for<00:01:00.280> melee

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
now is just not that suitable for melee

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:01.860 
now is just not that suitable for melee
but<00:01:00.640> I<00:01:00.670> can<00:01:00.910> manage<00:01:01.179> through<00:01:01.390> pretty<00:01:01.660> easily

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
but I can manage through pretty easily

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.079 
but I can manage through pretty easily
because<00:01:02.859> of<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.100> buffs<00:01:03.309> that<00:01:03.519> he<00:01:03.579> does<00:01:03.760> get<00:01:04.030> on

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
because of the buffs that he does get on

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.740 
because of the buffs that he does get on
his<00:01:04.420> abilities<00:01:05.160> but<00:01:06.160> here<00:01:06.490> or<00:01:06.700> there<00:01:07.090> we<00:01:07.510> going

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
an anchor eos and it requires the dual

giving that up I've got the primer and

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.390 
giving that up I've got the primer and
not<00:01:19.030> really<00:01:19.329> a<00:01:19.360> big<00:01:19.509> issue<00:01:19.659> to<00:01:19.990> make<00:01:20.400> dual

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
not really a big issue to make dual

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.969 
not really a big issue to make dual
cleavers<00:01:21.880> however<00:01:22.210> I<00:01:22.530> refuse<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.619> hear<00:01:23.770> my

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
cleavers however I refuse to hear my

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.920 
cleavers however I refuse to hear my
dual<00:01:24.130> cleaver<00:01:24.430> so<00:01:24.729> that<00:01:24.880> means<00:01:25.180> that<00:01:25.450> you'll

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
dual cleaver so that means that you'll

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.690 
dual cleaver so that means that you'll
purchase<00:01:26.290> another<00:01:26.710> set<00:01:26.979> of<00:01:27.070> dual<00:01:27.220> flavors

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
purchase another set of dual flavors

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.690 
purchase another set of dual flavors
build<00:01:28.299> it<00:01:28.479> and<00:01:28.630> then<00:01:29.290> make<00:01:29.590> this<00:01:29.799> weapon<00:01:30.220> a

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
build it and then make this weapon a

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.760 
build it and then make this weapon a
reason<00:01:31.479> I<00:01:31.540> refuse<00:01:31.930> is<00:01:32.140> because<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.560> dual

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
reason I refuse is because the dual

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.280 
reason I refuse is because the dual
cleavers<00:01:33.220> out<00:01:33.520> top<00:01:33.909> this<00:01:34.210> weapon<00:01:34.659> any<00:01:34.930> day<00:01:35.259> of

just<00:01:48.780> well<00:01:49.780> pummels<00:01:50.229> over<00:01:50.500> this<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.570> is<00:01:52.810> it

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
just well pummels over this so is it

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.990 
just well pummels over this so is it

much less resources and are going to be

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
edge pulse break and the reason I run

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.759 
edge pulse break and the reason I run
jagged<00:02:58.480> edge<00:02:58.569> a<00:02:58.690> buzz<00:02:58.900> kill<00:02:59.110> was<00:02:59.170> because<00:02:59.620> it

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
jagged edge a buzz kill was because it

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.259 
jagged edge a buzz kill was because it
is<00:02:59.890> a<00:02:59.920> slash<00:03:00.220> heavy<00:03:00.489> weapon<00:03:00.760> so<00:03:00.910> let's<00:03:01.120> just

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
is a slash heavy weapon so let's just

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.789 
is a slash heavy weapon so let's just
get<00:03:01.390> all<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.690> slash<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.170> we<00:03:02.260> can<00:03:02.470> in<00:03:02.620> there

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
get all the slash that we can in there

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.020 
get all the slash that we can in there
then<00:03:03.370> we're<00:03:03.459> gonna<00:03:03.549> go<00:03:03.670> ahead<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:03.850> have

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
then we're gonna go ahead and have

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.000 
then we're gonna go ahead and have
bruiser<00:03:04.390> curr<00:03:04.599> and<00:03:04.750> that's<00:03:05.380> because<00:03:05.560> this<00:03:05.860> is

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
bruiser curr and that's because this is

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.960 
bruiser curr and that's because this is
a<00:03:06.040> pretty<00:03:06.670> good<00:03:07.650> critical<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:09.340> we're<00:03:09.819> gonna
