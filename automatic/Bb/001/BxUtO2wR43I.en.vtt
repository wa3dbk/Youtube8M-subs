 I remember that these options are going to 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.229
 change according to the operating system in 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.590

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.450

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.040
 if it is a black color or grayscale 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.280
 here we will not edit anything we close 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.959
 and we click on print we will 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.560
 wait a moment for our 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.560
 Print 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.410
 and what we see next is 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.970
 cut out with the help of scissors 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.880
 our design we are going to start 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.600
 cut out like this 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.600
 with many cares 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.550
 here 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.290
 I remind you that you can 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.360
 place the text of your preference to 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.120
 the desired images can 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.860
 modify as you like we are going to 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.540
 cut well around here in these areas 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.540
 very carefully 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.490
 This way too 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.870
 here 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.870
 over here 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.700
 to finish we will cut here 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.879
 there we have it 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.180
 let's remove all this papers that we 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.180
 there are too many 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.400
 let's remove these envelopes and camps and 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.220
 what we want next is to double the 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.820
 tabs inward starting with 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.820
 this part 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.439
 so very carefully we are going to bend it 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.439
 in the same way over here 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.590
 from another side 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.840
 and finally up here 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.830
 now let's paste the lashes we take 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.400
 the glue stick and what we will do to 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.509
 next is this 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.509
 we double here 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.310
 and we add some glue in 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.310
 this zone 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:39.760
 a little more so that it sticks correctly 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:42.310
 and we doubled this corner or tab and we 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.800
 is going to look like this like this 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.449
 side let's put a little bit of 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.840
 glue 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:52.569
 we fold the tab and we must stay 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.180
 so we verify that it is correctly 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:58.870
 stuck there we have it and we can 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:02.199
 put a little letter we all talk and there 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.969
 we have our envelope for letter 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.439
 it's that easy to create these envelopes 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:07.059
 personalized remind that the 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:08.979
 You can download it from the template
