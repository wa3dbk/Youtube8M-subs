00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.940
 the people here at home will not be super 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.009
 healthy and so I want to teach 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.590
 you crepe with stuffing of 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.119

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.560
 alexa who understands everything about panela 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.119
 nonstick I'm going to do this recent 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.949
 using the pin line that I am 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.449
 using at home here I'm loving we 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:30.269
 there for mass you will need a 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.149
 cup of milk tea 8 tablespoons 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.940
 oatmeal 3 tablespoons 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.809
 wheat flour soup 1 tablespoon 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.600
 olive oil 1 clove garlic salt and 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.309
 pepper to taste and to start 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.719
 this recipe preparing the batter hit 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.190
 everything in the blender but if you 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.260
 wish you can hit the hand that does not 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.960
 It's a problem, so add the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.640
 olive oil the milk 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.770
 if you want you can use origin 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.250
 vegetable, no problem 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.350
 the egg I like to season pasta if you 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.039
 You'll make a sweet crepe and you'll skip that one. 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.979
 part 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.729
 so I 'll add a garlic put 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.610
 a little pepper and a little bit of 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.979
 salt 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.750
 I will now add that the wheat flour 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.250
 and oatmeal if you can not find 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.900
 oatmeal you can buy 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.430
 that old flock and beating the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.009
 indicator a processor until it is well 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.720
 but it's always easy to 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.460
 find on the market and now it 's just people 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.119
 You will have it all very well until one 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.119
 very homogeneous mass 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.520
 with the pasta ready now we're going 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.200
 warm the skillet and how to 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.730
 pottery is not great. 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.620
 I need no fat is to have what 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.720
 makes the recipe much healthier 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.330
 so now I'm going to put a shell here 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.240
 and we're going to give a tour of 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.130
 to spread through the shape and leave 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.660
 its fried dough is not 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.760
 touching the drop time of the background 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.530
 means that the time to turn our good 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.120
 already a patriot and as a group 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.830
 called in that pot I'll do the 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.670
 stuffing I was using to fry 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.020
 the pancakes 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.820
 The only thing I'm going to do is to spend a 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.000
 little paper to take a little dirt 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.649
 I will start the filling and 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.270
 if that palm heart farm but you 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.899
 can leave your car than you 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.490
 want to 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.620
 so I'm going to put a little bit of 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:22.300
 olive oil garlic a little bit of 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.800
 scallion tomato seeded to 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.270
 Repeat until all is well 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.210
 cushion now may be the palm heart I 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.620
 I bought it from those bats. 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.120
 I stayed home but if you want you can 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.290
 buy that little house that does not have 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.320
 problem 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.820
 Just give a little dino and they 'll add 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.890
 here olive 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.650
 I'm going to give a temperada dinha with a 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.180
 bit of sweet 4k besides giving flavor 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.320
 will give a kitchen also well 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:54.150
 interesting 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:56.620
 pepper and can not miss salt 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.330
 Now I will add a little water 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.220
 It is to help and if from here to cook and 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:06.910
 make everything alright but that's just mixing 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:10.830
 all is just cover with the lid and not even the 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.660
 cook for at least 15 minutes 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.519
 now just take off the lid and I'll go 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.700
 add ricotta cream of curiosity 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:21.519
 but you can add curd 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.440
 chains do you prefer to turn it off 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.660
 that the fire that no longer needs to leave 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.240
 connected while also adding a little bit 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:32.370
 of salt is now mixed well 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.570
 closed is ready and is now only
