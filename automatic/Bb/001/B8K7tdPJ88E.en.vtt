00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.420
 Hi guys, all right, before you start 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.429
 Today's video a background for you 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.740
 than you will see in a moment that 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.870
 It was not to be the video was not for today 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.369
 have a video but I decided to put this 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.830
 from here just for your happiness 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.859
 and to my shame also that is the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.510
 next I was playing daisy with a 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.760
 monarchist in none without any 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.349
 worry about doing nothing right when the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.470
 monarch came the idea because people 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.640
 does not play as if we had 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.190
 interpreting the characters someone who 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.390
 had actually been lost on a crowded island 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.090
 from zombie 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.629
 So we tried to do that and it was 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.980
 our attempt did not work very well and 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.980
 now you'll see why we're not going 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.690
 invent a background story we 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:58.320
 are the two agents of the company and agent was 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.250
 sent a mission to wait for the government 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.820
 Russian 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:07.260
 only that our plane crashed because of a 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.260
 hysterical attack of one of a guy she 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.790
 inside the plane and we were the only one 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:19.070
 survivor and I want to tag people 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:24.659
 swam to the box society beauty i 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:26.670

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.020
 You did not have a size. 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.500
 You have to be rolling stories here. 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.610

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.340
 The new recruit then you me

 they messed up this character you do 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.040
 okay and then we're discussing here 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.040
 Let's start here 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.200

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:58.689

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.689

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:17.890

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:46.239
 this is serious and other hysterical 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.239
 global wealth of this water and this is 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:05.709
 so easy to let die 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:29.930
 The crying in a playground position case 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:32.239

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.950
 hunger and thirst that so many people in the morning 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.959
 You almost died because you do not need to 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:24.009

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:26.460
