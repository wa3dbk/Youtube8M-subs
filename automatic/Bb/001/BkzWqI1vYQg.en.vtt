gone for that already one of the
important<00:01:12.950> things<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:13.250> understand<00:01:13.670> about

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
important things to understand about

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.300 
important things to understand about
this<00:01:14.060> resource<00:01:14.450> is<00:01:14.810> then<00:01:15.710> it<00:01:15.830> has<00:01:15.979> a<00:01:16.009> lot<00:01:16.280> of

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
this resource is then it has a lot of

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.670 
this resource is then it has a lot of
termite<00:01:16.820> damage<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.479> the<00:01:18.140> fact<00:01:18.380> that<00:01:18.500> it<00:01:18.590> has

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
termite damage and the fact that it has

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.130 
termite damage and the fact that it has
termite<00:01:19.130> damage<00:01:19.270> makes<00:01:20.270> it<00:01:20.420> very<00:01:20.540> useful<00:01:20.780> in

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
termite damage makes it very useful in

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.380 
termite damage makes it very useful in
other<00:01:21.619> ways<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.430> let's<00:01:22.640> harvest<00:01:22.820> a<00:01:23.060> piece<00:01:23.090> of

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
other ways so let's harvest a piece of

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.330 
other ways so let's harvest a piece of
this<00:01:23.450> termite<00:01:23.840> damaged<00:01:24.259> wood<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:24.740> then<00:01:25.220> we'll

that's exactly what we want
now<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.429> piece<00:02:04.700> like<00:02:04.939> this<00:02:04.999> is<00:02:05.539> going<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.899> have

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
now a piece like this is going to have

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.559 
now a piece like this is going to have
to<00:02:06.229> have<00:02:06.639> direct<00:02:07.639> flame<00:02:08.170> for<00:02:09.170> ignition<00:02:10.569> but

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
to have direct flame for ignition but

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.120 
to have direct flame for ignition but
once<00:02:11.780> we<00:02:11.930> get<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:12.290> lit<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:12.740> it<00:02:12.830> won't<00:02:12.950> take

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
once we get it lit and it won't take

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.590 
once we get it lit and it won't take
long<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.580> do<00:02:13.730> that

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:31.910 

a<00:02:21.110> little<00:02:22.110> bit<00:02:22.230> more

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.990 

there<00:02:32.520> we<00:02:32.610> go<00:02:32.790> now<00:02:33.780> we're<00:02:33.900> getting<00:02:34.110> somewhere

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
there we go now we're getting somewhere

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.809 
there we go now we're getting somewhere
now<00:02:36.000> we<00:02:36.060> can<00:02:36.330> let<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.630> sit<00:02:36.840> there<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.110> burn

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
now we can let that sit there and burn

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.130 
now we can let that sit there and burn
and<00:02:38.819> before<00:02:39.180> long<00:02:39.390> when<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.750> gets<00:02:39.900> up<00:02:40.050> into

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
and before long when it gets up into

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.780 
and before long when it gets up into
those<00:02:40.380> cavities<00:02:40.709> it's<00:02:41.160> going<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.459> start<00:02:41.700> to

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
those cavities it's going to start to

00:02:41.790 --> 00:03:04.770 
those cavities it's going to start to
smolder<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:43.500> will<00:02:43.620> become<00:02:43.920> an<00:02:44.040> ember

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.210 

you<00:03:05.780> can<00:03:05.960> see<00:03:06.140> really<00:03:06.320> what<00:03:06.530> this<00:03:06.710> is<00:03:06.860> doing<00:03:07.040> is

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
you can see really what this is doing is

00:03:07.220 --> 00:04:38.049 
you can see really what this is doing is
turning<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:07.940> larger<00:03:08.420> and<00:03:08.600> larger<00:03:09.170> Ember
