percentage of the light that's hitting
the<00:01:37.690> subject<00:01:38.230> is<00:01:38.410> from<00:01:39.010> an<00:01:39.790> electronic<00:01:40.420> flash

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
the subject is from an electronic flash

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.840 
the subject is from an electronic flash
and<00:01:41.020> what<00:01:41.500> percentage<00:01:42.100> of<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.430> light<00:01:42.610> hitting

and what percentage of the light hitting

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.300 
and what percentage of the light hitting
the<00:01:42.940> subject<00:01:43.450> is<00:01:43.600> from<00:01:43.780> ambient<00:01:44.260> sources<00:01:44.920> and

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
the subject is from ambient sources and

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.350 
the subject is from ambient sources and
it<00:01:45.880> gives<00:01:46.300> this<00:01:46.540> in<00:01:46.840> ten<00:01:47.680> percent<00:01:48.360> segments

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
it gives this in ten percent segments

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.510 
it gives this in ten percent segments
which<00:01:49.540> means<00:01:49.810> you<00:01:50.020> can<00:01:50.200> really<00:01:50.440> fine-tune<00:01:50.950> it

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
which means you can really fine-tune it

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.700 
which means you can really fine-tune it
when<00:01:52.000> you're<00:01:52.150> trying<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.600> balance<00:01:52.720> ambient

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
light and flash actually it is quicker

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.800 
light and flash actually it is quicker
than<00:01:58.230> making<00:01:59.230> the<00:01:59.530> decisions<00:02:00.160> with<00:02:00.910> a<00:02:01.210> TTL

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
than making the decisions with a TTL

take that into an account and what I

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.500 
take that into an account and what I

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
find is is that instead of spending time

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.210 
find is is that instead of spending time

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
how they appear in my camera I'm

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.890 
how they appear in my camera I'm

and what's really important to me about
incident<00:04:26.340> light<00:04:26.720> metering<00:04:27.720> techniques<00:04:28.590> is

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
incident light metering techniques is

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.400 
incident light metering techniques is
that<00:04:29.520> it<00:04:29.640> gives<00:04:29.910> me<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:30.210> consistent<00:04:30.960> reading

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
that it gives me a consistent reading

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.980 
that it gives me a consistent reading
and<00:04:31.620> it<00:04:31.800> takes<00:04:32.520> out<00:04:32.790> of<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:33.240> equation<00:04:33.900> it

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
and it takes out of the equation it

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.950 
and it takes out of the equation it
eliminates<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.860> variable<00:04:35.520> of<00:04:35.700> what<00:04:36.270> color<00:04:36.630> my

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
eliminates the variable of what color my

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.500 
eliminates the variable of what color my
subject<00:04:37.530> is<00:04:37.680> because<00:04:38.610> an<00:04:38.760> incident<00:04:39.300> light

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
subject is because an incident light

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.250 
subject is because an incident light
meter<00:04:39.860> gets<00:04:40.860> to<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.310> light<00:04:42.020> before<00:04:43.020> it

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
meter gets to the light before it

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.470 
meter gets to the light before it
actually<00:04:43.440> hits<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:44.190> subject<00:04:44.790> and<00:04:44.940> then<00:04:45.180> gets

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
actually hits the subject and then gets

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.990 
actually hits the subject and then gets
reflected<00:04:45.810> back<00:04:46.320> to<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:46.650> camera

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
reflected back to the camera

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.660 
reflected back to the camera
all<00:04:48.390> metering<00:04:49.260> technique<00:04:49.770> is<00:04:49.980> based<00:04:50.250> on<00:04:50.520> the

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
all metering technique is based on the

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.540 
all metering technique is based on the
concept<00:04:51.240> that<00:04:51.920> that<00:04:52.920> whatever<00:04:53.310> you're

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
concept that that whatever you're

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.000 
concept that that whatever you're
pointing<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.180> meter<00:04:54.510> ad<00:04:54.750> is<00:04:55.080> a<00:04:55.110> middle<00:04:55.620> gray

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
pointing the meter ad is a middle gray

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.400 
pointing the meter ad is a middle gray
that's<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:57.090> way<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.330> meters<00:04:57.600> are<00:04:57.750> calibrated

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
that's the way the meters are calibrated

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.320 
that's the way the meters are calibrated
to<00:04:58.530> give<00:04:58.710> you<00:04:58.830> in<00:04:58.980> a<00:04:59.070> correct<00:04:59.550> exposure<00:04:59.940> it's

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
to give you in a correct exposure it's

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:07.460 
to give you in a correct exposure it's
often<00:05:00.630> called<00:05:00.870> an<00:05:01.020> 18%<00:05:01.710> gray<00:05:06.020> if<00:05:07.020> you<00:05:07.110> have<00:05:07.380> a

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
often called an 18% gray if you have a

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.500 
often called an 18% gray if you have a
subject<00:05:07.710> who<00:05:08.160> is<00:05:08.310> wearing<00:05:08.550> a<00:05:08.730> red<00:05:08.970> dress<00:05:09.000> or<00:05:09.450> a

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
subject who is wearing a red dress or a

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.860 
subject who is wearing a red dress or a
yellow<00:05:10.110> dress<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:11.310> problem<00:05:11.730> is<00:05:11.910> is<00:05:12.120> that<00:05:12.150> you

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
yellow dress the problem is is that you

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.020 
yellow dress the problem is is that you
have<00:05:13.080> to<00:05:13.290> make<00:05:13.530> a<00:05:13.560> decision<00:05:14.010> with<00:05:14.340> a<00:05:14.370> reflected

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
have to make a decision with a reflected

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.620 
have to make a decision with a reflected
light<00:05:15.240> meter<00:05:15.540> or<00:05:15.960> a<00:05:16.410> TTL<00:05:17.070> meter<00:05:17.400> in<00:05:17.640> a<00:05:17.760> digital

eliminate<00:05:26.280> the<00:05:26.700> variable<00:05:27.419> of<00:05:27.630> what<00:05:28.290> color<00:05:28.650> is

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
eliminate the variable of what color is

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.490 
eliminate the variable of what color is
