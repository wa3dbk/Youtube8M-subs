expectations<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.950> them<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.189> really<00:01:32.220> didn't

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
expectations of them I really didn't

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.850 
expectations of them I really didn't
think<00:01:32.700> these<00:01:33.000> two<00:01:33.210> bronze<00:01:33.540> MLS<00:01:33.900> players<00:01:34.170> we're

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
think these two bronze MLS players we're

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.140 
think these two bronze MLS players we're
gonna<00:01:34.950> do<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.310> job<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.610> back<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.000> thought

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
gonna do the job of the back I thought

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.510 
gonna do the job of the back I thought
we<00:01:36.270> believe<00:01:36.479> some<00:01:37.200> gaping<00:01:37.470> holes<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.340> my

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
we believe some gaping holes in my

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.550 
we believe some gaping holes in my
defense<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.150> they<00:01:39.689> didn't<00:01:39.900> let<00:01:40.079> him<00:01:40.200> at<00:01:40.380> all

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
defense but they didn't let him at all

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.340 
defense but they didn't let him at all
and<00:01:40.799> they<00:01:40.890> really<00:01:41.369> did<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.670> job

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
and they really did the job

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.590 
and they really did the job
fantastically<00:01:43.350> jean-baptiste<00:01:43.799> he's<00:01:44.700> got<00:01:44.939> 91

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
fantastically jean-baptiste he's got 91

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.760 
fantastically jean-baptiste he's got 91
strength<00:01:46.530> which<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:48.210> dumb<00:01:48.570> for<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> bronze

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
strength which is so dumb for a bronze

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.980 
strength which is so dumb for a bronze
come<00:01:50.100> let's<00:01:50.340> go<00:01:50.399> Johnson<00:01:50.939> he<00:01:51.420> was<00:01:51.630> genuinely

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
come let's go Johnson he was genuinely

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.899 
come let's go Johnson he was genuinely
really<00:01:52.439> impressive<00:01:52.979> he<00:01:53.130> did<00:01:53.340> his<00:01:53.460> job<00:01:53.490> nicely

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
really impressive he did his job nicely

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.620 
really impressive he did his job nicely
there<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.899> floor<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.710> team<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.280> paper<00:01:56.630> and

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
there is a floor this team on paper and

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.620 
there is a floor this team on paper and
that<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.710> doesn't<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.729> great

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
that is that it doesn't have a great

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.730 
that is that it doesn't have a great
deal<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.930> height<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.590> really<00:02:01.829> doesn't<00:02:02.479> but

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
deal of height it really doesn't but

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.950 
deal of height it really doesn't but
saying<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.399> didn't<00:02:06.180> actually<00:02:06.329> encounter

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
saying that I didn't actually encounter

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.839 
saying that I didn't actually encounter
that<00:02:07.049> problem<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.069> strange<00:02:08.489> because

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
that problem and that is strange because

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.540 
that problem and that is strange because
I'm<00:02:09.569> usually<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.110> first<00:02:10.440> one<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.770> notice<00:02:11.069> a

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
I'm usually the first one to notice a

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.610 
I'm usually the first one to notice a
lack<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.060> height<00:02:12.420> in<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.660> team<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.050> really

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
lack of height in a team and I really

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.520 
lack of height in a team and I really
to<00:02:13.830> play<00:02:14.010> with<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> team<00:02:14.489> that<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.629> wouldn't

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
to play with a team that is I wouldn't

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.869 
to play with a team that is I wouldn't
say<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.799> sure<00:02:17.010> because<00:02:17.310> it's<00:02:17.400> not<00:02:17.519> it's<00:02:17.670> not<00:02:17.790> at

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
say it sure because it's not it's not at

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.610 
say it sure because it's not it's not at
all<00:02:18.000> but<00:02:18.269> there<00:02:18.629> are<00:02:18.810> some<00:02:18.989> players<00:02:19.260> in

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
all but there are some players in

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.770 
all but there are some players in
positions<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.220> i<00:02:20.340> would<00:02:20.610> prefer<00:02:20.909> to<00:02:21.120> usually

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
positions that i would prefer to usually

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.420 
positions that i would prefer to usually
have<00:02:22.290> some<00:02:22.560> taller<00:02:22.830> players<00:02:23.129> because<00:02:23.340> we've

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
have some taller players because we've

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.430 
have some taller players because we've
got<00:02:23.519> Matt<00:02:23.640> we've<00:02:23.970> got<00:02:24.000> will<00:02:24.330> Johnson<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:24.959> both

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
got Matt we've got will Johnson and both

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.920 
got Matt we've got will Johnson and both
those<00:02:25.769> aren't<00:02:26.220> crazy<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.940> like<00:02:27.180> over<00:02:27.510> six-foot

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
those aren't crazy to like over six-foot

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.229 
those aren't crazy to like over six-foot
sorts<00:02:28.230> thing<00:02:28.440> but<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.340> didn't<00:02:29.580> become<00:02:30.030> a

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
sorts thing but it didn't become a

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.030 
sorts thing but it didn't become a
problem<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:31.200> think<00:02:31.319> this<00:02:31.739> is<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:31.920> first

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
problem and I think this is the first

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.699 
problem and I think this is the first
time<00:02:32.640> where<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.420> kind<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:33.750> team<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:33.989> has<00:02:34.349> some

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
time where a kind of team that has some

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.530 
time where a kind of team that has some
players<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.220> are<00:02:35.280> shorter<00:02:35.430> than<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:36.150> usuals

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
players that are shorter than the usuals

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.630 
players that are shorter than the usuals
I<00:02:36.750> throw<00:02:37.019> in<00:02:37.140> there<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.159> didn't<00:02:38.459> make<00:02:38.610> a

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
I throw in there and it didn't make a

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.479 
I throw in there and it didn't make a
difference<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:39.329> was<00:02:39.480> really<00:02:40.110> really<00:02:40.890> good<00:02:41.310> and

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
difference it was really really good and

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.509 
difference it was really really good and
the<00:02:41.640> play<00:02:42.180> felt<00:02:42.599> so<00:02:42.840> quick<00:02:43.260> because<00:02:43.500> there<00:02:44.430> was

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
the play felt so quick because there was

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.250 
the play felt so quick because there was
a<00:02:44.549> lot<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.760> nippy<00:02:45.209> players<00:02:45.510> players<00:02:45.989> that

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
a lot of nippy players players that

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.020 
a lot of nippy players players that
could<00:02:46.379> do<00:02:46.560> step<00:02:46.859> overs<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.430> get<00:02:47.579> into<00:02:47.730> awesome

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
could do step overs and get into awesome

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.210 
could do step overs and get into awesome
positions<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.660> play<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.470> ball<00:02:49.500> about<00:02:49.950> him

positions and play the ball about him

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.400 
positions and play the ball about him
more<00:02:50.459> instead<00:02:51.209> of<00:02:51.239> being<00:02:51.510> these<00:02:51.750> absolute

defend their asses off but it was

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.869 
defend their asses off but it was
genuinely<00:02:57.150> really<00:02:57.540> impressive<00:02:58.409> and<00:02:58.590> I'm<00:02:59.310> not

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
genuinely really impressive and I'm not

genuinely really impressive and I'm not
one<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.120> really<00:03:00.540> like<00:03:00.900> players<00:03:01.379> or<00:03:01.769> teams<00:03:02.480> that

can't win aerial battles but for some

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.300 
can't win aerial battles but for some

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.789 
reason I don't know if I just got lucky
I<00:03:08.700> didn't<00:03:09.209> really<00:03:09.359> get<00:03:09.629> into<00:03:09.930> many<00:03:10.200> aerial

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799
