00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.540
 5 natural sugar substitutes all 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.420
 we know refined sugar as the 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.300
 main enemy of the health causing 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.520
 from cÃ¡diz to obesity however 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.010
 that does not need at least one 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.590
 teaspoon for coffee or bs tea 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.950
 when the fruit is not usually enough 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.350
 many times more is required 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.710
 to give a sweet touch to the papillae 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.129
 tasting the sugar substitutes are 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.680
 have created as more nutritious options 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:49.520
 however the one with fewer calories 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.840
 it does not mean they are healthier 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.450
 fortunately with the advances in 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.120
 science have been devised better options 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:01.230
 of very effective natural sweeteners 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.989
 like the following coconut sugar 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.500
 if there is coconut oil and coconut water 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.750
 because there is also a sugar this is 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.630
 gets from heating the palm of 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.600
 coconut until evaporate the water and get the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.930
 extract in the form of grains is rich in 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.530
 minerals like iron zinc potassium and 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.140
 calcium as well as antioxidants its 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.200
 flavor is similar to brown sugar 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.200
 but even richer it is recommended to use it 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.940
 to cook as it does not alter the texture 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.670
 of the saucers 2 sugar water nectar 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.630
 of tequila because there is no plant 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.750
 Cactacea not only produces alcohol 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.960
 contains 90% football and only 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.979
 contributes 20 calories per teaspoon is 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.130
 25% sweeter than ordinary sugar is 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.070
 You can use 3-way honey as 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.190
 translated it would be sugar made healthy 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.539
 its flavor is exactly that of sugar and 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.479
 It is also 100% natural as is possible 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.090
 thanks to the mixture of several sugars 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.530
 fructose that is found in fruits 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.500
 Sucrose found plants 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.690
 such as the cane and lactose that 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.120
 find the sugar in milk 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.110
 Healthy absorbs carbohydrates 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.730
 salts like sucrose and starch 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.920
 also provides 4 calories two 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.390
 scoops comes in presentation 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.640
 grainy brown sugar or sea sugar 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.250
 45 also known as the alcohol of 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.610
 sugar is a natural sweetener present 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.200
 in berries and in corn tastes so sweet 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.629
 like sugar while it's 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.870
 partially absorbed in the body 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:51.989
 They provide 9 calories with teaspoon and 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.450
 It has a low glycemic index 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.670
 outside, it fights against the bacteria that 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.010
 generates the plaque on the teeth so 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.160
 which is used for chewing gums 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.640
 without sugar the bad thing is that it can cause 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.040
 Stomach upset and diarrhea if 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.709
 consume too much 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.129
 because alcohol is not digested 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:16.159
 easy the xylitol is in products without 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:19.340
 sugar for people with diabetes 5 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:21.920
 stevia extract this 100% sugar 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.799
 natural with zero calories comes from 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.470
 a plant called rebiana itself that 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.680
 is in the center and South America is 40 times 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.409
 sweeter than ordinary sugar and does not have 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.590
 nothing of caloric content as well as a 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:39.200
 very low glycemic index at the beginning 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.629
 it was not consumed much because it usually 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.329
 have a slight bitter taste but 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:47.139
 fortunately companies like trivia and 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:50.659
 sweet left managed to solve the problem 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:52.549
 isolating the sweet part of the plant 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:55.150
