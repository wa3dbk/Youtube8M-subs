going to make a difference to your team
score<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.479> basically<00:01:58.170> when<00:01:58.799> you're<00:01:58.920> playing

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
score but basically when you're playing

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.450 
score but basically when you're playing
game<00:01:59.250> battles<00:01:59.610> it's<00:01:59.880> all<00:02:00.119> about<00:02:00.149> winning<00:02:00.570> and

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
game battles it's all about winning and

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.280 
game battles it's all about winning and
so<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.700> doesn't<00:02:03.240> matter<00:02:03.299> i<00:02:03.479> mean<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.049> could<00:02:04.170> be

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
so it doesn't matter i mean you could be

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.990 
so it doesn't matter i mean you could be
going<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:04.649> 5<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.159> 25<00:02:05.399> but<00:02:05.790> if<00:02:05.820> you're

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
going like 5 and 25 but if you're

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.459 
going like 5 and 25 but if you're
writing<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.420> flag<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.810> capture<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.290> flag

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
writing the flag and capture the flag

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.400 
writing the flag and capture the flag
then<00:02:08.509> you're<00:02:09.509> still<00:02:09.720> doing<00:02:09.840> great<00:02:10.110> for<00:02:10.289> your

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
then you're still doing great for your

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.960 
then you're still doing great for your
team<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.920> could<00:02:11.069> still<00:02:11.280> be<00:02:11.430> easily<00:02:11.730> winning

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
team you could still be easily winning

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.690 
team you could still be easily winning
with<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.180> score<00:02:12.420> like

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
with a score like

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.170 
with a score like
and<00:02:13.470> what<00:02:14.470> we<00:02:14.590> do<00:02:14.709> here<00:02:15.069> is<00:02:15.220> we<00:02:15.250> see<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.090> they

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
and what we do here is we see that they

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.199 
and what we do here is we see that they
planted<00:02:16.569> a<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:18.280> be<00:02:18.370> honest<00:02:18.730> it's<00:02:18.879> easier

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
planted a and to be honest it's easier

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.089 
planted a and to be honest it's easier
just<00:02:19.239> defend<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:20.050> defend<00:02:20.349> one<00:02:20.560> point<00:02:20.830> so<00:02:20.980> we

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
just defend to defend one point so we

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.839 
just defend to defend one point so we
just<00:02:21.250> kind<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.489> let<00:02:21.640> them<00:02:21.790> have<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.330> there<00:02:22.599> and

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
just kind of let them have a there and

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.009 
just kind of let them have a there and
we<00:02:24.849> plan<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.209> defend<00:02:25.420> for<00:02:25.629> the<00:02:25.720> rest<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.930> the

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
we plan to defend for the rest of the

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.589 
we plan to defend for the rest of the

game at her for the rest of the rounded
be<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.310> I'll<00:02:30.310> admit<00:02:30.700> this<00:02:30.880> team<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:31.300> not<00:02:31.450> the

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
be and I'll admit this team is not the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.110 
be and I'll admit this team is not the
best<00:02:31.930> team<00:02:32.290> like<00:02:33.040> they're<00:02:33.280> not<00:02:33.459> unbelievable

best team like they're not unbelievable

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.490 
best team like they're not unbelievable

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
and as you can see Wes either gets a

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.160 
and as you can see Wes either gets a
triple<00:02:35.830> spray<00:02:36.330> he<00:02:37.330> was<00:02:37.450> really<00:02:37.599> stoked<00:02:37.959> on

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
triple spray he was really stoked on

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.680 
triple spray he was really stoked on

communication and strategic play that's
going<00:02:51.190> on<00:02:51.400> is<00:02:51.579> is<00:02:51.849> just<00:02:52.660> completely<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:53.640> lot

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
going on is is just completely a lot

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.160 
going on is is just completely a lot
more<00:02:54.849> than<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.209> would<00:02:55.360> be<00:02:55.390> in<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:55.690> public<00:02:56.019> match

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
more than it would be in a public match

more than it would be in a public match
like<00:02:56.920> you're<00:02:57.430> caught<00:02:57.640> you're<00:02:57.790> making

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
like you're caught you're making

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.580 
like you're caught you're making
call-outs<00:02:58.569> like<00:02:58.840> telling<00:02:59.110> your<00:02:59.200> friends

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
where people are and planning out like

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.089 
where people are and planning out like
organized<00:03:03.940> pushes<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.630> move<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:05.739> take<00:03:05.950> control

organized pushes to move to take control

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.539

part<00:03:06.610> of<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.760> map<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.150> stuff<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:08.250> yeah<00:03:09.250> and

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
part of the map and stuff and yeah and

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.750 
part of the map and stuff and yeah and
you'll<00:03:10.000> notice<00:03:10.569> that<00:03:10.599> most<00:03:11.290> of<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.650> time<00:03:11.890> in

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
you'll notice that most of the time in

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.280 
you'll notice that most of the time in
gamebattles<00:03:13.209> it's<00:03:13.599> pointless<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.049> use<00:03:14.260> a

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
gamebattles it's pointless to use a

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.600 
gamebattles it's pointless to use a
silencer<00:03:14.560> unless<00:03:15.069> you're<00:03:15.220> playing<00:03:15.310> against

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
silencer unless you're playing against

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.050 
silencer unless you're playing against
really<00:03:15.940> bad<00:03:16.120> people<00:03:16.510> because<00:03:17.230> um<00:03:17.910> most<00:03:18.910> of<00:03:18.970> the

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
really bad people because um most of the

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.759 
really bad people because um most of the
time<00:03:19.209> as<00:03:19.480> soon<00:03:20.049> as<00:03:20.079> you<00:03:20.260> shoot<00:03:20.470> you're<00:03:20.650> going

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
time as soon as you shoot you're going

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.590 
time as soon as you shoot you're going
to<00:03:20.829> get<00:03:20.920> called<00:03:21.220> out<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:22.180> other<00:03:22.299> team<00:03:22.450> is

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
to get called out and the other team is

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.000 
to get called out and the other team is
going<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.780> tell<00:03:23.079> all<00:03:23.290> their<00:03:23.500> friends<00:03:23.530> where

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
going to tell all their friends where

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.289 
going to tell all their friends where
you<00:03:24.130> are<00:03:24.280> so<00:03:24.549> it<00:03:24.670> doesn't<00:03:24.910> really<00:03:25.000> make<00:03:25.239> a

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
you are so it doesn't really make a

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:26.520 
you are so it doesn't really make a
difference<00:03:25.510> if<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:25.780> have<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:25.930> silencer<00:03:26.380> so

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
difference if you have a silencer so

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.280 
difference if you have a silencer so
it's<00:03:26.680> better<00:03:26.829> to<00:03:26.980> like<00:03:27.100> go<00:03:27.700> with<00:03:27.850> FMJ<00:03:28.269> or<00:03:28.810> like

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
it's better to like go with FMJ or like

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.240 
it's better to like go with FMJ or like
a<00:03:29.500> site<00:03:29.950> or<00:03:29.980> something<00:03:30.549> but<00:03:31.450> uh<00:03:31.769> yeah<00:03:32.769> I<00:03:33.130> don't

know like with the UMP though I like to
use<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.440> sounds<00:03:35.739> or<00:03:35.859> sometimes<00:03:36.190> it's<00:03:36.310> just

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
use the sounds or sometimes it's just

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.530 
use the sounds or sometimes it's just
because<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:36.850> doesn't<00:03:37.060> really<00:03:37.209> make<00:03:37.329> that<00:03:37.480> much

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
because it doesn't really make that much

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.300 
because it doesn't really make that much
of<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.780> difference<00:03:38.109> of<00:03:38.139> the<00:03:38.200> gun<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:38.739> I<00:03:39.010> don't

you'll<00:05:27.580> see<00:05:27.820> I'm<00:05:28.300> kind<00:05:28.780> of<00:05:28.840> taking<00:05:29.110> control

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
you'll see I'm kind of taking control

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.850 
you'll see I'm kind of taking control
the<00:05:29.710> right<00:05:29.890> side<00:05:30.160> here<00:05:30.610> and<00:05:30.930> trying<00:05:31.930> to<00:05:32.020> cover

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
the right side here and trying to cover

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.200 
the right side here and trying to cover
it<00:05:32.980> because<00:05:33.280> they<00:05:33.580> all<00:05:33.670> seem<00:05:33.880> to<00:05:33.970> be<00:05:34.060> coming

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
just trying to basically spawn trap them

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
remember now I was talking about ninja

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.390 
remember now I was talking about ninja
because<00:05:59.110> everyone<00:05:59.560> has<00:05:59.680> headset<00:06:00.130> so<00:06:00.280> that

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
because everyone has headset so that

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.120 
because everyone has headset so that
plays<00:06:00.550> gamebattles<00:06:00.970> basically<00:06:01.570> so<00:06:02.260> everyone

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
plays gamebattles basically so everyone

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.460 
plays gamebattles basically so everyone
uses<00:06:03.400> ninja<00:06:03.790> to<00:06:04.630> make<00:06:04.960> sure<00:06:05.110> they<00:06:05.230> don't<00:06:05.380> get

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
uses ninja to make sure they don't get

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.590 
uses ninja to make sure they don't get
heard<00:06:05.890> and<00:06:06.390> whatnot<00:06:07.390> and<00:06:08.010> um<00:06:09.420> yeah<00:06:10.420> I<00:06:10.450> guess

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
heard and whatnot and um yeah I guess

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.180 
heard and whatnot and um yeah I guess
like<00:06:10.810> I<00:06:10.930> was<00:06:11.050> using<00:06:11.080> commando<00:06:11.740> because<00:06:12.100> he

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
like I was using commando because he

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.720 
like I was using commando because he
doesn't<00:06:12.340> know<00:06:12.430> how<00:06:12.520> to<00:06:12.610> play<00:06:12.790> but<00:06:14.130> he<00:06:15.130> mystic

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 
doesn't know how to play but he mystic

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.760 
doesn't know how to play but he mystic
matawan<00:06:16.240> me<00:06:16.360> a<00:06:16.600> while<00:06:16.990> back<00:06:17.200> there<00:06:17.410> and<00:06:17.590> we

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
matawan me a while back there and we

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.140 
matawan me a while back there and we
were<00:06:17.860> in<00:06:17.920> the<00:06:18.010> first<00:06:18.190> round<00:06:18.400> there<00:06:18.700> cuz<00:06:19.000> we

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
were in the first round there cuz we

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.250 
were in the first round there cuz we
were<00:06:19.270> playing<00:06:19.480> some<00:06:19.660> good<00:06:19.780> defense<00:06:20.290> and<00:06:22.260> yeah

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
were playing some good defense and yeah

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.200 
were playing some good defense and yeah
another<00:06:23.980> difference<00:06:24.190> in<00:06:24.580> game<00:06:24.820> battles

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
another difference in game battles

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.900 
another difference in game battles
though<00:06:25.390> is<00:06:25.630> in<00:06:26.080> most<00:06:26.710> game<00:06:27.130> types<00:06:27.400> there's<00:06:27.670> a

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910 
though is in most game types there's a

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.970 
though is in most game types there's a
respawn<00:06:28.450> delay<00:06:28.750> which<00:06:29.440> puts<00:06:29.740> a<00:06:29.800> whole<00:06:29.950> new

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:29.980 
respawn delay which puts a whole new

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.350 
respawn delay which puts a whole new
element<00:06:30.220> into<00:06:30.580> the<00:06:30.700> game<00:06:30.820> because<00:06:31.060> I<00:06:31.240> don't

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
element into the game because I don't

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.629 
element into the game because I don't
know<00:06:31.450> how<00:06:31.630> many<00:06:31.840> times<00:06:31.900> like<00:06:32.260> in

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 
know how many times like in

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.700 
know how many times like in
in<00:06:33.270> public<00:06:33.659> matches<00:06:33.780> I'll<00:06:34.080> be<00:06:34.169> capturing<00:06:34.590> a

on<00:07:13.919> the<00:07:14.009> bomb<00:07:14.159> timer<00:07:14.430> so<00:07:15.080> Chris<00:07:16.080> and<00:07:16.229> Wes<00:07:16.319> you

on the bomb timer so Chris and Wes you

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.379 
on the bomb timer so Chris and Wes you
start<00:07:16.770> to<00:07:16.889> go<00:07:17.009> over<00:07:17.310> to<00:07:17.460> be<00:07:17.699> to<00:07:17.939> get<00:07:18.060> the<00:07:18.150> plant
