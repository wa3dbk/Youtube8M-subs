order

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.120 
order
I've<00:02:05.580> got<00:02:05.820> flour<00:02:06.229> then<00:02:07.229> I've<00:02:07.350> got<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.619> egg<00:02:07.830> and

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
I've got flour then I've got the egg and

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.910

then I've got the crumb mixture so the

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.860 
then I've got the crumb mixture so the
acronym<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.370> we<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.910> use<00:02:12.150> for<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:12.600> is

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
acronym that we like to use for this is

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.460 
acronym that we like to use for this is
thick<00:02:13.650> flour<00:02:14.280> egg<00:02:14.610> crumb<00:02:15.210> if<00:02:15.540> easy<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.290> if<00:02:16.350> you

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
to heat up a pan off oil now I'm using

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.410
