bad it moved on to a close grip speed
bench<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.510> I'm<00:00:33.600> kind<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.840> dropped<00:00:34.079> these<00:00:34.260> as

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
bench so I'm kind of dropped these as

bench so I'm kind of dropped these as
fast<00:00:34.710> as<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:34.980> can<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.850> stopped<00:00:36.270> them<00:00:36.540> one

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780

competition<00:00:45.150> grip<00:00:45.360> would<00:00:45.600> be<00:00:46.550> pinkies<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
competition grip would be pinkies on the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.270 
competition grip would be pinkies on the
Rings<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.530> maybe<00:00:49.770> three<00:00:50.190> inches

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
Rings so this is maybe three inches

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.280 
Rings so this is maybe three inches
inside<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:53.690> and<00:00:54.690> I'm<00:00:54.750> doing<00:00:54.900> these<00:00:55.080> with

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
inside that and I'm doing these with

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.820 
inside that and I'm doing these with
with<00:00:55.800> short<00:00:56.070> rest<00:00:56.280> 45<00:00:56.730> seconds<00:00:57.150> between

with short rest 45 seconds between
between<00:00:58.830> rest<00:00:59.160> periods<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.550> I'll<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.940> these

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
between rest periods on I'll do these

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.800 
between rest periods on I'll do these
three<00:01:00.600> times<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.350> my<00:01:02.070> build<00:01:02.340> up<00:01:02.630> three<00:01:03.630> times

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
three times in my build up three times

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.530 
three times in my build up three times
through<00:01:04.199> my<00:01:04.320> training<00:01:04.500> cycle<00:01:05.420> so<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.479> next

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
through my training cycle so the next

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.880 
through my training cycle so the next
time<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.840> come<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.229> him<00:01:07.350> it'll<00:01:07.530> probably<00:01:07.710> be

time I come to him it'll probably be

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.580 
time I come to him it'll probably be
like<00:01:08.070> 3<00:01:08.400> 40<00:01:08.759> 45<00:01:09.150> sets<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.570> three<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> last
