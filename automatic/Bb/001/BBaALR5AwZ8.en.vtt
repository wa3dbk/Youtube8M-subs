associated with fat in the outer leg but
in<00:00:27.980> reality<00:00:28.550> I<00:00:28.580> have<00:00:28.849> patients<00:00:29.090> in<00:00:29.390> my<00:00:29.509> office

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.710 

cellulite<00:00:37.190> is<00:00:37.460> really<00:00:37.850> a<00:00:37.879> structural<00:00:38.480> problem

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
cellulite is really a structural problem

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.780 
cellulite is really a structural problem
that<00:00:39.110> is<00:00:39.230> caused<00:00:39.500> by<00:00:39.680> three<00:00:40.010> factors<00:00:40.580> the

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
that is caused by three factors the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.850 
that is caused by three factors the
first<00:00:41.510> being<00:00:41.780> thin<00:00:42.199> skin

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
first being thin skin

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.009 
first being thin skin
the<00:00:43.370> second<00:00:43.820> factor<00:00:44.180> these<00:00:44.330> little<00:00:44.540> fibrous

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
the second factor these little fibrous

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:46.960 
the second factor these little fibrous
bands<00:00:45.320> that<00:00:45.620> attach<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.129> skin<00:00:46.460> down<00:00:46.730> to<00:00:46.760> the

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
bands that attach the skin down to the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.850 
bands that attach the skin down to the
muscle<00:00:47.420> that<00:00:47.449> actually<00:00:47.989> pull<00:00:48.290> the<00:00:48.530> skin<00:00:48.800> down

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
muscle that actually pull the skin down

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.250 
muscle that actually pull the skin down
in<00:00:49.190> certain<00:00:49.580> areas<00:00:49.910> and<00:00:50.120> in<00:00:50.720> between<00:00:50.930> those

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
in certain areas and in between those

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.469 
in certain areas and in between those
fibrous<00:00:51.799> bands<00:00:52.100> are<00:00:52.309> little<00:00:52.610> tiny<00:00:52.790> globules

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:53.479 
fibrous bands are little tiny globules

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:55.539 
fibrous bands are little tiny globules
of<00:00:53.659> fat<00:00:53.720> that<00:00:54.379> are<00:00:54.500> poking<00:00:54.920> up<00:00:55.070> to<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:55.309> surface

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:55.549 
of fat that are poking up to the surface

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:58.060 
of fat that are poking up to the surface
causing<00:00:56.150> the<00:00:56.269> skin<00:00:56.390> to<00:00:56.570> dimple<00:00:57.049> so<00:00:57.680> what<00:00:57.890> makes

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
causing the skin to dimple so what makes

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.439 
causing the skin to dimple so what makes
cellulose<00:00:58.640> different<00:00:59.150> than<00:00:59.269> other

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
cellulose different than other

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.229 
cellulose different than other
treatments<00:00:59.809> of<00:01:00.110> cellulite<00:01:00.620> in<00:01:01.030> reality<00:01:02.030> those

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
treatments of cellulite in reality those

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.939 
treatments of cellulite in reality those
other<00:01:02.420> treatments<00:01:02.900> are<00:01:02.989> very<00:01:03.019> superficial

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
other treatments are very superficial

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.259 
other treatments are very superficial
and<00:01:04.129> what<00:01:04.280> they're<00:01:04.430> doing<00:01:04.460> is<00:01:04.879> they're<00:01:05.030> just

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
and what they're doing is they're just

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.180 
and what they're doing is they're just
basically<00:01:05.690> redistributing<00:01:06.619> water<00:01:06.920> and

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
basically redistributing water and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.740 
basically redistributing water and
eventually<00:01:07.880> that's<00:01:08.119> going<00:01:08.270> to<00:01:08.360> come<00:01:08.540> back

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
eventually that's going to come back

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.120 
eventually that's going to come back
again<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.320> dimpling<00:01:09.619> is<00:01:09.830> going<00:01:10.040> to

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
again and the dimpling is going to

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.270 
again and the dimpling is going to
reoccur<00:01:10.960> with<00:01:11.960> our<00:01:12.110> new<00:01:12.290> system<00:01:12.680> cellular<00:01:13.220> is

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
reoccur with our new system cellular is

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.830 
reoccur with our new system cellular is
what<00:01:13.549> we<00:01:13.670> do<00:01:13.850> is<00:01:14.030> I<00:01:14.119> have<00:01:14.299> the<00:01:14.420> patients

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
what we do is I have the patients

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.359 
what we do is I have the patients
standing<00:01:15.229> up<00:01:15.320> in<00:01:15.470> front<00:01:15.740> of<00:01:15.799> me<00:01:15.920> before<00:01:16.100> the

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
standing up in front of me before the

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.310 
standing up in front of me before the
procedure<00:01:16.729> is<00:01:16.909> done<00:01:16.970> I<00:01:17.360> use<00:01:17.780> this<00:01:17.990> grid

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
procedure is done I use this grid

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.530 
procedure is done I use this grid
pattern<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:18.860> it<00:01:19.220> marks<00:01:19.490> off<00:01:19.670> five<00:01:19.970> centimeter

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
pattern and it marks off five centimeter

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.960 
pattern and it marks off five centimeter
squares<00:01:21.110> of<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.890> cellulite<00:01:22.369> on<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:22.790> outer

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
squares of the cellulite on the outer

squares of the cellulite on the outer
aspect<00:01:23.240> of<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:23.810> leg<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.980> green<00:01:25.340> circles<00:01:25.880> are

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
aspect of the leg the green circles are

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.790 
aspect of the leg the green circles are
really<00:01:26.030> those<00:01:26.450> little<00:01:26.690> globs<00:01:26.960> of<00:01:27.260> fat<00:01:27.590> that

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
really those little globs of fat that

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.140 
really those little globs of fat that
I'm<00:01:27.920> going<00:01:28.100> to<00:01:28.130> melt<00:01:28.370> that<00:01:28.580> are<00:01:28.700> stuck<00:01:29.000> between

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
I'm going to melt that are stuck between

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.750 
I'm going to melt that are stuck between
those<00:01:29.600> fibrous<00:01:30.200> bands<00:01:30.710> then<00:01:31.220> you<00:01:31.370> notice<00:01:31.670> I

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
those fibrous bands then you notice I

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.580 
those fibrous bands then you notice I
use<00:01:31.910> a<00:01:31.940> red<00:01:32.300> magic<00:01:32.720> marker<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:33.110> red<00:01:33.320> magic

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
use a red magic marker the red magic

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.100 
use a red magic marker the red magic
marker<00:01:33.800> lines<00:01:34.460> off<00:01:34.790> those<00:01:35.390> little<00:01:35.660> fibrous

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
marker lines off those little fibrous

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.720

bands that are stuck down underneath the
skin<00:01:38.090> that<00:01:38.270> I'm<00:01:38.360> eventually<00:01:38.660> going<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.140> snap

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
skin that I'm eventually going to snap

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.080 
skin that I'm eventually going to snap
during<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:39.920> procedure

during the procedure

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.880 
during the procedure
it's<00:01:43.090> a<00:01:43.240> minimally<00:01:43.720> invasive<00:01:43.750> procedure<00:01:44.229> that

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
it's a minimally invasive procedure that

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.680 
it's a minimally invasive procedure that
we<00:01:45.040> can<00:01:45.190> do<00:01:45.310> in<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.520> office<00:01:45.909> under<00:01:46.210> a<00:01:46.420> local

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.870 
first of all the laser is going to melt
those<00:01:56.110> little<00:01:56.530> tiny<00:01:56.770> pockets<00:01:57.369> of<00:01:57.490> fat<00:01:57.729> that

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
those little tiny pockets of fat that

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.480 
those little tiny pockets of fat that
are<00:01:58.030> underneath<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.420> skin<00:01:58.930> after<00:01:59.830> that<00:02:00.310> the

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
are underneath the skin after that the

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.160 
are underneath the skin after that the
laser<00:02:00.700> is<00:02:00.850> going<00:02:00.910> to<00:02:01.150> snap<00:02:01.450> those<00:02:01.630> fibrous

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
laser is going to snap those fibrous

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.380 
laser is going to snap those fibrous
bands<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.770> fibrous<00:02:03.250> bands<00:02:03.520> will<00:02:04.030> help<00:02:04.270> to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
bands the fibrous bands will help to

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.359 
bands the fibrous bands will help to
release<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.960> skin<00:02:05.229> pop<00:02:05.619> it<00:02:05.800> back<00:02:05.830> up<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:06.340> the

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
release the skin pop it back up to the

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.460 
release the skin pop it back up to the
surface<00:02:06.700> then<00:02:07.690> we're<00:02:07.900> going<00:02:08.020> to<00:02:08.050> use<00:02:08.289> the

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
surface then we're going to use the

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.770 
surface then we're going to use the
laser<00:02:08.649> to<00:02:08.890> stimulate<00:02:09.459> collagen<00:02:09.700> that<00:02:10.390> helps

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
laser to stimulate collagen that helps

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.960 
laser to stimulate collagen that helps
to<00:02:10.899> thicken<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.380> skin<00:02:11.560> now<00:02:12.459> we've<00:02:12.760> actually

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
to thicken the skin now we've actually

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.090 
to thicken the skin now we've actually
addressed<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.870> three<00:02:14.170> structural<00:02:14.620> problems

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
addressed the three structural problems

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.700 
addressed the three structural problems
associated<00:02:15.430> with<00:02:15.790> cellular

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.680 

as<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.460> can<00:02:20.580> see<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> minimally

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
as you can see this is a minimally

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.690 
as you can see this is a minimally
invasive<00:02:21.720> procedure<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:23.070> procedure<00:02:23.490> itself

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
invasive procedure the procedure itself

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.490 
invasive procedure the procedure itself
takes<00:02:24.180> somewhere<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.690> range<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:25.050> about<00:02:25.320> an

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
takes somewhere in the range of about an

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.230 
takes somewhere in the range of about an
hour<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:26.070> most<00:02:26.250> people<00:02:26.550> are<00:02:26.640> able<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.880> return

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
hour and most people are able to return

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.360 
hour and most people are able to return
to<00:02:27.300> work<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.720> next<00:02:27.840> day<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.920> need<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.190> wear<00:02:29.340> a

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
to work the next day you need to wear a

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.890 
to work the next day you need to wear a
compression<00:02:29.790> garment<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.510> couple<00:02:30.810> of

compression garment for a couple of

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.900 
compression garment for a couple of
weeks<00:02:30.960> afterwards<00:02:31.770> sort<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.100> like<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.280> Spanx

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
weeks afterwards sort of like a Spanx
