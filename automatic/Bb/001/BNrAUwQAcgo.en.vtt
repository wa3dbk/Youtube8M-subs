there's several aspects that you often
see<00:01:29.400> common<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.390> boats<00:01:30.659> one<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
see common to you boats one is that the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.550 
see common to you boats one is that the
push<00:01:32.520> piece<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> chronograph<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
push piece is for the chronograph and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.069 
push piece is for the chronograph and
the<00:01:34.740> crank<00:01:35.009> position<00:01:35.700> here<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.540> left-hand

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the crank position here on the left-hand

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.899 
the crank position here on the left-hand
side<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.439> case<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.400> actually<00:01:38.549> that's

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
side of the case and actually that's

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.060 
side of the case and actually that's
very<00:01:39.090> sensible<00:01:39.509> because<00:01:39.780> they<00:01:40.530> actually<00:01:40.710> wear

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
very sensible because they actually wear

very sensible because they actually wear
the<00:01:41.250> watch

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the watch

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.789 
the watch
you<00:01:42.119> don't<00:01:42.329> gauge<00:01:42.600> into<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.500> find<00:01:43.740> that

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
you don't gauge into you and I find that

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.889 
you don't gauge into you and I find that
very<00:01:44.009> very<00:01:44.130> comfortable<00:01:44.549> interior<00:01:45.060> think

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
very very comfortable interior think

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.590 
very very comfortable interior think
it's<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.079> great<00:01:46.259> aspect<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.950> watch<00:01:47.130> design

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
it's a great aspect to the watch design

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.350 
it's a great aspect to the watch design
on<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.780> reverse<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> watch<00:01:49.970> you've<00:01:50.970> got<00:01:51.180> a

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
watched quite like this one

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.439 
watched quite like this one
a<00:04:33.300> little<00:04:34.050> bit<00:04:34.520> yeah<00:04:35.520> I<00:04:35.669> often<00:04:35.909> say<00:04:36.150> he'll<00:04:36.300> of

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
a little bit yeah I often say he'll of

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.879

watches<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.110> I<00:04:37.199> think<00:04:37.409> part<00:04:37.710> of<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.860> reason

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
watches and I think part of the reason

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.950 
watches and I think part of the reason
for<00:04:38.190> that<00:04:38.340> is<00:04:38.610> that<00:04:38.639> through<00:04:39.360> many<00:04:39.539> watches
