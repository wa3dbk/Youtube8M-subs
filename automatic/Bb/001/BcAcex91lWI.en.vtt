style in general symbols one thing I

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.179 
style in general symbols one thing I
really<00:00:30.570> he's<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> great<00:00:31.619> player<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.949> general

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
but one thing I really like about his

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.209 
but one thing I really like about his
play<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.989> how<00:00:34.170> much<00:00:34.290> he<00:00:34.350> incorporates<00:00:34.890> drops

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
play is how much he incorporates drops

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.280 
play is how much he incorporates drops
and<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> lesser<00:00:36.329> extent<00:00:36.660> nidus<00:00:36.960> networks

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
compared to others herbs it's very

xerx lose a lot when they focus too much
in<00:00:45.360> high<00:00:45.480> tech<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.160> saw<00:00:47.399> him<00:00:47.610> go<00:00:48.110> kind<00:00:49.110> of

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
in high tech and so I saw him go kind of

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.740 
in high tech and so I saw him go kind of
the<00:00:49.320> Max<00:00:49.680> Roach<00:00:50.010> 12-minute<00:00:50.760> Max<00:00:50.940> Roach<00:00:51.180> style

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
the Max Roach 12-minute Max Roach style

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.260 
the Max Roach 12-minute Max Roach style
that<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.010> popular<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.520> instead<00:00:54.090> he

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
that is so popular but instead he

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.910 
that is so popular but instead he
deleted<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.870> max<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.170> little<00:00:55.379> bit<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.649> he

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
deleted the max a little bit and he

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.639 
deleted the max a little bit and he
actually<00:00:56.039> mixed<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.550> drop<00:00:56.789> play<00:00:57.030> which<00:00:57.649> is

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
actually mixed in drop play which is

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.959 
actually mixed in drop play which is
really<00:00:59.129> really<00:00:59.340> smart<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.640> my<00:00:59.730> opinion

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
really really smart in my opinion

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.400 
really really smart in my opinion
because<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.539> big<00:01:00.780> strength<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.140> style

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
because the big strength of that style

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.139 
because the big strength of that style
is<00:01:01.590> not<00:01:02.039> winning<00:01:02.340> straight<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.640> fights<00:01:02.850> if<00:01:03.030> you

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
is not winning straight up fights if you

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.310 
is not winning straight up fights if you
fight<00:01:03.329> straight<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:03.899> some<00:01:04.049> mortal

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
fight straight up for some mortal

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.509 
fight straight up for some mortal
century<00:01:04.589> army<00:01:04.799> you're<00:01:04.920> going<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.129> get<00:01:05.220> rolled

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
century army you're going to get rolled

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.910 
century army you're going to get rolled
no<00:01:06.390> matter<00:01:06.570> how<00:01:06.689> many<00:01:06.810> roaches<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.409> but

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
no matter how many roaches you have but

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.050 
no matter how many roaches you have but
what's<00:01:08.159> smart<00:01:08.340> about<00:01:08.490> what<00:01:08.610> he<00:01:08.700> does<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.030> he

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
what's smart about what he does is he

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.850 
what's smart about what he does is he
loads<00:01:09.420> up<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:09.930> overlords<00:01:10.350> goes<00:01:10.500> back<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
loads up for overlords goes back in the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.140 
loads up for overlords goes back in the
main<00:01:11.070> well<00:01:11.280> at<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.430> same<00:01:11.580> time<00:01:11.729> he<00:01:11.880> hits<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
main well at the same time he hits a

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.580 
main well at the same time he hits a
third<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.510> then<00:01:12.570> he<00:01:12.689> goes<00:01:12.810> into<00:01:13.020> natural<00:01:13.200> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
third and then he goes into natural and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.990 
third and then he goes into natural and
it's<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.130> much<00:01:14.280> easier<00:01:14.310> way<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.760> spread

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
it's just a much easier way to spread

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.399 
it's just a much easier way to spread
your<00:01:15.060> opponent<00:01:15.450> out<00:01:15.509> which<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.080> entire

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
your opponent out which is the entire

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.350 
your opponent out which is the entire
purpose<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.040> style<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:18.210> something

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
purpose of that style so it's something

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.609 
purpose of that style so it's something
I've<00:01:18.540> been<00:01:18.570> trying<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> incorporate<00:01:19.200> quite<00:01:19.590> a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
I've been trying to incorporate quite a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.219 
I've been trying to incorporate quite a
bit<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.799> my<00:01:19.979> play<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.780> it's<00:01:21.780> difficult

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
bit in my play and it's difficult

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.170 
bit in my play and it's difficult
because<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.950> guests<00:01:23.280> are<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.640> lift<00:01:23.820> upgrades

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
because the guests are the lift upgrades

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.390 
because the guests are the lift upgrades
200<00:01:24.689> guests<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.290> ventral<00:01:25.650> sacks<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.070> another

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
200 guests for ventral sacks and another

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.310 
200 guests for ventral sacks and another
100<00:01:26.700> guests<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.090> speed<00:01:27.330> upgrade<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.140> it

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320

way<00:02:55.530> through<00:02:55.770> and<00:02:56.640> kind<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:57.030> like<00:02:57.150> that<00:02:57.360> so

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
way through and kind of like that so

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.210 
way through and kind of like that so
everything's<00:02:58.410> going<00:02:58.470> around<00:02:58.800> looking<00:02:59.160> for

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
everything's going around looking for

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.430 
everything's going around looking for
pylons<00:02:59.670> here<00:02:59.880> I<00:03:00.030> see<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:00.959> probe<00:03:01.140> coming<00:03:01.380> off

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
pylons here I see that probe coming off

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.900 
pylons here I see that probe coming off
I<00:03:01.560> realized<00:03:01.890> there's<00:03:02.130> going<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.340> be<00:03:02.370> pylon<00:03:02.730> go

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
I realized there's going to be pylon go

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.760 
I realized there's going to be pylon go
kill<00:03:03.209> it<00:03:03.239> immediately<00:03:03.630> also<00:03:04.380> have<00:03:04.470> my<00:03:04.560> Roche

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
kill it immediately also have my Roche

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.729 
kill it immediately also have my Roche
Warren<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.310> evo<00:03:05.610> chamber<00:03:05.970> down<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:07.020> see

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
Warren and the evo chamber down I see

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.170 
Warren and the evo chamber down I see
that<00:03:07.890> he<00:03:08.010> doesn't<00:03:08.190> work<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:08.550> immediately<00:03:08.940> if

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
that he doesn't work in immediately if

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.880 
that he doesn't work in immediately if
it's<00:03:09.360> going<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.540> be<00:03:09.630> like<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.780> +1<00:03:10.050> for<00:03:10.470> gate<00:03:10.650> or

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
it's going to be like a +1 for gate or

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.440 
it's going to be like a +1 for gate or
something<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.610> would<00:03:11.820> have<00:03:11.940> warped<00:03:12.150> in<00:03:12.270> there

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
something you would have warped in there

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.210 
something you would have warped in there
the<00:03:13.080> gateways<00:03:13.380> open<00:03:13.500> up<00:03:13.709> at<00:03:13.830> eight<00:03:13.920> minutes

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
the gateways open up at eight minutes

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.860 
the gateways open up at eight minutes
with<00:03:14.250> that<00:03:14.430> timing<00:03:14.760> given<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:15.450> he<00:03:15.660> didn't

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
with that timing given that he didn't

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.540 
with that timing given that he didn't
warp<00:03:16.020> in<00:03:16.110> immediately<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.560> feel<00:03:16.830> like<00:03:17.010> it's<00:03:17.280> for

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
warp in immediately I feel like it's for

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.190 
warp in immediately I feel like it's for
something<00:03:17.760> else<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.090> I<00:03:18.120> put<00:03:18.300> down<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.480> spore<00:03:18.989> in

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
something else so I put down a spore in

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.290 
something else so I put down a spore in
my<00:03:19.320> second<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.709> third<00:03:19.770> base<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.940> know<00:03:21.060> it's

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
my second and third base I I know it's

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.699 
my second and third base I I know it's
not<00:03:21.390> gonna<00:03:21.510> be<00:03:21.600> an<00:03:21.690> initial<00:03:22.140> immediate<00:03:22.560> rush

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
not gonna be an initial immediate rush

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.490 
not gonna be an initial immediate rush
and<00:03:23.010> given<00:03:23.910> that<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.630> likelihood<00:03:24.840> of<00:03:25.140> DT<00:03:25.440> and

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
and given that the likelihood of DT and

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.660 
and given that the likelihood of DT and
void<00:03:25.680> ray<00:03:25.830> goes<00:03:25.980> way<00:03:26.130> up<00:03:26.160> he<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.519> actually

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
void ray goes way up he is actually

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.670 
void ray goes way up he is actually
going<00:03:26.910> dt<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.390> didn't<00:03:27.750> scout<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.140> but<00:03:28.380> he<00:03:28.560> is

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
going dt I didn't scout that but he is

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.460 
going dt I didn't scout that but he is
going<00:03:28.830> dt<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:30.239> so<00:03:30.750> in<00:03:30.840> order<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.019> respond<00:03:31.290> that

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
going dt and so in order to respond that

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.960 
going dt and so in order to respond that
obviously<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:31.950> want<00:03:32.130> to<00:03:32.220> have<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.610> couple<00:03:32.880> of

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
obviously you want to have a couple of

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.340 
obviously you want to have a couple of
sport<00:03:33.150> crawlers<00:03:33.450> all<00:03:33.570> over<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:33.959> if<00:03:34.170> he<00:03:34.260> is

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
sport crawlers all over and if he is

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.690 
sport crawlers all over and if he is
just<00:03:34.560> going<00:03:34.590> for<00:03:34.800> a<00:03:34.890> delayed<00:03:35.130> warp<00:03:35.370> gate<00:03:35.519> rush

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
just going for a delayed warp gate rush

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.009 
just going for a delayed warp gate rush
or<00:03:35.940> blink<00:03:36.120> stock<00:03:36.300> or<00:03:36.480> something<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:36.780> sort

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
or blink stock or something of that sort

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.350 
or blink stock or something of that sort
to<00:03:37.769> sport<00:03:38.010> crawlers<00:03:38.280> is<00:03:38.550> it's<00:03:38.970> not<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.209> huge

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
to sport crawlers is it's not a huge

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.820 
to sport crawlers is it's not a huge
deal<00:03:39.480> it's<00:03:39.840> not<00:03:40.050> going<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.350> make<00:03:40.440> a<00:03:40.500> break<00:03:40.739> the

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
deal it's not going to make a break the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.009 
deal it's not going to make a break the
game<00:03:40.950> for<00:03:41.190> you<00:03:41.310> it's<00:03:41.700> well<00:03:42.000> worth<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.300> and<00:03:42.510> so

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
game for you it's well worth it and so

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.050 
game for you it's well worth it and so
here<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.470> dt<00:03:43.739> Scott<00:03:44.010> loses<00:03:44.280> three<00:03:44.760> of<00:03:44.880> them

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
here the dt Scott loses three of them

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.970 
here the dt Scott loses three of them
one<00:03:45.510> on<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:45.989> way<00:03:46.080> as<00:03:46.320> I<00:03:46.470> said<00:03:46.530> not<00:03:46.920> a

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
one on the way as I said not a

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.380 
one on the way as I said not a
particularly<00:03:47.489> good<00:03:47.580> player<00:03:47.790> don't<00:03:47.970> don't

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
particularly good player don't don't

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.000 
particularly good player don't don't
really<00:03:48.570> watch<00:03:48.720> what<00:03:48.959> he<00:03:49.110> does<00:03:49.140> just<00:03:49.830> watch

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
really watch what he does just watch

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.380 
really watch what he does just watch
what<00:03:50.190> I<00:03:50.220> do

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
what I do

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.910 
what I do
so<00:03:52.390> now<00:03:52.540> this<00:03:52.720> is<00:03:52.990> the<00:03:53.200> opportunity<00:03:53.410> that<00:03:53.740> I

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
so now this is the opportunity that I

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.740 
so now this is the opportunity that I
need<00:03:54.160> I<00:03:54.370> realized<00:03:54.670> he's<00:03:54.790> wasted<00:03:55.120> a<00:03:55.180> lot<00:03:55.210> of<00:03:55.420> a

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
need I realized he's wasted a lot of a

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.540 
need I realized he's wasted a lot of a
lot<00:03:56.080> of<00:03:56.200> resources<00:03:56.440> on<00:03:56.710> that<00:03:56.860> DT<00:03:57.160> TECA<00:03:57.370> did

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.950 
lot of resources on that DT TECA did
absolutely<00:03:57.760> nothing<00:03:57.970> I<00:03:58.330> have<00:03:58.510> a<00:03:58.720> very

absolutely nothing I have a very

absolutely nothing I have a very
well-established<00:03:59.170> economy<00:03:59.950> so<00:04:00.280> I<00:04:00.310> start<00:04:00.610> that

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:16.300 
build as it turns out he is doing with

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.960 
build as it turns out he is doing with
those<00:04:16.450> two<00:04:16.690> robos<00:04:17.070> so<00:04:18.070> I'd<00:04:18.400> much<00:04:18.640> prefer<00:04:18.670> the

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
those two robos so I'd much prefer the

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.760 
those two robos so I'd much prefer the
carapace<00:04:19.300> opening<00:04:19.690> even<00:04:19.930> though<00:04:20.080> it<00:04:20.320> is<00:04:20.350> a

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:20.770 
carapace opening even though it is a

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.470 
carapace opening even though it is a
little<00:04:20.920> bit<00:04:21.040> more<00:04:21.160> costly<00:04:21.489> also<00:04:22.180> putting<00:04:22.360> down

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
little bit more costly also putting down

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.270 
little bit more costly also putting down
a<00:04:22.510> second<00:04:22.810> evo<00:04:22.990> chamber<00:04:23.350> whenever<00:04:24.010> you<00:04:24.130> know

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
a second evo chamber whenever you know

you're going to be going into a macro
game<00:04:25.600> you<00:04:25.720> have<00:04:25.840> an<00:04:25.960> economic<00:04:26.080> advantage<00:04:26.770> you

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
game you have an economic advantage you

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
second evo chamber upgrades are so

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.260 
second evo chamber upgrades are so
incredibly<00:04:30.040> important<00:04:30.490> it's<00:04:30.760> well<00:04:31.120> worth

upgrade going down I saw getting the

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.470 
upgrade going down I saw getting the
baneling<00:04:35.440> nest<00:04:35.650> banelings<00:04:36.490> I<00:04:36.790> way<00:04:37.210> if<00:04:37.360> you

those 3d teaser Leon gave me a

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.270 
those 3d teaser Leon gave me a
ridiculous<00:05:05.380> amount<00:05:05.440> of<00:05:05.650> leeway<00:05:05.800> in<00:05:06.040> the<00:05:06.130> game

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
ridiculous amount of leeway in the game

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.070 
ridiculous amount of leeway in the game
so<00:05:06.460> I'm<00:05:06.550> able<00:05:06.700> to<00:05:06.760> just<00:05:06.970> do<00:05:07.450> whatever<00:05:07.660> I<00:05:07.840> want

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
but like I said that that's what this

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.370 
but like I said that that's what this
build<00:05:10.300> is<00:05:10.390> kind<00:05:10.540> of<00:05:10.630> for<00:05:10.810> is<00:05:10.960> for<00:05:11.140> taking

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
build is kind of for is for taking

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.660 
build is kind of for is for taking
advantage<00:05:11.770> of<00:05:11.860> the<00:05:11.980> situation<00:05:12.190> where<00:05:12.610> you

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
advantage of the situation where you

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.340 
advantage of the situation where you

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
have the opportunity to do quite a bit

have the opportunity to do quite a bit
as<00:05:14.590> zerg<00:05:15.310> if<00:05:15.520> you<00:05:15.730> hold<00:05:15.970> on<00:05:16.120> early<00:05:16.420> game<00:05:16.570> versus
