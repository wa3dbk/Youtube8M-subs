00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.310
 hello I'm gray and today I show you how 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.310
 fold a talkative 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.560
 to fold we will use a sheet 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:18.779
 a4 of 21 x 29 7 the first folds to the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.869
 half as if it were a book is 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.239
 important at this point rotate it and 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.310
 re-stick it in half again 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:29.699
 as if it were a book now what I'm going 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.330
 to do is open this last fold and 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:38.070
 take only the top sheet of the 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.989
 down I'm going to leave it unfolded and I'm going to 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.900
 repeat the same thing on the other side I'm going to 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.030
 bring this edge to this fold 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.940
 now I'm going to return the fold to your 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.540
 place in this way and turn around 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.360
 to keep working I'm going to join this 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:01.940
 edge with this fold I'm going to rotate the 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:05.600
 model and I'm going to do the same and I'm going to 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.210
 close the talkative is almost finished 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.130
 The only thing we lack is where the 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.340
 lips that are made of the following 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.430
 forms I'm going to join this point with this 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.860
 point to mark half nothing else 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.229
 I'm going to make a full fold I'm just going 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.700
 to mark mark half because I'm going to 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.530
 make a small cut that is going to 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.190
 allow to make the corners of the 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:32.720
 lips and the talkative is almost ready 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:35.390
 I can only stick my eyes a lot 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.869
 to make the eyes I will use a 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.130
 I note here the garrulous ready 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.290
 to play 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.110
 friends of poop robarte robert bosch 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.259
 to make this talkative what 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:51.890
 we did was use a sheet size 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.440
 a4 and I did a series of folds 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.170
 that they gave us the head then through 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.610
 from a cut we could form the lips and 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.610
 we finally hit his eyes 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.170
