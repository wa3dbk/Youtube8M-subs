00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.630
 conceptualists type - for example you 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.550
 I will consider conceptualist in all 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:17.220
 guided the betas with the school of 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.220
 skinny menotti very well is a paste 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:28.230
 is the best is the best player of the 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.210
 world and it's good 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.450
 is the best interplanetary has a 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.329
 only program where critical and 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.969
 try to revile the protagonists is 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.250
 the east of the surroundings what to 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:45.910
 sometimes use the fat and just the fat 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.350
 palace that puts up that round that 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.890
 It's the ball 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.260
 and I say that Messi is uniquely a supersonic 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.030
 supersonic player the best of everything today 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:01.530
 they will give him the fourth time the best 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.530
 player the best player in the world 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.229
 saying that we improve the supersonic 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.229
 who is an extraordinary human 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.840
 same as equal 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.759
 the best player in the world 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.170
 I want to say good because in less 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.360
 72 hours 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.960
 viatri is going to be a lanús player 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.799
 loan 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.970
 it is impossible to do the opposite 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.970
 impossible to do the opposite 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.350
 if not 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.140
 it would be that the martyr tata was 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.140
 conceptualists but it's actually 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.140
 taxis 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.980
 now I will hold this what I said 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.349
 against good and drive traviés and manage 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.230
 Messi is the best player in the world is 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.629
 extraordinary definidor tell me when 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.480
 step on the ball brakes when you make a 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.790
 pause when competing in a tiny 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.129
 come back and put everything back in 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.620
 200 kilometers per hour is the virtue 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:42.040
 main that has that makes it the best 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.319
 of the world do not confuse not confuse but 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.870
 does not have the skill of the skilled 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.209
 that are able to change in a meter 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.120
 slow exit and return to stop out and 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.090
 come back ready with my story and for my 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.230
 roots I have to have a coffee with 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.230
 with Carlos Bilardo 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.880
 the history 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.720
 maradona have nothing to do with those 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.720
 that seemed stopped once 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:25.740
 of short duration where he did everything 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.740
 technical skill has never been gone 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.890
 the best of all the colors that I have 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.280
 seen without any doubts everything with 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.280
 elegance 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.280
 but 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:08.840
 It is a summary of which my opinions 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.120
 the truth 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:18.910
 in white tells me they can not come 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:18.910
 because it has a lot of the universe 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:32.420
 and why does the title generate you how 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:36.080
 the strange production ends now 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.070
 thank you very much friends I thank you 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.270
 they also miss me and with all the 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.270
 things that they put when they are eating 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.450
 for example at this moment that my son 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.920
 fed is in san juan is watching is 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.920
 having lunch and also see the 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.670
 inscriptions good many and then in 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.670
 allusion to that program 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.270
 when I go home 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.180
 and it will not 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.080
 but the boy waits a few days of 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.970
 break 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.970
 see you in February 404
