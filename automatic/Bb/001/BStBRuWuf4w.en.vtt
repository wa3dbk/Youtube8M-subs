00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
wondering this is what I'm wearing to

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.570 
wondering this is what I'm wearing to
the<00:00:43.180> fruit<00:00:43.330> look<00:00:43.830> the<00:00:44.830> sun's<00:00:45.040> not<00:00:45.160> out<00:00:45.309> yet<00:00:45.370> but

the fruit look the sun's not out yet but

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.240 
the fruit look the sun's not out yet but
hopefully<00:00:45.790> it<00:00:46.030> will<00:00:46.150> come<00:00:46.300> out<00:00:46.420> because<00:00:47.250> this

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
hopefully it will come out because this

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.880 
hopefully it will come out because this
isn't<00:00:48.610> really<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:49.809> attire<00:00:50.200> for<00:00:50.230> cold<00:00:50.800> weather
