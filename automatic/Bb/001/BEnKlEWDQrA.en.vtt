00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.640
 omitting 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.570
 Let's start right away like expensive ones 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.100
 oatmeal gives off your banana and 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.840
 then with and egg white I have 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.040
 ever prepared taste option 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.450
 could also vary a bit 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.070
 carbohydrate hurry for example honey 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.960
 or apple nut fatty peanut butter 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.550
 or cocoa powder or if you look at it completely 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.490
 the taste will just take place 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.840
 a banana for example strawberries 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:12.070

 I would definitely do it now 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.550
 just chop a few almonds 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.590
 and on top of that they will stay 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.640
 even afterwards, on top of it looks easy 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.500
