00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:16.850 

next<00:01:09.030> we<00:01:09.150> start<00:01:09.480> the<00:01:09.600> 216<00:01:10.260> d

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.090 

and<00:01:17.280> then<00:01:17.760> we<00:01:17.910> start<00:01:18.210> our<00:01:18.330> fan<00:01:21.590> we<00:01:22.590> adjust<00:01:22.950> the

and then we start our fan we adjust the
amplitude<00:01:23.280> range<00:01:24.030> switch<00:01:25.370> and<00:01:27.020> then<00:01:28.020> we

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
amplitude range switch and then we

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.860 
amplitude range switch and then we
adjust<00:01:28.260> the<00:01:28.680> tuning<00:01:28.890> dial<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.760> 216<00:01:30.420> D<00:01:30.660> to

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
adjust the tuning dial on the 216 D to

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.540 
adjust the tuning dial on the 216 D to
make<00:01:31.050> sure<00:01:31.260> we<00:01:31.470> are<00:01:31.500> tuned<00:01:31.860> into<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.310> fan

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
make sure we are tuned into the fan

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.940 
make sure we are tuned into the fan
running<00:01:32.850> speed

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.719

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
with our selector switch on side one we

00:01:43.729 --> 00:02:02.640 
with our selector switch on side one we
read<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.150> amplitude<00:01:44.630> meter

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:09.969 

and<00:02:02.970> with<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.120> strobe<00:02:04.390> light<00:02:04.420> running

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.800 

we<00:02:10.550> now<00:02:10.759> read<00:02:11.030> our<00:02:11.239> phase<00:02:11.510> on<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.989> fan<00:02:12.230> face

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
we now read our phase on the fan face

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.360 
we now read our phase on the fan face
and<00:02:14.810> we<00:02:14.989> record<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.560> numbers<00:02:15.860> on<00:02:16.010> our<00:02:16.129> polar

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
and we record the numbers on our polar

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.910 
and we record the numbers on our polar
graph<00:02:16.640> paper

now<00:02:18.920> we<00:02:18.980> change<00:02:19.340> our<00:02:19.580> selector<00:02:20.060> switch<00:02:20.300> to

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
now we change our selector switch to

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.190 
now we change our selector switch to
side<00:02:20.780> two<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.700> we<00:02:22.700> again<00:02:23.300> read<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.690> amplitude

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
side two and we again read the amplitude

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.390 
side two and we again read the amplitude
meter

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.399 

and<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:32.329> phase<00:02:32.569> angle<00:02:32.769> and<00:02:34.810> we<00:02:35.810> record<00:02:36.230> these

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
and the phase angle and we record these

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:48.059 
and the phase angle and we record these
numbers<00:02:36.860> on<00:02:37.040> our<00:02:37.099> polar<00:02:37.610> graph<00:02:37.939> pad

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.960 

then<00:02:48.700> we<00:02:48.819> stop<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.299> fan

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.210 

and<00:02:53.060> our<00:02:53.720> polar<00:02:53.990> graph<00:02:54.320> pad<00:02:54.620> should<00:02:54.980> look

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
and our polar graph pad should look

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:08.390 
and our polar graph pad should look
approximately<00:02:55.520> like<00:02:56.000> this

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400

run<00:03:09.400> number<00:03:09.819> two<00:03:11.280> now<00:03:12.280> we<00:03:12.340> add<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.700> trial<00:03:13.120> weight

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
run number two now we add a trial weight

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:20.010 
run number two now we add a trial weight
to<00:03:13.599> side<00:03:13.900> one

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:28.870 

and<00:03:20.470> we<00:03:20.830> start<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.280> fan

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.880 

and<00:03:49.850> we<00:03:50.810> record<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.380> numbers<00:03:51.680> on<00:03:51.860> our
