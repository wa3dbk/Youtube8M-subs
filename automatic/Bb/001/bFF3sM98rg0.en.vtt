00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
that affected us away from Kyle today

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.049 
that affected us away from Kyle today
but<00:00:58.410> even<00:00:58.739> though<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.100> core<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.699> system

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
but even though the core of this system

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.549 
but even though the core of this system
is<00:01:00.180> going<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.449> remain<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:01.050> far<00:01:01.350> offshore

here's<00:01:02.489> our<00:01:02.699> problem<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:03.600> have<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.019> onshore

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
here's our problem we have the onshore

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.250 
here's our problem we have the onshore
winds<00:01:05.100> produced<00:01:05.909> by<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.150> distant<00:01:06.840> hurricane

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
and just the onshore winds is sufficient

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.950 
and just the onshore winds is sufficient
to<00:01:10.439> produce<00:01:10.619> well<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.909> flooding<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.780> we're

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
to produce well the flooding that we're

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.440
