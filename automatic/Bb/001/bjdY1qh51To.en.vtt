you<00:00:07.229> ever<00:00:07.379> noticed<00:00:07.680> that<00:00:07.740> mushrooms<00:00:08.189> kind<00:00:08.370> of

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
you ever noticed that mushrooms kind of

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.440 
you ever noticed that mushrooms kind of
almost<00:00:08.790> can<00:00:09.000> take<00:00:09.330> on<00:00:09.510> very<00:00:09.809> organ<00:00:10.260> like<00:00:10.410> if

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.140 

right<00:00:14.450> or<00:00:15.020> that<00:00:15.170> look<00:00:15.320> like<00:00:15.470> a<00:00:15.500> liver<00:00:15.860> or<00:00:16.220> like

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
right or that look like a liver or like

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.040 
right or that look like a liver or like
an<00:00:17.300> ear<00:00:18.970> we're<00:00:19.970> more<00:00:20.210> closely<00:00:20.360> related<00:00:20.779> to

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
an ear we're more closely related to

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.650 
an ear we're more closely related to
mushrooms<00:00:21.470> than<00:00:21.619> we<00:00:21.710> are<00:00:21.830> related<00:00:22.160> to<00:00:22.250> plants

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
mushrooms than we are related to plants

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.510 
mushrooms than we are related to plants
and<00:00:23.660> we<00:00:23.840> share<00:00:24.140> the<00:00:24.410> same<00:00:24.619> kind<00:00:24.920> of<00:00:25.130> immune

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
and we share the same kind of immune

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.950 
and we share the same kind of immune
system<00:00:26.180> with<00:00:27.110> them<00:00:28.360> right<00:00:29.360> so<00:00:29.540> they<00:00:29.660> have<00:00:29.840> the

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.130 
your blood they dock they land they dock
on<00:01:09.170> white<00:01:09.680> blood<00:01:09.950> cells<00:01:10.720> so<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.810> white<00:01:11.960> blood

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
on white blood cells so the white blood

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.660 
on white blood cells so the white blood
cells<00:01:12.200> have<00:01:12.470> little<00:01:12.710> receptor<00:01:13.190> sites<00:01:13.400> they're

floating around right and these guys hit
the<00:01:15.409> receptor<00:01:15.890> sites<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:16.310> they<00:01:16.670> dock<00:01:16.969> on<00:01:18.700> like

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
the receptor sites and they dock on like

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.480 
the receptor sites and they dock on like
a<00:01:19.729> lock-and-key<00:01:20.590> and<00:01:21.590> what<00:01:21.770> happens<00:01:22.159> is<00:01:22.310> the

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
a lock-and-key and what happens is the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.300 
a lock-and-key and what happens is the

there's<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.739> lot<00:02:46.769> of<00:02:47.070> specifics<00:02:47.519> in<00:02:47.640> them<00:02:47.790> you

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
there's a lot of specifics in them you

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.850 
there's a lot of specifics in them you
could<00:02:48.150> boil<00:02:48.330> something<00:02:48.720> down<00:02:49.019> particularly

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
could boil something down particularly

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.530 
could boil something down particularly
if<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.250> wanted<00:02:50.610> something<00:02:50.820> really<00:02:51.150> strong

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
if you wanted something really strong

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.000 
if you wanted something really strong
and<00:02:51.780> concentrated<00:02:52.410> like<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.620> you're<00:02:52.800> on<00:02:52.950> a

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
and concentrated like it you're on a

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.280 
and concentrated like it you're on a
serious<00:02:53.819> path<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.540> try<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.780> clean<00:02:55.050> up<00:02:55.170> your

serious path to try to clean up your

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.630 
serious path to try to clean up your
immune<00:02:55.560> system<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.069> really<00:02:56.250> want<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.519> use

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
immune system you really want to use

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.220 
immune system you really want to use
these<00:02:56.850> kind<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.150> mushrooms<00:02:57.510> mushrooms<00:02:58.080> like

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
these kind of mushrooms mushrooms like

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.199 
these kind of mushrooms mushrooms like
this<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:59.069> could<00:02:59.190> boil<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.640> down<00:02:59.819> so<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.030> was

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
this you could boil it down so that was

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.759 
this you could boil it down so that was
like<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.360> thick<00:03:00.720> sludge<00:03:01.140> that's<00:03:01.440> all<00:03:01.650> that's

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
like a thick sludge that's all that's

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.770 
like a thick sludge that's all that's
left<00:03:01.890> in<00:03:02.459> cooking<00:03:02.790> they<00:03:03.000> call<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.269> reducing

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
left in cooking they call that reducing

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.030 
left in cooking they call that reducing
something<00:03:04.140> it's<00:03:04.260> like<00:03:04.319> how<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.500> make<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.709> gravy

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
something it's like how you make a gravy

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.640 
something it's like how you make a gravy
right<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:06.239> could<00:03:06.390> reduce<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:06.840> down<00:03:06.900> until<00:03:07.530> you

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
right you could reduce it down until you

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.830 
right you could reduce it down until you
just<00:03:07.830> have<00:03:07.980> like<00:03:08.130> a<00:03:08.160> sludge<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:09.450> then<00:03:09.569> you<00:03:09.690> can

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
just have like a sludge and then you can

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.890 
just have like a sludge and then you can
take<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.050> powder<00:03:10.350> or<00:03:10.590> anything<00:03:10.800> you<00:03:11.040> can<00:03:11.220> take

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
take a powder or anything you can take

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.870 
take a powder or anything you can take
goji<00:03:12.900> powder<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.290> can<00:03:13.440> take<00:03:13.620> maca<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.670> take

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
goji powder you can take maca you take

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.120 
goji powder you can take maca you take
some<00:03:15.060> kind<00:03:15.209> of<00:03:15.269> flour<00:03:15.650> those<00:03:16.650> powders<00:03:17.010> are

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
some kind of flour those powders are

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.380 
some kind of flour those powders are
really<00:03:17.310> flowers<00:03:17.700> of<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:17.940> plant<00:03:18.150> right<00:03:18.269> it's

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
really flowers of the plant right it's

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.390 
really flowers of the plant right it's
like<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.510> like<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.870> flower<00:03:19.110> take<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.190> flower

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
like a like a flower take that flower

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.690 
like a like a flower take that flower
and<00:03:20.850> mix<00:03:21.299> it<00:03:21.420> into<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.660> sludge<00:03:22.400> so<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.459> had

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
and mix it into the sludge so you had

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.789 
and mix it into the sludge so you had
like<00:03:23.880> this<00:03:24.000> thick<00:03:24.329> paste<00:03:24.690> which<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.650> could

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
like this thick paste which you could

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.770 
like this thick paste which you could
spread<00:03:26.280> onto<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.790> dehydrator<00:03:27.360> sheets<00:03:27.600> and

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
spread onto the dehydrator sheets and

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.130 
spread onto the dehydrator sheets and
dry<00:03:28.019> out<00:03:29.239> then<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:30.360> could<00:03:30.480> either<00:03:30.630> crumble

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
dry out then you could either crumble

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.660 
dry out then you could either crumble
and<00:03:31.230> powder<00:03:31.470> that<00:03:31.680> like<00:03:31.920> maybe<00:03:32.130> drop<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.579> in

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
and powder that like maybe drop it in

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.340 
and powder that like maybe drop it in
