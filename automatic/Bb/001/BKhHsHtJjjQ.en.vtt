what typically you are your own natural
hair<00:02:50.870> would<00:02:51.020> typically<00:02:51.350> shed<00:02:51.740> so<00:02:52.130> I<00:02:52.430> still

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
hair would typically shed so I still

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.030 
hair would typically shed so I still
would<00:02:53.390> not<00:02:53.420> steal<00:02:53.810> my<00:02:53.840> wet<00:02:54.200> if<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:54.620> purchased
