00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
there coming in at number four we have

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.889 
there coming in at number four we have
brenybeast<00:00:33.710> and<00:00:34.710> he<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.280> actually<00:00:35.730> building<00:00:36.630> a

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
brenybeast and he is actually building a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.069 
brenybeast and he is actually building a
piston<00:00:37.469> circuit<00:00:38.219> which<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.969> triggered<00:00:39.930> by<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
piston circuit which is triggered by a

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.350 
piston circuit which is triggered by a
wooden<00:00:40.649> pressure<00:00:40.920> plate<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:42.180> is

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
wooden pressure plate and it is

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.560 
wooden pressure plate and it is
basically<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:43.110> secret<00:00:43.890> door<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.370> i<00:00:45.120> think<00:00:45.420> it's

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
basically a secret door and i think it's

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.529 
basically a secret door and i think it's
pretty<00:00:45.780> epic<00:00:46.399> thumbs<00:00:47.399> up<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.910> do<00:00:48.090> as<00:00:48.270> well

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
coming in at number three we have the

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.990 
coming in at number three we have the
black<00:00:57.829> belt<00:00:58.129> panda<00:00:58.610> building<00:00:59.120> and<00:00:59.420> igloo<00:01:01.000> that

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
black belt panda building and igloo that

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.289 
black belt panda building and igloo that
really<00:01:02.420> does<00:01:02.750> work<00:01:03.050> and<00:01:03.440> apart<00:01:03.769> from<00:01:03.860> is<00:01:04.299> HD

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
really does work and apart from is HD

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.999 
really does work and apart from is HD
texture<00:01:06.020> pack<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:07.690> build<00:01:08.690> really<00:01:09.049> is<00:01:09.380> epic

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
texture pack the build really is epic

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.740 
texture pack the build really is epic
and<00:01:10.130> i<00:01:10.250> think<00:01:10.550> i<00:01:10.670> will<00:01:10.850> actually<00:01:11.300> build<00:01:11.509> one

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
and i think i will actually build one

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.560 
and i think i will actually build one
myself<00:01:11.920> once<00:01:12.920> I<00:01:13.810> do<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:15.350> Survival<00:01:15.950> Series
