to come out of the carrier on their own

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.220 
to come out of the carrier on their own
or<00:01:28.770> not<00:01:28.890> hiding<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.970> an<00:01:30.150> important<00:01:30.750> coping

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
or not hiding is an important coping

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.950

strategy for the cat so it's important

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.840 
strategy for the cat so it's important

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
to allow them to stay in the bottom half

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.300 
to allow them to stay in the bottom half
of<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.090> carrier<00:01:36.510> or<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.230> have<00:01:37.410> a<00:01:37.440> towel<00:01:37.830> to

of the carrier or to have a towel to
cover<00:01:38.550> them<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.210> they<00:01:39.330> can<00:01:39.390> feel<00:01:39.750> hidden

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
cover them so that they can feel hidden

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.620 
cover them so that they can feel hidden
cats<00:01:40.860> don't<00:01:41.100> like<00:01:41.280> anyone<00:01:41.760> steering<00:01:42.420> or

cats don't like anyone steering or
looming<00:01:43.020> over<00:01:43.350> them<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.800> it's<00:01:43.950> important<00:01:44.310> to

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
looming over them so it's important to

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.150 
looming over them so it's important to
come<00:01:44.580> from<00:01:44.730> behind<00:01:44.970> or<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.720> side<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:47.010> do
