is that it's actually a little bit

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.430 
is that it's actually a little bit
different<00:01:01.449> than<00:01:01.569> the<00:01:01.659> other<00:01:01.839> vapor<00:01:02.170> eights

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
different than the other vapor eights

there's also been a lot of rumors

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.320 
there's also been a lot of rumors
floating<00:01:36.190> around<00:01:36.370> that<00:01:36.670> this<00:01:36.790> is<00:01:36.970> actually<00:01:37.300> a

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
floating around that this is actually a

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.360 
floating around that this is actually a
completely<00:01:37.780> different<00:01:38.080> material<00:01:38.170> than<00:01:38.740> the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
completely different material than the

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.400 
completely different material than the
launch<00:01:39.580> vapor<00:01:39.820> rates<00:01:40.090> that's<00:01:40.750> not<00:01:41.020> true<00:01:41.260> at

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
launch vapor rates that's not true at

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.380 
launch vapor rates that's not true at
all<00:01:41.440> the<00:01:42.130> only<00:01:42.400> difference<00:01:42.730> is<00:01:42.850> to<00:01:42.970> finish<00:01:43.240> on

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
all the only difference is to finish on

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.930 
all the only difference is to finish on
the<00:01:43.510> outside<00:01:43.540> so<00:01:44.110> instead<00:01:44.380> of<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.940> suede

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
the outside so instead of the suede

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.800 
the outside so instead of the suede
finish<00:01:46.150> you<00:01:46.420> have<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.720> faux<00:01:46.900> leather<00:01:46.930> finish

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
finish you have the faux leather finish

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.420 
finish you have the faux leather finish
thus<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:50.170> synthetic<00:01:50.380> upper<00:01:50.860> on<00:01:50.980> this<00:01:51.160> shoe<00:01:51.310> is

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
thus the synthetic upper on this shoe is

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.420 
thus the synthetic upper on this shoe is
basically<00:01:51.910> a<00:01:52.290> super<00:01:53.290> thin<00:01:53.620> tasian<00:01:54.010> synthetic

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
basically a super thin tasian synthetic

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.580 
basically a super thin tasian synthetic
upper<00:01:55.240> you<00:01:55.690> can<00:01:55.810> see<00:01:55.930> my<00:01:56.050> finger<00:01:56.409> actually

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
upper you can see my finger actually

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.500 
upper you can see my finger actually
pushing<00:01:57.100> through<00:01:57.280> here<00:01:57.490> it's<00:01:57.610> super<00:01:57.909> thin<00:01:58.300> and

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
pushing through here it's super thin and

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.899 
pushing through here it's super thin and
what's<00:01:59.500> basically<00:01:59.800> unique<00:02:00.280> about<00:02:00.490> this<00:02:00.670> clash

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
what's basically unique about this clash

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.510 
what's basically unique about this clash
collection<00:02:01.390> is<00:02:01.810> you<00:02:01.960> have<00:02:02.110> this<00:02:02.260> RGB<00:02:02.830> right

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
collection is you have this RGB right

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.700 
collection is you have this RGB right
here<00:02:03.760> on<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.780> back<00:02:04.930> it's<00:02:05.110> really<00:02:05.350> hard<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:05.590> see

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
here on the back it's really hard to see

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.340 
here on the back it's really hard to see
on<00:02:05.740> camera<00:02:05.909> basically<00:02:06.909> RGB<00:02:07.630> is<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:07.780> color<00:02:08.080> code

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
on camera basically RGB is a color code

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.710 
on camera basically RGB is a color code
so<00:02:08.530> R<00:02:08.740> stands<00:02:09.069> for<00:02:09.160> red<00:02:09.429> G<00:02:09.729> stands<00:02:10.000> for<00:02:10.090> green<00:02:10.360> d

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
so R stands for red G stands for green d

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.540 
so R stands for red G stands for green d
stands<00:02:10.990> for<00:02:11.110> blue<00:02:11.380> so<00:02:11.950> if<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.100> actually<00:02:12.250> go

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
stands for blue so if you actually go

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.440 
stands for blue so if you actually go
into<00:02:12.790> your<00:02:12.910> like<00:02:13.090> Microsoft<00:02:13.540> painters

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
into your like Microsoft painters

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.970 
into your like Microsoft painters
or<00:02:14.660> even<00:02:15.020> go<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.140> like<00:02:15.350> a<00:02:15.380> Home<00:02:15.590> Depot<00:02:15.950> or

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
or even go to like a Home Depot or

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.650 
or even go to like a Home Depot or
something<00:02:16.310> like<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:16.850> give<00:02:17.420> them<00:02:17.540> this

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
something like that and give them this

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.330 
something like that and give them this
color<00:02:17.930> code<00:02:18.230> they<00:02:18.800> could<00:02:18.950> actually<00:02:19.069> create

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
color code they could actually create

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.520 
color code they could actually create
the<00:02:19.550> paint<00:02:19.790> for<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.140> exactly<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.380> this

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
the paint for you exactly in this

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.930 
the paint for you exactly in this
matching<00:02:22.100> color<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:22.910> our<00:02:23.150> is<00:02:23.390> 255<00:02:24.020> G<00:02:24.800> is<00:02:24.950> 0<00:02:25.250> B<00:02:25.790> is

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
matching color so our is 255 G is 0 B is

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.150 
matching color so our is 255 G is 0 B is
128<00:02:26.480> so<00:02:27.080> it's<00:02:27.200> kind<00:02:27.350> of<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.470> cool<00:02:27.650> little<00:02:27.860> thing

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
128 so it's kind of a cool little thing

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.340 
128 so it's kind of a cool little thing
that<00:02:28.340> they<00:02:28.459> chose<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.760> do<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.240> little<00:02:30.230> bit

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
that they chose to do a little bit

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.110 
that they chose to do a little bit
unique<00:02:30.470> basically<00:02:31.370> splits<00:02:31.640> in<00:02:31.760> half<00:02:31.790> from

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
unique basically splits in half from

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.479 
unique basically splits in half from
this<00:02:32.300> white<00:02:32.569> to<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:32.989> it's<00:02:33.650> more<00:02:33.860> of<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.160> I

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
this white to this it's more of a I

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.970 
this white to this it's more of a I
guess<00:02:34.970> you<00:02:35.120> could<00:02:35.239> say<00:02:35.270> a<00:02:35.560> dark<00:02:36.560> pink<00:02:36.890> color

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
guess you could say a dark pink color

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.180 
guess you could say a dark pink color
rather<00:02:37.550> than<00:02:37.880> a<00:02:37.910> red<00:02:38.680> but<00:02:39.680> definitely<00:02:40.010> not<00:02:40.130> a

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
rather than a red but definitely not a

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.580 
rather than a red but definitely not a
super<00:02:40.819> flamboyant<00:02:41.300> pink<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.050> guess<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.410> could

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
super flamboyant pink I guess you could

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.150 
super flamboyant pink I guess you could
say<00:02:42.850> as<00:02:43.850> far<00:02:44.000> as<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.209> soul<00:02:44.390> goes<00:02:44.600> on<00:02:44.810> this<00:02:44.930> you

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
say as far as the soul goes on this you

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.370 
say as far as the soul goes on this you
you<00:02:46.550> basically<00:02:46.730> have<00:02:47.030> what<00:02:47.870> is<00:02:47.959> a<00:02:48.140> pretty

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
you basically have what is a pretty

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.080 
you basically have what is a pretty
unique<00:02:48.709> firm<00:02:49.010> ground<00:02:49.280> soleplate<00:02:49.610> you<00:02:50.000> have

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
unique firm ground soleplate you have

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.900 
unique firm ground soleplate you have
the<00:02:50.239> glass<00:02:50.450> fiber<00:02:50.750> soleplate<00:02:51.230> with<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.370> dual

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
the glass fiber soleplate with the dual

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.970 
the glass fiber soleplate with the dual
layer<00:02:53.209> glass<00:02:53.510> fiber<00:02:53.810> in<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.230> in<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.620> forefoot

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
layer glass fiber in the in the forefoot

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.680 
layer glass fiber in the in the forefoot
and<00:02:55.130> heel<00:02:55.160> area<00:02:55.430> with<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.209> single<00:02:56.510> layer<00:02:56.660> and

and heel area with the single layer and

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.809 
and heel area with the single layer and
in<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.440> forefoot<00:02:57.980> just<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.340> keep<00:02:58.489> it<00:02:58.640> nice<00:02:58.760> and

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
in the forefoot just to keep it nice and

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.120 
in the forefoot just to keep it nice and
flexible<00:02:59.390> but<00:03:00.380> basically<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:00.800> have<00:03:00.830> two

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
flexible but basically you have two

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.100 
flexible but basically you have two
studs<00:03:01.430> in<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:01.640> back<00:03:01.819> which<00:03:02.569> is<00:03:02.600> really<00:03:02.930> unique

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
studs in the back which is really unique

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.990 
studs in the back which is really unique
for<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:03.380> firm<00:03:03.620> ground<00:03:03.860> side<00:03:04.069> pattern<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.880> you

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
for a firm ground side pattern and you

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.850 
for a firm ground side pattern and you
essentially<00:03:05.390> have<00:03:05.660> what<00:03:05.870> is<00:03:05.959> four<00:03:06.260> studs<00:03:06.650> in

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
essentially have what is four studs in

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.620 
essentially have what is four studs in
the<00:03:06.950> front<00:03:07.190> so<00:03:07.580> basically<00:03:07.910> on<00:03:08.060> a<00:03:08.090> six<00:03:08.390> stud

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
the front so basically on a six stud

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.570 
the front so basically on a six stud
firm<00:03:08.930> ground<00:03:09.200> stud<00:03:09.440> pattern<00:03:09.769> which<00:03:10.400> is<00:03:10.430> a

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
firm ground stud pattern which is a

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.800 
firm ground stud pattern which is a
little<00:03:10.819> bit<00:03:10.910> unique<00:03:11.030> but<00:03:11.300> it<00:03:11.420> really<00:03:11.660> does

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
little bit unique but it really does

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.540 
little bit unique but it really does
work<00:03:11.989> well<00:03:12.230> I<00:03:12.470> have<00:03:12.890> already<00:03:13.130> tested<00:03:13.280> the

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
work well I have already tested the
