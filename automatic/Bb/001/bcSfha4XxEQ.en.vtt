always<00:01:57.010> think<00:01:57.220> wow<00:01:57.580> that'd<00:01:57.970> be<00:01:58.090> cool<00:01:58.360> really

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
always think wow that'd be cool really

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.160 
always think wow that'd be cool really
use<00:01:58.870> this<00:01:59.050> or<00:01:59.350> that<00:01:59.530> but<00:02:00.600> there's<00:02:01.600> that<00:02:01.780> fear

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
use this or that but there's that fear

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.080 
use this or that but there's that fear
that<00:02:02.380> kind<00:02:02.590> of<00:02:02.650> creep<00:02:02.890> sentence<00:02:03.310> like<00:02:03.580> all<00:02:03.850> its

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
that kind of creep sentence like all its

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.490 
that kind of creep sentence like all its
computers<00:02:04.570> though<00:02:04.750> it<00:02:04.960> something's<00:02:05.320> going<00:02:05.470> to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
computers though it something's going to

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.780 
computers though it something's going to
get<00:02:05.619> screwed<00:02:05.860> up<00:02:05.979> into<00:02:06.250> something's<00:02:06.550> like<00:02:06.640> I

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
get screwed up into something's like I

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.820 
get screwed up into something's like I
work<00:02:07.000> I<00:02:07.210> don't<00:02:07.690> know<00:02:07.750> how<00:02:07.900> to<00:02:07.960> you<00:02:08.500> know<00:02:08.530> make

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
work I don't know how to you know make

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.650 
work I don't know how to you know make
the<00:02:08.890> latency<00:02:09.550> right<00:02:09.880> and<00:02:10.149> all<00:02:10.209> that<00:02:10.360> stuff<00:02:10.509> so

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
the latency right and all that stuff so

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.270 
the latency right and all that stuff so
it's<00:02:11.380> just<00:02:11.500> always<00:02:11.680> been<00:02:11.830> something<00:02:12.130> that

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
it's just always been something that

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.460 
it's just always been something that
it's<00:02:12.490> kind<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:12.730> just<00:02:13.510> made<00:02:13.810> me<00:02:13.959> stay<00:02:14.200> away<00:02:14.410> from

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
it's kind of just made me stay away from

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.420 
it's kind of just made me stay away from
computers<00:02:15.190> so<00:02:15.970> I've<00:02:16.330> always<00:02:16.930> used<00:02:17.430> external

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
computers so I've always used external

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.260 
computers so I've always used external
things<00:02:19.290> but<00:02:20.290> now<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:21.100> know<00:02:21.250> with<00:02:21.670> my<00:02:21.820> new<00:02:22.000> role

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
things but now you know with my new role

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.990 
things but now you know with my new role
in<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.660> TV<00:02:22.900> 9<00:02:23.170> KX<00:02:23.590> 2<00:02:23.860> kit<00:02:24.190> I'm<00:02:24.400> really<00:02:24.730> excited

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
in the TV 9 KX 2 kit I'm really excited

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.500 
in the TV 9 KX 2 kit I'm really excited
about<00:02:25.209> using<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.750> as<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.680> controller<00:02:27.520> to

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
about using that as a controller to

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.090 
about using that as a controller to
control<00:02:28.540> many<00:02:29.500> drums<00:02:30.100> inside<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:31.570> a<00:02:32.500> dog<00:02:32.530> I

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
control many drums inside of a dog I

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.030 
control many drums inside of a dog I
really<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.060> really<00:02:34.510> like<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.380> I've<00:02:35.620> tried<00:02:35.920> to

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
really I really like that I've tried to

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.530 
really I really like that I've tried to
do<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.250> before<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.820> latency<00:02:37.209> was<00:02:37.360> just

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
do it before and the latency was just

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.570 
do it before and the latency was just
screwed<00:02:37.750> up<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.410> basically<00:02:38.830> my<00:02:38.950> question<00:02:39.489> is

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
screwed up so basically my question is

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.080 
screwed up so basically my question is
this<00:02:39.720> is<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:41.320> true<00:02:41.739> is<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.070> true<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.820> max

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
this is it true is it true the max

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.140 
this is it true is it true the max
better<00:02:43.450> for<00:02:43.720> those<00:02:43.840> things<00:02:44.200> or<00:02:45.100> is<00:02:45.670> a

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
better for those things or is a

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.540 
better for those things or is a
high-performance<00:02:46.570> pc<00:02:47.380> just<00:02:47.680> going<00:02:47.830> to<00:02:47.890> do<00:02:48.070> is

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
high-performance pc just going to do is

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.260 
high-performance pc just going to do is
that<00:02:49.360> going<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.570> be<00:02:49.600> just<00:02:49.870> as<00:02:50.080> good<00:02:51.120> what<00:02:52.120> I<00:02:52.150> do

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
that going to be just as good what I do

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.199 
that going to be just as good what I do
like<00:02:52.600> also<00:02:52.959> about<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.320> new<00:02:53.440> max<00:02:53.739> is<00:02:54.130> just<00:02:54.489> the

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
like also about the new max is just the

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.330 
like also about the new max is just the
fact<00:02:55.450> that<00:02:55.570> everything<00:02:56.019> if<00:02:56.530> Matt<00:02:56.860> kind<00:02:57.280> of

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
fact that everything if Matt kind of

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.720 
fact that everything if Matt kind of
works<00:02:57.549> together<00:02:57.820> I<00:02:58.350> like<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.470> idea<00:02:59.620> that<00:03:00.100> if

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
works together I like the idea that if

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.530 
works together I like the idea that if
you<00:03:00.910> have<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.120> macbook<00:03:01.420> pro<00:03:01.959> I<00:03:02.290> saw<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.640> was<00:03:04.030> at<00:03:04.480> a

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
you have a macbook pro I saw I was at a

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.900 
you have a macbook pro I saw I was at a
church<00:03:04.810> service<00:03:05.049> one<00:03:05.350> time<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.459> pastor

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
church service one time and the pastor

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.030 
church service one time and the pastor
had<00:03:07.060> his<00:03:07.180> iPhone<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:07.900> he<00:03:08.560> was<00:03:08.709> controlling

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
had his iPhone and he was controlling

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.290 
had his iPhone and he was controlling
his<00:03:09.459> own<00:03:09.610> slides<00:03:10.030> on<00:03:10.600> his<00:03:11.140> macbook

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
his own slides on his macbook

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.600 
his own slides on his macbook
and<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.320> like<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.010> I'll<00:03:14.100> probably<00:03:14.340> end

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
and so I like that and I'll probably end

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.400 
and so I like that and I'll probably end
up<00:03:14.730> getting<00:03:15.000> an<00:03:15.090> iphone<00:03:15.420> 5<00:03:15.750> if<00:03:16.050> that<00:03:16.200> ever

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
up getting an iphone 5 if that ever

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.370 
up getting an iphone 5 if that ever
comes<00:03:16.440> out<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:17.070> like<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.270> last<00:03:18.960> couple<00:03:19.140> weeks

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
comes out I like the last couple weeks

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.080 
comes out I like the last couple weeks
I'm<00:03:19.530> going<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.710> listen<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.520> all<00:03:20.610> these<00:03:20.730> YouTube

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
I'm going to listen to all these YouTube

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.450 
I'm going to listen to all these YouTube
videos<00:03:21.120> about<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:22.020> speculation<00:03:22.710> of<00:03:22.830> what's

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
videos about the speculation of what's

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.770 
videos about the speculation of what's
going<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.700> be<00:03:23.790> in<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:23.970> new<00:03:24.060> macbook<00:03:24.300> pro

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
going to be in the new macbook pro

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.200 
going to be in the new macbook pro
what's<00:03:25.710> going<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:25.920> be<00:03:26.070> in<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.280> new<00:03:26.430> iphone<00:03:26.880> you

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
what's going to be in the new iphone you

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.420 
what's going to be in the new iphone you
know<00:03:27.330> whatever<00:03:27.740> and<00:03:28.740> I<00:03:28.800> think<00:03:28.860> that<00:03:29.340> I'm

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
know whatever and I think that I'm

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.760 
know whatever and I think that I'm
leaning<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:30.180> way<00:03:30.360> I've<00:03:31.140> already<00:03:31.320> begun<00:03:31.620> to

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
leaning that way I've already begun to

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.000 
leaning that way I've already begun to
sell<00:03:31.980> off<00:03:32.130> some<00:03:32.160> gear<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:33.450> I<00:03:34.110> think<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.710> can<00:03:34.860> do

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
sell off some gear that I think I can do

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.030 
sell off some gear that I think I can do
without<00:03:35.990> so<00:03:36.990> I<00:03:37.020> think<00:03:37.170> I<00:03:37.410> think<00:03:37.770> it's<00:03:37.890> going<00:03:37.980> to

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
without so I think I think it's going to

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.750 
without so I think I think it's going to
be<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.280> macbook<00:03:38.670> pro<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.750> new<00:03:39.960> edition<00:03:40.470> of

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
be the macbook pro the new edition of

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.610 
be the macbook pro the new edition of
2012<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.090> now<00:03:42.270> my<00:03:42.690> question<00:03:42.750> like<00:03:43.440> I've<00:03:43.590> said

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
2012 and now my question like I've said

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.950 
2012 and now my question like I've said
it<00:03:43.860> a<00:03:43.920> couple<00:03:43.950> times<00:03:44.220> already<00:03:44.580> is<00:03:45.180> that<00:03:45.840> the

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
it a couple times already is that the

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.510 
it a couple times already is that the
way<00:03:46.080> to<00:03:46.110> go<00:03:46.350> do<00:03:46.650> you<00:03:46.800> think<00:03:47.070> that's<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.370> way<00:03:47.400> to
