00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.410
 if you were wondering about the vitamin a b 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.960
 the c the d o the e 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.620
 who else or who least speak to 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.520
 who they are or where they are but if 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:20.900
 we asked ourselves about vitamin k 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:24.180
 some would not know that there is 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.640
 welcome to the reef 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.310
 It is normal that there are people who do not know about 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.560
 the existence of vitamin ka weigh 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.600
 that it was discovered in 1935 and that 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.910
 it is because it is very rare that we have 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.100
 deficiency in this vitamin since it is 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.160
 of the few that the body can 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.280
 store however this is 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.820
 starting to change and that's because of 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.090
 misuse of antibiotics 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.690
 the vitamin k despite not being very 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.750
 known is essential as it acts 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.780
 in the manufacture of red blood cells 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.150
 proteins and especially present in the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.580
 coagulation process 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.340
 without it we would do blood 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.290
 this until now was not greater 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.630
 problem because when stored in the 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.830
 body there have always been good reservations 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.140
 of this vitamin in our body 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.080
 but the abusive use of antibiotics is 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.540
 causing that cases are appearing 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.060
 vitamin k deficiency 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.800
 this vitamin is made by the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.470
 bacteria that inhabit our tract 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.680
 intestinal is what is known as 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.230
 intestinal flora without them without these 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.050
 bacteria we would not have the ability to 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.610
 absorb the vitamin k that we ingest 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.890
 through food antibiotics 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.950
 they kill bacteria but they do not 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.070
 distinguish between good and bad if they are 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.290
 within its spectrum of action the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.070
 remove 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.470
 as well as the misuse of antibiotics 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.570
 has caused these to create resistance 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.200
 new generations of antibiotics are 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.780
 more and more powerful with which they attack 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.620
 indiscriminately to more types of 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:23.030
 bacteria including beneficial ones 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.580
 that's why every time we use antibiotics 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.909
 we eliminate intestinal flora said of 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.000
 otherwise we are running out of 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.830
 good bacteria logically if they go down 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.340
 the colonies of bacteria in the flora 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:42.360
 intestinal with it will lower the capacity 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.409
 absorption of vitamin k therefore 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.290
 every time we are taking 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:49.829
 antibiotics we will have to implement the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.120
 taking vitamin k to compensate for the 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:55.030
 absorption deficit 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.769
 for this we indicate the seven 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:03.760
 foods with more vitamin k1 for each 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:06.659
 day of the week first and with 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.340
 a lot of vitamin k the cabbage 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.950
 100 grams of this vegetable gives us the 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.829
 vitamin k for a whole week and that is 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.989
 contains neither more nor less more than a thousand 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:22.030
 percent of the daily amount 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:24.790
 recommended chives just a few 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.410
 that we eat will solve the problem 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.819
 since they contain 252 percent of the 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.930
 Recommended daily allowance 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.219
 Brussels sprouts only 100 grams 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.849
 we will accumulate vitamin for more than two 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:44.840
 days since 100 grams contribute 242 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:47.379
 percent of the recommended daily amount 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.099
 Broccoli once again on our list 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:54.720
 this vegetable contains 176 percent 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:58.830
 of the recommended daily amount 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:02.070
 Asparagus 100 grams contain a 95 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.540
 percent of what we should take from 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.840
 vitamin k 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.060
 pickles with the same amount as 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.420
 asparagus but easier to consume 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:16.139
 for the little ones in the house and 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:20.190
 finally the parsley this herb 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:22.650
 aromatic will provide us 83% of the 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.040
 amount that we need 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.040
 as you see different foods for 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.930
 different days of the week 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.810
 for those people who are 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.840
 taking anticoagulants tell you that the 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.810
 Vitamin K will not come so well 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.760
 You must be attentive to not past in your 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.560
 consumption 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.480
 I hope these tips are from 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.780
 your help and I encourage you to
