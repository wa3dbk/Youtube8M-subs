00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
of the features of this board so this

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.700 
of the features of this board so this
board<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.590> 28<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.580> 3/4<00:00:36.450> inch<00:00:36.690> long<00:00:36.990> and<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.620> a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
ones just great for cruising around and
then<00:01:12.330> you've<00:01:12.450> got<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> little<00:01:12.690> bit<00:01:12.840> smaller

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
then you've got a little bit smaller

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.180 
then you've got a little bit smaller
wheels<00:01:13.440> you've<00:01:13.770> got<00:01:13.890> fifty<00:01:14.250> nine<00:01:14.400> millimeter

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
wheels you've got fifty nine millimeter

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.520 
wheels you've got fifty nine millimeter
78<00:01:17.190> a<00:01:17.430> offset<00:01:18.210> nine<00:01:18.390> ball<00:01:18.659> wheels<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.380> instead

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
78 a offset nine ball wheels so instead

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.719 
78 a offset nine ball wheels so instead
of<00:01:19.590> having<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:19.979> bearings<00:01:20.310> kind<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.520> line<00:01:20.640> up

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
of having the bearings kind of line up

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.100 
of having the bearings kind of line up
right<00:01:20.940> in<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.120> middle<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.479> wheel<00:01:21.630> they're

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
right in the middle of the wheel they're

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.630 
right in the middle of the wheel they're
offset<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.530> bit<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.770> believe<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.250> creates<00:01:23.580> a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
offset a bit I believe it just creates a

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.760 
offset a bit I believe it just creates a
little<00:01:23.760> bit<00:01:23.880> bigger<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:25.020> not<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> wheel<00:01:25.530> base

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
little bit bigger it's not a wheel base

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.320 
little bit bigger it's not a wheel base
but<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.400> wheels<00:01:26.640> are<00:01:26.760> set<00:01:26.909> apart<00:01:27.180> a

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
but like the wheels are set apart a

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.820 
but like the wheels are set apart a
little<00:01:27.420> bit<00:01:27.630> further<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.380> gives<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.650> more

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
little bit further so gives it more

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.820 
little bit further so gives it more
stability<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:30.600> between<00:01:30.870> the<00:01:31.290> trucks<00:01:31.590> and

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
stability and the between the trucks and

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.370 
stability and the between the trucks and
the<00:01:32.220> board<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:33.000> quarter<00:01:33.630> inch<00:01:33.659> riser<00:01:34.110> pad

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
the board is a quarter inch riser pad

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.620 
the board is a quarter inch riser pad
this<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:35.010> gives<00:01:35.190> you<00:01:35.250> some<00:01:35.400> space<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.299> you're

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
this just gives you some space so you're

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.880 
this just gives you some space so you're
not<00:01:36.690> going<00:01:36.870> to<00:01:36.930> wheel<00:01:37.080> bite<00:01:37.260> if<00:01:37.470> you're<00:01:37.590> really

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
not going to wheel bite if you're really

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.430 
not going to wheel bite if you're really
