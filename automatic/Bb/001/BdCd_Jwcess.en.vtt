like<00:00:43.680> 15<00:00:44.040> different<00:00:44.190> cities<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.210> see<00:00:45.710> one

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
like 15 different cities and we see one

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.799 
like 15 different cities and we see one
seven<00:00:47.129> hundred<00:00:47.460> answers<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.270> those<00:00:48.510> different

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
seven hundred answers in those different

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.990 
seven hundred answers in those different
cities<00:00:49.260> between<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.160> three<00:00:50.520> groups<00:00:50.820> that

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
cities between the three groups that

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.770 
cities between the three groups that
maybe<00:00:51.590> 70<00:00:52.699> dancers<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.000> beginning<00:00:54.600> when

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
maybe 70 dancers in the beginning when

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.750 
maybe 70 dancers in the beginning when
they<00:00:54.960> come<00:00:55.230> here<00:00:55.440> they<00:00:55.890> come<00:00:56.160> from<00:00:56.399> different

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
they come here they come from different

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.020 
they come here they come from different
backgrounds<00:00:57.629> different<00:00:57.809> school<00:00:58.710> and

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
backgrounds different school and

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.080 
backgrounds different school and
different<00:01:00.030> training<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.350> we'd<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.090> unify

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
different training so we'd like to unify

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.000 
different training so we'd like to unify
them<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:03.780> much<00:01:04.229> as<00:01:04.409> possible

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
them as much as possible

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.609 
them as much as possible
so<00:01:05.280> when<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:05.700> get<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> point<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.659> core

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
so when we get to the point to core

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.250 
so when we get to the point to core
graphic<00:01:08.010> pieces<00:01:08.280> there<00:01:08.939> they<00:01:09.330> look<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:10.140> know

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
graphic pieces there they look you know

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.830 
graphic pieces there they look you know
together<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.490> like<00:01:11.760> six<00:01:12.090> shows<00:01:12.510> they

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
together so it's like six shows they

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.840 
together so it's like six shows they
have<00:01:13.020> three<00:01:13.409> galas<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.040> then<00:01:14.400> they<00:01:14.520> have<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
have three galas and then they have the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.640 
have three galas and then they have the
core<00:01:15.090> graphic<00:01:15.390> workshop<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.140> they<00:01:16.290> really

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
core graphic workshop so they really

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.679 
core graphic workshop so they really
need<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.250> shape<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:18.240> can<00:01:18.420> see<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
need to be on shape you can see a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.770 
need to be on shape you can see a
tremendous<00:01:19.290> difference<00:01:20.420> between<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> first

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
tremendous difference between the first

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.690 
tremendous difference between the first

another<00:01:48.380> amazing<00:01:49.100> thing<00:01:49.369> about<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.880> program

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
another amazing thing about the program

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.410 
another amazing thing about the program
is<00:01:50.390> that<00:01:50.600> they<00:01:50.899> not<00:01:51.049> only<00:01:51.380> get<00:01:51.560> to<00:01:52.420> perform

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
is that they not only get to perform

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.270 
is that they not only get to perform
themselves<00:01:54.049> they<00:01:54.200> get<00:01:54.350> to<00:01:54.500> be<00:01:54.680> a<00:01:54.710> professional

themselves they get to be a professional
company<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:56.090> see<00:01:56.479> what<00:01:56.899> it's<00:01:57.049> going<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:57.320> be

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:58.810 
company and see what it's going to be
like<00:01:57.619> because<00:01:58.039> a<00:01:58.070> lot<00:01:58.250> of<00:01:58.369> them<00:01:58.490> don't<00:01:58.700> go<00:01:58.759> to

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820
