00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 some amazing cases of samba and san 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.099
 Martin was a cold autumn like so many 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.980
 others in boulogne-sur-mer the days are 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.980
 they made very long lengths until 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.300
 dear ones 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.910
 here is your visit a new case 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.470
 to solve I need your help 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.470
 welcome sr 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.869
 Argentine dramatist and journalist how 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.850
 I can help you, lady, they stole my 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.030
 manuscript of my first novel the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.280
 rabid toy the rabid toy 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.800
 weird do not worry lady what 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.420
 we will help to recover it we go both 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.420
 we must solve this case 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.970
 I found this sheet so strange 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.449
 among my notes, it surpasses crow 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.980
 overcome second person singular 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:01.109
 diminutive tummy of the noun 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.259
 of the verb to occur first person of the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.390
 singular it seems that our suspect 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:10.080
 es español don jose nobody in america 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.509
 says alert and we say alert 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.429
 I think it appears like that because of the cultivation 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.000
 we must pay attention to the letters 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:20.400
 see well of course here is hidden 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.460
 the answer are anagrams 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.280
 anagram samba are words that are 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.180
 form changing the order of the letters of 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.180
 the same word 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.289
 sanmartín we can look for the grass of 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:38.210
 this book we went to that is the 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.210
 dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:46.299
 that is another key now we know that it is 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.299
 a capital 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.909
 the culprit wrote with pen but this 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.440
 it is not a pen any is a pen 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.440
 of clear peacock 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:07.000
 I will never be discovered, it 's safe, captain 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.000
 realistic 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.590
 it's not true capital realizes our 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.260
 logic revealed that changing order 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.630
 letters formed the word batteries 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.770
 I say realistic 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.770
 what samba 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.690
 do not worry don jose what's important is 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.180
 that solved the case and I recover my 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.709
 precious 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.709
 sanmartín is a man of his word
