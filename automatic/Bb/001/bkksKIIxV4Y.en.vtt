going<00:01:18.750> into<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.170> headwind<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.740> then<00:01:20.720> from

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
going into the headwind and then from

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.420 
going into the headwind and then from
snapper<00:01:22.350> into<00:01:22.620> the<00:01:22.740> alley<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.010> ploy<00:01:23.190> didn't

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
snapper into the alley a ploy didn't

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.010 
snapper into the alley a ploy didn't
take<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.670> best<00:01:23.850> liner<00:01:24.090> may<00:01:24.420> have<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.840> come

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
take the best liner may have just come

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.540 
take the best liner may have just come
in<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.200> little<00:01:25.320> bit<00:01:25.530> too<00:01:25.650> close<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.070> think<00:01:26.100> Torian

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
in a little bit too close I think Torian

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.250 
in a little bit too close I think Torian
took<00:01:26.730> a<00:01:26.760> better<00:01:26.970> line<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.480> was<00:01:27.960> kind<00:01:28.140> of
