00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.580
 well that's it everybody's people 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.080
 senque this goal I hope you go 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.939
 well in any case me it's great and we 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.680
 finds himself today for the challenge 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.920
 number 13 of a subscriber who was me 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.970
 proposed by x smg bull back he got me everything 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.560
 simply ask to make a 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.869
 no-fault in arms game so what 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.920
 equals to make wine 0 that's all 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.450
 simply zero wine that is to say 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.309
 to chain weapons all weapons 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.260
 of this mode without getting killed I 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.210
 recalls that he has 20 tarn and that 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.460
 ends with the ballistic knife 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.860
 preceded last before the crossbow 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.469
 so two last weapons very difficult 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.370
 to manage and down to do business kiel 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.920
 with that's it 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.210
 it's a big difficulty you're going 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.610
 see that the enemies in the game 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.500
 was not good no he was not 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.120
 necessarily good that's true what iena a 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.469
 moment he's going spawn right next to me 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.460
 but he will not kill me I do not want the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.020
 see I 'll tell you just now 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.430
 so I will not start topics 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.899
 special today since you 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.309
 have seen the video is quite short 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.290
 so maybe I succeed them 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.390
 maybe not to you are going to find out 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.770
 so here I am going to comment on the gameplay 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.420
 just one for once we're going 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.159
 change of habits so here I go 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.630
 rather temporize in this in this 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.909
 region beyond the wave so we are him 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.320
 frozen not specified on standoff and so 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.820
 here I am going to stay in dancer in 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.950
 this little warehouse there I want to say 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.420
 to properly delay and then in addition to 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.740
 spawn are just next there 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.810
 unfair in the corner where I'm just 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.479
 right then yann 1 in the barn and 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.650
 one in the service station so here I 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.000
 do a little around and I look 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.310
 from time to time a medium like like 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.930
 the just right and now so here is 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.250
 it's really a difficult moment 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.810
 to chain because there are plenty 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.060
 different weapons lanes light rifle 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.229
 gunner and more easily on doing 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.909
 watch out for the radars as it 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.439
 is active every five seconds I 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.149
 believe so here I stay a little in 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.530
 this region in this region of the 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.299
 map for not really venturing 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.009
 especially when we go to sniper 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.170
 must really insured his kilt as there 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.909
 I'm doing it here I'm going to spend on the dsr 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.170
 50 with which I am quite comfortable 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.399
 still it's the sniper with which 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.049
 I'm more comfortable playing I think 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.310
 so I decide to go out because I 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.540
 knew that the guy was going to go up watching 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.920
 on the radar he just went up 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.240
 the objects a few moments ago 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.399
 I thought I'll take someone 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.709
 which is more the most extreme 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.300
 eccentric and yeah I unlock the ballista 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.110
 agents direct chain has a quick scope 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.580
 which is very rare 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.380
 with the ballista coming because I do not manage 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.000
 not necessarily very well and I chained 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.140
 then with the smau we go to the launcher 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.270
 which had this word and rocket launcher 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.980
 afterwards I know he will be asking 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.930
 the station I watch he spawn at the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.400
 station very well I move to the crossbow 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.500
 I head to the window to see if 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.760
 is an enemy of available what is 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.110
 really very hard on Belgian time 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.430
 prefers when the enemies arrive in 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.870
 face of me so what will happen 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.890
 will I succeed in doing the he 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.120
 to the art broom to go to the knife 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.430
 ballistic the camper in the hot corner 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.350
 the views under the collar I'm killing myself I 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.330
 am really disgusted so here it is 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.760
 a challenge fail i will not hide it 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.530
 but I'm relatively disgusted being 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.890
 given that once the crossbow pass 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.600
 still 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.130
 I tell myself that the ballistic knife 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.870
 it was a little easier I think 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.280
 that there was a way to delay after 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.050
 to make this wine 0 but hey it's 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.250
 shame it's a challenge fail so here we go 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.300
 may not always succeed them and I will 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.260
 invites to abandon two in the 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.360
 comments always with the same 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.160
 mechanism of like on the different 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.570
 as here and then I hope you 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.280
 will have enjoyed the video we find ourselves 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.080
 this weekend I do not know if it will be a 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.400
 episode 9 of raider tomb finally I do not 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.750
 do not know at all field tray revision in 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.310
 this moment so here I will try to 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.260
 make a video I will not promise you anything 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.610
 so here are the people I wanted on this 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.930
 wine for 2 and I hope the video 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.930
 you will have liked by everyone
