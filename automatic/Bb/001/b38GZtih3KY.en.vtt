you

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.410 

another<00:00:09.099> fundamental<00:00:09.400> principles<00:00:10.150> upon

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
another fundamental principles upon

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.620 
another fundamental principles upon
which<00:00:10.480> large<00:00:10.840> areas<00:00:10.990> based<00:00:11.410> is<00:00:11.710> pressure<00:00:12.630> we

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:13.630 
which large areas based is pressure we

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.390 
which large areas based is pressure we
have<00:00:13.780> an<00:00:13.930> emitting<00:00:14.200> object<00:00:14.650> inside<00:00:15.010> the<00:00:15.220> wine

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400 
have an emitting object inside the wine

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.150 
have an emitting object inside the wine
bottle<00:00:15.670> and<00:00:16.000> when<00:00:16.930> the<00:00:17.349> particles<00:00:17.860> bounce

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
bottle and when the particles bounce

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.480 
bottle and when the particles bounce
around<00:00:18.460> it<00:00:18.730> finds<00:00:19.090> an<00:00:19.360> opening<00:00:19.780> and<00:00:20.220> flows<00:00:21.220> out

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
around it finds an opening and flows out

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.310 
around it finds an opening and flows out
and<00:00:23.160> if<00:00:24.160> that<00:00:24.310> opening<00:00:24.670> was<00:00:24.789> blocked<00:00:25.150> then<00:00:25.930> it

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
and if that opening was blocked then it

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.080 
and if that opening was blocked then it
would<00:00:26.470> simply<00:00:26.830> build<00:00:27.130> up<00:00:27.310> inside<00:00:27.520> so<00:00:27.910> let's

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
would simply build up inside so let's

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.060 
would simply build up inside so let's
let's<00:00:28.630> see<00:00:28.750> what<00:00:28.869> would<00:00:29.109> happen<00:00:29.289> would<00:00:29.590> let<00:00:29.980> me

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
let's see what would happen would let me

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.069 
let's see what would happen would let me
do<00:00:30.190> that<00:00:30.369> I<00:00:30.580> want<00:00:31.060> to<00:00:31.119> change<00:00:31.330> the<00:00:31.510> size<00:00:31.810> of<00:00:31.990> the

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
do that I want to change the size of the

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.169 
do that I want to change the size of the
particles<00:00:32.590> instead<00:00:33.010> of<00:00:33.100> point<00:00:33.399> 2<00:00:33.609> units<00:00:34.030> to

00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:34.179 
particles instead of point 2 units to

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:38.880 
particles instead of point 2 units to
one<00:00:34.479> unit<00:00:34.870> in<00:00:35.050> size<00:00:36.269> if<00:00:37.269> they<00:00:38.140> can't<00:00:38.559> get<00:00:38.800> out

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
one unit in size if they can't get out

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.819 
one unit in size if they can't get out
of<00:00:39.100> that<00:00:39.420> bottleneck<00:00:40.420> because<00:00:40.749> it's<00:00:41.319> too<00:00:41.530> big

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
of that bottleneck because it's too big

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.000 
of that bottleneck because it's too big
so<00:00:42.039> basically<00:00:42.579> it<00:00:42.670> sits<00:00:42.969> there<00:00:43.679> now<00:00:44.679> we<00:00:44.739> only

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
so basically it sits there now we only

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.009 
so basically it sits there now we only
emit<00:00:45.280> once<00:00:45.639> in<00:00:46.030> this<00:00:46.179> case<00:00:46.449> you<00:00:46.600> fall<00:00:46.780> to<00:00:46.899> go

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
emit once in this case you fall to go

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:48.930 
emit once in this case you fall to go
inside<00:00:47.289> the<00:00:47.530> compound<00:00:47.979> the<00:00:48.159> senate<00:00:48.489> as<00:00:48.670> they

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
inside the compound the senate as they

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.489 
inside the compound the senate as they
emit<00:00:49.329> every<00:00:50.109> frame<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.879> builds<00:00:52.690> up<00:00:52.959> until<00:00:53.350> it

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:53.499 
emit every frame it builds up until it

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:55.349 
emit every frame it builds up until it
can't<00:00:53.769> actually<00:00:54.129> occupy<00:00:54.699> any<00:00:54.760> more<00:00:55.030> volume

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
can't actually occupy any more volume

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.209 
can't actually occupy any more volume
and<00:00:55.449> stops<00:00:55.809> emitting<00:00:56.350> and<00:00:56.649> this<00:00:56.799> is<00:00:56.920> what<00:00:57.069> this

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
and stops emitting and this is what this

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.879 
and stops emitting and this is what this
performs<00:00:57.760> space<00:00:58.059> check<00:00:58.389> does<00:00:58.629> basically<00:00:59.440> says

00:00:59.879 --> 00:00:59.889 
performs space check does basically says

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:02.219 
performs space check does basically says
can<00:01:00.459> I<00:01:00.489> add<00:01:00.819> another<00:01:01.179> particle<00:01:01.629> of<00:01:01.839> the<00:01:02.019> same

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
can I add another particle of the same

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.189 
can I add another particle of the same
size<00:01:02.530> in<00:01:02.920> this<00:01:03.069> volume<00:01:03.360> nope<00:01:04.360> another<00:01:04.900> part<00:01:05.110> of

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
size in this volume nope another part of

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.600 
size in this volume nope another part of
your<00:01:05.290> occupies<00:01:05.620> that<00:01:05.650> space<00:01:06.070> therefore<00:01:06.310> do

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
your occupies that space therefore do

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.560 
your occupies that space therefore do
not<00:01:06.640> fill<00:01:07.090> it<00:01:07.680> if<00:01:08.680> I<00:01:08.860> were<00:01:09.040> to<00:01:09.280> turn<00:01:10.000> off<00:01:10.240> space

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
not fill it if I were to turn off space

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.600 
not fill it if I were to turn off space
check<00:01:10.900> watch<00:01:11.140> what<00:01:11.350> happens<00:01:11.710> it<00:01:11.950> fills<00:01:12.490> the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
check watch what happens it fills the

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.520 
check watch what happens it fills the
volume<00:01:12.940> and<00:01:13.150> then<00:01:13.360> it<00:01:13.600> tries<00:01:13.900> to<00:01:13.930> add<00:01:14.290> another

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
volume and then it tries to add another

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.010 
volume and then it tries to add another
particle<00:01:15.520> in<00:01:15.760> the<00:01:15.790> same<00:01:16.060> space<00:01:16.420> and<00:01:16.720> therefore

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
particle in the same space and therefore

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.840 
particle in the same space and therefore
it<00:01:17.110> pushes<00:01:17.470> another<00:01:17.710> one<00:01:17.890> away<00:01:18.160> because<00:01:18.640> of

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
it pushes another one away because of

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.090 
it pushes another one away because of
the<00:01:19.060> pressure<00:01:19.300> involved<00:01:19.810> so<00:01:20.560> that's<00:01:20.740> what<00:01:20.950> the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
the pressure involved so that's what the

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.230 
the pressure involved so that's what the
perform<00:01:21.640> space<00:01:21.970> check<00:01:22.300> does<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:24.670> I<00:01:24.790> were<00:01:24.910> to<00:01:25.060> go

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
perform space check does if I were to go

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.870 
perform space check does if I were to go
back<00:01:25.480> and<00:01:25.510> change<00:01:25.930> this<00:01:26.800> back<00:01:27.040> to<00:01:27.250> point<00:01:27.610> to

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
back and change this back to point to

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.620 
back and change this back to point to
and<00:01:28.290> actually<00:01:29.290> bring<00:01:29.920> up<00:01:30.070> my<00:01:30.940> grid<00:01:31.360> I'm<00:01:31.480> going

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
and actually bring up my grid I'm going

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.600 
and actually bring up my grid I'm going
to<00:01:31.690> put<00:01:31.810> it<00:01:31.900> over<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.170> bottle<00:01:32.530> neck<00:01:32.710> when<00:01:33.430> we

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
to put it over the bottle neck when we

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.050 
to put it over the bottle neck when we
start<00:01:33.640> emitting<00:01:34.420> again<00:01:34.900> a<00:01:35.760> similar<00:01:36.760> sort<00:01:36.880> of

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
start emitting again a similar sort of

start emitting again a similar sort of
thing<00:01:37.180> happens<00:01:37.570> it's<00:01:38.260> going<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.470> be<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.590> buildup

thing happens it's going to be a buildup
of<00:01:39.160> pressure<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:41.350> then<00:01:41.590> once<00:01:41.800> the<00:01:42.070> bottle

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
bit more detail even smooth it out a bit

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.460 
bit more detail even smooth it out a bit
like<00:02:28.810> 10<00:02:29.080> here<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.890> one<00:02:30.790> of<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.170> beauties<00:02:32.170> is

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
like 10 here and one of the beauties is

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.470 
like 10 here and one of the beauties is
in<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.980> lower<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.700> polygamy<00:02:34.120> so<00:02:34.299> it

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
in the lower and the polygamy so it

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.449 
in the lower and the polygamy so it
really<00:02:34.780> works<00:02:35.019> well<00:02:35.110> together<00:02:35.440> is<00:02:35.799> to<00:02:35.980> create

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
really works well together is to create

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.339 
really works well together is to create
this<00:02:36.670> fluid<00:02:37.150> shaper<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:39.430> really<00:02:39.700> does<00:02:39.940> help

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
this fluid shaper it really does help

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.199 
this fluid shaper it really does help
make<00:02:41.349> a<00:02:41.380> proper<00:02:42.010> fluid<00:02:42.610> shape<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.060> we<00:02:43.120> can

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
make a proper fluid shape and we can

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.729 
make a proper fluid shape and we can
also<00:02:43.330> add<00:02:43.630> things<00:02:43.930> like<00:02:44.049> this<00:02:44.349> remove

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
also add things like this remove

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.630 
also add things like this remove
intersection<00:02:45.400> especially<00:02:45.790> when<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:46.060> hits

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
intersection especially when it hits

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.839 
intersection especially when it hits
collision<00:02:48.640> objects<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.980> if<00:02:51.099> i<00:02:51.220> were<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.459> now<00:02:51.640> go

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
collision objects so if i were to now go

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:59.270 
collision objects so if i were to now go
back<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.410> my<00:02:53.410> colleague<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:53.799> I<00:02:53.980> sir<00:02:54.040> settings

by<00:03:45.090> controlling<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.750> pressures<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.500> then

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
by controlling the pressures and then

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.120 
by controlling the pressures and then
now<00:03:47.520> using<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.150> polygamy<00:03:48.750> sir<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:49.890> fluid

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
now using the polygamy sir the fluid

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.820 
now using the polygamy sir the fluid
shaper<00:03:50.730> it's<00:03:51.720> really<00:03:51.900> cool<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.500> be<00:03:52.650> able<00:03:52.710> to
