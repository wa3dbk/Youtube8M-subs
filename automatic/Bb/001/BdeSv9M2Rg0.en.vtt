 here fierce duckling in a new tutorial and 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.700
 good in this opportunity I'm going to 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.950
 teach how to install a server 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.620
 minecraft in this case version 1.4 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.470
 point 2 which is the last with our 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.900
 favorite mods that we're going to do first 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.449
 obviously we need these four 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.580
 minecraft things obviously I'm sorry sorry what 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.860
 who wanted to open the fuck says is the 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.119
 minecraft we are going to need the files 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.619
 of the server that I will leave them in 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.230
 the description of the video obviously 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.439
 we're going to need the minecraft the main 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.629
 cross is the fox and universal minecraft 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.909
 6.0 point 1.3 point 5.0 point points 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.710
 point point this one I'm going to leave 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:40.780
 the description of the video and obviously a 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.909
 couple of mods in this case good I'll 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.530
 use these three which are the extended 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:47.139
 workbench the back pack team is called 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.479
 backpack and the peter ticket that is for 

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:50.350
 cut wood faster faster good in short 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.269
 well once we have four 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.069
 things let's proceed with the mod with the 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.100
 server sorry what we are going to do is 

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:59.049
 once we extract the folder we are going to 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.549
 have these files not what I have to 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:02.229
 do now is set it up as a first 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:03.699
 step we will go to be server that is what 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.019
 first we're going to configure click 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.390
 right edit 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.670
 this will help us to assign the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.929
 ram memory to our server I 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.609
 I recommend putting half of what 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:15.100
 you have in this case I have for 

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:17.590
 example 2 gb of ram and I'll put the 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.799
 half that would be 1024 mb than in this 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.229
 case would be 1024 mb we put here and here 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.770
 we also delete the giga that is placed 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.679
 and we put 1024 megabytes 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.149
 we put file save close 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.250
 we have already configured the 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:36.210
 start server the following configure 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.789
 the server properties I think it's 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.380
 well let's see edit and well here 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.880
 I'm going to give a couple of parameters of what 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.500
 it serves more or less every thing this for 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.549
 more or less change the name to be the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.950
 duck pact pact pact wi point and i am 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.140
 fucking we go to the generate part 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.329
 good structure this you already know these 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.969
 to generate structures in the distance 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.619
 of the view let's say if we want that it puts 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.149
 of monsters the amount of beaches that 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.009
 the game mode can enter server 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.509
 the difficulty if they want to get out of life 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.470
 before the players and this is very 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.660
 important on line mode is to put fox 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.009
 false false and whatever they want to call them 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.569
 those who know how to put textures what 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.299
 put in this case it is not so that I do not 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.340
 I'm going to put this good would be hardcore the 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:20.630
 spam from spawn animals of the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.730
 narigones server and for here it dances to be the 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.260
 sorry the ip of our server in 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.450
 this case is the ip of hamÃ¡s and this already 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.220
 they will know and those who do not know the date well 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.280
 hamachi 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.370
 and we are going to give him to save and close 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.410
 quietly what follows is if you want 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.480
 plead some kind of administrator 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.800
 in the ops text file I go 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.750
 add there is no add to myself 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.180
 obviously fierce duckling 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.040
 and we close and we save ok we have 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.230
 configured our server what 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.450
 we have to do now is let's 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.120
 minimize forgiveness and we are going to open the 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.100
 minecraft folder for me how can 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.140
 see we have many files here that is 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.640
 what we are going to use now we go back to the 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.890
 server folder and let's open the 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.590
 main craft server 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.540
 Right click to open with winrar we're going 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.910
 to leave aside and let's open the 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.860
 maikel folch folder we put it to a 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.420
 cost all the files in the folder 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.970
 We're going to minecraft force 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.860
 select and we will move it to the 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.590
 folder in this case rap of 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.150
 minecraft server let's accept and 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.680
 we hope it charges already we have 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.380
 installed in our minecraft force 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.970
 inside our server I think that 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.250
 we have to do now obviously it's 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.800
 start the server let's start side 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.959
 from start server not from minecraft 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.810
 server from here 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.000
 we double- click on it and it's going to start 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.489
 download all the files in this 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.860
 case of the force as you can see fox force 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.440
 mount loader in this case we do not need 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.200
 mpn module adan nothing good she 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.820
 completely full full full the force and 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.180
 universal so we do not need anything 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.440
 more than that once you download it 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.660
 will start the server as you see 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.670
 is already preparing the spam we are going to 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.890
 wait for it to load 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.380
 and good once we load we go to 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.970
 proceed to install our mod 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.620
 wait a bit more than you take a 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.230
 little bit of time and good once 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.390
 we have everything already let's say spurred by 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.860
 so saying it let's close the server and 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.990
 let's see that the server folder 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.989
 we are going to have several new files 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.989
 how are these two the mods live core folder 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.840
 mods and config 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.800
 because these folders are created 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.650
 obviously to load our molds 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.690
 in this case we are going to go back to 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.819
 desktop and here if we go to the folder 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.710
 mods let's leave this a little bit more 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:34.599
 up we are going to enter folder mods in 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.860
 this case this folder I have it no no 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.389
 I am going to leave it to you 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.430
 download the mods they want to try 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.229
 the mods that want that depends on 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.840
 you are tastes we are not going to for these 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.060
 three what we are going to do is copy and 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.430
 we are going to stick them inside our 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.220
 server in this case the mods folder what 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.720
 we paste here we already have the mods 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.949
 installed on our server the only thing 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.810
 What is missing is to start the server 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:59.620
 obviously we are going to start it from 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.870
 This server floor I usually repeat and I'm going 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.550
 repeat as many times as needed 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.960
 we open the start server and as you can see it is going 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.490
 to load our server 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.560
 quietly without any kind of 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.759
 problem without any skull is not going to 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.810
 restart is not going to lock it is not going to 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.759
 hang up let's play 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.409
 we will calmly wait for it 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:19.319
 believe in spawn areas 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:22.110
 50% 57 percent 63 percent 69 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:25.700
 lalalala and well let's hope that 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.350
 finish loading the time 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.720
 I want to sing but I'm not going to 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.890
 sing because I do not know how to sing once 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.810
 we have the server loaded what 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.900
 we have to do is obviously enter 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.310
 to the minecraft egg egg serrat and 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.010
 folders to these many thanks 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.280
 let's go into our fucking minecraft 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.980
 mistake fucking error thank you very much for 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.370
 enter we are going to give enter game awaits us 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.370
 to load 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.979
 and well let's wait a little piece and them 

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:56.110
 I will give a very important clarification 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.119
 now when we enter for those who 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.029
 say today I can not enter I have a 

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:03.939
 error the error is the most basic of all 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:06.249
 he's the stupidest of all and I'm going to 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:08.349
 say what happens if you put mods 

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:09.520
 inside your server that does not want 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:11.919
 say that they no longer have inside their 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.959
 minecraft what do you mean by 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.279
 example by extending workbench inside 

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:16.809
 of your server but if you do not have it 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:19.029
 installed in your minecraft obviously not 

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:20.830
 they will be able to enter because the server 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:22.779
 is needing you to have that 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.059
 so well that's the clarification if 

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:26.439
 they want to enter your server with a mode 

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:28.990
 they have to load it into their 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:30.869
 server and in your game once said 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.430
 this is going to enter multiplayer 

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:35.319
 multiplayer and as you can see, our 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.169
 server created duck duck duck duck 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:40.330
 point and we will enter quietly 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:42.369
 double click logging in is going to 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.940
 load a little bit and good now 

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:45.950
 he throws us a couple of 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.220
 they are not mistakes tells us that it is already for 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.690
 update the different types of 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.120
 This case mods and as you can see and 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.280
 We have our mods installed should 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.480
 give a test to see let's go to 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.100
 put together a little bit of wood I want them 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.290
 show so they see that this is not a 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.710
 infected fake or anything like that 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:05.450
 I'm not going to show you for example 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.360
 how we break the easy wood the 

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:11.930
 extend woolwich workbench that already 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:15.220
 you can meet and the backpacks 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:18.380
 we're going to do there, we're just going to do 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.490
 two clear messages as you can see this 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.320
 to show them that the molds are 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.129
 working quietly is not for 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.139
 another thing 

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:27.330
 as you can see we already have our way 

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:29.069
 installed inside the server another mode 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.750
 that we had to install we are going to 

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:34.510
 look for a stone ax 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:37.300
 your broken and turbo diamonds in total is what 

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.650
 same and as you can see the tree falls 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:42.400
 completely or is it installed 

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:44.440
 in model in this case is rich peter is 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.210
 installed quietly and another way that 

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.230
 we had is for example the one of the 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.790
 backpack that I will also show it 

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.900
 to see that I have not done much or 

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.250
 that I do not lie 

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.560
 let's make a backpack that is made of 

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.910
 this way 

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.490
 and as you can see we have our 

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:58.889
 backpack installed our server 

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.870
 all quiet so good this was 

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:03.090
 basically today's tutorial 

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.710
 I hope you liked it and well we 

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:07.699
 we see until the next I'm fierce duckling 

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.699
 bye
