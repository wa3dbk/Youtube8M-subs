00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 So does the dog really lose weight? 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.120
 This is what you will know. 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:13.440
 in this very fast video in Kurdish 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.450
 so come just looks the answer to that 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.520
 question is the following is the dog 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.320
 Do not even lose weight, excuse me. 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.279
 arms of the forces but the truth is that 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.900
 this is a myth 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.210
 in fact even if it is a myth it is 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.640
 there is no evidence that this really 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.669
 the dog has happened it has been used 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.920
 by many people but one has not been 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.510
 have been proven and scientific that 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.270
 really helps to lose weight 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.969
 in fact the testimonies of these people 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.590
 who say that the dog is thin is 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.210
 because it actually generates a 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.190
 extra society 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.809
 only that this anxiety goes with the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.440
 time then the person is hungry for 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.090
 new 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.969
 in fact the dog does not help at all 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.789
 the person to lose weight at least not that 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.739
 this has been proved, it does not happen that 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.030
 the benefits of artichoke is that it is 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.800
 low calorie 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.899
 so if you started a dog 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.270
 probably you but would win but ok 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.820
 you were very hungry then you would be 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.700
 horrible for your body do not do 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.320
 That's because it's like you go with my 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.240
 dog can not eat a new one 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.950
 greasy yet a little caloric 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.950
 because the tendency to eat a 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.570
 dog is always like today if you go 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.460
 like greasy sauces 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.460
 What will happen is that you will 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.380
 end up not having this specific calorie 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.390
 but we end up eating calories 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.130
 The only other thing was that the dog was 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.479
 it 's not a strike even though it 's a little 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.430
 caloric right 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.329
 but an artichoke recipe for you 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.250
 do is you take the dog put bake 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.500
 with water and salt and an onion sauce 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.049
 grated lemon vinegar water salt and olive oil 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.509
 This makes me not a dog. 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.439
 stay greasy between the winter you 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.820
 serve with sauce you can serve with 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.649

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.340
