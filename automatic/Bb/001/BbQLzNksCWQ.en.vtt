00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.349
 I spoke with visas in the abruzzo field district 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.049
 here and today that you have seen through 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.820
 title I'm talking about the beige 4 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.740
 and we talked about some news 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.410
 recent there but good 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.449
 before talking about bs-4 want to talk 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.430
 a bit about my there stream and 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.920
 Good, I know some people have 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.619
 some problems with Oleg during the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.990
 laws 30 and thinking about it until lowering a 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.030
 little tite that some people 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.480
 they complained and the quality dropped 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.940
 and I have already changed beer 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.730
 I tried changing server multiple times 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.940
 it does not seem to work, there are still people 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.260
 who still has leg and good thinking about it 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.350
 I searched a little there on the internet. 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.309
 find this link that has the description to 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.680
 You are the tutorial so do it there. 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.710
 What are you asking, is this blocking? 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.829
 some ete's probably pulling 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.899
 unnecessary bandwidth and leaving little 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.680
 space for alex had i hope this 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:11.460
 help me a lot there if I could I would 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.100
 las 30 and 120 peak high quality there but 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.020
 thinking this, I know a lot of people 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.549
 have these problems and there is no internet 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.290
 very good so I end up doing it in 480p 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.360
 even if you still do not follow me 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.210
 still there in tuite because 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.140
 You 're helping me until you can 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.840
 this partnership 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.930
 no tweet and then you will have 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.600
 options to choose from is quality 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.970
 if you can choose between 720p 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.210
 with 180 and 360 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.540
 everything depends even there is more time 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.009
 but it 's yours, too, and also 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.930
 I'm thinking of making it colder. 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.439
 today at the same time as always 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.810
 I do between 7 hours and 8 hours or so. 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.170
 also six hours depending on 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.299
 I really want to do it but it's not 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.490
 Can I promise you anything good, but let's go? 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.829
 Because it matters, it 's good for who does not. 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.770
 know even gave a four - wire will 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.110
 be on display in games with and for 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.750
 who does not know yet if it will be the same 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.930
 The way e3 is going is doing 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.650
 criciúma and it 's about the game and also 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.540
 it seems the game is totally 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.270
 different from what we saw in e3 né 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.910
 it seems they have advanced a lot there and 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.360
 people will have the opportunity to see how 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.970
 that the game is how they evolved, huh? 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.920
 games will be on the 21st until the 25th 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.860
 so we'll have plenty of time there 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.690
 four days to lay boat parade 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.690
 four will be more or less the same 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.180
 style that was on e3 nor does the time start 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.400
 time and also now 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:54.700
 with a different profile slightly more choice 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.239
 cheap e3 does not look like 279 70 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.020
 huh 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:02.230
 they put is pretty it's things in that 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.770
 ps right to make sure you go on the run 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.350
 maximum frame maximum exit but I do not 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.280
 I think the fork will be 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.010
 despite this, of course, the beautiful 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.070
 flee or even still must be in alpha 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.680
 still alberto has not been announced yet 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.019
 Baidu there they would have if in the pcs that is 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.530
 to have as much difference as possible 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:29.110
 to be sure and logical that it will run 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.120
 and everything is fine, right? 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.480
 like I just said the game is in alpha 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.330
 still is not optimized yet 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.940
 so I think the profile of four goes 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.959
 be more or less kombat 3 game to the 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.390
 food is 4 alpha and was more or less the same 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.989
 or three neighborhoods remembering that he did not 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.540
 have used and he is not 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.269
 texture in it is not destroyed and 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.489
 but I think it will continue the same 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.100
 way it's just going to be a little heavier 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.930
 that the beautiful kick of 3 there and also them 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.940
 have announced that a mortar will be 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.950
 Remotely controlled 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.090
 For those who do not know, I do not excel. 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.610
 2 company and the snip is contained h 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.650
 mortar, and he more or less than 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.890
 functional by remote control are you 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.560
 the place and then the 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.020
 moteiro fell there so you do not need 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.360
 stay on the equipment as you need 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.420
 stay in the g3 neighborhood 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.750
 I liked that because it kind of goes 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.690
 and leave the holder but inside the 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.330
 and if he wants to use the 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.420
 mortar, nor is it logical that he will 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.730
 have more mobility this is obvious and 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.970
 will also be able to select let's go like this 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.400
 choose the places to drop the script 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.770
 more easily also one more news 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.580
 well cool there is that in those with will be 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.430
 announced and will be shown looks like the new 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.480
 game mode that will have a nice end to 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.970
 four ne 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:03.000
 the boot goes rolling that this new 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.730
 mode will be more or less the same as 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 against the striker is today if you die 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:11.040
 You can not give me any more backing. 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.400
 that this is just speculation but it would be 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.530
 cool to see a way where it would be 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.810
 practically against strike né 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.050
 today you have to say a bomb or 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.930
 something like that and I do not know, I think 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.510
 staff would give more value so life 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.270
 inside the game and also the news indicates 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.760
 that the factions will be dynamic right 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.770
 that is, the Russian might end up struggling 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.290
 against the Chinese 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:40.200
 or the Chinese fight against the 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.480
 United States and so on. 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.810
 many people thought it would be three factions 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.610
 per game which would be completely 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.190
 I did not think it would be more or 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.920
 less is the style we had 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:56.550
 seen there on e3 but you could see 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.680
 clearly that China was unified with 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.770
 Russia, can you ask for support 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.780
 for the Russians of Chinese and an hour and 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.810
 another in the game place that we saw there 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.810
 by e3 is right you see equipment 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:13.020
 Russians along with the Chinese and 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.990
 vice versa is that I came up understanding that 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.280
 the Chinese would be unified 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.990
 russians right? 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.180
 so this is personal to you 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.390
 I have enjoyed this news 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.800
 quite happy with some screens not right 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.470

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:31.470
