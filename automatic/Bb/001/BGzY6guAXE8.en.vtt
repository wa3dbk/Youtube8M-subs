00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.470
 yo faka gamers and welcome back here 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.420
 at more there 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.580
 microsoft flight i am the pilot of 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.710
 today my name and i go luscious 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.180
 try not to start anymore 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.470
 I think that's the best thing I can do 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.720
 I wanted to be first microsoft flight 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.029
 professed flaysome members try x or or 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.770
 2004 but then it goes so incredibly 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.140
 for buttons in that if I have a button 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.910
 do not press any or my recording 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.740
 equipment went over airplanes 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.000
 thundered down like a block and 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.590
 then we must have it, I even have it 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.270
 once trying to get the fuel tanks 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.950
 throw it overboard and that was not giving up 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.630
 I normally have the intention there 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.370
 microsoft flight downloaded it is real 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.980
 free I think I don't mean it 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.210
 at least for me it's free 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.280
 and I still think that can be nice and free 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.090
 go fly go fly is always 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.800
 good 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.970
 and we have to choose from 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.730
 different missions because we have 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.980
 here an ahoy and edventure pack 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.350
 should buy or something but i like 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.659
 to do a mission so that can be here 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.450
 the active which is overnight oil reserves 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.060
 and pilot profile I show namely 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.310
 really pilot look i'm name this 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.880
 rick and name i am pilot level 2 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.920
 or I can fly over all 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.179
 I really never start again, really never me 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.770
 just go on all missions for a while 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.210
 Retry I have only one 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.039
 done or something and I know all the buttons 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.390
 no more so many buttons in one 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.539
 plane as once as once the 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.990
 press button then it is there I am 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.280
 really good at it 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.310
 I'm really good at things let down 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.719
 we are going to do that mission and off 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.689
 the commission is that i think we are 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:41.859
 a burn essentials tutorial still distracts 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.719
 give it a try because 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:46.119
 turn on when the pieces struck down and 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.889
 then all have problems whining 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.359
 people everywhere there is blood we would like that 

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:51.219
 of course not so I want to do well 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.569
 learn how to fly again and again 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:52.899
 the games were gestures too 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.880
 to learn 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.960

 mission succeeded more started I have to 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.170
 pay attention the pilot must pay attention it is 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.090
 ferry can not reset to 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.519
 apparently restart and this time 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.410

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.880

 so i we we go and compliance too 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.110
 we play, we fly and we play 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.510
 go under balloons if you have the 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.280
 balloons touches the dojo 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.140
 without the plane plane we 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.930
 screw it together like that 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.989

 let's be nice to fly with 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.660
 that the game indicates that it is one 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.090
 balloon is an evil i thought 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.470
 namely that it was a cutlery drawer 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.310
 but there is of course not clean and 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.850
 balloon 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.150
 50 points from the balloons and so is not 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:31.900
