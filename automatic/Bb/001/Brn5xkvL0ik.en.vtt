maintenance<00:00:03.540> channel<00:00:05.180> in<00:00:06.180> previous<00:00:06.750> episode

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
maintenance channel in previous episode

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.459 
maintenance channel in previous episode
we<00:00:07.529> learned<00:00:08.069> basic<00:00:09.030> use<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.809> text<00:00:10.200> stream

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
we learned basic use of the text stream

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.079 
we learned basic use of the text stream
and<00:00:10.880> let's<00:00:11.880> bring<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.780> up<00:00:12.960> higher<00:00:13.849> let's<00:00:14.849> go

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
and let's bring it up higher let's go

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.269 
and let's bring it up higher let's go
and<00:00:15.389> see<00:00:15.599> together<00:00:15.960> how<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.529> find<00:00:17.250> life<00:00:17.940> data

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
and see together how to find life data

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.450 
and see together how to find life data
in<00:00:20.279> previous<00:00:20.850> video<00:00:21.240> either<00:00:21.539> together

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
in previous video either together

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.679 
in previous video either together
already<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.680> screen<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.300> here<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.330> can

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
already in this screen and here I can

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.950 
already in this screen and here I can
select<00:00:27.960> which<00:00:28.650> live<00:00:29.099> data<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.939> want<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.480> acquire

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
select which live data I want to acquire

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.650 
select which live data I want to acquire
so<00:00:31.470> for<00:00:31.679> example<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.430> will<00:00:32.489> go<00:00:32.850> for<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.390> tire

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
so for example I will go for the tire

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.860 
so for example I will go for the tire
pressure<00:00:34.079> monitors<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:36.270> will<00:00:36.510> click<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.530> it

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
pressure monitors and I will click on it

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.400 
pressure monitors and I will click on it
right<00:00:39.870> here<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:41.540> go<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.719> search<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
right here and go and search for the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.970 
right here and go and search for the
live<00:00:43.649> data<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.899> here<00:00:45.950> the<00:00:46.950> computer<00:00:47.670> reads<00:00:48.980> or

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
live data and here the computer reads or

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.369 
live data and here the computer reads or
to<00:00:50.489> communicate<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> computers<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
to communicate with the computers in the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.810 
to communicate with the computers in the
vehicle<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:54.149> see<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.469> very<00:00:55.890> life

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
vehicle and you can see the very life

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.380 
vehicle and you can see the very life
data<00:00:57.680> here<00:00:58.680> all<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.940> tires<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:00.989> see<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
data here all the tires you can see the

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.109 
data here all the tires you can see the
registered<00:01:03.390> ID<00:01:03.690> goes<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.100> see<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
registered ID goes you can see the the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.670 
registered ID goes you can see the the
voltages<00:01:06.780> are<00:01:07.020> okay<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:08.610> threshold<00:01:09.680> low

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
voltages are okay the threshold low

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.510 
voltages are okay the threshold low
pressure<00:01:11.100> how<00:01:11.580> they<00:01:11.790> are<00:01:11.909> set<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.650> so

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
pressure how they are set and so on so

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.149 
pressure how they are set and so on so
this<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.880> also<00:01:15.270> very<00:01:15.509> simple<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.170> acquiring

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
this is also very simple to acquiring

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.060 
this is also very simple to acquiring
the<00:01:17.490> life<00:01:17.790> data<00:01:18.479> from<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.290> vehicle<00:01:19.409> using

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
the life data from the vehicle using

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.880 
the life data from the vehicle using
test<00:01:20.310> stream<00:01:20.840> here<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.170> see<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.619> data

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
test stream here you can see the data

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.469 
test stream here you can see the data
from<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.610> different<00:01:24.180> system<00:01:25.430> this<00:01:26.430> time<00:01:26.790> we

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
from the different system this time we

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.480 
from the different system this time we
are<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.220> cruise<00:01:29.220> control<00:01:30.259> life<00:01:31.340> so<00:01:32.340> this

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
are in the cruise control life so this

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.270 
are in the cruise control life so this
is<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> chart<00:01:33.210> which<00:01:33.780> has<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> technician<00:01:34.920> when

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
is the chart which has a technician when

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.700 
is the chart which has a technician when
you<00:01:35.400> will<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.729> driving<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.390> vehicle<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.680> can

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
you will be driving the vehicle you can

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.740 
you will be driving the vehicle you can
see<00:01:38.369> all<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.570> vehicle<00:01:40.079> speed<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.970> all<00:01:41.970> kinds

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
see all the vehicle speed and all kinds

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.440 
see all the vehicle speed and all kinds
of<00:01:42.840> data<00:01:43.110> which<00:01:43.500> are<00:01:43.680> helpful<00:01:44.280> for<00:01:44.460> diagnosis

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
of data which are helpful for diagnosis

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.920 
of data which are helpful for diagnosis
and<00:01:45.659> repairs<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:47.030> really<00:01:48.030> hope<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.659> video

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
and repairs I really hope this video

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.749 
and repairs I really hope this video
