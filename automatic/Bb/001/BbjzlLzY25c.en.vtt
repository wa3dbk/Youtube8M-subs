result<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:13.670> that<00:01:13.700> he<00:01:14.300> researched<00:01:14.780> infant

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
result to that he researched infant

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.070

water safety classes and found the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.620

closest<00:01:18.680> were<00:01:19.130> in<00:01:19.250> Ohio<00:01:19.610> I<00:01:20.000> thought<00:01:20.240> if

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
closest were in Ohio I thought if

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.290 
closest were in Ohio I thought if
there's<00:01:20.870> nobody<00:01:21.170> in<00:01:21.290> Michigan<00:01:21.710> teaching<00:01:22.070> this

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
there's nobody in Michigan teaching this

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.300 
there's nobody in Michigan teaching this
 I'd<00:01:23.480> do<00:01:23.600> that<00:01:23.750> so<00:01:24.320> he<00:01:24.530> got<00:01:24.710> certified

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
 I'd do that so he got certified

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.270 
 I'd do that so he got certified
and<00:01:25.790> now<00:01:26.180> ones<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.930> only<00:01:27.410> infant<00:01:27.920> swimming
