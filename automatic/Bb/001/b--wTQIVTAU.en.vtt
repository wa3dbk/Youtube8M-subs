00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
see that that's exactly what I did I

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.250 
see that that's exactly what I did I
framed<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.550> area<00:02:17.030> around<00:02:17.420> her<00:02:17.600> head<00:02:18.080> and

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
framed the area around her head and

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.230 
framed the area around her head and
shoulders<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:19.340> be<00:02:19.520> a<00:02:19.550> darker<00:02:20.090> background

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
shoulders to be a darker background

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.720 
shoulders to be a darker background
that's<00:02:20.840> what<00:02:21.080> makes<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.590> rim<00:02:21.920> light<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.550> back

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
that's what makes the rim light the back

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.660 
that's what makes the rim light the back
light<00:02:23.000> pop<00:02:23.360> of<00:02:23.660> course<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:24.860> also<00:02:25.070> pay<00:02:25.460> very

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
light pop of course I also pay very

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.730 
light pop of course I also pay very
close<00:02:25.910> attention<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.750> area<00:02:27.050> around<00:02:27.440> the

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
close attention to the area around the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.350 
close attention to the area around the
head<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:27.980> shoulders<00:02:28.580> that's<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:29.000> next<00:02:29.210> thing

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
head and shoulders that's the next thing

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.870 
head and shoulders that's the next thing
that<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:29.660> notice<00:02:30.350> when<00:02:31.010> I'm<00:02:31.160> creating<00:02:31.430> and

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
that I notice when I'm creating and

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.360 
that I notice when I'm creating and
composing<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.420> shot<00:02:32.660> like<00:02:32.870> this<00:02:33.040> from<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.160> head

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
composing a shot like this from the head

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.980 
composing a shot like this from the head
around<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:35.030> shoulders<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.510> everywhere<00:02:35.840> this

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
around the shoulders and everywhere this

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.230 
around the shoulders and everywhere this
whole<00:02:36.410> area<00:02:36.800> I'm<00:02:37.430> going<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.820> pay<00:02:37.940> close

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
whole area I'm going to pay close

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.360 
whole area I'm going to pay close
attention<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.930> make<00:02:39.110> sure<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:39.620> if<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.340> had

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
attention and make sure that if I had

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.400 
attention and make sure that if I had
framed<00:02:40.880> it<00:02:41.060> just<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:41.750> her<00:02:41.840> head<00:02:42.020> was<00:02:42.050> over

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
framed it just so that her head was over

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.980 
framed it just so that her head was over
here<00:02:42.740> or<00:02:43.250> over<00:02:43.310> here<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:44.120> would<00:02:44.570> not<00:02:44.780> have<00:02:44.960> been

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
here or over here it would not have been

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.540 
here or over here it would not have been
the<00:02:45.230> same<00:02:45.470> it<00:02:45.920> would<00:02:46.100> have<00:02:46.220> still<00:02:46.340> been<00:02:46.430> a

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
the same it would have still been a

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.610 
the same it would have still been a
great<00:02:46.790> shot<00:02:47.090> but<00:02:47.600> this<00:02:47.720> is<00:02:47.870> what<00:02:48.020> makes<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.380> pop

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
great shot but this is what makes it pop

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.160 
great shot but this is what makes it pop
is<00:02:48.920> having<00:02:49.400> that<00:02:49.610> simple<00:02:50.600> consistent

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
is having that simple consistent

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.740 
is having that simple consistent
background<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.760> be<00:02:52.880> right<00:02:53.060> here<00:02:53.270> in<00:02:53.330> fact<00:02:53.630> if

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
background to be right here in fact if

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.480 
background to be right here in fact if
you<00:02:53.810> see<00:02:53.960> these<00:02:54.110> twigs<00:02:54.350> up<00:02:54.530> here<00:02:54.770> one<00:02:55.310> of<00:02:55.400> these

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
you see these twigs up here one of these

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.120 
you see these twigs up here one of these
twigs<00:02:55.760> came<00:02:56.120> down<00:02:56.450> towards<00:02:57.020> her<00:02:57.200> head<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.740> so

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
twigs came down towards her head and so

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.730 
twigs came down towards her head and so
I<00:02:58.160> photoshopped<00:02:58.550> it<00:02:58.850> out<00:02:59.000> because<00:02:59.210> it<00:03:00.020> really

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
I photoshopped it out because it really

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.140 
I photoshopped it out because it really
made<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.950> difference<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:03.290> anyways<00:03:04.190> let's<00:03:04.790> have

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
made a difference so anyways let's have

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.510 
made a difference so anyways let's have
a<00:03:05.180> look<00:03:05.570> at<00:03:05.810> a<00:03:05.870> handful<00:03:06.530> of<00:03:06.650> shots<00:03:06.920> like<00:03:07.190> this

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
a look at a handful of shots like this

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.460 
a look at a handful of shots like this
and<00:03:07.820> see<00:03:08.890> just<00:03:09.890> how<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.940> looks<00:03:11.270> when<00:03:12.050> you<00:03:12.200> do<00:03:12.320> it

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
and see just how it looks when you do it

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.960 
and see just how it looks when you do it
in<00:03:12.560> all<00:03:12.800> sorts<00:03:12.830> of<00:03:13.370> different<00:03:13.520> conditions

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
in all sorts of different conditions

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.600 
in all sorts of different conditions
here<00:03:14.660> I've<00:03:14.810> got<00:03:15.530> models

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
here I've got models

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.630 
here I've got models
I've<00:03:16.700> got<00:03:17.060> portraits<00:03:17.840> of<00:03:18.020> a<00:03:18.470> couple<00:03:19.010> bride<00:03:19.490> and

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
I've got portraits of a couple bride and

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.310 
I've got portraits of a couple bride and
groom<00:03:19.880> or<00:03:20.210> engagement<00:03:20.630> session<00:03:21.140> like<00:03:21.260> this

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
groom or engagement session like this

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.220 
groom or engagement session like this
and<00:03:22.180> consistently<00:03:23.180> across<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.870> board<00:03:24.110> you

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
and consistently across the board you

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.780 
and consistently across the board you
can<00:03:24.380> see<00:03:24.500> that<00:03:24.680> each<00:03:24.860> time<00:03:24.890> I'm<00:03:25.460> doing<00:03:25.700> the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
can see that each time I'm doing the

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.230 
can see that each time I'm doing the
same<00:03:25.970> thing<00:03:26.030> I'm<00:03:26.560> framing<00:03:27.560> her<00:03:28.520> or<00:03:28.790> their

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
same thing I'm framing her or their

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
same thing I'm framing her or their
faces

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.710 
background you can see in this shot and

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.580 
background you can see in this shot and
in<00:03:37.280> this<00:03:37.430> shot<00:03:37.730> if<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.330> subject<00:03:38.960> has<00:03:39.140> darker

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.160 
in this shot if the subject has darker
hair<00:03:39.950> then<00:03:40.610> it<00:03:40.850> can<00:03:41.180> work<00:03:41.480> to<00:03:41.690> frame<00:03:41.960> them

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
hair then it can work to frame them

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.110

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.160 
this one is what these this one here is
one<00:04:03.260> of<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:04.700> more<00:04:05.120> dramatic<00:04:05.510> shots

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
one of the the more dramatic shots

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.870 
one of the the more dramatic shots
because<00:04:06.530> you<00:04:06.650> can<00:04:06.800> see<00:04:07.040> she's<00:04:07.610> wearing

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
because you can see she's wearing

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.910 
because you can see she's wearing
something<00:04:08.090> dark<00:04:08.480> and<00:04:08.720> that<00:04:09.170> background<00:04:09.770> is

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
something dark and that background is

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.730 
something dark and that background is
very<00:04:09.950> dark<00:04:10.580> deep<00:04:10.940> deep<00:04:11.210> shade<00:04:11.540> back<00:04:11.780> there<00:04:12.080> so

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
very dark deep deep shade back there so

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.030 
very dark deep deep shade back there so
that<00:04:13.010> RIM<00:04:13.250> light<00:04:13.490> really<00:04:13.730> sets<00:04:14.240> it<00:04:14.390> off<00:04:14.570> and<00:04:15.040> so

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
that RIM light really sets it off and so

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.190 
that RIM light really sets it off and so
that's<00:04:16.579> that's<00:04:17.209> how<00:04:17.450> it<00:04:17.630> look<00:04:17.930> works

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
that's that's how it look works

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.280 
that's that's how it look works
consistently<00:04:19.130> across<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.700> board<00:04:19.970> and<00:04:20.290> this

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
consistently across the board and this

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.080 
consistently across the board and this
is<00:04:21.440> a<00:04:21.470> this<00:04:21.799> is<00:04:21.920> just<00:04:22.130> the<00:04:22.220> starting<00:04:22.580> point<00:04:22.640> for

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
is a this is just the starting point for

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.400 
is a this is just the starting point for
your<00:04:23.270> portrait<00:04:23.720> session

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
your portrait session

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.680 
your portrait session
what<00:04:25.220> I<00:04:25.250> would<00:04:25.430> do<00:04:25.580> is<00:04:25.760> I<00:04:25.970> would<00:04:26.000> have<00:04:26.360> I<00:04:26.540> would

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
what I would do is I would have I would

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.390 
what I would do is I would have I would
look<00:04:26.810> for<00:04:27.020> shade<00:04:27.260> I<00:04:27.500> would<00:04:27.830> find<00:04:28.190> some

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
look for shade I would find some

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.040 
look for shade I would find some
sunlight<00:04:28.880> of<00:04:29.390> course<00:04:29.600> you<00:04:29.690> can<00:04:29.810> also<00:04:29.930> take

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
sunlight of course you can also take

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.840 
sunlight of course you can also take
pictures<00:04:30.380> in<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:30.920> shade<00:04:31.160> and<00:04:31.190> get<00:04:31.490> some<00:04:31.700> more

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
pictures in the shade and get some more

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.690 
pictures in the shade and get some more
softer<00:04:32.330> gentler<00:04:32.600> portraits<00:04:33.500> but<00:04:34.160> I<00:04:34.190> would<00:04:34.520> I

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
softer gentler portraits but I would I

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.280

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
situations and in this situation here

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.010 
situations and in this situation here
you<00:05:31.400> know<00:05:31.520> I've<00:05:31.640> got<00:05:31.820> bright<00:05:32.120> Sun<00:05:32.450> everywhere

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
it's really really kind of a cluttery

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.740 
it's really really kind of a cluttery
type<00:05:36.230> of<00:05:36.410> shot<00:05:36.650> but<00:05:37.520> I<00:05:37.550> intentionally<00:05:38.030> framed

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
type of shot but I intentionally framed

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.350 
type of shot but I intentionally framed
it<00:05:38.900> so<00:05:39.050> that<00:05:39.290> again<00:05:39.830> head<00:05:40.130> and<00:05:40.250> shoulders<00:05:40.640> dark

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
it so that again head and shoulders dark

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.830 
it so that again head and shoulders dark
background<00:05:42.010> shade<00:05:43.010> for<00:05:43.730> the<00:05:43.850> for<00:05:44.240> the<00:05:44.360> face

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
background shade for the for the face

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.530

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.540 
and boom that's that's the technique

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.750 
and boom that's that's the technique
right<00:05:47.750> there<00:05:47.810> so<00:05:48.590> same<00:05:48.919> thing<00:05:48.950> for<00:05:49.370> these<00:05:49.460> type

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
right there so same thing for these type

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
saying cheese but you're still you're

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.720 
saying cheese but you're still you're
still<00:05:56.990> going<00:05:57.440> for<00:05:57.620> that<00:05:57.680> same<00:05:57.950> composition

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:58.730

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.640 
still going for that same composition
framing<00:05:59.690> them<00:05:59.810> against<00:06:00.200> a<00:06:00.290> shadowy

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
framing them against a shadowy

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.290 
framing them against a shadowy
background<00:06:01.250> so<00:06:01.400> it<00:06:01.490> kind<00:06:01.669> of<00:06:01.730> sets<00:06:01.940> off<00:06:02.120> the

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
background so it kind of sets off the

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.390 
background so it kind of sets off the
light<00:06:02.510> and<00:06:02.919> even<00:06:03.919> if<00:06:04.010> they're<00:06:04.130> not<00:06:04.250> even

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
looking at the camera at all like in

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.300 
looking at the camera at all like in
this<00:06:05.900> shot<00:06:06.200> they're<00:06:06.830> you<00:06:07.100> know<00:06:07.130> they're

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
this shot they're you know they're

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.580 
this shot they're you know they're
walking<00:06:07.669> away<00:06:07.790> I'm<00:06:08.450> still<00:06:08.810> I'm<00:06:08.990> framing<00:06:09.290> them

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
walking away I'm still I'm framing them

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.620 
walking away I'm still I'm framing them
here<00:06:09.950> I'm<00:06:10.070> letting<00:06:10.970> this<00:06:11.180> bright<00:06:11.600> area

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
here I'm letting this bright area

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.620 
here I'm letting this bright area
because<00:06:12.470> it's<00:06:12.770> it's<00:06:13.190> a<00:06:13.280> backlit<00:06:13.730> shot<00:06:14.060> this<00:06:14.480> is

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
because it's it's a backlit shot this is

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.300 
because it's it's a backlit shot this is
totally<00:06:14.900> blown<00:06:15.140> out<00:06:15.320> but<00:06:15.740> it<00:06:15.830> doesn't<00:06:16.010> matter

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
totally blown out but it doesn't matter

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.159 
totally blown out but it doesn't matter
because<00:06:16.790> this<00:06:17.090> is<00:06:17.360> where<00:06:17.540> the<00:06:17.660> viewers<00:06:17.960> eye

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169 
because this is where the viewers eye

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.060 
because this is where the viewers eye
goes<00:06:18.760> see<00:06:19.760> what<00:06:19.880> I<00:06:19.940> mean<00:06:20.090> and<00:06:20.650> check<00:06:21.650> this<00:06:21.830> out

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
goes see what I mean and check this out

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.330 
goes see what I mean and check this out
it<00:06:22.280> can<00:06:22.430> work<00:06:22.760> even<00:06:23.060> for<00:06:23.780> family<00:06:24.260> formal<00:06:25.040> well

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
it can work even for family formal well

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.550 
it can work even for family formal well
enough<00:06:25.610> formal<00:06:26.240> but<00:06:26.419> you<00:06:26.780> know<00:06:26.900> just<00:06:27.080> casual

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:39.389 
a little a little bit here and there but

they're facing away from the Sun you've
got<00:06:41.610> that<00:06:41.759> RIM<00:06:42.029> light<00:06:42.059> and<00:06:42.509> what<00:06:43.020> sets<00:06:43.289> off<00:06:43.469> the

got that RIM light and what sets off the

got that RIM light and what sets off the
rim<00:06:43.830> light<00:06:44.039> is<00:06:44.249> the<00:06:44.369> fact<00:06:44.639> that<00:06:44.789> the

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:45.029 
rim light is the fact that the

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:47.450 
rim light is the fact that the
background<00:06:45.509> behind<00:06:45.689> them<00:06:46.110> is<00:06:46.289> darker<00:06:46.740> if<00:06:46.919> I

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
background behind them is darker if I

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.579 
background behind them is darker if I
had<00:06:47.669> shot<00:06:48.389> at<00:06:48.539> a<00:06:48.599> lower<00:06:48.809> angle<00:06:49.080> and<00:06:49.469> their

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:49.589 
had shot at a lower angle and their

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:51.829 
had shot at a lower angle and their
heads<00:06:49.860> were<00:06:50.039> against<00:06:50.520> all<00:06:50.699> these<00:06:50.879> trees<00:06:51.539> and

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:51.839 
heads were against all these trees and

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:54.829 
heads were against all these trees and
the<00:06:52.469> bright<00:06:52.710> Sun<00:06:53.069> the<00:06:53.759> shot<00:06:54.029> would<00:06:54.270> have<00:06:54.569> been

00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:54.839 
the bright Sun the shot would have been

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:57.170 
the bright Sun the shot would have been
ruined<00:06:55.379> so<00:06:55.919> I'm<00:06:56.069> intentionally<00:06:56.430> getting<00:06:57.059> a

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
ruined so I'm intentionally getting a

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.939 
ruined so I'm intentionally getting a
higher<00:06:57.389> angle<00:06:57.689> I<00:06:58.080> might<00:06:58.259> have<00:06:58.349> had<00:06:58.439> to<00:06:58.499> hold<00:06:58.800> my

00:06:58.939 --> 00:06:58.949 
higher angle I might have had to hold my

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:01.070 
higher angle I might have had to hold my
