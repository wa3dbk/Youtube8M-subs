same watch this is a Steinhardt Nabi and

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.020 
same watch this is a Steinhardt Nabi and
this<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.910> it's<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.000> Nabi<00:00:36.180> uhr<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.820> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
this is it's a Nabi uhr and this is the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.840 
this is it's a Nabi uhr and this is the
44<00:00:39.719> millimeter<00:00:42.379> it's<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.530> hole<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.520> solid

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
44 millimeter it's a hole it's a solid

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.420 
44 millimeter it's a hole it's a solid
bronze<00:00:45.030> case<00:00:45.860> and<00:00:46.860> that's<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.190> liked

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
bronze case and that's what I liked

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.000 
bronze case and that's what I liked
about<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.730> bronze<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.500> it<00:00:49.500> doesn't<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.860> any

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
about the bronze is it doesn't have any

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.630 
about the bronze is it doesn't have any
kind<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.250> coating<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.390> bronze<00:00:51.690> will

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
kind of coating so the bronze will

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.270 
kind of coating so the bronze will
patina<00:00:53.640> over<00:00:53.969> time<00:00:57.530> but<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.620> like<00:00:58.800> it's<00:00:58.980> just<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
patina over time but I like it's just a

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.900 
patina over time but I like it's just a
simple<00:00:59.640> watch<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.149> mechanic<00:01:00.750> mechanical

a cheap watch but it's also not a

a cheap watch but it's also not a
high-end<00:01:39.890> watch<00:01:39.980> this<00:01:40.640> one<00:01:40.910> I<00:01:41.950> believe<00:01:42.950> what

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
high-end watch this one I believe what

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.890 
high-end watch this one I believe what
the<00:01:44.080> euro<00:01:45.080> to<00:01:45.230> dollar<00:01:45.500> was<00:01:46.220> a<00:01:46.750> little<00:01:47.750> bit

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
the euro to dollar was a little bit

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.780 
the euro to dollar was a little bit
under<00:01:48.200> five<00:01:48.410> hundred<00:01:50.470> but<00:01:51.470> I<00:01:51.740> had<00:01:51.980> a<00:01:52.460> few

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
under five hundred but I had a few

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.220 
under five hundred but I had a few
knives<00:01:53.060> that<00:01:53.330> were<00:01:53.450> just<00:01:53.720> sitting<00:01:54.200> there

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
knives that were just sitting there

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.400 
knives that were just sitting there
doing<00:01:54.620> nothing<00:01:54.800> so<00:01:55.520> I<00:01:55.790> let<00:01:56.630> those<00:01:56.810> go<00:01:57.110> so<00:01:57.350> I

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
doing nothing so I let those go so I

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
doing nothing so I let those go so I
could<00:01:57.590> get<00:01:57.710> a<00:01:57.770> new<00:01:57.920> watch

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
could get a new watch

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.460 
could get a new watch

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.260 
and it comes with a brown strap I
actually<00:02:00.680> put<00:02:01.040> a<00:02:01.070> black<00:02:01.340> strap<00:02:01.700> on<00:02:01.880> this<00:02:02.060> one

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.040 
actually put a black strap on this one
of<00:02:02.390> them<00:02:02.510> and<00:02:02.900> I'm<00:02:02.990> currently<00:02:03.500> making<00:02:03.890> a<00:02:04.370> new

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
of them and I'm currently making a new

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.040 
of them and I'm currently making a new
black<00:02:06.050> leather<00:02:06.350> strap<00:02:06.710> for<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.630> but<00:02:08.630> I<00:02:08.660> like<00:02:08.869> to

black leather strap for it but I like to

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.040 
black leather strap for it but I like to
weigh<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.440> black<00:02:09.649> really<00:02:09.950> kind<00:02:10.220> of<00:02:11.020> with<00:02:12.020> a

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
weigh the black really kind of with a

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.860 
weigh the black really kind of with a
contrast<00:02:12.650> set<00:02:12.890> off<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.220> bronze<00:02:13.900> but<00:02:14.900> that<00:02:15.290> is

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
contrast set off the bronze but that is

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.230 
contrast set off the bronze but that is
my<00:02:17.870> Steinhardt<00:02:18.730> another<00:02:19.730> watch<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:20.060> got<00:02:20.180> a

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
my Steinhardt another watch I got a

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.410 
my Steinhardt another watch I got a
while<00:02:20.390> back<00:02:20.690> on<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.050> trade<00:02:21.410> that<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:23.120> really

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
while back on the trade that I really

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.900 
while back on the trade that I really
like<00:02:23.660> is<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:25.190> one<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.820> this<00:02:26.330> is<00:02:27.670> this<00:02:28.670> is<00:02:28.730> a

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
like is this one and this is this is a

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.360 
like is this one and this is this is a
Christopher<00:02:29.540> Ward<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.620> it's<00:02:30.800> an<00:02:30.920> automatic

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
Christopher Ward and it's an automatic

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.490 
Christopher Ward and it's an automatic
which<00:02:32.360> is<00:02:32.510> mechanical<00:02:33.260> it's<00:02:33.440> not<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.650> quartz

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
which is mechanical it's not a quartz

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.860 
which is mechanical it's not a quartz
but<00:02:36.500> kind<00:02:36.800> of<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:37.840> aviation<00:02:38.840> design<00:02:39.170> on<00:02:39.500> it<00:02:40.870> this

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
but kind of a aviation design on it this

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.210 
but kind of a aviation design on it this
watch<00:02:42.080> is<00:02:42.110> really<00:02:43.100> really<00:02:43.820> accurate<00:02:44.650> I<00:02:45.650> think

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
watch is really really accurate I think

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.880 
watch is really really accurate I think
it<00:02:46.550> gains<00:02:46.820> maybe<00:02:47.420> two<00:02:47.900> seconds<00:02:48.380> a<00:02:48.470> day<00:02:48.620> and

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
it gains maybe two seconds a day and

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.940 
it gains maybe two seconds a day and
four<00:02:49.100> you<00:02:49.340> know<00:02:49.459> mechanical<00:02:50.060> that's<00:02:50.950> really

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
four you know mechanical that's really

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.930 
four you know mechanical that's really
good<00:02:52.160> and<00:02:52.780> this<00:02:53.780> is<00:02:54.020> a<00:02:54.489> aftermarket<00:02:55.489> strap<00:02:55.790> I

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
good and this is a aftermarket strap I

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.350 
good and this is a aftermarket strap I
have<00:02:56.090> on<00:02:56.300> it<00:02:59.560> but<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.590> real<00:03:00.800> nice<00:03:01.010> watch<00:03:01.360> and

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
have on it but a real nice watch and

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.000 
have on it but a real nice watch and
this<00:03:02.450> one<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:02.959> believe<00:03:03.320> is<00:03:03.650> also<00:03:03.800> a<00:03:04.040> 44<00:03:06.010> the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
this one I believe is also a 44 the

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.560 
this one I believe is also a 44 the
Steinhardt<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:07.700> believe<00:03:07.880> looks<00:03:08.150> a<00:03:08.239> little<00:03:08.330> bit

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
Steinhardt I believe looks a little bit

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:17.920 
Steinhardt I believe looks a little bit
bigger<00:03:09.170> because<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:13.340> have<00:03:13.489> that<00:03:13.730> thin<00:03:14.180> I<00:03:16.930> mean

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
bigger because you have that thin I mean

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.260 
bigger because you have that thin I mean
know<00:03:18.170> what<00:03:18.200> you<00:03:18.350> call<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:18.680> a<00:03:19.180> bezel<00:03:20.180> around

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
know what you call it a bezel around

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.990 
know what you call it a bezel around
here<00:03:20.720> but<00:03:21.440> that's<00:03:21.590> thinner<00:03:22.070> so<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.550> makes<00:03:22.850> it

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
here but that's thinner so it makes it

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.800 
here but that's thinner so it makes it
look<00:03:23.180> a<00:03:23.450> little<00:03:23.570> bit<00:03:23.810> larger<00:03:24.910> but<00:03:25.910> I<00:03:25.940> think<00:03:26.239> 44

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
look a little bit larger but I think 44

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.990 
look a little bit larger but I think 44
is<00:03:26.959> kind<00:03:27.230> of<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.410> size<00:03:27.620> I<00:03:27.830> like<00:03:28.010> with<00:03:28.280> watches

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.400 

and<00:03:31.720> so<00:03:32.080> that's<00:03:32.920> those<00:03:33.760> two<00:03:34.120> watches<00:03:34.600> in<00:03:34.840> this

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
and so that's those two watches in this

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.660 
and so that's those two watches in this
next<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:38.470> watch<00:03:38.790> this<00:03:39.790> one<00:03:40.060> was<00:03:40.390> actually<00:03:41.670> my

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
next to watch this one was actually my

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.040 
next to watch this one was actually my
father's<00:03:43.120> watch

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
father's watch

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.680 
father's watch
he<00:03:44.350> passed<00:03:44.620> away<00:03:44.770> in<00:03:44.980> 99<00:03:45.520> and<00:03:45.970> this<00:03:46.270> was<00:03:46.450> just

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
he passed away in 99 and this was just

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.230 
he passed away in 99 and this was just
in<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.870> box<00:03:47.050> and<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:47.830> just<00:03:48.370> assumed<00:03:48.760> for<00:03:49.060> some

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
in a box and I just assumed for some

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.900 
in a box and I just assumed for some
reason<00:03:49.540> that<00:03:49.630> it<00:03:49.750> was<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.870> quartz<00:03:50.230> watch<00:03:50.820> but<00:03:51.820> it

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
reason that it was a quartz watch but it

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.550 
reason that it was a quartz watch but it
turns<00:03:52.120> out<00:03:52.240> to<00:03:52.300> be<00:03:52.420> a<00:03:52.740> Walkman<00:03:55.020> this<00:03:56.020> is<00:03:56.230> a<00:03:56.260> mid

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
turns out to be a Walkman this is a mid

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.730 
turns out to be a Walkman this is a mid
70s<00:03:57.280> chronograph<00:03:59.010> hand<00:04:00.010> wined<00:04:00.960> but<00:04:01.960> a<00:04:01.990> Walkman

believe<00:04:07.390> and<00:04:07.540> this<00:04:07.630> is<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:07.780> Swiss<00:04:08.050> made<00:04:08.350> watch

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
believe and this is a Swiss made watch

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:17.970 
believe and this is a Swiss made watch
kind<00:04:11.380> of<00:04:11.470> a<00:04:11.530> classic<00:04:14.850> 70s<00:04:15.850> design<00:04:16.540> on<00:04:16.780> it<00:04:16.980> it

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
kind of a classic 70s design on it it

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.550 
kind of a classic 70s design on it it
was<00:04:18.100> in<00:04:18.280> such<00:04:18.549> poor<00:04:18.820> shape<00:04:19.180> when<00:04:20.080> I<00:04:20.109> dug<00:04:20.350> it<00:04:20.500> out

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
was in such poor shape when I dug it out

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.940 
was in such poor shape when I dug it out
of<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.769> box<00:04:21.010> I<00:04:21.370> had<00:04:22.030> this<00:04:22.360> in<00:04:23.169> a<00:04:23.290> refurbished

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
of the box I had this in a refurbished

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.380 
of the box I had this in a refurbished
where<00:04:24.160> they<00:04:24.280> went<00:04:24.460> through<00:04:24.820> put<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:25.240> new

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
where they went through put a new

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.720 
where they went through put a new
crystal<00:04:25.810> on<00:04:27.390> buff<00:04:28.390> the<00:04:28.630> back<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:30.280> then<00:04:30.400> I<00:04:30.520> put

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
crystal on buff the back and then I put

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.700

a<00:04:30.760> different<00:04:31.630> strap<00:04:31.930> on<00:04:32.169> I<00:04:32.290> need<00:04:32.350> to<00:04:32.560> get<00:04:32.680> a

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
a different strap on I need to get a

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.220 
a different strap on I need to get a
proper<00:04:32.950> strap<00:04:33.430> for<00:04:33.760> it<00:04:33.910> but<00:04:34.150> right<00:04:35.020> now<00:04:35.080> I

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
proper strap for it but right now I

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.980 
proper strap for it but right now I
think<00:04:35.530> it<00:04:35.680> kind<00:04:36.070> of<00:04:36.130> goes<00:04:36.370> well<00:04:36.700> but<00:04:37.660> this<00:04:37.810> one

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
think it kind of goes well but this one

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.140 
think it kind of goes well but this one

your stop you know stop time rather than

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
your reset but this is probably probably

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.219

I did have it serviced once

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.760 
I did have it serviced once
back<00:05:44.610> in<00:05:46.069> 2002<00:05:47.900> and<00:05:48.900> it's<00:05:49.319> due<00:05:49.500> for<00:05:49.710> a

watch<00:05:53.849> if<00:05:54.240> I<00:05:54.389> get<00:05:54.569> a<00:05:54.599> little<00:05:55.050> bitter<00:05:59.330> picture

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330

on<00:06:00.419> this<00:06:00.629> one<00:06:00.870> but<00:06:01.139> I<00:06:01.409> believe<00:06:02.069> this<00:06:02.580> is<00:06:02.639> a<00:06:03.090> 37

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
on this one but I believe this is a 37

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.020 
on this one but I believe this is a 37
or<00:06:04.110> 38<00:06:04.139> and<00:06:04.949> it<00:06:05.099> seems<00:06:05.370> so<00:06:06.000> much<00:06:06.300> smaller<00:06:06.539> than

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
or 38 and it seems so much smaller than

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.439 
or 38 and it seems so much smaller than
like<00:06:09.030> the<00:06:09.210> 44<00:06:10.310> but<00:06:11.310> also<00:06:11.550> it's<00:06:11.879> not<00:06:12.120> just<00:06:12.180> kind

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
like the 44 but also it's not just kind

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:19.580 
like the 44 but also it's not just kind
of<00:06:12.509> a<00:06:12.599> classic<00:06:13.430> Rolex<00:06:14.430> design<00:06:17.690> and<00:06:18.690> that's<00:06:19.110> it

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
of a classic Rolex design and that's it

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:25.220
