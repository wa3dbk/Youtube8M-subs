00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 very good to all these butterfield 4 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.020
 in a gameplay about access in mountains 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.450
 guilin and 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.240
 this is the first gameplay so much that 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.520
 game like I rise up is when 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.469
 aerial suggestion with helicopters yo 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.400
 I thought there were only airplanes and 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.820
 just surprise and 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.440
 that there are also helicopters I do not know if 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:29.510
 It will be fun if it will be 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:31.760
 if it will be quite entertaining to play your 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.010
 fish tank with helicopters since it is a 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.570
 gameplay is a way to play pretty 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.450
 slower what 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.750
 that with planes with him with planes and 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.690
 the rest 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.620
 but let's see if a good game comes out 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.329
 and 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.879
 today I'm just going to go up as well 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.300
 I commented on the previous video a gameplay 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.860
 of sober fair for the theme that I have 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.130
 of exams that I'm studying in 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.380
 the university 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.320
 and that I do not have much time these days 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.650
 to upload videos since I have the 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.590
 partial seconds of the year and that 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:13.130
 it will obviously we are not falling 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.280
 I can and it's obviously going to give 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.640
 much more effort and much more I will give 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.950
 much more time to study than to go up 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.540
 videos but anyway I would 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.080
 I promise to upload a video every day 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.080
 as always 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.060
 I'm going to play a game because 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.770
 and entertainment for me there is no life or 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.080
 whether he was studying all his life 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.420
 without being able to play without being able to go out with my 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.119
 friends 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.119
 the truth is that it would not be life that does not 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.640
 ok and we kill this I do not know if also 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.950
 there seems to be a flag 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.900
 a flag and who controls it supposes 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.510
 who wins the game because if there is only 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.230
 a flag and I guess this will go like 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.390
 in his aerial aircraft expertise is worth this 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.280
 it crashes with sights to its periphery of 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.490
 airplanes because the one that controls flag is 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.310
 the one that will win so 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:25.510
 let's see if we launch missiles at this 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.510
 elusive hands 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.420
 in help elimination 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.780
 we make a small turn and we are 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.630
 falling mayday mayday mayday no no no no 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.230
 no not worth 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.420
 I think we've fallen I think also 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.480
 can enter the helicopter as a copilot 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.100
 in his aerial expertise but I'm not 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.070
 completely safe 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.530
 to see if it seems that the patrols are of 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.420
 two people one is 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.360
 one is the pilot and others always the 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.600
 co-pilot even if he is not sure, maybe 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.640
 maybe yes and marshall 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.250
 our patrol teammate throws himself a 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.080
 helicopter I could get myself to him not what 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.390
 I know because it 's the first one I play as 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.110
 I have told you and it does not look like much 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.410
 theme worth 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.970
 we got a 3 2 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.590
 that is not bad for the first 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.459
 game that I do of this style to see 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.340
 let's finish with launching missiles at this 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.170
 helicopter from here 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.170
 and eludes them 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.030
 we throw the flares 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.180
 and we kill ourselves if you have not killed the 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.870
 helicopter gunner as has been 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.360
 said star since it's supposed to 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.860
 our patrol partner I think 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.970
 that not only your partner but because 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.400
 anyone can get into your 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.770
 helicopter as long as you finish 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.500
 appear in the area 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.470
 so now I prefer to be 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.370
 gunner that pilot pilot is not given to me 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.489
 bad but I'm better at artillery 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:08.510
 and we're going to lose the game we're worth 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.860
 lost the game but in the end I did not 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.569
 has done so badly the game has been 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.150
 more or less well within what is my 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.890
 team 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.690
 and I think I will have gotten the best 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.690
 some point or some unlocking I do not know 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.780
 we've got two gallons 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:27.490
 got two balls yes 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.360
 some points to unlock 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.960
 helicopter here to unlock the 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:36.260
 extinguisher so good guys this has 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.520
 been this is the this is one of the 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.620
 videos that I will upload today or I will upload 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.630
 two because this the truth is that it has been 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.120
 other short video will not know if 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.100
 team deathmatch or 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.930
 I jump in some way that I do not 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.950
 take a long time since as I have 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.380
 said I'm with exams and I can not 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.720
 dedicate as much time as usual 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.030
 to upload videos but good I hope that you 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.920
 like this video 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.710
 give favorite likes and try 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:07.990
 a bit then recommend the video and the 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:12.120
 channel to your friends and so on so 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.120
 this is all see you later and goodbye
