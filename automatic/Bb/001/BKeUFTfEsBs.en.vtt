00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
think it's really important if I'm

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.910 
think it's really important if I'm
honest<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.989> most<00:02:24.170> important<00:02:24.590> thing<00:02:24.739> is<00:02:24.890> that

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
honest the most important thing is that

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.040 
honest the most important thing is that
we're<00:02:25.489> winning<00:02:25.760> games<00:02:25.940> again<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:26.450> that's

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
we're winning games again and that's

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.360 
we're winning games again and that's
what<00:02:27.170> they<00:02:27.260> want<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.530> see<00:02:27.680> that's<00:02:28.099> what<00:02:28.280> they

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
what they want to see that's what they

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.210 
what they want to see that's what they
believe<00:02:28.730> in<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:29.060> think<00:02:29.810> they've<00:02:29.959> got<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:33.220> group

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
believe in I think they've got a group

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.979 
believe in I think they've got a group
that<00:02:34.400> could<00:02:34.580> excite<00:02:34.910> them<00:02:35.150> this<00:02:35.300> year<00:02:35.360> you

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
that could excite them this year you

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.540 
that could excite them this year you
know<00:02:36.020> we've<00:02:36.319> got<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.620> lot<00:02:36.830> of<00:02:36.860> pace<00:02:37.130> in<00:02:37.400> and

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
know we've got a lot of pace in and

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.280 
know we've got a lot of pace in and
around<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.910> squad<00:02:38.239> it's<00:02:38.660> getting<00:02:38.989> it<00:02:39.080> on<00:02:39.170> the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
around the squad it's getting it on the

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.110 
around the squad it's getting it on the
pitch<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.770> doing<00:02:40.069> using<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:40.790> in<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:40.970> right

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
pitch and doing using it in the right

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.880 
pitch and doing using it in the right
manner<00:02:41.360> which<00:02:41.870> were<00:02:42.019> managing<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.560> do<00:02:42.680> at<00:02:42.830> the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
manner which were managing to do at the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.930 
manner which were managing to do at the
moment<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.959> i<00:02:45.620> think<00:02:45.860> it's<00:02:46.099> a<00:02:46.340> it's<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.760> nice

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940
