00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.480
 good today I bring you the review of the 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.199
 double wear light makeup base 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.779
 the estee eluder finally because almost 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:18.880
 I laugh when I do not run out of battery 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.509
 from the camera I had to leave 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.640
 running in the middle of video when not 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:27.860
 he recorded happily and then had all 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.789
 the painted lips of a 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.720
 a purple lipstick 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.450
 very elegant 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.540
 so now I'm not going fast now 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.660
 tell you the impressions and I'm going to 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.040
 leave then mounted as I applied it 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.520
 and all that, taking advantage of the fact that he has recorded 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.140
 the base of lancôme and so we already 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.390
 we removed state on that I think that 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.239
 it deserves a lot 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.370
 this time of makeup I discovered it by 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.170
 elena den euros in videos if not the 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.710
 you know you are late I will leave you 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.170
 also if I remember your channel or by the 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.290
 screen or in the information box and 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.910
 is that we have pretty similar skin 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.040
 throws fat although there are seasons in 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.590
 that maybe some area is a 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.630
 little bit more rebellious last summer I had 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.450
 a wedding and I rushed there to adventure 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.930
 girls do not do this normally 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:24.160
 bullet anecdote 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:28.710
 and had a sample of this base in addition 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.710
 it was the 3.0 tone that is the one that I have 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.990
 I launched myself I saw that it was my color I went with 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.570
 Elena's closed eyes and I put it on 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.540
 for the wedding I was a lot of 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.320
 hours equal 12 hours and only 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.090
 I needed to touch up with these papers 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.509
 matificantes a little the zone of the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.119
 nose 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.860
 then I flip walk saying this base 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.710
 it has to be mine but let's start with the 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.140
 beginning my tone is 3.0 in Spain 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.110
 I think there are 10 available 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.570
 contains 30 milliliters and has a date 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.340
 of expiration from 24 months to today 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.500
 I have very clear 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.359
 that the day I ran out I 'm going to 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.640
 replenish has sun protection factor 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.739
 10 actually for a factor of 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.900
 protection on the low so I do not know why 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.519
 what do you put them because you can make the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.290
 you will see that a little bit in photos or you can do 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.540
 which is not and is a protection factor 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.890
 solar so small that it's supposed to 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.470
 good to be grateful but 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.180
 so small does something texture is 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.480
 pretty light I know there are many 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.730
 people in love with the original of the 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.099
 base of having web 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.510
 but there are others that I throw a little 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.580
 back because that is very thick 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.460
 well with this you do not have that problem is 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.220
 quite light and it works very well 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.460
 is perfectly with the skin will 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.830
 applied with brushes type f 80 of 82 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.320
 of sigma like with the female act if 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.780
 I want to be more precise to go more slowly 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.090
 also with sponges and even with 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.730
 fingers and applying it with your fingers 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.130
 neither does it give me more fat, so it's a 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.420
 base that behave well so I have 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.070
 to insist a little for example on the 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.110
 area of ​​the nose for the theme of the 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.230
 pores so they are not marked then 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.420
 I insist there is a little bit 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.870
 gentlemen by escola base and the effect 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.870
 it looks good 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.780
 Y 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.440
 this is the result of the base with nothing 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.750
 only the base you see that the dark circles 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.549
 covers them quite well and unifies the 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.409
 eyelid tone when I do this what 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.989
 I do is use a pre-base so that the 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.640
 base is there more settled and remains 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.579
 Pretty pretty much covers me 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.010
 everything insists a little more here that I have 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.900
 a redness and I think more or less the 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.449
 coverage and the finish is nice there what 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.960
 you are seeing me I like to seal it 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:31.479
 and usually use or more loose or 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.210
 compact indistinctly but that are 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.979
 the above apply finite and thus get 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.320
 hold makeup a little more 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.930
 they endure many hours without glare and 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.510
 I said it by making August calorazo 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.400
 what a cloth 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.680
 but in all the ways I like it 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.090
 seal the soil seal it with powder 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.700
 translucent or powders that have a 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.410
 very soft color and so I go more 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.360
 quiet yes it was used days 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.700
 followed without any problems of 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.760
 that I have granite and its price I have seen 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.130
 which is between 28 and 39 euros is 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.930
 a pretty big margin as always 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.300
 I tell you compare because there are pages in 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.450
 which is cheaper to buy it in 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.400
 the English cut is a past the pasta 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.650
 asking for it but if you have the 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.680
 oily skin and even if you have the skin 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.350
 mixed I think is a base that yes that 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.830
 I recommend because it never hurts 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.480
 have a base as a base 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.260
 to get you out of trouble 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:31.170
 I have more and when I'm going to play it safe 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.390
 I need to have makeup 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.660
 impeccable for a lot of hours 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.090
 shot of this 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.090
 eight hours have passed and this is the 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.010
 result of how the skin is now 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.170
 I would need to touch up the area a bit 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.320
 the nose and especially the forehead that is 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:50.000
 where I notice that some glitters come out 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.550
 but otherwise doing that little 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.290
 retouching as I said before with a 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.420
 anti- glare sheet and is that almost no 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:00.380
 you need neither nor seal with powders 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:02.840
 above that has been everything I hope that you 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.250
 I liked it takes a lot with desire 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.170
 to teach you this base you have 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.900
 asked quite a lot when he's gone 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.270
 uploading to Instagram above all the 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.880
 ingredients of the day that I put you then 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:17.180
 what I use to make up and I hope 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.550
 that the curiosity that you had and all 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.590
 things have been sated thanks for 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.340
 see me for being there and see you in the 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.190
 next 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:29.030
 take number 1,000 of the base 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:33.449
 makeup double wear light of styles 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:35.610
 good to all good to all this base 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:38.010
 of makeup is the light version of the 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.930
 famous double wear that I never tried it 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.870
 because it seemed too square 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:45.000
 too heavy on the skin like that 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.699
 had excessive coverage and that 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.500
 it left the cardboard face does not whiten in 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:52.229
 photography is not like that something that you notice 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.850
 a lot although if you look with a lot of flash 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:55.770
 Well yes you can notice a little 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.270
 they present it to us as a base of 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.919
 makeup for all skin types 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:02.250
 I have to say that if you have the skin 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:04.169
 I would not recommend it dry because 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.300
 surely yes that would mark these zones 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:07.710
 that are drier to me has happened to me 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.720
 once in the nose and I have some 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:12.810
 pinch or something like that is marked but 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.020
 taking care to hydrate well is 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.490
 It melts very well the texture is light 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.800
 stoned has an average coverage that 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.300
 we can modulate a bit in the most areas 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.889
 problematic as you have seen by 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.249
 example in my area here in the 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:28.259
 the dark circles 

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:28.259
 although it does not 

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.430
 if you have the ojera very marked as I 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.990
 we camouflage it completely but yes it 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.000
 note an important difference you have 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:40.300
 seen in the application does not transfer 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.800
 much something if transferred in the advertises 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.300
 it does not transfer anything a little 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.110
 yes it transfers but it is forgivable 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.110
 totally
