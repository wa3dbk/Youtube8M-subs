hey youtube this is evan magician 34 and
I<00:00:03.480> have<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:04.049> long-awaited<00:00:04.730> new<00:00:05.730> format

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
I have the long-awaited new format

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.820 
I have the long-awaited new format
approved<00:00:06.799> Obelisk<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:08.069> Tormentor<00:00:08.790> deck<00:00:09.830> so

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
approved Obelisk the Tormentor deck so

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.580 
approved Obelisk the Tormentor deck so
it's<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:12.000> little<00:00:12.150> changed<00:00:12.509> up<00:00:12.690> not<00:00:13.349> just<00:00:13.380> for

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
it's a little changed up not just for

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.870 
it's a little changed up not just for
the<00:00:13.710> format<00:00:14.009> but<00:00:14.190> we've<00:00:14.280> actually<00:00:14.309> improved

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
the format but we've actually improved

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.980 
the format but we've actually improved
it<00:00:15.059> some<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.509> think<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.809> actually

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
it some so I think this actually

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.810 
it some so I think this actually
benefited<00:00:16.740> from<00:00:16.859> all<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.190> changes<00:00:17.550> since<00:00:17.699> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
benefited from all the changes since the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.000 
benefited from all the changes since the
last<00:00:17.970> time<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.359> deck<00:00:18.570> was<00:00:18.750> built<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.650> here<00:00:19.949> we
