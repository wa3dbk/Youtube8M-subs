00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.610
 missions of the quinté plus and 5-5 for 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.080

 hello mathieu hello philippe hello 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.619
 to all alain mathieu 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.180
 that's it things start 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.279
 truly to vincennes price of 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.510
 boissy-saint-lighthouse 4 and 5 years of 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.990
 quality horses that we will see again 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.930
 throughout the winter 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.279
 yes it's categories where the category 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.510
 of property where they have a lot of 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.850
 races during the winter so that's right 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.739
 we're going to have to go see you again 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.059
 badly of times and so it's going to be a 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.920
 race where we will be able to take 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.180
 notes for the sequel I think okay 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.100
 well precisely by the note we are already going 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.590
 see your selection for this 5 5 you 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.620
 listen in mind I tried the 4 stelton 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.410
 then the 9 moving of 3.26 from the abbey 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.050
 the hermine varades say amber mail 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.360
 this artist of elbows on the 6th in anna 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.730
 knicks and the 15 picone so concerning 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.579
 your favorite number 4 stelton he has 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.109
 shown big fat means in suede we have 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.789
 an ascent that can hit entrance 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.439
 for his debut at vincennes 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.119
 as often with foreigners but 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.189
 these are the choices that are foreign to 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.180
 finally we realize that when 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.189
 they come to us they do not have 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.630
 really their gain what is a horse 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.700
 hours in Sweden there you down there 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.140
 support justice so support justice 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.700
 he is the winner of the European Championship 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.869
 five years before the town recently 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.850
 mystic and all his choices 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.530
 so there he runs a race close this 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.630
 horse there will be deferré of the four feet 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.740
 he shot on the 4th it's not a big horse 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.780
 it's a little horse but their little one 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.909
 speed horse so 2100 meters that's 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.500
 in the middle of this sport, that's often like 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.479
 says the strangers the first to 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.460
 Vincennes is often so good at 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.750
 pure paper my need they adapt to 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.920
 vincennes it's more on a stroke of 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.360
 poker because it's the first time 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.579
 they run on the big track 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.409
 but the paper peel normally 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.060
 the horse of the agreed race wanted 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.770
 oppose the number 9 moving zone 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.020
 a victorious comeback in the price 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.490
 clymene now she attracts and finally 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.049
 is rather inherited the number 9 behind 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.579
 the car what will handicap him a 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.960
 very little like in the pre clymene 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.700
 had something because it was certainly 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.800
 than females but ended up 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.630
 nose to the wind 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.460
 franck nivard knew how to manage well 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.630
 the effort he has he has really led well he 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.730
 did not seek to force the horse to 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.380
 head but she came to win it at 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.790
 term she was very 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.140
 brave for his comeback really 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.430
 it was not easy 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.450
 quite complicated to cover on the small 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.010
 track especially when you're nose to 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.030
 wind she did a trick anyway and 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.830
 it's the same, it's a mare like 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.450
 a lot of speed so the new is 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.920
 sure it's annoying it's not a very 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.910
 very good number but she is there the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.770
 speed so I think she 'll be able 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.810
 fall back pretty quickly if she has 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.030
 the course a good course 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.150
 then I think she's going fast for 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.069
 finish so 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.560
 she's really fit that I think 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.909
 that it's a good base in two phases 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.560
 in cfa by the way franck nivard who 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.730
 foot said he had the choice of 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.739
 worlds back up sense he had been able 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.000
 run he said he would have led him well 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.590
 okay that's a sign 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.780
 in third position just before the 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.700
 number 3 vinci of the abbey 100% on the 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.590
 course a victory an accessit 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.579
 the horse is on the rise but 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.780
 maybe earlier for a place than 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.159
 for the victory nueva vinci of the 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.500
 vigil jean michel bazire never 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.730
 hidden his esteem towards this horse the 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.109
 here he had seen ambitions 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.060
 classic as he presented it to 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.970
 departure of the criterium game needed a little 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.650
 disappointed anyway that's it 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.790
 we like we do not like this choice but 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.170
 we must admit that the 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.170
 suddenly find there is a category that 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.270
 widely in his ropes 2100 meters where 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.770
 said it's it does not bother him 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.990
 will be déferré later when he 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.490
 is in this configuration there he soup 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.450
 seldom he drew a good number 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.160
 behind the autostart 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.780
 jean-michel the adulate lead it at best 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.950
 for this race there it is here it is 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.540
 a first chance and a first 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.340
 chance the number of ermine varades 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.260
 she showed beautiful things beautiful 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.730
 things during the first half of 2013 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.500
 she too seems on the rise 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.360
 beware of ermine barral this is a 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.620
 old beaudoin we see there it was a 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.390
 very very good mare we remember 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.890
 she had long been defeated 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.480
 before falling on intense vision in 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.000
 the interregional final in vincennes 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.980
 she had her license on this course 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.630
 at the time of beating vaniqa durious the 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.070
 victories yeah that's not it so 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.910
 after a long interruption of 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.630
 career she moved to jean 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.550
 Michel Bazire 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.930
 but for his return the other time on the 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.180
 small track at night jean-michel la 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.709
 watch the city with closed subscribers and 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.570
 the mare was very fresh 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.280
 loved a lot of broken teeth a little 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.990
 little off to finish but that was when 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.760
 not even bad because she could have and 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.220
 did not finish that far in the end 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.660
 there they resorted a blow in province 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.600
 to restore her confidence she has 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.590
 nicely finished nicely withdrawal here is 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.480
 we but I dare verbeek 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.220
 we have to undo the four feet big 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.550
 thing that was done only once for 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.930
 moment 2 behind the autostart I 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.120
 still think that we must be careful 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.489
 of condemning me is that I am on 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.750
 will learn a lot for the future 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.460
 of his universe on this race there I 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.250
 agree to see if the mare 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.110
 is still able to cross the course or 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.370
 if maybe the seat is there it's fine 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.550
 correct but normally in this 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.350
 race there if it does not arrive there 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.760
 will have had a problem I think ok okay what 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.320
 whether the ranking is looking at it 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.750
 run whatever happens next 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.600
 of winter in fifth position the 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.979
 number 10 rounds a highly esteemed mail by 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.169
 the marten brothers so we said it's 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.520
 the dread maertens but they set themselves 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.000
 in it we can say here it's a 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.380
 horse 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.600
 every time they talk to us about it 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.250
 what if he has a big potential have for 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.900
 the moment he did beautiful things 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.699
 but 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.139
 from there to say that he did as soon as 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.040
 hear he ran like a crack this 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.080
 is not yet the case 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.639
 now with the few goods he has 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.840
 he always finds himself in islands to 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.680
 poor race conditions where 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.270
 it's the least rich 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.389
 or else he goes to the second line as 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.580
 today good there it is within so 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.810
 that's if they manage to sneak 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.039
 attention to him because even though 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.990
 lighthouses martens they have points of 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:14.949
 comparison in the boxes and that one 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.710
 they make a very very good so 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:19.270
 watch out for him we'll be wary 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.729
 the moment of the ground minute since 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.770
 arnaud lecomte agents telephone cédric 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.120
 proud melicie that they present athena 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.620
 in front of the number 5 then you 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.910
 do not have it in your selection 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.470
 will speak later for now 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.880
 will listen cédric tanners cédric 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.470
 melicie you will present athena 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.270
 in front of her a mare who has already done 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.190
 his evidence on the big track this is where 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:47.800
 discover it the 2100 of the big track 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:52.410
 she may be in 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.410
 preparation for other events 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.580
 that they come very very well 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:14.139
 to be Argentan on 50 m 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:19.570
 while not being very happy 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:21.039
 does it seem his main goal can 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.280
 to be the semi-classic of early females 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.280
 December 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.229
 it will be understood that this rhythm is flawed 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.090
 is a little in the blur a fig semite 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:32.889
 mi raisin it's not 1100 it's not 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.060
 his sport you want not retained in 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:35.830
 starch we put it in the game there 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.030
 did not think too much too much 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.680
 a very good mare careful 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.220
 part of the best females of his 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.770
 generation 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.060
 now here it is frozen pamiers 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.199
 precisely because 2100 meters is 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.380
 not too much his sport is a mare 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:46.580
 of holding 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.720
 I'm afraid it's speeding up 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.830
 leaving if it ends up in the 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.090
 last after it's a race a 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.950
 little tactics will have to work around the 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.150
 pack 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.010

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.870
