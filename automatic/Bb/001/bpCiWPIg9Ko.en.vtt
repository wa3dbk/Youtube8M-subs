00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.240 
give us great sadness and this is an
area<00:05:29.270> which<00:05:29.450> we<00:05:29.480> have<00:05:29.780> to<00:05:29.930> work<00:05:30.110> on<00:05:30.320> as<00:05:30.890> for

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
area which we have to work on as for

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.710 
area which we have to work on as for
whether<00:05:31.490> or<00:05:31.670> not<00:05:31.850> we<00:05:32.060> can<00:05:32.210> completely

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
whether or not we can completely

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.560 
whether or not we can completely
eradicate<00:05:32.960> terrorism<00:05:33.940> I'm<00:05:34.940> not<00:05:35.300> very

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
eradicate terrorism I'm not very

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.020 
eradicate terrorism I'm not very
optimistic<00:05:36.350> in<00:05:36.530> thinking<00:05:37.220> that<00:05:37.370> perhaps<00:05:37.640> we

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
optimistic in thinking that perhaps we

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.210 
optimistic in thinking that perhaps we
can<00:05:38.210> completely<00:05:38.690> eradicate<00:05:38.960> it<00:05:39.560> but<00:05:40.040> I<00:05:40.070> think

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
can completely eradicate it but I think

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.060 
can completely eradicate it but I think
that<00:05:40.580> we<00:05:40.910> have<00:05:41.180> a<00:05:41.480> lot<00:05:41.750> of<00:05:41.780> room<00:05:42.170> to<00:05:42.410> work

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
that we have a lot of room to work

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.760 
that we have a lot of room to work
together<00:05:43.280> to<00:05:43.670> make<00:05:43.790> sure<00:05:44.000> that<00:05:44.120> we<00:05:44.300> minimize

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
together to make sure that we minimize

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.620 
together to make sure that we minimize
terrorism<00:05:45.770> to<00:05:46.190> the<00:05:46.220> lowest<00:05:46.670> possible<00:05:46.880> extent

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
terrorism to the lowest possible extent

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.690 
terrorism to the lowest possible extent
and<00:05:47.900> to<00:05:48.410> do<00:05:48.560> that<00:05:48.800> we<00:05:48.950> have<00:05:49.130> to<00:05:49.250> keep<00:05:49.460> working

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
and to do that we have to keep working

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.120 
and to do that we have to keep working
together<00:05:50.000> on<00:05:50.450> many<00:05:51.080> areas<00:05:51.290> of<00:05:51.710> this<00:05:51.860> effort

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
together on many areas of this effort

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.450 
together on many areas of this effort
work<00:05:52.520> together<00:05:52.700> in<00:05:53.150> planning<00:05:53.740> use<00:05:54.740> technology

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
work together in planning use technology

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.190 
work together in planning use technology
so<00:05:55.640> that<00:05:55.820> we<00:05:55.940> can<00:05:56.120> continue<00:05:56.450> to<00:05:56.720> take<00:05:56.870> short

so that we can continue to take short

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.290 
so that we can continue to take short
