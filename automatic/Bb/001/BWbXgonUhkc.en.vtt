markers and they're in a slightly
different<00:01:08.000> spot<00:01:08.450> than<00:01:08.479> they<00:01:08.780> were<00:01:08.840> when<00:01:09.200> you

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
different spot than they were when you

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.570 
different spot than they were when you
were<00:01:09.500> doing<00:01:09.830> two<00:01:09.950> heel<00:01:10.420> gusset<00:01:11.710> decreases<00:01:12.710> so

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
were doing two heel gusset decreases so

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.160 
were doing two heel gusset decreases so
we're<00:01:13.790> going<00:01:13.970> to<00:01:14.119> knit<00:01:14.360> two<00:01:14.390> three<00:01:14.810> stitches

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170

we're going to knit two three stitches
before<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:16.010> marker<00:01:17.680> knit<00:01:18.680> two<00:01:18.860> together<00:01:19.930> knit

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
before the marker knit two together knit

one slip the marker knit one and then

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.969 
one slip the marker knit one and then
SSK<00:01:26.540> slip<00:01:27.140> slip<00:01:27.800> knit<00:01:28.900> those<00:01:29.900> two<00:01:30.110> together

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979

shaping because we are going to have

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.029 
shaping because we are going to have
four<00:01:50.300> decreases<00:01:50.840> every<00:01:51.170> round<00:01:51.380> rather<00:01:51.890> than

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
four decreases every round rather than

00:01:52.039 --> 00:02:01.230 
four decreases every round rather than

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
doing mirror image decreases around the

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.360 
doing mirror image decreases around the
markers<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:26.470> then<00:02:27.470> I'm<00:02:27.560> going<00:02:27.799> to<00:02:27.860> knit<00:02:28.190> to

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
markers and then I'm going to knit to

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.300 
markers and then I'm going to knit to
the<00:02:28.489> end<00:02:30.190> that's<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.340> decrease<00:02:31.670> round<00:02:31.850> and

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
were using the circular needle that'll

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.570 
were using the circular needle that'll
remind<00:04:55.620> you<00:04:55.800> where<00:04:55.950> the<00:04:56.040> beginning<00:04:56.160> of<00:04:56.490> your

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
remind you where the beginning of your

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.550 
remind you where the beginning of your
round<00:04:56.820> is<00:04:57.000> between<00:04:57.780> the<00:04:57.900> two<00:04:58.050> needles<00:04:58.229> right

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
round is between the two needles right

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.350 
round is between the two needles right
here

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
here

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.430 
here
so<00:05:00.360> you're<00:05:00.479> going<00:05:00.660> to<00:05:00.720> continue<00:05:01.260> decreasing

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
so you're going to continue decreasing

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.560 
so you're going to continue decreasing
and<00:05:02.010> following<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.520> pattern<00:05:02.729> until<00:05:03.270> you<00:05:03.390> get

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
and following the pattern until you get

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.930 
and following the pattern until you get
down<00:05:03.780> to<00:05:03.840> the<00:05:04.590> number<00:05:04.890> of<00:05:05.010> stitches<00:05:05.280> it's<00:05:05.729> very

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
down to the number of stitches it's very

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.490 
down to the number of stitches it's very
few<00:05:06.120> stitches<00:05:06.510> that<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:06.810> pattern<00:05:07.110> tells<00:05:07.260> you

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
few stitches that the pattern tells you

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.380 
few stitches that the pattern tells you
and<00:05:07.710> then<00:05:08.250> you<00:05:08.460> can<00:05:08.550> come<00:05:08.729> back<00:05:08.760> here<00:05:09.150> and<00:05:09.300> I'll

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
show you how to graph the toe using the

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.170 
show you how to graph the toe using the
Kitchener<00:05:11.340> stitch
