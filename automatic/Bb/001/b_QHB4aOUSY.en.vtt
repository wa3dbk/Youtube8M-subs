00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
look at the red out all the time so it's

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.429 
look at the red out all the time so it's
best<00:01:14.880> on<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> suppressor<00:01:15.659> also<00:01:16.259> have<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
best on the suppressor also have the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.590 
best on the suppressor also have the
foregrip<00:01:16.830> because<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> gun<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.729> good<00:01:18.360> i<00:01:18.450> could

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
foregrip because the gun is good i could

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.880 
foregrip because the gun is good i could
see<00:01:18.750> without<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:19.439> then<00:01:19.560> again<00:01:19.650> with<00:01:19.830> a

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
see without it but then again with a

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.320 
see without it but then again with a
foregrip<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.670> much<00:01:20.790> better<00:01:21.000> accuracy

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
foregrip it is so much better accuracy

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.899 
foregrip it is so much better accuracy
for<00:01:22.049> long<00:01:22.200> ridges<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.340> first<00:01:23.549> pick<00:01:23.759> is

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
for long ridges so the first pick is

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.280 
for long ridges so the first pick is
lightweight<00:01:24.270> book<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.750> could<00:01:24.990> run<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> lot

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
lightweight book so you could run a lot

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.600 
lightweight book so you could run a lot
faster<00:01:25.320> with<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.680> good<00:01:25.890> because<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> good<00:01:26.430> is

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
faster with a good because a good is

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.550 
faster with a good because a good is
quite<00:01:26.880> heavy<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.900> comes<00:01:28.110> slowly<00:01:28.290> quite

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
quite heavy and it comes slowly quite

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.620 
quite heavy and it comes slowly quite
now<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.159> fast<00:01:29.430> ads<00:01:29.670> basically<00:01:30.180> i've<00:01:30.240> got<00:01:30.420> fast

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
now so fast ads basically i've got fast

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.420 
now so fast ads basically i've got fast
