just show you example here's Barrett

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.920 
just show you example here's Barrett
right<00:04:57.280> here<00:04:57.490> we<00:04:58.210> just<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:01.090> here's<00:05:01.510> my<00:05:01.660> church

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
right here we just and here's my church

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.430 
right here we just and here's my church
so<00:05:02.770> I<00:05:03.550> don't<00:05:03.940> know<00:05:04.060> it's<00:05:04.330> just<00:05:04.630> me<00:05:04.900> but<00:05:05.140> I<00:05:05.380> think

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
so I don't know it's just me but I think

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.440 
so I don't know it's just me but I think
he<00:05:05.890> looks<00:05:06.190> like<00:05:06.250> a<00:05:06.340> modified<00:05:06.700> barracks<00:05:07.240> I

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
he looks like a modified barracks I

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.210 
he looks like a modified barracks I
think<00:05:07.840> it's<00:05:07.960> just<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.320> helmet<00:05:08.530> that<00:05:08.800> makes<00:05:09.100> me

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
think it's just the helmet that makes me

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.690 
think it's just the helmet that makes me
think<00:05:09.430> that<00:05:09.550> but<00:05:10.050> it's<00:05:11.050> just<00:05:11.230> the<00:05:11.470> I<00:05:11.770> don't

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
think that but it's just the I don't

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.490 
think that but it's just the I don't
know<00:05:12.790> what<00:05:12.940> it<00:05:13.030> is<00:05:13.150> maybe<00:05:13.420> to<00:05:13.690> you<00:05:13.810> it<00:05:13.990> doesn't

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
know what it is maybe to you it doesn't

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.320 
know what it is maybe to you it doesn't
fatal<00:05:15.100> with<00:05:15.190> nothing<00:05:15.490> like<00:05:15.700> but<00:05:15.910> to<00:05:16.030> me<00:05:16.150> they

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
fatal with nothing like but to me they

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.890 
fatal with nothing like but to me they
look<00:05:16.570> similar<00:05:17.140> so<00:05:17.670> yeah<00:05:18.670> just<00:05:19.300> I<00:05:19.570> think<00:05:19.780> it's

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
look similar so yeah just I think it's

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.970 
look similar so yeah just I think it's
just<00:05:20.020> a<00:05:20.110> head<00:05:20.260> though<00:05:20.410> because<00:05:20.620> you<00:05:20.710> can<00:05:20.830> see

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
just a head though because you can see

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.310 
just a head though because you can see
the<00:05:21.190> because<00:05:22.000> they<00:05:22.120> got<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.510> little<00:05:22.690> things

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
the because they got the little things

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.430 
the because they got the little things
popping<00:05:23.740> out<00:05:23.860> so<00:05:24.400> yeah<00:05:24.940> and<00:05:25.900> they<00:05:26.050> have<00:05:26.140> each

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
popping out so yeah and they have each

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.050 
popping out so yeah and they have each
have<00:05:26.620> a<00:05:26.650> Korean<00:05:26.950> cornea<00:05:27.400> so<00:05:27.580> maybe<00:05:27.910> that's

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
have a Korean cornea so maybe that's

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.940 
have a Korean cornea so maybe that's
another<00:05:28.120> reason<00:05:28.600> and<00:05:29.050> blue<00:05:29.410> quaternions<00:05:29.980> yeah

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
another reason and blue quaternions yeah

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.900 
another reason and blue quaternions yeah
just<00:05:32.950> sorta<00:05:33.160> it<00:05:33.250> should<00:05:33.400> point<00:05:33.670> that<00:05:33.790> out

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
just sorta it should point that out

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.220 
just sorta it should point that out
because<00:05:34.150> I<00:05:34.300> just<00:05:34.510> find<00:05:34.720> that<00:05:34.810> funny

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
because I just find that funny

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.330

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
figure but after I built him I was

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.960 
figure but after I built him I was
amazed<00:05:53.350> he's<00:05:53.770> pretty<00:05:54.190> cool<00:05:54.400> even<00:05:54.640> though<00:05:54.760> he

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
amazed he's pretty cool even though he

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.680 
amazed he's pretty cool even though he
has<00:05:55.060> the<00:05:55.680> same<00:05:56.730> body<00:05:57.730> design<00:05:58.210> and<00:05:58.240> the<00:05:58.480> same

has the same body design and the same

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.600 
has the same body design and the same
are<00:05:58.930> chelation<00:05:59.350> I<00:05:59.650> must<00:05:59.890> say<00:06:00.010> he<00:06:00.280> looks<00:06:00.460> pretty

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.880 
cool I think it's just the weapons that
give<00:06:02.830> him<00:06:02.890> that<00:06:03.250> extra<00:06:03.550> oppressive<00:06:04.270> coolness
