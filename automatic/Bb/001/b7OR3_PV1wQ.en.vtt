what did you took calculus to last year
calculus<00:01:48.540> -<00:01:48.720> but<00:01:49.260> I<00:01:49.439> took<00:01:49.590> calculus<00:01:50.189> one<00:01:50.670> in

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
calculus - but I took calculus one in

calculus - but I took calculus one in
like<00:01:52.549> 2010<00:01:53.659> well<00:01:54.659> isn't<00:01:54.810> calculus<00:01:55.380> -<00:01:55.710> more

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
know the basics of calculus one and then

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.950 
know the basics of calculus one and then
you<00:02:03.600> build<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.549> don't<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.820> don't<00:02:06.420> remember

and I was really excited about it
somehow<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:03.090> knew<00:04:03.420> that<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.200> UFOs<00:04:04.620> were<00:04:04.800> gonna

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
somehow I knew that the UFOs were gonna

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.610 
somehow I knew that the UFOs were gonna
come<00:04:05.250> so<00:04:06.030> I<00:04:06.060> put<00:04:06.450> my<00:04:06.630> nail<00:04:07.020> polish<00:04:07.350> on<00:04:07.500> the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
come so I put my nail polish on the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.880 
come so I put my nail polish on the
floor<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.250> laid<00:04:08.940> on<00:04:08.970> top<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:09.630> it<00:04:09.780> so<00:04:10.590> that<00:04:10.770> when

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
floor and laid on top of it so that when

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.430 
floor and laid on top of it so that when
the<00:04:10.980> UFO<00:04:11.280> went<00:04:11.820> I<00:04:12.000> think<00:04:12.240> suck<00:04:12.630> it<00:04:12.840> up

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
the UFO went I think suck it up

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.320 
the UFO went I think suck it up
I<00:04:13.470> would<00:04:14.010> weigh<00:04:14.220> enough<00:04:14.550> that<00:04:14.880> they<00:04:15.030> wouldn't

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
I would weigh enough that they wouldn't

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.789 
I would weigh enough that they wouldn't
get<00:04:15.480> away<00:04:15.570> and<00:04:16.020> it<00:04:16.200> worked

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
get away and it worked

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.550 
get away and it worked
except<00:04:17.580> for<00:04:17.730> then<00:04:17.970> these<00:04:18.299> people<00:04:18.810> must<00:04:19.410> have

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
except for then these people must have

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.289 
except for then these people must have
been<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.799> government<00:04:20.220> just<00:04:20.489> barge<00:04:20.820> into<00:04:21.090> my

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
been the government just barge into my

the<00:04:39.449> dream<00:04:39.689> was<00:04:39.930> me<00:04:40.110> just<00:04:40.289> like<00:04:40.530> being<00:04:40.800> really

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
the dream was me just like being really

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:42.800

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
I feel like nail polish isn't worth your

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.860 
I feel like nail polish isn't worth your
life<00:04:47.129> well<00:04:47.699> apparently<00:04:48.210> it<00:04:48.360> was<00:04:48.479> just<00:04:48.509> really

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
life well apparently it was just really

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.300 
life well apparently it was just really
cool<00:04:49.139> on<00:04:49.259> the<00:04:49.349> unpolished<00:04:49.770> what's<00:04:50.099> it<00:04:50.219> been

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
cool on the unpolished what's it been

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.809 
cool on the unpolished what's it been
invented<00:04:50.789> yet<00:04:50.819> I<00:04:51.289> very<00:04:52.289> very<00:04:52.680> rarely<00:04:52.830> remember

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:53.819 
invented yet I very very rarely remember

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.809 
invented yet I very very rarely remember
dreams<00:04:54.419> when<00:04:54.870> I<00:04:54.900> wake<00:04:55.110> up<00:04:55.310> it's<00:04:56.310> like<00:04:56.460> once

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:56.819 
dreams when I wake up it's like once

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.450 
dreams when I wake up it's like once
every<00:04:57.150> six<00:04:57.389> months<00:04:57.689> maybe<00:04:57.870> I<00:04:58.050> will<00:04:58.319> have<00:04:58.620> some

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
every six months maybe I will have some

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.969 
every six months maybe I will have some
sort<00:04:59.789> of<00:04:59.879> vague<00:05:00.509> idea<00:05:00.990> that<00:05:01.560> I<00:05:01.590> was<00:05:01.800> dreaming

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
sort of vague idea that I was dreaming

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.670 
sort of vague idea that I was dreaming
but<00:05:02.689> usually<00:05:03.689> for<00:05:03.840> me<00:05:03.960> falling<00:05:04.289> asleep<00:05:04.560> just

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
but usually for me falling asleep just

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.459 
but usually for me falling asleep just
involves<00:05:05.189> being<00:05:06.180> awake<00:05:06.509> and<00:05:06.810> then<00:05:07.229> all<00:05:07.319> of<00:05:07.349> a

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
involves being awake and then all of a

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:09.469 
involves being awake and then all of a
sudden<00:05:07.500> I'm<00:05:07.860> waking<00:05:08.310> up<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:08.699> next<00:05:08.849> day<00:05:09.120> my

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
sudden I'm waking up the next day my

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.240 
sudden I'm waking up the next day my
brain<00:05:09.719> just<00:05:09.840> sort<00:05:10.020> of<00:05:10.080> shuts<00:05:10.349> off<00:05:10.620> or<00:05:10.949> it<00:05:11.009> feels

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
brain just sort of shuts off or it feels

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.760 
brain just sort of shuts off or it feels
like<00:05:11.520> it<00:05:11.669> totally<00:05:12.000> shuts<00:05:12.210> off<00:05:12.419> in<00:05:13.169> between<00:05:13.289> I

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
like it totally shuts off in between I

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.230 
like it totally shuts off in between I
mean<00:05:13.949> maybe<00:05:14.159> that<00:05:14.279> means<00:05:14.550> to<00:05:14.789> get<00:05:14.909> a<00:05:14.969> more

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
mean maybe that means to get a more

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.330 
mean maybe that means to get a more
restful<00:05:15.689> sleep<00:05:15.990> but<00:05:16.409> I<00:05:16.620> think<00:05:16.889> that<00:05:17.099> dreams

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
restful sleep but I think that dreams

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.399 
restful sleep but I think that dreams
can<00:05:17.610> be<00:05:17.729> really<00:05:17.969> fun<00:05:18.240> except<00:05:19.199> for<00:05:19.289> this

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409
