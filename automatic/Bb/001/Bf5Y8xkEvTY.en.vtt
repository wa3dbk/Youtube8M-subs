00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.290 
has this really pretty big pockets right
here<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.680> it's<00:02:20.310> just<00:02:20.520> loose<00:02:20.730> there's<00:02:21.060> no

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
here and it's just loose there's no

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.820 
here and it's just loose there's no
buttons<00:02:21.660> or<00:02:21.810> anything<00:02:21.990> so<00:02:22.380> it's<00:02:22.530> just<00:02:22.680> meant

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
buttons or anything so it's just meant

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.910 
buttons or anything so it's just meant
to<00:02:22.950> be<00:02:22.980> weren't<00:02:23.280> open<00:02:23.580> so<00:02:24.180> it's<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.380> materials

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
to be weren't open so it's the materials

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.590 
to be weren't open so it's the materials
kind<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.370> businesses<00:02:26.880> so<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.060> think<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.390> could

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
kind of businesses so I think you could

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.540 
kind of businesses so I think you could
get<00:02:27.750> away<00:02:27.810> with<00:02:28.140> work<00:02:28.350> wearing<00:02:29.130> this<00:02:29.220> at<00:02:29.370> work

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
get away with work wearing this at work

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.700 
get away with work wearing this at work
and<00:02:29.820> depending<00:02:30.780> on<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.020> know<00:02:31.050> where<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.530> work

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
and depending on you know where you work

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.470 
and depending on you know where you work
but<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.010> think<00:02:32.130> it's<00:02:32.340> pretty<00:02:32.580> work<00:02:33.270> time

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
but I think it's pretty work time

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.300 
but I think it's pretty work time
appropriate<00:02:34.020> but<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.230> can<00:02:34.350> also<00:02:34.530> wear<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.100> I

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
appropriate but you can also wear this I

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.110 
appropriate but you can also wear this I
think<00:02:35.430> just<00:02:35.880> school<00:02:36.480> if<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.810> wanted<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.380> um<00:02:38.190> so

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
think just school if you wanted to um so

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.630 
think just school if you wanted to um so
I<00:02:39.150> think<00:02:39.450> it's<00:02:39.660> really<00:02:40.080> really<00:02:40.320> pretty<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.890> in

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
I think it's really really pretty and in

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.150 
I think it's really really pretty and in
the<00:02:41.940> photo<00:02:42.180> Kim<00:02:42.630> also<00:02:42.780> had<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.290> black<00:02:43.560> scarf<00:02:43.920> on

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
the photo Kim also had a black scarf on

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.420 
the photo Kim also had a black scarf on
so<00:02:45.050> I'm<00:02:46.050> going<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.380> go<00:02:46.590> ahead<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:46.950> do<00:02:47.100> that<00:02:47.130> so

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
so I'm going to go ahead and do that so

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.090 
so I'm going to go ahead and do that so
if<00:02:47.700> it's<00:02:47.850> getting<00:02:48.200> chillier<00:02:49.200> out<00:02:49.260> probably

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
if it's getting chillier out probably

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.010 
if it's getting chillier out probably
not<00:02:50.250> right<00:02:50.430> now<00:02:50.610> but<00:02:51.060> once<00:02:51.360> it<00:02:51.510> gets<00:02:51.600> chillier

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
not right now but once it gets chillier

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.100 
not right now but once it gets chillier
out<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.680> may<00:02:52.860> want<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.280> wear<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.970> scarf<00:02:54.750> like

like<00:03:08.880> this<00:03:09.270> tying<00:03:09.960> it<00:03:10.110> around<00:03:10.520> the<00:03:11.520> neck<00:03:11.730> and

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
like this tying it around the neck and

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.690 
like this tying it around the neck and
then<00:03:12.300> pulling<00:03:13.080> these<00:03:13.260> strands<00:03:14.010> she<00:03:14.490> weren't

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
then pulling these strands she weren't

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.160 
then pulling these strands she weren't
kind<00:03:14.970> of<00:03:15.150> close<00:03:15.330> up<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.600> her<00:03:15.660> neck<00:03:15.780> but<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:16.020> like

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
kind of close up to her neck but I like

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.350 
kind of close up to her neck but I like
to<00:03:16.320> have<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.500> little<00:03:16.680> wiggle<00:03:17.400> room<00:03:17.670> so<00:03:17.700> it's<00:03:18.150> not

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
to have a little wiggle room so it's not

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.510 
to have a little wiggle room so it's not
like<00:03:18.600> suffocating<00:03:19.200> me<00:03:19.410> or<00:03:19.530> anything

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
like suffocating me or anything

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.680 
like suffocating me or anything
and<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:23.830> is<00:03:24.070> what<00:03:24.340> she<00:03:24.610> wore<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.270> then<00:03:25.570> she

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
and that is what she wore and then she

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.120 
and that is what she wore and then she
also<00:03:25.870> had<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.230> black<00:03:26.650> long<00:03:27.190> quilted<00:03:28.830> purse<00:03:29.830> and

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
also had a black long quilted purse and

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.680 
also had a black long quilted purse and
I'm<00:03:30.520> pretty<00:03:30.700> sure<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.970> smell<00:03:31.270> that<00:03:31.450> I'm<00:03:31.540> not

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
I'm pretty sure to smell that I'm not

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.170 
I'm pretty sure to smell that I'm not
absolutely<00:03:32.140> positive<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:33.340> a<00:03:33.760> much<00:03:34.150> cheaper

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
absolutely positive so a much cheaper

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.570 
absolutely positive so a much cheaper
alternative<00:03:34.990> it's<00:03:35.170> just<00:03:35.320> to<00:03:35.440> go<00:03:35.590> with<00:03:35.920> your<00:03:36.370> go

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
alternative it's just to go with your go

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.610 
alternative it's just to go with your go
to<00:03:36.640> black<00:03:37.060> bag<00:03:37.300> does<00:03:37.540> not<00:03:37.690> have<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:37.960> be<00:03:38.110> similar

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
to black bag does not have to be similar

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.710 
to black bag does not have to be similar
this<00:03:39.250> one<00:03:39.370> has<00:03:39.520> chains<00:03:39.910> kind<00:03:40.270> of<00:03:40.360> like<00:03:40.480> hers

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
this one has chains kind of like hers

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.420 
this one has chains kind of like hers
did<00:03:40.990> so<00:03:41.500> that's<00:03:41.650> why<00:03:41.770> I<00:03:41.800> grabbed<00:03:42.070> this<00:03:42.250> one

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
did so that's why I grabbed this one

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.970 
did so that's why I grabbed this one
this<00:03:42.520> one<00:03:42.940> in<00:03:43.060> particular<00:03:43.420> is<00:03:43.480> from<00:03:43.690> BCBG<00:03:43.980> but

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
this one in particular is from BCBG but

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.730 
this one in particular is from BCBG but
again<00:03:45.910> what's<00:03:46.180> much<00:03:46.840> cheaper<00:03:47.260> than<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.440> Chanel

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
again what's much cheaper than a Chanel

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.000 
again what's much cheaper than a Chanel
bag<00:03:47.770> and<00:03:48.250> you<00:03:48.880> can<00:03:48.970> just<00:03:49.180> wear<00:03:49.360> it<00:03:49.390> like<00:03:49.510> this

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090

except for Kim's had the white tank top

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.540 
except for Kim's had the white tank top
was<00:03:58.420> lower<00:03:58.810> than<00:03:58.990> the<00:03:59.320> black<00:03:59.770> so<00:04:00.130> I<00:04:00.160> will<00:04:00.430> show

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
was lower than the black so I will show

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.550

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
to be a little bit more exactly like Kim

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.350 
to be a little bit more exactly like Kim
so<00:04:05.290> that<00:04:05.530> is<00:04:05.710> the<00:04:05.950> first<00:04:06.250> look

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.480 

okay<00:04:10.360> so<00:04:10.480> this<00:04:10.660> next<00:04:10.990> outfit<00:04:11.410> is<00:04:11.620> more<00:04:12.250> work

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490

time<00:04:12.700> appropriate<00:04:13.240> but<00:04:13.360> also<00:04:13.540> it<00:04:13.810> could<00:04:13.930> be

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
time appropriate but also it could be

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.590 
time appropriate but also it could be
school<00:04:14.320> time<00:04:14.590> as<00:04:14.830> well<00:04:15.070> if<00:04:15.430> you<00:04:16.000> are<00:04:16.030> someone

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
using a regular laser that I got from

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.850 
using a regular laser that I got from
Target<00:04:24.040> so<00:04:24.700> very<00:04:25.000> very<00:04:25.270> inexpensive

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
Target so very very inexpensive

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.530

alternative<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:27.100> Kim's<00:04:27.340> look<00:04:27.640> and<00:04:27.850> this<00:04:28.330> one

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
alternative to Kim's look and this one

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.750 
alternative to Kim's look and this one
is<00:04:28.690> more<00:04:28.960> like<00:04:29.290> hers<00:04:29.770> because<00:04:30.040> of<00:04:30.460> a<00:04:30.550> little

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
is more like hers because of a little

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.180 
is more like hers because of a little
butterfly<00:04:31.120> so<00:04:31.420> by<00:04:31.600> umm<00:04:31.990> because<00:04:32.470> the<00:04:32.950> white

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
butterfly so by umm because the white

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.700 
butterfly so by umm because the white
tank<00:04:33.700> top<00:04:33.760> hits<00:04:34.390> lower<00:04:34.660> than<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.260> black<00:04:35.470> one

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
tank top hits lower than the black one

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.500 
tank top hits lower than the black one
does<00:04:35.950> and<00:04:36.250> I<00:04:36.520> really<00:04:36.820> really<00:04:37.030> like<00:04:37.180> this<00:04:37.330> one

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
does and I really really like this one

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.900 
does and I really really like this one
because<00:04:37.960> it<00:04:38.410> kind<00:04:38.620> of<00:04:38.710> adds<00:04:38.890> a<00:04:39.040> feminine<00:04:39.490> shape

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
because it kind of adds a feminine shape

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.600 
because it kind of adds a feminine shape
and<00:04:40.320> it<00:04:41.320> kind<00:04:41.590> of<00:04:41.650> makes<00:04:41.920> the<00:04:42.040> illusion<00:04:42.460> that

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
and it kind of makes the illusion that

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.730 
and it kind of makes the illusion that
you<00:04:42.730> have<00:04:42.760> a<00:04:43.210> little<00:04:43.600> bit<00:04:43.690> more<00:04:43.810> curves<00:04:44.110> and<00:04:44.410> we

all know that Kim has a lot of curve and

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.280 
all know that Kim has a lot of curve and

okay so this last outfit is the most

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.869 
okay so this last outfit is the most
inspired<00:05:19.419> by<00:05:19.689> cam<00:05:20.050> I<00:05:20.349> believe<00:05:20.680> because<00:05:20.919> it<00:05:21.370> has

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:21.879 
inspired by cam I believe because it has

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.869 
inspired by cam I believe because it has
the<00:05:22.360> kind<00:05:22.780> of<00:05:22.870> leather<00:05:23.319> s<00:05:23.710> jacket<00:05:24.460> this<00:05:24.580> is<00:05:24.639> not

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:24.879 
the kind of leather s jacket this is not

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:26.399 
the kind of leather s jacket this is not
leather<00:05:25.090> doesn't<00:05:25.599> even<00:05:25.780> it's<00:05:25.930> not<00:05:25.960> even<00:05:26.050> fold

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:26.409 
leather doesn't even it's not even fold

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.559 
leather doesn't even it's not even fold
leather<00:05:26.620> but<00:05:27.250> I<00:05:27.280> think<00:05:27.669> it<00:05:27.759> looks<00:05:27.969> more<00:05:28.180> like

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569 
leather but I think it looks more like

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.839 
leather but I think it looks more like
moto<00:05:28.990> like<00:05:29.500> kind<00:05:29.740> of<00:05:29.830> rebellious<00:05:30.400> like<00:05:30.669> her

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
moto like kind of rebellious like her

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:33.480

urban vibe I'm not really positive where

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:41.219 
urban vibe I'm not really positive where
it's<00:05:39.189> from<00:05:39.400> but<00:05:40.090> I<00:05:40.270> don't<00:05:40.539> I<00:05:40.750> feel<00:05:40.900> like<00:05:40.960> it<00:05:41.139> was

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
it's from but I don't I feel like it was

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.119 
it's from but I don't I feel like it was
just<00:05:41.319> like<00:05:41.409> ten<00:05:41.680> dollars<00:05:42.069> so<00:05:42.419> it<00:05:43.419> has<00:05:43.979> kind<00:05:44.979> of

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:45.129 
just like ten dollars so it has kind of

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:49.110 
just like ten dollars so it has kind of
cups<00:05:45.520> right<00:05:45.849> here<00:05:46.419> and<00:05:46.659> then<00:05:47.110> this<00:05:47.729> kind<00:05:48.729> of<00:05:48.909> I

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
cups right here and then this kind of I

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.879 
cups right here and then this kind of I
don't<00:05:49.180> know<00:05:49.330> what<00:05:49.509> material<00:05:49.990> this<00:05:50.110> is<00:05:50.169> but<00:05:50.620> a

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
don't know what material this is but a

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:55.730 
don't know what material this is but a
shinier<00:05:51.580> material<00:05:52.449> and<00:05:52.840> it<00:05:53.500> hits<00:05:53.770> the<00:05:54.490> most

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
shinier material and it hits the most

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.890 
shinier material and it hits the most
it's<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:56.830> shortest<00:05:57.340> one<00:05:57.550> where<00:05:57.909> it<00:05:58.030> hits<00:05:58.210> so

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
it's the shortest one where it hits so

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.260 
it's the shortest one where it hits so
again<00:05:59.349> it<00:05:59.530> still<00:05:59.650> has<00:05:59.830> that<00:05:59.879> length<00:06:00.879> from<00:06:01.180> the

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
again it still has that length from the

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.990 
again it still has that length from the
white<00:06:01.449> tea<00:06:01.629> that<00:06:01.960> Kam's<00:06:02.289> had<00:06:02.710> and<00:06:03.099> again

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
white tea that Kam's had and again

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.760 
white tea that Kam's had and again
pulling<00:06:04.539> it<00:06:04.659> off<00:06:04.810> with<00:06:04.990> the<00:06:05.080> bag<00:06:05.259> I<00:06:05.469> feel<00:06:05.650> like

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
pulling it off with the bag I feel like

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.350 
pulling it off with the bag I feel like
this<00:06:05.889> is<00:06:06.039> just<00:06:06.069> the<00:06:06.340> most<00:06:06.490> make<00:06:07.090> time

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
this is just the most make time

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.089 
this is just the most make time
appropriate<00:06:07.990> look<00:06:08.259> and<00:06:08.500> I<00:06:08.529> think<00:06:08.560> this<00:06:08.830> one<00:06:08.979> is

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099 
appropriate look and I think this one is

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:10.529 
appropriate look and I think this one is
great<00:06:09.279> because<00:06:09.580> you<00:06:09.699> can<00:06:09.789> wear<00:06:10.060> either<00:06:10.360> the

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
great because you can wear either the

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:12.300 
great because you can wear either the
Blazer<00:06:10.779> or<00:06:10.990> the<00:06:11.319> other<00:06:11.500> top<00:06:11.800> that<00:06:11.949> I<00:06:11.979> showed

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:15.749 
you previously on during the day at
night<00:06:14.680> you<00:06:14.830> can<00:06:14.949> still<00:06:15.189> achieve<00:06:15.279> the<00:06:15.460> same

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759
