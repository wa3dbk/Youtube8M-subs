is just going to be the color scheme

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.750 
is just going to be the color scheme
this<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.570> going<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.809> be<00:00:37.250> the<00:00:38.250> color<00:00:38.460> scheme<00:00:38.730> on

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760

the<00:00:38.940> version<00:00:39.300> 2<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:40.110> then<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.620> seem<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.860> what

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the version 2 and then I seem that what

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.139 
the version 2 and then I seem that what
they<00:00:41.280> added<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:41.730> here<00:00:41.760> was<00:00:42.320> this<00:00:43.320> little<00:00:44.149> light

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
they added on here was this little light

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.690 
they added on here was this little light
that<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.629> see<00:00:45.809> right<00:00:45.960> there<00:00:46.430> that's<00:00:47.430> going<00:00:47.579> to

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
that you see right there that's going to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.670 
that you see right there that's going to
illuminate<00:00:48.020> dark<00:00:49.020> spots<00:00:49.350> when<00:00:49.559> you're

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
illuminate dark spots when you're

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.560 
illuminate dark spots when you're
drilling<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.309> working<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.090> things<00:00:51.300> like<00:00:51.390> in

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
drilling and working on things like in

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.619 
drilling and working on things like in
cabinets<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.350> stuff<00:00:52.500> like<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.629> would

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
cabinets and stuff like that I would

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.380 
cabinets and stuff like that I would
have<00:00:54.719> liked<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.050> placement<00:00:55.620> up<00:00:55.710> top<00:00:56.390> probably

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
have liked the placement up top probably

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.630 
have liked the placement up top probably
would<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:57.600> been<00:00:57.690> more<00:00:57.930> efficient<00:00:58.440> but<00:00:58.710> it's

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
would have been more efficient but it's

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.500 
would have been more efficient but it's
okay<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.149> long<00:01:00.239> as<00:01:00.300> they<00:01:00.420> added<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:01.170> there

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
okay as long as they added that on there

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.090 
okay as long as they added that on there
the<00:01:03.510> unique<00:01:03.809> thing<00:01:04.049> about<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.500> drill<00:01:04.860> is

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
actually ended up getting this drill for

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.330 
actually ended up getting this drill for
this<00:02:22.220> attachment<00:02:22.870> exclusively<00:02:27.130> really<00:02:28.130> nice

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
this attachment exclusively really nice

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.390 
this attachment exclusively really nice
it<00:02:28.700> gets<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.030> job<00:02:29.060> done

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
it gets the job done

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.890 
it gets the job done
you<00:02:31.400> pull<00:02:31.640> on<00:02:31.820> this<00:02:31.940> guy<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:32.750> can

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
you pull on this guy and you can

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.060 
you pull on this guy and you can
actually<00:02:34.300> put<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.450> actual<00:02:37.120> driver<00:02:38.120> in<00:02:38.360> there

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
actually put the actual driver in there

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.210 
actually put the actual driver in there
but<00:02:40.070> yeah<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:41.030> works<00:02:41.240> really<00:02:41.480> well<00:02:41.600> I<00:02:42.100> use<00:02:43.100> this

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
but yeah it works really well I use this

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.880 
but yeah it works really well I use this
on<00:02:43.480> repairing<00:02:44.480> my<00:02:44.630> fence<00:02:44.960> in<00:02:45.170> my<00:02:45.260> backyard<00:02:45.470> and

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890

on repairing my fence in my backyard and
I<00:02:46.460> actually<00:02:46.610> needed<00:02:46.970> an<00:02:47.180> impact<00:02:47.510> driver<00:02:47.600> and

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
I actually needed an impact driver and

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.230 
I actually needed an impact driver and
it<00:02:47.960> worked<00:02:48.140> beautifully<00:02:51.730> yeah<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.060> that's

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
it worked beautifully yeah and that's

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.540 
it worked beautifully yeah and that's
pretty<00:02:53.630> much<00:02:53.780> it<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.500> want<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.280> show<00:02:55.460> you

pretty much it and I want to show you

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.840 
pretty much it and I want to show you
guys<00:02:55.730> one<00:02:56.060> more<00:02:56.090> thing<00:02:56.570> here<00:02:57.490> it's<00:02:58.490> going<00:02:58.760> to

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
guys one more thing here it's going to

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.120 
guys one more thing here it's going to
be<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.120> battery<00:02:59.710> this<00:03:00.710> is<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:00.980> original

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
be the battery this is the original

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.550 
be the battery this is the original
battery<00:03:01.520> that<00:03:01.760> came<00:03:02.000> with<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.270> drill<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:03.380> is

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
battery that came with the drill it is

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.560 
battery that came with the drill it is
adequate<00:03:03.950> for<00:03:04.370> you<00:03:04.730> know<00:03:04.820> light<00:03:05.060> duty<00:03:05.360> work

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
adequate for you know light duty work

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.720 
adequate for you know light duty work
but<00:03:06.560> you're<00:03:06.800> probably<00:03:07.070> going<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.400> go<00:03:07.520> through

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
but you're probably going to go through

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.920 
but you're probably going to go through
this<00:03:07.850> pretty<00:03:08.060> quick<00:03:08.420> if<00:03:08.570> you're<00:03:08.690> going<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:08.870> be

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
this pretty quick if you're going to be

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.750 
this pretty quick if you're going to be
working<00:03:09.110> on<00:03:09.380> anything<00:03:09.590> extensively<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.460> for

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
working on anything extensively and for

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.530 
working on anything extensively and for
long<00:03:11.570> periods<00:03:11.960> of<00:03:11.990> time<00:03:12.700> it<00:03:13.700> is<00:03:13.850> lithium<00:03:14.060> ion

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
long periods of time it is lithium ion

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.440 
long periods of time it is lithium ion
powered<00:03:14.990> so<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:16.190> is<00:03:16.370> pretty<00:03:16.580> efficient<00:03:17.209> till

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
powered so it is pretty efficient till

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.390 
powered so it is pretty efficient till
the<00:03:17.570> end<00:03:17.720> it's<00:03:18.530> not<00:03:18.650> going<00:03:18.770> to<00:03:19.010> like<00:03:19.160> lose

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
the end it's not going to like lose

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.690 
the end it's not going to like lose
power<00:03:20.080> like<00:03:21.080> a<00:03:21.110> NiCad<00:03:21.709> batteries<00:03:22.070> will<00:03:22.250> so

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
power like a NiCad batteries will so

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.960 
power like a NiCad batteries will so
just<00:03:22.940> keep<00:03:23.270> that<00:03:23.300> in<00:03:23.510> mind<00:03:24.520> another<00:03:25.520> downside

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
just keep that in mind another downside

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.510 
just keep that in mind another downside
to<00:03:26.660> this<00:03:27.020> is<00:03:27.380> going<00:03:28.130> to<00:03:28.220> be<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:29.020> charge<00:03:30.020> time

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
to this is going to be a charge time

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.400 
to this is going to be a charge time
what<00:03:31.520> they<00:03:31.670> include<00:03:31.940> a<00:03:31.970> charger<00:03:32.450> that<00:03:33.290> you're

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
what they include a charger that you're

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.690 
what they include a charger that you're
given<00:03:33.740> inside<00:03:34.070> the<00:03:34.160> box

this comes with a drill it takes four
averages<00:03:37.670> charge<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.180> standard<00:03:38.510> battery

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
averages charge the standard battery

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.770 
averages charge the standard battery
about<00:03:38.959> five<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:39.350> six<00:03:39.500> hours<00:03:40.390> that's<00:03:41.390> why<00:03:41.750> I

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
about five to six hours that's why I

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.960 
about five to six hours that's why I
actually<00:03:42.050> ended<00:03:42.590> up<00:03:42.709> getting<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.459> extended

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
actually ended up getting the extended

actually ended up getting the extended
battery<00:03:45.250> this<00:03:46.250> is<00:03:46.430> four<00:03:46.730> amp<00:03:46.910> power<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:47.420> it's

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
battery this is four amp power so it's

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.430 
battery this is four amp power so it's
double<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.110> capacity<00:03:48.260> at<00:03:48.980> 20<00:03:49.489> volts<00:03:50.320> ended<00:03:51.320> up

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
double the capacity at 20 volts ended up

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.320 
double the capacity at 20 volts ended up
blind<00:03:51.620> this<00:03:51.860> online<00:03:52.040> because<00:03:52.730> I<00:03:52.850> was<00:03:53.000> doing<00:03:53.270> a
