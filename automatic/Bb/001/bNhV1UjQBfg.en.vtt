good<00:00:01.170> afternoon<00:00:01.350> oh<00:00:01.709> this<00:00:02.280> is<00:00:02.460> james<00:00:02.879> cg<00:00:03.419> from

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
good afternoon oh this is james cg from

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.170 
good afternoon oh this is james cg from
exercise<00:00:04.259> base<00:00:04.500> and<00:00:04.799> today<00:00:05.790> i<00:00:05.819> have<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.089> little

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
exercise base and today i have a little

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.520 
exercise base and today i have a little
question<00:00:06.420> about<00:00:06.960> tiling<00:00:08.450> specifically

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
question about tiling specifically

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.839 
question about tiling specifically
tiling<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:11.040> how<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.309> appears<00:00:11.639> in<00:00:11.759> the

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
tiling and how it appears in the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.900 
tiling and how it appears in the
viewport<00:00:12.059> when<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:12.960> tile<00:00:13.230> textures<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:14.639> what

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
viewport when you tile textures so what

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.630 
viewport when you tile textures so what
we<00:00:15.000> have<00:00:15.179> here<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.690> simple<00:00:16.080> plane<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:17.310> has

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
we have here is a simple plane that has

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.060 
we have here is a simple plane that has
been<00:00:17.880> rotated<00:00:18.330> 90<00:00:18.539> degrees<00:00:18.740> so<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:19.890> vertical

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
been rotated 90 degrees so it's vertical

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.970 
been rotated 90 degrees so it's vertical
I<00:00:20.490> have<00:00:21.240> applied<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.990> texture<00:00:22.380> projection<00:00:22.830> and

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
I have applied a texture projection and

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.330 
I have applied a texture projection and
a<00:00:23.820> texture<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.390> top<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:24.840> it's<00:00:25.199> just<00:00:25.380> sort

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
a texture on top of this it's just sort

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.670 
a texture on top of this it's just sort
of<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.460> grazie<00:00:26.970> on<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.180> white<00:00:27.330> background<00:00:27.680> the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
of a grazie on a white background the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.109 
of a grazie on a white background the
idea<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.039> eventually<00:00:29.369> these<00:00:29.580> already<00:00:29.880> sent

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
idea is eventually these already sent

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.630 
idea is eventually these already sent
bars<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.990> plane<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.859> white<00:00:32.070> parts<00:00:32.430> will

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
bars on a plane and the white parts will

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.760 
bars on a plane and the white parts will
be<00:00:32.669> transparent<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.690> they'll<00:00:34.380> probably<00:00:34.620> end

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
be transparent and they'll probably end

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.680 
be transparent and they'll probably end
up<00:00:34.829> using<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.070> sprite<00:00:35.340> note<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:35.730> for<00:00:35.850> now<00:00:36.000> I've

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
up using a sprite note but for now I've

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.569 
up using a sprite note but for now I've
just<00:00:36.989> created<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.350> material<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.920> simple<00:00:38.250> Lambert

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
just created a material a simple Lambert

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.610 
just created a material a simple Lambert
it's<00:00:39.030> plugged<00:00:39.420> into<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.660> diffuse<00:00:40.110> I'm<00:00:40.320> not

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
it's plugged into the diffuse I'm not

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.760 
it's plugged into the diffuse I'm not
worrying<00:00:40.829> about<00:00:40.950> transparency<00:00:41.629> so<00:00:42.649> this<00:00:43.649> is

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
worrying about transparency so this is

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.959 
worrying about transparency so this is
where<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:43.980> problem<00:00:44.070> comes<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.789> looks

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
where the problem comes in this looks

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.060 
where the problem comes in this looks
wonderful<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:46.079> let's<00:00:46.320> say<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.530> need<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.800> scale

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
wonderful but let's say I need to scale

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.529 
wonderful but let's say I need to scale
this<00:00:47.640> plane<00:00:48.079> let's<00:00:49.079> say<00:00:49.230> four<00:00:49.559> times<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.539> Z

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
this plane let's say four times in the Z

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.569 
this plane let's say four times in the Z
access<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.199> been<00:00:52.350> stretched<00:00:52.620> out<00:00:52.829> well

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
access so it's been stretched out well

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.389 
access so it's been stretched out well
next<00:00:54.420> step<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:54.809> go<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.960> image<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:56.219> know<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
next step we go to image and we know the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.369 
next step we go to image and we know the
Advanced<00:00:56.670> tab<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.480> we're<00:00:57.899> going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.079> scale

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
Advanced tab and we're going to scale

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.069 
Advanced tab and we're going to scale
the<00:00:59.340> texture<00:00:59.670> four<00:00:59.850> times<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.960> looks

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the texture four times and it looks

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.990 
the texture four times and it looks
great<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.739> know<00:01:01.859> that's<00:01:02.219> that's<00:01:02.460> perfect

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
great you know that's that's perfect

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.600 
great you know that's that's perfect
that's<00:01:03.090> why<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.270> want<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.489> so<00:01:05.489> yeah

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
that's why I want to see and so yeah

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.240 
that's why I want to see and so yeah
everything's<00:01:05.909> fine<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.360> now<00:01:07.229> let's<00:01:07.770> bring<00:01:07.950> in

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
everything's fine and now let's bring in

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.840 
everything's fine and now let's bring in
a<00:01:09.080> cylinder<00:01:10.080> will<00:01:10.470> put<00:01:10.680> bars<00:01:10.950> running

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
a cylinder will put bars running

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.990 
a cylinder will put bars running
vertically<00:01:12.689> on<00:01:12.930> either<00:01:13.110> side<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:14.000> plane

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
vertically on either side of this plane

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.499 
vertically on either side of this plane
so<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.900> select<00:01:16.350> polygon<00:01:16.860> mesh<00:01:17.040> cylinder<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.670> I

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
so I select polygon mesh cylinder and I

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.179 
so I select polygon mesh cylinder and I
move<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.900> over<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.619> may<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:19.860> noticed

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
move this over and you may have noticed

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.240 
move this over and you may have noticed
that<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> plane<00:01:20.909> now<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:22.320> texture<00:01:23.070> has

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
that on the plane now the texture has

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.990 
that on the plane now the texture has
resized<00:01:24.030> down<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.689> no<00:01:25.470> repeats<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.369> you

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
resized down to no repeats it is you

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.450 
resized down to no repeats it is you
know<00:01:27.090> covering<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> entire<00:01:27.659> plane<00:01:28.140> now<00:01:28.920> when

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
know covering the entire plane now when

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.090 
know covering the entire plane now when
I<00:01:29.490> go<00:01:29.909> into<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.810> render<00:01:31.079> region<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.680> looks<00:01:31.920> fine

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
I go into a render region it looks fine

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.399 
I go into a render region it looks fine
everything's<00:01:32.820> normal<00:01:32.880> but<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.200> project

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
everything's normal but for the project

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.410 
everything's normal but for the project
i'm<00:01:34.680> doing<00:01:34.710> i'm<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> need<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.939> see<00:01:36.119> how

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
i'm doing i'm going to need to see how

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.810 
i'm doing i'm going to need to see how
the<00:01:36.780> textures<00:01:37.200> look<00:01:37.380> tiled<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:37.979> all<00:01:38.070> times<00:01:38.400> and

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
the textures look tiled at all times and

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.550 
the textures look tiled at all times and
so<00:01:39.780> i'm<00:01:39.900> not<00:01:39.990> really<00:01:40.049> sure<00:01:40.200> what's<00:01:40.500> happening

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
so i'm not really sure what's happening

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.270 
so i'm not really sure what's happening
here<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.850> we<00:01:42.119> go<00:01:42.270> into<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:43.079> image<00:01:43.229> again<00:01:43.439> you

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
here if we go into the image again you

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.830 
here if we go into the image again you
can<00:01:44.399> see<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:44.670> repeated<00:01:44.970> four<00:01:45.180> times<00:01:45.210> as<00:01:45.750> I

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
can see it's repeated four times as I

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.770 
can see it's repeated four times as I
scale<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.110> back<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:47.369> tile<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:48.240> know<00:01:48.329> appears

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
scale it back the tile you know appears

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.990 
scale it back the tile you know appears
correctly<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> image<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:50.579> as<00:01:50.670> soon<00:01:50.790> as<00:01:50.939> I

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
correctly for the image but as soon as I

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.910 
correctly for the image but as soon as I
close<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.450> window<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.290> resorts<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:54.920> you

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
close the window it resorts to this you

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
we lose the tiling and i'm not sure why

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.410 
we lose the tiling and i'm not sure why
that<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.729> texture<00:02:02.729> projection<00:02:03.270> is

scaling with the object which i think
would<00:02:04.979> be<00:02:05.100> normal<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.790> something<00:02:06.719> you'd<00:02:06.840> want
