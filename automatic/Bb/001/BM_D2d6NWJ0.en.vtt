00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
model now here's something basically

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.330 
model now here's something basically
made<00:00:40.160> and<00:00:41.480> I<00:00:42.480> know<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.649> side<00:00:43.920> doesn't<00:00:44.219> look

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
made and I know that side doesn't look

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.860 
made and I know that side doesn't look
as<00:00:44.550> good<00:00:44.670> as<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.969> side<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.360> side<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.629> think

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
as good as this side this side I think

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.709 
as good as this side this side I think
turned<00:00:46.350> out<00:00:46.469> real<00:00:46.710> nice

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
turned out real nice

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.819 
turned out real nice
this<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> sign<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.530> meant<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.640> meant<00:00:50.969> made

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
this was for a sign I meant I meant made

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.040 
this was for a sign I meant I meant made
so<00:00:52.829> anyway<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:54.120> turned<00:00:54.390> out<00:00:54.539> pretty<00:00:54.660> well

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
so anyway that turned out pretty well

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.350 
so anyway that turned out pretty well
so<00:00:55.530> it'll<00:00:55.649> look<00:00:55.710> nice<00:00:56.070> nicer<00:00:57.000> than<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.180> did

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
so it'll look nice nicer than it did

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.420 
so it'll look nice nicer than it did

currently and then I'll rate it if it
was<00:05:09.490> in<00:05:09.669> like<00:05:10.240> pristine<00:05:10.750> condition<00:05:11.409> like

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
was in like pristine condition like

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.119 
was in like pristine condition like
fresh<00:05:12.550> out<00:05:12.729> of<00:05:12.789> the<00:05:12.939> box<00:05:12.969> I'd<00:05:13.629> rate<00:05:14.050> it<00:05:14.080> that<00:05:14.830> I

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:15.129 
fresh out of the box I'd rate it that I

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.869 
fresh out of the box I'd rate it that I
probably<00:05:15.729> do<00:05:15.939> well<00:05:16.870> in<00:05:17.860> the<00:05:18.039> condition<00:05:18.610> it<00:05:18.759> is

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:18.879 
probably do well in the condition it is

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:21.450 
probably do well in the condition it is
basically<00:05:19.539> has<00:05:19.900> a<00:05:19.930> tiny<00:05:20.469> bit<00:05:20.800> of<00:05:20.919> chip<00:05:21.069> but<00:05:21.279> you

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
basically has a tiny bit of chip but you

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.760 
basically has a tiny bit of chip but you
can't<00:05:21.699> even<00:05:21.789> see<00:05:21.879> but<00:05:22.330> like<00:05:23.169> for<00:05:23.439> those<00:05:23.560> of<00:05:23.710> you

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
can't even see but like for those of you

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.379 
can't even see but like for those of you
who<00:05:23.949> really<00:05:24.129> care<00:05:24.520> there's<00:05:24.819> a<00:05:24.909> tiny<00:05:25.240> little

who really care there's a tiny little

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.300 
who really care there's a tiny little
chip<00:05:25.839> you<00:05:26.259> see<00:05:26.439> you<00:05:26.560> can't<00:05:26.770> even<00:05:26.919> see<00:05:27.099> it<00:05:27.129> it's

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
chip you see you can't even see it it's

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.519 
chip you see you can't even see it it's
up<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:27.580> corner<00:05:28.029> of<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.240> thing<00:05:28.810> and<00:05:29.080> then<00:05:29.439> of

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:29.529 
up the corner of the thing and then of

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:31.079 
up the corner of the thing and then of
course<00:05:29.800> it's<00:05:29.919> missing<00:05:30.219> one<00:05:30.249> wheel<00:05:30.610> but<00:05:30.849> it<00:05:30.969> has

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:31.089 
course it's missing one wheel but it has

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:32.730 
course it's missing one wheel but it has
a<00:05:31.120> small<00:05:31.479> wheel<00:05:31.659> on<00:05:31.839> it<00:05:31.960> in<00:05:32.080> the<00:05:32.500> condition

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
a small wheel on it in the condition

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.800 
a small wheel on it in the condition
stands<00:05:33.490> up<00:05:34.110> out<00:05:35.110> of<00:05:35.560> ten<00:05:35.889> I'd<00:05:36.699> rate<00:05:37.000> this<00:05:37.029> an<00:05:37.509> 8
