00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.410
 to any Spanish youtube this 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.509
 information was taken from a video of a 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.980
 American youtuber in which he ensures of 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:20.770
 that this information is totally 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.590
 certain 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:28.689
 there is no statement or any 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.910
 Treyarch official information on 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.710
 this topic but according to the tweet as 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.590
 what this man says is totally 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.890
 certain and that will be done later give to 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.540
 light this information 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.150
 so well I have the benefit of the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.220
 doubt if I fail in this one 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.690
 in this information in fact the fault of 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.910
 this american youtube but according to says 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.870
 is super convinced that what is 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.450
 A) Yes 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.890
 today what I bring you is an information 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.330
 of the multiplayer that will see 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.760
 quite a few big changes me as 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.440
 who understood what I could 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.510
 understand in the video to me is it 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.070
 really liking the change that they are going to 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.659
 do about the classes 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.190
 just as we have it right now in 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.870
 mother bastar bulls call of duty that 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.130
 we have been able to play since the 24 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.000
 because call of duty 2 I could not 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.730
 see is a pretty complete system in 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.860
 not slots 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.300
 we can equip in slot 1 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.730
 for example the main weapon in the 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.590
 slot 2 we can match the weapon 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.710
 secondary the gun the firecrackers and 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.690
 all this kind of paraphernalia and then 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.790
 We have three slots for the advantages and 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.330
 then separate the special grenades 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.310
 then the competition and all this does not 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.670
 in the white everything is going to have a change 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.760
 great in this sense because it will give us 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.190
 choose what kind we can wear 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.530
 this is the same as in call of duty no 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.420
 but the difference is that we're going 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.450
 you were based on a system of 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.960
 point 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.360
 where he explained 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.340
 right now but let's go to the cr 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.020
 we can go fully equipped the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.790
 modern warfare 3 are the call of duty no 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.950
 whatever it is we can not get to cr no 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.470
 we can put with a silencer with 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.340
 red dot our class in exchange for a 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.580
 advantage 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.920
 no competition in the mobile guasa 3 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.500
 change of competition then the eggs 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.940
 puts playmore firecrackers and all these 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.950
 things are all saved that 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.720
 surely they will be on the elbow not you 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.340
 Worry, I'll have your firecracker 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.670
 your grenade launcher your fire 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.850
 fast all this shit that there is but it's going 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.190
 to cost 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.650
 I compare it and I like to compare it 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.330
 with the assassin with the assassin change 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.870
 between white modern warfare 3 and the 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.870
 modern warfare 2 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.900
 force mÃ¼ller before was in modern 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.530
 warfare 2 and order 24 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.810
 but cold blood was also but I 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.209
 in modern warfare2 I almost never saw 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.180
 nobody in cold blood or if I had it 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.640
 put did not get super pig to campear 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.640
 or if I had a solution, sometimes I had 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.319
 solution right now in white and in 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.470
 modern warfare 3 there is a quantity 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.540
 huge number of murderers and ghosts in the 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.000
 that for me is over empowered because 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.819
 does not have a counter, not somebody 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.890
 they can say what recognition 7 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.349
 a torcedora that is useless I say it already 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.440
 It is useless because if you have a m will 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.659
 you stay the same if they throw you a contra 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.889
 counter wow you stay exactly the same 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.690
 it has no cost 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.519
 sincerely happy that it has 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.220
 I will make you imagine for example that 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:33.030
 this is not going to happen like that 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.100
 we have a class that is 30 points per 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.800
 put it that way then the acr for 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.750
 example is worth 5 points is worth then if 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.080
 we want to put for example the point 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.690
 red and the muffler 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.580
 5 more points are added to the acr for 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.140
 example we do not have 10 points and we 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.660
 there are too many 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.580
 this means that what we have 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.760
 that remove the advantages as we put 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.550
 murderers if we do not want to put a stable 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.430
 deadly silence 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.630
 this means that we can sacrifice 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.910
 things in return 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.510
 of having more advantages we can not even 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.849
 have up to 5 advantages for example 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.129
 in exchange for for example I know I do not know 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.680
 if you can give the case but imagine 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.019
 that you go without without weapons you go to knife 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.660
 There are more clues but you have what 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.880
 66 advantages not five advantages this 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.690
 it's pretty good it seems to me 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.930
 correct and we will not see so many people full x 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.740
 not with fire burned pp 90 loaded 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.690
 expanded grenades and all this 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.220
 paraphernalia that I do not like what 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.630
 good that the one who uses it well 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.770
 I respect it but I do not like it 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.729
 I share 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.659
 this 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.889
 I see it quite well because I believe 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.180
 that the data at the beginning if you look at me 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.099
 classes but there is a time that 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.249
 I say good because he does not look at them anymore 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:54.539
 long chronicles and it takes wind this 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:56.729
 what it does is that good I think 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:00.389
 study good then sacrifice the pomegranate 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:02.699
 the blinding for putting the red dot 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.039
 for putting me the enlarged loaded not like 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.319
 I am not competent or the same 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.759
 example with a franc many people do not 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:10.740
 uses the secondary so that same 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.439
 can you catch and tell me to sacrificed the 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.110
 pistol or high school and I wear a 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:17.729
 advantage plus I put the marathon not me 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.110
 I put command I put any 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.149
 foolishness that will surely do 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.360
 is missing because the stars are usually 

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:27.509
 make games that lame walk two 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.339
 good sniper is not that I got excited 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:31.710
 a lot but good we can have this 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:33.479
 option not how to load it extended 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.990
 sacrifice the gun and put a 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.990
 advantage more 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.220
 If this change comes to me 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.479
 It seems a great success because I 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.060
 remember for example the call of duty 4 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:46.400
 in which you equipped with grenade launchers 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.940
 in the weapon and sacrificed the advantage 1 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.830
 that you could not use them in the advantage 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.490
 The 1st seems a great success this 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.810
 system I do not know what you think about 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.249
 what I would like very much of what 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.589
 you think and I'll leave your comment here 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:06.459
 if you liked the video and I hope that 

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:08.589
 yes at least the information we 

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:11.109
 have served to think say pussy then 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:13.629
 could serve me like the video 

00:06:11.109 --> 00:06:15.429
 and that you support the channel and if you 're not 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:19.029
 subscribed to subscribe or it is already so 

00:06:15.429 --> 00:06:21.479
 nothing i xvii I say goodbye to you and 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:21.479
 until another
