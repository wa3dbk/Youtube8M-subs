with<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.900> another<00:00:25.320> good<00:00:25.590> thing<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.920> do<00:00:26.310> is

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.849 

notice<00:00:30.630> there's<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.900> hole<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.470> bottom<00:00:31.619> of

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
notice there's a hole on the bottom of

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.060 
notice there's a hole on the bottom of
this<00:00:32.600> bowl<00:00:34.280> now<00:00:35.570> on<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.899> initial<00:00:37.260> strip<00:00:37.590> and

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
this bowl now on the initial strip and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.330 
this bowl now on the initial strip and
in<00:00:38.250> subsequent<00:00:38.730> castings<00:00:39.530> this<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.920> hard<00:00:41.190> to

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
in subsequent castings this is hard to

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.950 
in subsequent castings this is hard to
get<00:00:41.460> off<00:00:41.579> even<00:00:42.090> after<00:00:42.360> you've<00:00:42.480> stripped<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
get off even after you've stripped the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.440 
get off even after you've stripped the
outer<00:00:43.140> shell<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:44.340> has<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> tendency<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.210> stick

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
outer shell this has a tendency to stick

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.160 
outer shell this has a tendency to stick
in<00:00:45.660> there<00:00:45.690> what<00:00:46.620> I'd<00:00:46.739> like<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.950> do<00:00:47.809> with<00:00:48.809> having

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
in there what I'd like to do with having

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.290 
in there what I'd like to do with having
that<00:00:49.289> hole<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.579> then<00:00:50.730> stick<00:00:50.940> my<00:00:51.090> air

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
that hole and then stick my air

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.150 
that hole and then stick my air
compressor<00:00:51.510> nozzle<00:00:52.410> there<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.829> they<00:00:52.949> give<00:00:53.100> it

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
compressor nozzle there and they give it

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.459 
compressor nozzle there and they give it
a<00:00:53.219> shot<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.610> air<00:00:53.820> when<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.750> give<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.050> shot<00:00:55.320> of

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
a shot of air when you give it a shot of

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.430 
a shot of air when you give it a shot of
air<00:00:55.590> it'll<00:00:56.520> pop<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.940> ball<00:00:57.120> up<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:58.020> will<00:00:58.289> come

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
air it'll pop the ball up and will come

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.110 
air it'll pop the ball up and will come
out<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.590> lot<00:00:58.710> easier<00:00:58.820> now<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.879> way<00:01:00.059> to

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
out a lot easier now the way to

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.740 
out a lot easier now the way to
incorporate<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.410> drill<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.039> hole<00:01:02.750> is

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
incorporate that and drill that hole is

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.980 
incorporate that and drill that hole is
before<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.409> fiberglass<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.400> up<00:01:05.840> in<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
before you fiberglass this up in the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.260 
before you fiberglass this up in the
bottom<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.350> your<00:01:07.380> latex<00:01:07.860> put<00:01:08.369> an<00:01:08.460> earplug<00:01:08.909> like

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
bottom of your latex put an earplug like

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.840 
bottom of your latex put an earplug like
a<00:01:09.299> foam<00:01:09.740> ear<00:01:10.740> plug<00:01:11.040> for<00:01:11.280> hearing<00:01:11.520> protection

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
a foam ear plug for hearing protection

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.330 
a foam ear plug for hearing protection
doesn't<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.990> be<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> whole<00:01:13.350> thing<00:01:13.380> cut

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
doesn't have to be the whole thing cut

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.870 
doesn't have to be the whole thing cut
it<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.520> half<00:01:14.700> put<00:01:15.290> it<00:01:16.290> somewhat<00:01:17.130> center<00:01:17.580> and

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
it in half put it somewhat center and

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.940 
it in half put it somewhat center and
then<00:01:18.450> fiberglass<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:19.650> you're<00:01:19.770> going<00:01:19.920> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
then fiberglass so what you're going to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.090 
then fiberglass so what you're going to
end<00:01:20.009> up<00:01:20.189> with<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> hump<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.720> bowl

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
end up with is a hump in this bowl

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.230 
end up with is a hump in this bowl
you'll<00:01:23.100> see

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
you'll see

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.890 
you'll see
so<00:01:25.110> you're<00:01:25.409> ready<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.710> strip<00:01:26.690> looking<00:01:27.690> for

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
so you're ready to strip looking for

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.980 
so you're ready to strip looking for
that<00:01:28.520> that<00:01:29.520> hump<00:01:29.880> where<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.360> had<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> earplug

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
that that hump where you had the earplug

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.380 
that that hump where you had the earplug
underneath<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:32.190> drill<00:01:32.550> your<00:01:32.700> hole<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.240> way

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
underneath you drill your hole that way

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.440 
underneath you drill your hole that way
you<00:01:33.450> don't<00:01:33.659> drill<00:01:34.170> into<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.619> latex<00:01:35.240> it<00:01:36.240> leaves

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
you don't drill into the latex it leaves

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.690 
you don't drill into the latex it leaves
a<00:01:36.570> buffer<00:01:36.960> then<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.800> give<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> shot<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.520> air

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
a buffer then you give it a shot of air

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.050 
a buffer then you give it a shot of air
gonna<00:01:39.690> pop<00:01:39.930> out<00:01:40.550> now<00:01:41.550> the<00:01:41.610> other<00:01:41.759> thing<00:01:41.970> they

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
gonna pop out now the other thing they

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.149 
gonna pop out now the other thing they
do<00:01:42.210> before<00:01:42.240> initially<00:01:42.960> stripping<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.950> to

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
do before initially stripping this is to

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.800 
do before initially stripping this is to
notch<00:01:45.050> notch<00:01:46.050> out<00:01:46.259> your<00:01:46.880> sides<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.330> your<00:01:48.570> bowl

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
notch notch out your sides and your bowl

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.639 
notch notch out your sides and your bowl
so<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.740> have<00:01:49.890> alignment<00:01:50.190> all<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:50.670> time

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649

as<00:01:55.649> far<00:01:55.920> as<00:01:55.950> clean<00:01:58.340> you<00:01:59.340> build<00:01:59.580> your<00:01:59.729> clay<00:01:59.880> wall

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
as far as clean you build your clay wall

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.090 
as far as clean you build your clay wall
up<00:02:00.619> all<00:02:01.619> along<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.280> edge<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> latex<00:02:03.030> a

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
up all along the edge of the latex a

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.550 
up all along the edge of the latex a

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
couple inches high glass the outside

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.140 
couple inches high glass the outside
first<00:02:08.149> then<00:02:09.149> strip<00:02:10.640> then<00:02:11.640> glass<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.300> inside

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
first then strip then glass the inside
