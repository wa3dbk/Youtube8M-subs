00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:09.470
 so online Motovelo sport.ru 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:21.449
 on the information provided about lapping 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.710
 valves and replacing the knife on creamy 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.869
 caps that I have here 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.060
 publishing motul filed engine 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.789
 In fact, all this is very easy I 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.380
 wanted to lead srx and was ready to give spit 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.370
 on 2 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:38.670
 so what is the whole 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.340
 history throughout the fix 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.640
 I restore as if chronologically 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.010
 where did the cops stand valve to show how 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.520
 they are removed 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.520
 does not work 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:00.170
 in the same condition is this bowl like 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.730
 as a shock absorber in a car that's just 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.190
 to go away is to catch this 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.360
 spring is crackers and such here 2 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.250
 the rim they become a circle all around just 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.930
 clogged like a peg 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.060
 how can a peg be held this way 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.850
 tasks in what to take a candlestick as you can 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:25.250
 so that the patient is centered and now 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:27.229
 so here pave show show a couple 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.800
 strokes must be pre 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.710
 putting a soft screwdriver right under the valve 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.910
 like this so we sell lowered 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.820
 by 5-7 millimeters 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.040
 tom so as not to bend the valve 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.619
 smoothly do not be afraid to bend it 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.899
 difficult to choose a good main screwdriver 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.740
 literate will stand together better to one 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.290
 held and second from top to here 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.240
 a couple of blows they will be soft anyway 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:58.610
 chief pick rubber screwdriver 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:03.500
 not such that the main attack rebounded 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:06.229
