00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
high-yield we see that the Zerg player

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.350 
high-yield we see that the Zerg player
is<00:00:01.680> also<00:00:01.890> expanding<00:00:02.129> there<00:00:02.429> as<00:00:02.550> well<00:00:02.730> that'll

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
is also expanding there as well that'll

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.260 
is also expanding there as well that'll
be<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:04.350> very<00:00:05.040> harsh<00:00:05.279> for<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.549> Protoss<00:00:06.060> player

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
be a very harsh for the Protoss player

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.440 
be a very harsh for the Protoss player
to<00:00:06.420> realize<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:07.049> we<00:00:07.799> see<00:00:07.980> here<00:00:08.309> in<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.849> income

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
to realize and we see here in the income

to realize and we see here in the income
tab<00:00:09.840> that<00:00:10.500> he's<00:00:10.860> almost<00:00:11.099> taking<00:00:11.580> in<00:00:11.610> detaining

tab that he's almost taking in detaining
1.4<00:00:15.360> yeah<00:00:15.780> one<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.260> half<00:00:16.289> times<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:17.010> income

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
1.4 yeah one and a half times the income

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.820 
1.4 yeah one and a half times the income
that<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:18.289> Protoss<00:00:19.289> player<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.619> at<00:00:19.740> this

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
that the Protoss player is at this

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.460 
that the Protoss player is at this
moment<00:00:19.890> let's<00:00:20.670> go<00:00:20.760> back<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:20.939> units<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.660> we<00:00:22.320> see

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
moment let's go back to units and we see

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.160 
moment let's go back to units and we see
here<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.830> army<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.250> comprised<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.699> mainly

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
here the army is comprised the mainly

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.429 
here the army is comprised the mainly
zealots<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:26.539> very<00:00:27.539> large<00:00:27.750> amount<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.050> centuries

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
zealots a very large amount of centuries

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.810 
zealots a very large amount of centuries
for<00:00:28.619> some<00:00:28.740> reason<00:00:29.010> as<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.400> see<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.640> force

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
for some reason as we see the force

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.060 
for some reason as we see the force
fields<00:00:30.090> going<00:00:30.300> up<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.630> defend<00:00:31.500> against<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
fields going up to defend against the

fields going up to defend against the
zerg<00:00:32.189> link<00:00:32.430> threat<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.910> we<00:00:33.600> see<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:34.020> he

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
zerg link threat and we see that he

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.350 
zerg link threat and we see that he
accidentally<00:00:34.739> leaves<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.100> hole<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.730> his<00:00:36.000> force

accidentally leaves a hole in his force

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.030 
accidentally leaves a hole in his force
field<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.930> isn't<00:00:37.320> can<00:00:37.410> be<00:00:37.500> able<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.710> do<00:00:37.860> much

opponent's natural expansion let's see

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.979 
opponent's natural expansion let's see
here<00:00:47.969> with<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> opponents<00:00:48.570> building<00:00:48.840> he

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
here with the opponents building he

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.720 
here with the opponents building he
gonna<00:00:49.469> be<00:00:49.620> building<00:00:49.920> another<00:00:50.129> century<00:00:50.610> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
gonna be building another century and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.580 
gonna be building another century and
some<00:00:50.879> zealots<00:00:51.090> if<00:00:51.780> he<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.110> get<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.260> Center

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
some zealots if he can get that Center

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.410 
some zealots if he can get that Center
up<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.100> build<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> force<00:00:53.579> field<00:00:53.820> here<00:00:54.180> he

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
up just to build the force field here he

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.779 
up just to build the force field here he
might<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.320> good<00:00:55.559> position<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.340> get<00:00:56.670> out

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
might be in a good position to get out

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.650 
might be in a good position to get out
some<00:00:56.969> stalkers<00:00:57.539> or<00:00:58.160> some<00:00:59.160> more<00:00:59.309> immortals<00:00:59.730> we

some stalkers or some more immortals we

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.660 
some stalkers or some more immortals we
see<00:01:00.840> here<00:01:01.050> he<00:01:01.260> still<00:01:01.590> build<00:01:01.949> Phoenix's<00:01:02.460> which

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
see here he still build Phoenix's which

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.880 
see here he still build Phoenix's which

let's see we see a bunch rushing across
the<00:01:13.049> map<00:01:13.260> also<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.490> remainder<00:01:14.970> is

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
the map also the remainder is

the other ones are in the natural

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.330 
the other ones are in the natural
expansion<00:01:18.510> rushing<00:01:19.290> against<00:01:19.620> the<00:01:19.890> Protoss

player and all we're gonna excellent
force<00:01:23.520> field<00:01:23.760> but<00:01:24.410> too<00:01:25.410> little<00:01:25.590> too<00:01:26.010> late<00:01:26.040> for

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
force field but too little too late for

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.340 
force field but too little too late for
the<00:01:26.550> Protoss<00:01:26.910> player<00:01:27.150> as<00:01:27.390> many<00:01:27.690> circlings<00:01:28.230> are

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the Protoss player as many circlings are

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.560 
the Protoss player as many circlings are
in<00:01:28.440> his<00:01:28.590> base<00:01:28.830> and<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:29.760> see<00:01:29.910> the<00:01:30.000> centuries<00:01:30.390> go

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
in his base and we see the centuries go

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.130 
in his base and we see the centuries go
down<00:01:30.750> quickly<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:32.570> cannon<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.690> doing<00:01:33.960> some

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
down quickly the cannon is doing some

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.810 
down quickly the cannon is doing some
work<00:01:34.320> out<00:01:34.530> there<00:01:34.800> it's<00:01:35.010> killing<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.460> few

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
work out there it's killing a few

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.720 
work out there it's killing a few
zerglings<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:37.560> zerglings<00:01:37.800> have<00:01:38.280> very<00:01:38.550> little

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
zerglings the zerglings have very little

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.990 
zerglings the zerglings have very little
HP<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.510> I<00:01:39.840> think<00:01:40.440> they<00:01:40.620> died<00:01:40.860> from<00:01:41.160> the<00:01:41.370> photon

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
HP and I think they died from the photon

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.610 
HP and I think they died from the photon
cannons<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.480> either<00:01:43.110> one<00:01:43.620> or<00:01:43.650> two<00:01:43.890> hits<00:01:45.620> here

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
cannons and either one or two hits here

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.490 
cannons and either one or two hits here
we<00:01:46.710> see<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.240> Phoenix<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.420> using<00:01:49.410> their

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
we see the Phoenix is using their

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.030 
we see the Phoenix is using their
graviton<00:01:50.040> beam<00:01:50.280> beam<00:01:50.970> capability<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.860> lift<00:01:52.860> up

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
graviton beam beam capability to lift up

some<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.370> zerglings<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:54.120> like<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.570> said

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
some of the zerglings but like I said

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.360 
some of the zerglings but like I said
too<00:01:55.080> little<00:01:55.350> too<00:01:55.500> late<00:01:55.530> for<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.950> Protoss

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.250 
too little too late for the Protoss
player<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.450> think<00:01:57.690> this<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.870> going<00:01:58.080> to<00:01:58.170> be

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
player and I think this is going to be

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.200 
player and I think this is going to be
the<00:01:58.410> end<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.710> him<00:01:58.890> if<00:01:59.280> we<00:01:59.790> can<00:01:59.940> get<00:02:00.060> this

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
the end of him if we can get this

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.810 
the end of him if we can get this

we see another gateway going up it's not

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.520
