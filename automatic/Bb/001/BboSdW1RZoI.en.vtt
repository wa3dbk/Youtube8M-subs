something really cool for you guys well
yeah<00:05:20.810> we<00:05:20.960> did<00:05:21.319> start<00:05:21.560> out<00:05:21.680> with<00:05:21.800> the<00:05:21.949> idea<00:05:22.159> of

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
yeah we did start out with the idea of

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.570 
yeah we did start out with the idea of
the<00:05:22.400> camera<00:05:22.639> lenses<00:05:23.030> and<00:05:23.979> antique<00:05:24.979> parts<00:05:25.370> and

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
the camera lenses and antique parts and

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.890 
the camera lenses and antique parts and
stuff<00:05:25.699> like<00:05:25.940> that<00:05:26.000> but<00:05:26.330> when<00:05:26.479> the<00:05:26.569> numbers

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
stuff like that but when the numbers

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.740 
stuff like that but when the numbers
kept<00:05:27.289> climbing<00:05:27.610> it<00:05:28.610> became<00:05:29.060> pretty<00:05:29.360> clear

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
kept climbing it became pretty clear

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.080 
kept climbing it became pretty clear
that<00:05:30.080> we<00:05:30.530> couldn't<00:05:30.830> do<00:05:31.220> that<00:05:31.250> I<00:05:31.460> was<00:05:31.909> going<00:05:32.030> to

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
that we couldn't do that I was going to

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.260 
that we couldn't do that I was going to
be<00:05:32.270> way<00:05:32.599> too<00:05:32.659> time-consuming<00:05:33.169> so<00:05:34.240> basically<00:05:35.240> I

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
be way too time-consuming so basically I

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.610 
be way too time-consuming so basically I
wanted<00:05:35.599> to<00:05:35.720> create<00:05:35.900> something<00:05:35.990> that<00:05:36.349> looked

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
wanted to create something that looked

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.339 
wanted to create something that looked
really<00:05:36.860> cool<00:05:37.159> but<00:05:37.970> that<00:05:38.389> we<00:05:38.539> could<00:05:38.720> cut<00:05:39.080> from

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
really cool but that we could cut from

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:43.089 
really cool but that we could cut from
one<00:05:39.650> single<00:05:40.039> piece<00:05:40.870> so<00:05:41.870> I<00:05:41.900> like<00:05:42.380> the<00:05:42.620> idea<00:05:42.770> of

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
one single piece so I like the idea of

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:46.089 
one single piece so I like the idea of
actually<00:05:43.400> making<00:05:43.759> a<00:05:44.090> frame<00:05:44.479> for<00:05:44.840> the<00:05:45.560> framed

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:46.099 
actually making a frame for the framed

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:49.749 
actually making a frame for the framed
Awards<00:05:46.909> well<00:05:47.569> it<00:05:47.690> started<00:05:48.080> with<00:05:48.289> a<00:05:48.759> messy

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 
Awards well it started with a messy

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.790 
Awards well it started with a messy
sketch<00:05:50.030> of<00:05:50.300> mine<00:05:50.509> and<00:05:50.870> I<00:05:51.110> gave<00:05:51.349> it<00:05:51.379> to<00:05:51.650> my

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
sketch of mine and I gave it to my

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.390 
sketch of mine and I gave it to my
director<00:05:52.270> and<00:05:53.270> he<00:05:53.569> put<00:05:53.840> the<00:05:53.960> design<00:05:54.289> into<00:05:54.919> the

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
director and he put the design into the

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.059 
director and he put the design into the
computer<00:05:56.169> then<00:05:57.169> we<00:05:57.409> take<00:05:57.590> that<00:05:57.800> to<00:05:58.039> a

00:05:58.059 --> 00:05:58.069 
computer then we take that to a

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:00.189 
computer then we take that to a
fabrication<00:05:58.669> shop<00:05:59.090> and<00:05:59.330> they<00:05:59.449> actually<00:05:59.630> cut

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
fabrication shop and they actually cut

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.430 
fabrication shop and they actually cut
the<00:06:00.229> flat<00:06:00.919> pieces<00:06:01.780> by<00:06:02.780> a<00:06:02.810> computer<00:06:03.319> aided

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
the flat pieces by a computer aided

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.120 
the flat pieces by a computer aided
plasma<00:06:04.219> cutter<00:06:04.400> and<00:06:05.300> then<00:06:06.080> they<00:06:06.590> stick<00:06:06.889> it<00:06:07.009> in

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
plasma cutter and then they stick it in

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.920 
plasma cutter and then they stick it in
a<00:06:07.219> machine<00:06:07.370> that<00:06:07.789> makes<00:06:07.969> the<00:06:08.210> bend<00:06:08.389> it's

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
a machine that makes the bend it's

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.309 
a machine that makes the bend it's
really<00:06:09.199> quick<00:06:09.380> and<00:06:09.529> easy<00:06:10.090> and<00:06:11.090> then<00:06:12.050> they<00:06:12.169> give

the<00:06:26.810> leap<00:06:26.930> over<00:06:27.230> into<00:06:27.590> sculpture<00:06:28.370> and<00:06:28.640> not<00:06:28.910> I

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
the leap over into sculpture and not I

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.550 
the leap over into sculpture and not I
wanted<00:06:29.270> to<00:06:29.360> kind<00:06:29.510> of<00:06:29.570> start<00:06:29.780> over<00:06:29.900> so<00:06:30.290> i<00:06:30.320> wanted

brands i guess to start with and it

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.060 
brands i guess to start with and it
probably<00:06:36.380> took<00:06:36.650> me<00:06:36.890> a<00:06:37.250> year<00:06:37.520> of<00:06:39.070> thinking

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
probably took me a year of thinking

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.830 
probably took me a year of thinking
about<00:06:40.160> it<00:06:40.460> and<00:06:40.580> mulling<00:06:40.880> it<00:06:40.970> over<00:06:41.090> and<00:06:41.510> what

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
about it and mulling it over and what

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.130 
about it and mulling it over and what
not<00:06:41.990> to<00:06:42.020> come<00:06:42.200> up<00:06:42.290> with<00:06:42.410> the<00:06:42.530> right<00:06:42.680> name<00:06:42.950> and

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.140 
not to come up with the right name and

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.250 
not to come up with the right name and
the<00:06:45.140> refinery<00:06:45.860> thing<00:06:46.450> basically<00:06:47.450> comes<00:06:47.930> from

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:48.260 
the refinery thing basically comes from

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.890 
the refinery thing basically comes from
the<00:06:48.890> thought<00:06:49.070> of<00:06:49.130> oil<00:06:49.550> refineries<00:06:50.210> factories

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
the thought of oil refineries factories

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.580 
the thought of oil refineries factories
industrial<00:06:51.890> scale<00:06:53.320> manufacturing<00:06:54.320> stuff

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590 
industrial scale manufacturing stuff

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.080 
industrial scale manufacturing stuff
like<00:06:54.770> that<00:06:54.800> for<00:06:55.070> some<00:06:55.220> reason<00:06:55.330> those<00:06:56.330> sorts<00:06:56.780> of

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
like that for some reason those sorts of

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.520 
like that for some reason those sorts of
buildings<00:06:59.090> silhouettes<00:06:59.660> that<00:06:59.960> they<00:07:00.350> really

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530 
buildings silhouettes that they really

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.710 
buildings silhouettes that they really
appeal<00:07:00.830> to<00:07:00.860> me<00:07:01.040> and<00:07:01.400> I<00:07:02.030> also<00:07:02.180> like<00:07:02.510> the<00:07:02.690> idea

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 
appeal to me and I also like the idea

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.640 
appeal to me and I also like the idea
that<00:07:03.080> you<00:07:03.860> know<00:07:03.980> I'm<00:07:04.130> taking<00:07:04.760> things<00:07:05.000> and

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:05.650 
that you know I'm taking things and

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.570 
that you know I'm taking things and
maybe<00:07:06.650> they're<00:07:06.890> things<00:07:07.070> from<00:07:07.250> the<00:07:07.340> scrap<00:07:07.550> yard

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:07.580 
maybe they're things from the scrap yard

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.090 
maybe they're things from the scrap yard
or<00:07:08.150> things<00:07:09.020> that<00:07:09.140> somebody<00:07:09.380> else<00:07:09.590> throw<00:07:09.680> away

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.100 
or things that somebody else throw away

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.370 
or things that somebody else throw away
and<00:07:10.490> I<00:07:11.050> put<00:07:12.050> a<00:07:12.080> new<00:07:12.700> well<00:07:13.700> I<00:07:13.880> we<00:07:14.090> find<00:07:14.600> them<00:07:14.840> into

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380 
and I put a new well I we find them into

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.260 
and I put a new well I we find them into
something<00:07:15.710> else<00:07:15.830> when<00:07:16.610> the<00:07:16.730> frame<00:07:16.940> network

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.270 
something else when the frame network

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.540 
something else when the frame network
approached<00:07:17.720> me<00:07:18.020> to<00:07:18.560> make<00:07:18.740> custom<00:07:19.130> Awards<00:07:19.430> I

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:19.550 
approached me to make custom Awards I

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.100 
approached me to make custom Awards I
was<00:07:19.670> really<00:07:19.970> really<00:07:20.060> excited<00:07:20.270> and<00:07:20.780> I<00:07:20.870> wanted

was really really excited and I wanted
to<00:07:21.170> create<00:07:21.440> something<00:07:21.560> really<00:07:22.250> really

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:22.670
