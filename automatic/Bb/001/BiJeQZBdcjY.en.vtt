jungle because you guys have the we'll
keep<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.470> side<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.740> have<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> disadvantage

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
you can also come up here at the guard

you can also come up here at the guard
tower<00:00:29.340> which<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.820> quite<00:00:30.330> useful<00:00:30.779> spot<00:00:31.050> if

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
tower which is a quite useful spot if

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.680 
tower which is a quite useful spot if
you<00:00:31.410> have<00:00:31.529> flak<00:00:31.890> jacket<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:33.000> gun<00:00:33.540> that's

you have flak jacket and a gun that's

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.810 
you have flak jacket and a gun that's
going<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:34.050> lots<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.440> ammo<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.100> which<00:00:35.640> I

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
going to have lots of ammo in it which I

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.910 
going to have lots of ammo in it which I
have<00:00:36.000> both<00:00:36.300> which<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.750> cool<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.969> I<00:00:39.739> warlord<00:00:40.739> I

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
have both which is cool and I warlord I

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.440 
have both which is cool and I warlord I
would<00:00:41.070> recommend<00:00:41.370> sleight<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.879> hand<00:00:42.180> for<00:00:42.390> this

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
would recommend sleight of hand for this

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.090 
would recommend sleight of hand for this
map<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.989> reason<00:00:43.290> being<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:43.950> quite

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
map the reason being is that it's quite

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.310 
map the reason being is that it's quite
quite<00:00:44.940> close<00:00:45.660> combat<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:47.960> and<00:00:48.960> there's<00:00:49.170> going

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
quite close combat and and there's going

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.740 
quite close combat and and there's going
to<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.530> lot<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:50.000> needing<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.149> reload<00:00:51.480> and

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
to be a lot of needing to reload and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.600 
to be a lot of needing to reload and
lots<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.050> fast-paced<00:00:52.559> action<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.280> firing

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
lots of fast-paced action on firing

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.880 
lots of fast-paced action on firing
range<00:00:54.000> one<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.079> reasons<00:00:55.320> when<00:00:55.590> people

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
range one of the reasons when people

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.650 
range one of the reasons when people
like<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.579> pretty<00:00:56.850> much<00:00:56.969> took<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.449> guard

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
like it and I pretty much took the guard

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.299 
like it and I pretty much took the guard
tower<00:00:57.870> route<00:00:58.109> just<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.440> get<00:00:58.620> over<00:00:58.739> here<00:00:59.160> now

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
tower route just to get over here now

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.069 
tower route just to get over here now
what<00:00:59.789> I'm<00:00:59.910> doing<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.300> I'm<00:01:00.480> cutting<00:01:00.899> through

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
what I'm doing is I'm cutting through

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.810 
what I'm doing is I'm cutting through
back<00:01:01.260> jungle<00:01:01.680> because<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.100> realized<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.579> my

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
back jungle because I realized that my

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.630 
back jungle because I realized that my
team<00:01:03.390> my<00:01:03.629> party<00:01:03.960> we<00:01:04.439> push<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.860> spawn<00:01:05.159> back<00:01:05.430> up

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
team my party we push the spawn back up

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.060 
team my party we push the spawn back up
to<00:01:05.820> see<00:01:06.090> domination<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.350> want<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.740> try<00:01:07.890> and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
to see domination so I want to try and

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.340 
to see domination so I want to try and
sit<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.400> firing<00:01:08.729> range<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.720> i<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:10.049> get<00:01:10.140> them<00:01:10.320> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
sit in firing range so i can get them to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.410 
sit in firing range so i can get them to
spawn<00:01:10.710> all<00:01:10.979> at<00:01:11.250> sea<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.790> when<00:01:11.939> we<00:01:12.060> wipe<00:01:12.240> them

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
spawn all at sea so when we wipe them

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.080 
spawn all at sea so when we wipe them
out<00:01:12.540> i<00:01:12.780> can<00:01:13.260> move<00:01:13.470> at<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.920> firing<00:01:14.369> range<00:01:14.549> and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
out i can move at a firing range and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.270 
out i can move at a firing range and
they'll<00:01:15.330> spawn<00:01:15.659> back<00:01:16.110> at<00:01:16.380> firing<00:01:16.799> range<00:01:17.040> which

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
they'll spawn back at firing range which

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.730 
they'll spawn back at firing range which
we<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.580> start<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.030> spell<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.299> trap<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.869> by

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
we can start the spell and trap on by

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.730 
we can start the spell and trap on by
range<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.189> quite<00:01:20.520> basic<00:01:20.790> spawns<00:01:21.299> um<00:01:21.600> if<00:01:22.530> you're

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
range is quite basic spawns um if you're

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.320 
range is quite basic spawns um if you're
sitting<00:01:22.950> where<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.250> am<00:01:23.280> there<00:01:23.460> probably<00:01:23.909> starts

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
sitting where I am there probably starts

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.969 
sitting where I am there probably starts
calling<00:01:24.509> firing<00:01:25.049> range<00:01:25.229> if<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.560> push<00:01:25.799> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
calling firing range if you push the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.530 
calling firing range if you push the
trailer<00:01:26.250> side<00:01:26.549> too<00:01:26.759> much<00:01:26.939> they<00:01:27.180> will<00:01:27.420> be

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
trailer side too much they will be

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.109 
trailer side too much they will be
forced<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.200> spawn<00:01:28.740> firing<00:01:29.250> range<00:01:29.490> it's

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
forced to spawn firing range it's

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.149 
forced to spawn firing range it's
actually<00:01:30.299> quite<00:01:30.630> basic<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.320> that's<00:01:31.470> why<00:01:31.619> I'm

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
actually quite basic and that's why I'm

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.649 
actually quite basic and that's why I'm
running<00:01:32.310> around<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.790> lot<00:01:32.939> because<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.299> want<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
running around a lot because I want to

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.719 
running around a lot because I want to
get<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> firing<00:01:34.320> range<00:01:34.560> spawn<00:01:34.890> trap<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.549> so

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
get the firing range spawn trap just so

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.700 
get the firing range spawn trap just so
I<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:35.880> show<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.180> guys<00:01:36.329> how<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.570> get<00:01:36.780> because<00:01:37.680> a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
I can show you guys how to get because a

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.800 
I can show you guys how to get because a
lot<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.920> people<00:01:38.009> i<00:01:38.790> know<00:01:38.970> i<00:01:39.299> know<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:39.720> like
