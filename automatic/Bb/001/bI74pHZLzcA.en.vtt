video<00:00:23.160> call<00:00:23.550> now<00:00:23.730> because<00:00:23.910> then<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.330> could

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
video call now because then you could

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.529 
video call now because then you could
see<00:00:24.600> what<00:00:24.750> they're<00:00:24.930> seeing<00:00:25.230> right<00:00:25.580> now<00:00:26.580> until

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
see what they're seeing right now until

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.800 
see what they're seeing right now until
I<00:00:27.960> until<00:00:28.920> face<00:00:29.130> time<00:00:29.429> until<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.179> ipod<00:00:30.570> has<00:00:30.750> a

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
I until face time until the ipod has a

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.740 
I until face time until the ipod has a
camera<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.710> can't<00:00:31.949> do<00:00:32.099> two<00:00:32.309> way<00:00:32.460> calls<00:00:32.790> but<00:00:33.480> at

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
camera you can't do two way calls but at

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.540 
camera you can't do two way calls but at
least<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.380> do<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> one-way<00:00:34.980> see<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.280> right

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
that's good enough for now because you

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.560 
that's good enough for now because you
to<00:00:37.920> do<00:00:38.070> what<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.460> should<00:00:38.700> do<00:00:38.850> what<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:39.390> have
