heavyweights go back and forth you know

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.420 
heavyweights go back and forth you know
I<00:00:23.420> think<00:00:23.570> this<00:00:23.930> LSU<00:00:24.350> team<00:00:24.710> is<00:00:24.920> a<00:00:25.039> team<00:00:25.070> that<00:00:25.369> has

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
I think this LSU team is a team that has

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.130 
I think this LSU team is a team that has
really<00:00:25.789> matured<00:00:25.940> throughout<00:00:26.480> the<00:00:26.600> year<00:00:26.840> and

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
really matured throughout the year and

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.080 
really matured throughout the year and
gotten<00:00:27.500> better<00:00:27.619> it's<00:00:27.860> a<00:00:27.890> lot<00:00:28.039> of<00:00:28.130> 18<00:00:28.430> 19<00:00:28.640> 20

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
gotten better it's a lot of 18 19 20

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.660 
gotten better it's a lot of 18 19 20
year-olds<00:00:29.539> and<00:00:29.720> so<00:00:30.440> they're<00:00:30.590> improving<00:00:30.890> we

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
year-olds and so they're improving we

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.149 
year-olds and so they're improving we
can<00:00:31.880> a<00:00:31.910> week<00:00:32.149> out<00:00:32.329> and<00:00:32.689> really<00:00:33.019> excited<00:00:33.920> to<00:00:33.980> see

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:34.159 
can a week out and really excited to see

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:35.950 
can a week out and really excited to see
how<00:00:34.309> they're<00:00:34.489> going<00:00:34.609> to<00:00:34.730> be<00:00:35.149> able<00:00:35.359> to<00:00:35.569> match<00:00:35.749> up

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
how they're going to be able to match up

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.480 
how they're going to be able to match up
versus<00:00:36.289> Alabama<00:00:36.530> team

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.490 
versus Alabama team

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.730 
versus Alabama team
is<00:00:38.940> alabama's<00:00:39.480> defensive<00:00:39.960> front<00:00:40.230> as<00:00:40.440> good<00:00:40.620> as

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.740 
is alabama's defensive front as good as

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.560 
is alabama's defensive front as good as
advertised<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.490> think<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:41.880> I<00:00:42.090> think<00:00:42.210> they're

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
advertised I think so I think they're

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.330 
advertised I think so I think they're
one<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.810> the<00:00:42.900> best<00:00:43.110> defenses<00:00:43.740> of<00:00:43.890> stopping<00:00:44.220> to

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
one of the best defenses of stopping to

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.490 
one of the best defenses of stopping to
run<00:00:44.550> with<00:00:45.330> statistically<00:00:46.050> they're<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.320> best

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
run with statistically they're the best

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.870 
run with statistically they're the best
in<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.650> SEC<00:00:46.770> house<00:00:47.160> i<00:00:47.310> think<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.550> probably<00:00:47.640> one

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
in the SEC house i think is probably one

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
in the SEC house i think is probably one
of<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> best<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.300> country<00:00:48.510> they<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:48.870> a

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
of the best in the country they do a

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.260 
of the best in the country they do a
really<00:00:49.110> good<00:00:49.380> job<00:00:49.460> big<00:00:50.460> bodies<00:00:50.880> they<00:00:51.060> fill

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
really good job big bodies they fill

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.120 
really good job big bodies they fill
their<00:00:51.420> holes<00:00:51.660> they<00:00:51.900> put<00:00:52.200> a<00:00:52.320> two-gap<00:00:52.770> and

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
their holes they put a two-gap and

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.250 
their holes they put a two-gap and
they're<00:00:53.880> really<00:00:54.030> that's<00:00:54.330> why<00:00:54.450> it's<00:00:55.020> going<00:00:55.170> to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
they're really that's why it's going to

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.510 
they're really that's why it's going to
be<00:00:55.320> tough<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:55.590> LSU<00:00:55.830> to<00:00:56.040> run<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.310> ball<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.490> think

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
be tough for LSU to run the ball I think

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.580 
be tough for LSU to run the ball I think
they<00:00:56.790> need<00:00:56.970> to<00:00:57.060> do<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.360> consistently<00:00:57.810> but<00:00:58.470> also

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
they need to do it consistently but also

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.320 
they need to do it consistently but also
need<00:00:58.860> to<00:00:58.890> have<00:00:59.010> be<00:00:59.580> able<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.820> get<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.970> few<00:01:00.150> big

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
need to have be able to get a few big

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.270 
need to have be able to get a few big
plays<00:01:00.360> running<00:01:00.900> the<00:01:01.050> ball<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.560> they<00:01:01.710> they<00:01:01.950> can

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
plays running the ball so they they can

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.980 
plays running the ball so they they can
stay<00:01:02.490> with<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.880> and<00:01:03.090> go<00:01:03.210> play<00:01:03.390> action<00:01:03.570> over<00:01:03.870> the
