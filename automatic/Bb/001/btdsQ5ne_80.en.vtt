00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hello dear friends with you - three 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.370
 the fives we continue our assembly of the cube 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.780
 rubik 3 for 3 is 5 this 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.379
 and in this stage I will tell you about how 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:21.650
 until the end fill the last layer of the cube but 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:24.210
 and before all the same quickly collect it well 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.060
 as you remember we stopped at yellow 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.369
 cross and equalizing all middles on 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.140
 cubes further we need to create 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.530
 one correct item here it is 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.440
 correct item 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.750
 that is, it is an element that is already on 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.719
 Combine but it can be properly 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.379
 focused on the example yellow green 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.410
 red he is already in place 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.280
 green red yellow here he stands on 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.410
 its place 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.010
 accordingly, this element is already 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.530
 correct but nevertheless this blue 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.430
 orange yellow he stands wrong 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.510
 since there is red blue and yellow 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.350
 accordingly this element is 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.000
 wrong and later after that you have 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.850
 it may happen that there is not one 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.100
 the right element that is all 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.890
 the elements are out of place well though 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.990
 this one is already in place 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.869
 this element no role to us 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.250
 practically does not give 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.320
 if you don't have one right 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.299
 element then you need to choose 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.689
 absolutely any facet of the cube 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.229
 that is, whatever we do next 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.229
 formula 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.000
 here and we have created the right min then 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.939
 there are yellow and green orange 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.920
 orange green yellow that is 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.039
 the experiment is already in place the rest 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.170
 so far we stand wrong sometimes 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.939
 application of this algorithm in the amount of 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.810
 once is not enough to do 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.820
 tasks so we need if you have 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.590
 still no case of the right 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.250
 item after doing this 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.950
 of the algorithm 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.410
 then you need to repeat on the same 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.060
 the side where you did the algorithms 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:20.989
 this algorithm again until you have 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.640
 one correct moment will appear after 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.739
 of how you got the right one 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.860
 element now do so to us 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.230
 was on the right hand here he should 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.010
 being here and doing the same 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.010
 the algorithm itself 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.610
 that 's how we see nothing 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.620
 changed all our elements never on 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.050
 its place so we commit it yet 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.870
 since all of our elements are still 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.060
 itâ€™s worth doing wrong 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.250
 this one was right on our right hand 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.190
 and accordingly if we have all the elements 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.790
 don't become righteous the algorithm is necessary 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:12.560
 this show up until the moment 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:14.870
 the right moment doesn't happen here and we 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.790
 we see that now the situation has even become 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:23.150
 better we see our correct 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.160
 the element is already in its place 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.750
 spent was created to do right 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.500
 this item i have yellow blue 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.239
 red red blue yellow meaning he 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.130
 already standing in its place like this 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.319
 accordingly, the elements are already on 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.060
 the correct position and here are these 2 elements 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:43.010
 so much the more embarked 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:45.829
 And now I'll show you one more time that is 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.430
 we find one right moment and on it 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:52.150
 make the form that I already 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.150
 showed 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.989
 Here we see that the elements are still not 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.920
 stands in its place exactly we repeat 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:05.680
 this formula 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:09.430
 once again here and we got the same 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:13.239
 the situation itself sometimes happens that there is 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.730
 3 elements have two elements and even 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.250
 four elements will stand still but 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.739
 none of them will stand up correctly as 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.900
 number this one if you have exactly this 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.680
 do not be alarmed but you have all the elements 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.539
 will become and right now whatever 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.610
 there was a situation you need to know 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:34.960
 just one formula that will allow 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.880
 put elements into place we make 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.710
 so that we have the right element 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:49.000
 on the right hand 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:51.849
 completely next burns here and lay 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.919
 dream nothing really changed everything 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:57.270
 only violated but this algorithm is not 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.930
 the rise repeats the goal of the moment 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.550
 the corresponding yellow element is not 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:06.430
 will fall into place that is, we do 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:10.349
 him again here we see it still he is not 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.349
 I got so really it again 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.550
 here is the element in place we see that 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.630
 he now turns once 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.900
 right side 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.780
 our top and now this element 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:36.830
 need to put in place that is the same 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:40.460
 the very algorithm here we see that to us 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:45.380
 stayed once that's all Rubik's cube 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:47.090
 assembled well let's do it again 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.880
 demonstrate to those who do not understand something 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.500
 we have one correct element 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.450
 should the site on the right hand and we 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.190
 We make this algorithm for now. 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.190
 the element will not fall into place 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:15.030
 here we see the element has fallen into place 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.569
 rotate once not so here 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:26.130
 set 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:28.229
 namely, we rotate and we see 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.150
 now everything has fallen into place 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:32.479
 now we turn everything up to that moment 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:37.169
 until everything is the same 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:39.120
 that's all the Rubik's cube is assembled but I want 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.280
 say the technique was used alone 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.729
 from the simplest well that there is someone that is 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.380
 it was not clear for the whole lesson 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:49.909
 contact me in the comments and 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:53.400
 write to the channel I will answer you 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:55.680
 but it was all a tool for assembling the cube 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.419
 Rubik for beginners thanks for all 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.370
 viewing put your thumbs up 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:01.909
 subscribe to my channel everybody before 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.909
