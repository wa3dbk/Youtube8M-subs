several times in the past so of course I

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.959 
several times in the past so of course I
said<00:00:10.110> yeah<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:11.219> things<00:00:11.400> they<00:00:11.519> had<00:00:11.639> in<00:00:11.670> mind

this<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.360> first<00:00:12.570> one<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.840> them<00:00:13.080> this

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
this is the first one of them this

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.499 
this is the first one of them this
doesn't<00:00:14.190> look<00:00:14.250> like<00:00:14.309> much<00:00:14.670> at<00:00:15.000> first<00:00:15.240> glance

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
doesn't look like much at first glance

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.050 
doesn't look like much at first glance
but<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.230> from<00:00:16.470> Xiaomi<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:17.910> is

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
but this is from Xiaomi and this is

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.890 
but this is from Xiaomi and this is
their<00:00:18.270> Wi-Fi<00:00:19.080> 802

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
their Wi-Fi 802

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.000 
their Wi-Fi 802
now<00:00:21.900> as<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.080> can<00:00:22.170> see<00:00:22.230> just<00:00:22.529> from<00:00:22.619> my<00:00:22.800> hand

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
now as you can see just from my hand

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.950 
now as you can see just from my hand
size<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.550> not<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> massive<00:00:24.269> router<00:00:24.660> and

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
size this is not a massive router and

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.740 
size this is not a massive router and
actually<00:00:25.920> at<00:00:26.039> first<00:00:26.340> glance<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:27.119> like<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.510> idea

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
actually at first glance I like the idea

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.500 
actually at first glance I like the idea
that<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:27.990> 802<00:00:28.320> 11<00:00:28.349> AC<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.279> don't<00:00:29.730> read<00:00:30.179> Chinese

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
that is 802 11 AC I don't read Chinese

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.359 
that is 802 11 AC I don't read Chinese
or<00:00:30.960> speak<00:00:31.170> Chinese<00:00:31.590> but<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:31.859> can<00:00:32.070> tell<00:00:32.250> from

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
or speak Chinese but I can tell from

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.500 
or speak Chinese but I can tell from
right<00:00:32.610> here<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.910> says<00:00:33.059> 210<00:00:33.809> 100<00:00:34.380> LAN<00:00:34.770> ports<00:00:35.219> and

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
right here it says 210 100 LAN ports and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.490 
right here it says 210 100 LAN ports and
110<00:00:36.510> 100<00:00:36.989> yn<00:00:37.500> port<00:00:37.829> as<00:00:38.040> well<00:00:38.430> as<00:00:38.610> 1<00:00:38.850> USB<00:00:39.239> 2<00:00:39.420> port

on<00:00:40.500> something<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.040> does<00:00:41.160> 802<00:00:41.550> 11<00:00:41.579> AC<00:00:42.059> which

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
on something that does 802 11 AC which

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.990 
on something that does 802 11 AC which
is<00:00:42.690> capable<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.500> quote<00:00:44.010> unquote<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.760> little

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
is capable of quote unquote a little

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.119 
is capable of quote unquote a little
over<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> thousand<00:00:45.660> megabits<00:00:46.020> per<00:00:46.079> second<00:00:46.559> it's

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
over a thousand megabits per second it's

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.430 
over a thousand megabits per second it's
interesting<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.940> see<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.329> would<00:00:48.450> have<00:00:48.629> 10

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
interesting to see that it would have 10

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.799 
interesting to see that it would have 10
100<00:00:49.920> ports<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.489> are<00:00:50.640> wired<00:00:50.879> with<00:00:51.329> faster

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
100 ports that are wired with faster

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.600 
100 ports that are wired with faster
than<00:00:51.930> 100<00:00:52.289> megabits<00:00:52.649> per<00:00:52.710> second<00:00:53.129> Wireless

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
than 100 megabits per second Wireless

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.369 
than 100 megabits per second Wireless
but<00:00:54.329> anyway<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.690> thought<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.050> would<00:00:55.170> go<00:00:55.260> ahead

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
but anyway I thought I would go ahead

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.049 
but anyway I thought I would go ahead
and<00:00:55.500> open<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.800> up<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.219> worst<00:00:56.399> case<00:00:56.640> scenario

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
and open this up the worst case scenario

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.700 
and open this up the worst case scenario
it<00:00:57.360> would<00:00:57.449> be<00:00:57.510> an<00:00:57.660> interesting<00:00:57.840> way<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.199> extend

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
it would be an interesting way to extend

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.260 
it would be an interesting way to extend
a<00:00:58.829> network<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.370> all<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> devices<00:01:00.239> that

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
a network if all of the devices that

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.049 
a network if all of the devices that
you've<00:01:00.480> got<00:01:00.719> do<00:01:01.020> support<00:01:01.379> 802<00:01:01.800> 11<00:01:01.829> AC<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
you've got do support 802 11 AC and the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.460 
you've got do support 802 11 AC and the
worst<00:01:03.239> case<00:01:03.449> scenario<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.930> could<00:01:04.260> probably

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
worst case scenario you could probably

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.440 
worst case scenario you could probably
use<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.979> as<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> wireless<00:01:05.369> bridge<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.970> some<00:01:06.119> sort

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
use it as a wireless bridge of some sort

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.719 
use it as a wireless bridge of some sort
alright<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.409> there's<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.680> lot<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.890> Chinese<00:01:08.549> on

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
alright so there's a lot of Chinese on

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.130 
alright so there's a lot of Chinese on
there<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.060> unfortunately<00:01:09.510> again<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:09.990> not

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
there and unfortunately again I do not

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.960 
there and unfortunately again I do not
read<00:01:10.470> Chinese<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.220> I'll<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:11.790> kind

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
read Chinese so I'll have to just kind

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.609 
read Chinese so I'll have to just kind
of<00:01:12.030> leave<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.020> guys<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.350> let<00:01:13.439> me<00:01:13.590> know

your power brick and a little bit of

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.330 
your power brick and a little bit of
documentation<00:01:32.869> but<00:01:33.869> again<00:01:34.290> it's<00:01:34.979> all<00:01:35.189> in

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
documentation but again it's all in

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.890 
documentation but again it's all in
Chinese<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.119> doesn't<00:01:36.329> do<00:01:36.390> me<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.540> lot<00:01:36.750> of

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
Chinese so it doesn't do me a lot of

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.810 
Chinese so it doesn't do me a lot of
good<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.590> does<00:01:37.860> here<00:01:38.159> have<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> barcode<00:01:38.759> scanner

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
good it does here have a barcode scanner

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.910 
good it does here have a barcode scanner
so<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.630> go<00:01:39.750> ahead<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:39.960> try<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.259> get<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> app

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
so I can go ahead and try to get the app

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.859 
so I can go ahead and try to get the app
on<00:01:41.100> my<00:01:41.220> smart<00:01:41.520> phone<00:01:41.729> but<00:01:42.150> other<00:01:42.329> than<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.570> I

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
on my smart phone but other than that I

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.810 
on my smart phone but other than that I
can't<00:01:42.899> read<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.530> that's<00:01:44.100> one<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.549> things<00:01:44.729> I

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
can't read it that's one of the things I

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.550 
can't read it that's one of the things I
read<00:01:45.000> about<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.479> dealextreme<00:01:45.780> site<00:01:46.259> and

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
read about on the dealextreme site and

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.899 
read about on the dealextreme site and
on<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.680> couple<00:01:46.979> other<00:01:47.040> sites<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.670> that

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
on a couple other sites is that

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.149 
on a couple other sites is that
apparently<00:01:48.240> even<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.320> entire<00:01:49.619> UI<00:01:50.009> is

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
apparently even on this the entire UI is

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.789 
apparently even on this the entire UI is
in<00:01:50.549> Chinese<00:01:50.939> if<00:01:51.840> you're<00:01:52.020> using<00:01:52.200> Chrome<00:01:52.470> or

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.289 
in Chinese if you're using Chrome or
something<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.579> use<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.060> in

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
something like that you can use the in

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.929 
something like that you can use the in
browser<00:01:54.600> translator<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.619> take<00:01:56.399> advantage<00:01:56.790> of

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
browser translator to take advantage of

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.520 
browser translator to take advantage of
it<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.360> also<00:01:57.570> saw<00:01:57.869> something<00:01:58.110> online<00:01:58.380> where

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
it but I also saw something online where

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.800 
it but I also saw something online where
you<00:01:58.710> might<00:01:58.979> be<00:01:59.009> able<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.310> flash<00:01:59.460> dd-wrt<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.630> it

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
you might be able to flash dd-wrt to it

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.780 
you might be able to flash dd-wrt to it
so<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.469> don't<00:02:01.649> know<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:02.070> might<00:02:02.280> turn<00:02:02.460> into<00:02:02.640> a

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
so I don't know this might turn into a

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.459 
so I don't know this might turn into a
wireless<00:02:03.240> bridge<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.810> might<00:02:03.990> turn<00:02:04.140> into<00:02:04.380> me

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
wireless bridge it might turn into me

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.319 
wireless bridge it might turn into me
hooking<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.829> directly<00:02:05.189> into<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.729> cable<00:02:06.090> modem

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
hooking it directly into the cable modem

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.089 
hooking it directly into the cable modem
and<00:02:06.719> using<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.200> as<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.409> primary<00:02:07.649> source<00:02:08.009> of

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
and using it as the primary source of

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.949 
and using it as the primary source of
Wi-Fi<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.819> then<00:02:08.940> having<00:02:09.119> my<00:02:09.239> gigabit<00:02:09.750> wired

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
Wi-Fi and then having my gigabit wired

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.869 
Wi-Fi and then having my gigabit wired
network<00:02:10.379> separately<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.129> really<00:02:11.520> don't<00:02:11.700> know<00:02:11.849> I

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
network separately I really don't know I

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.390 
network separately I really don't know I
don't

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
don't

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.670 
don't
wireless<00:02:13.030> in<00:02:13.209> my<00:02:13.329> desktops<00:02:13.780> at<00:02:13.930> this<00:02:14.079> point<00:02:14.349> so

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
wireless in my desktops at this point so

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.929 
wireless in my desktops at this point so
we'll<00:02:15.220> just<00:02:15.400> have<00:02:15.489> to<00:02:15.549> sort<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.790> see<00:02:15.909> what

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
we'll just have to sort of see what

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.220 
we'll just have to sort of see what
happens<00:02:16.329> with<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:16.599> but<00:02:16.810> at<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:16.959> point<00:02:17.079> I'm

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
happens with it but at this point I'm

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.270 
happens with it but at this point I'm
going<00:02:17.379> to<00:02:17.439> go<00:02:17.530> ahead<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:17.829> hook<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.010> up<00:02:18.129> I'll

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
going to go ahead and hook it up I'll

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.860 
going to go ahead and hook it up I'll
plug<00:02:18.489> a<00:02:18.519> desktop<00:02:18.909> into<00:02:19.209> it<00:02:19.329> and<00:02:19.450> make<00:02:19.629> sure

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
plug a desktop into it and make sure

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.330 
plug a desktop into it and make sure
that<00:02:20.049> it<00:02:20.170> actually<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.620> hundred<00:02:20.980> megabit

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
that it actually is hundred megabit

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.649 
that it actually is hundred megabit
because<00:02:21.549> it<00:02:21.730> could<00:02:21.909> just<00:02:22.030> be<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.480> box

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
because it could just be that the box

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:24.149 
because it could just be that the box
hasn't<00:02:22.900> been<00:02:23.140> updated<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.829> we'll<00:02:23.950> just<00:02:24.069> see

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
hasn't been updated and we'll just see

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.800 
hasn't been updated and we'll just see
what<00:02:24.250> happens<00:02:24.610> all<00:02:24.760> right<00:02:25.060> I'm<00:02:25.239> back<00:02:25.269> a<00:02:25.510> little

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
what happens all right I'm back a little

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.420 
what happens all right I'm back a little
bit<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:25.989> a<00:02:26.049> scene<00:02:26.260> shift<00:02:26.560> here<00:02:26.920> I've<00:02:27.099> spent<00:02:27.310> a

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
bit of a scene shift here I've spent a

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.009 
bit of a scene shift here I've spent a
little<00:02:27.579> bit<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:27.849> time<00:02:28.030> with<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.329> xiaomi

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019

wireless router at this point and
unfortunately<00:02:31.569> my<00:02:31.720> earlier<00:02:32.019> suspicions<00:02:32.620> were

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
unfortunately my earlier suspicions were

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.339 
unfortunately my earlier suspicions were
confirmed<00:02:32.980> in<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:34.180> does<00:02:34.390> only<00:02:34.659> do<00:02:34.930> 100

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
confirmed in that it does only do 100

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:36.869 
confirmed in that it does only do 100

online sites the entire UI is in Chinese

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.220 
online sites the entire UI is in Chinese
which<00:02:42.370> made<00:02:42.879> the<00:02:43.030> setup<00:02:43.329> process<00:02:43.540> quite<00:02:44.200> a

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
which made the setup process quite a

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.780 
which made the setup process quite a
little<00:02:44.500> bit<00:02:44.590> difficult<00:02:44.889> because<00:02:45.280> if<00:02:45.639> you're

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
little bit difficult because if you're

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.430 
little bit difficult because if you're

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.819 
translations for you you can't actually
get<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.510> translation<00:02:53.109> so<00:02:53.319> what<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.470> ended<00:02:53.739> up

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
get the translation so what I ended up

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.349 
get the translation so what I ended up
doing<00:02:53.980> was<00:02:54.370> I<00:02:54.519> connected<00:02:54.909> to<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.090> through<00:02:55.239> my

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
doing was I connected to it through my

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.179 
doing was I connected to it through my
phone<00:02:55.659> and<00:02:55.959> then<00:02:56.470> when<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:56.680> would<00:02:56.829> get<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:56.950> page

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
phone and then when I would get a page

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:58.890 
phone and then when I would get a page
loaded<00:02:57.579> I<00:02:57.730> would<00:02:57.879> disconnect<00:02:58.269> from<00:02:58.389> the<00:02:58.540> Wi-Fi

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
loaded I would disconnect from the Wi-Fi

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.679 
loaded I would disconnect from the Wi-Fi
let<00:02:59.319> the<00:02:59.470> LTE<00:02:59.920> takeover<00:03:00.609> do<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.090> translation

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:01.689 
let the LTE takeover do the translation

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.080 
let the LTE takeover do the translation
reconnect<00:03:02.349> to<00:03:02.379> the<00:03:02.500> Wi-Fi<00:03:02.859> it<00:03:03.370> was<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.730> bit<00:03:03.939> of<00:03:04.030> a

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
reconnect to the Wi-Fi it was a bit of a

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.849 
reconnect to the Wi-Fi it was a bit of a
process<00:03:04.510> but<00:03:04.540> I<00:03:04.750> did<00:03:04.959> get<00:03:05.109> it<00:03:05.230> done<00:03:05.409> at<00:03:05.680> this

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.119 
Chinese it didn't translate for whatever
reason<00:03:10.930> but<00:03:11.170> it's<00:03:11.319> updating<00:03:11.680> itself<00:03:11.859> to<00:03:12.040> the

latest<00:03:12.370> version<00:03:12.670> of<00:03:12.730> software<00:03:12.939> so<00:03:13.389> moving

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
latest version of software so moving

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.030 
latest version of software so moving
forward<00:03:13.989> with<00:03:14.079> that<00:03:14.170> I'm<00:03:14.290> not<00:03:14.319> sure<00:03:14.769> exactly

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
forward with that I'm not sure exactly

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.349 
forward with that I'm not sure exactly
how<00:03:15.310> this<00:03:15.459> is<00:03:15.519> going<00:03:15.700> to<00:03:15.760> work<00:03:15.819> with<00:03:16.090> my<00:03:16.209> home

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
how this is going to work with my home

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:17.970 
how this is going to work with my home
network<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:17.019> would<00:03:17.169> definitely<00:03:17.319> be<00:03:17.620> very<00:03:17.650> nice

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
network it would definitely be very nice

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.610 
network it would definitely be very nice
to<00:03:18.010> have<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.340> dedicated<00:03:18.730> 802<00:03:19.359> 11<00:03:19.480> AC<00:03:20.019> network<00:03:20.470> to

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
to have a dedicated 802 11 AC network to

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.020 
to have a dedicated 802 11 AC network to
be<00:03:20.709> able<00:03:20.769> to<00:03:20.859> transfer<00:03:21.340> files<00:03:21.549> back<00:03:21.819> and<00:03:21.849> forth

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
be able to transfer files back and forth

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.360 
be able to transfer files back and forth
at<00:03:22.359> a<00:03:22.389> ridiculously<00:03:23.049> fast<00:03:23.349> rate<00:03:23.680> but<00:03:24.099> given

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
at a ridiculously fast rate but given

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.470 
at a ridiculously fast rate but given
that<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:24.579> has<00:03:24.609> a<00:03:24.730> hundred<00:03:25.090> megabits<00:03:25.359> per

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
that it has a hundred megabits per

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.720 
that it has a hundred megabits per
second<00:03:25.840> connection<00:03:26.079> to<00:03:26.440> everything<00:03:26.919> else<00:03:27.099> it

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
second connection to everything else it

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.640 
second connection to everything else it
immediately<00:03:28.120> becomes<00:03:28.449> not<00:03:28.750> so<00:03:28.780> useful<00:03:29.230> I've

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
immediately becomes not so useful I've

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.080 
immediately becomes not so useful I've
currently<00:03:29.919> got<00:03:30.099> it<00:03:30.280> set<00:03:30.430> up<00:03:30.549> in<00:03:30.639> the<00:03:30.699> bridging

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
currently got it set up in the bridging

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.430 
currently got it set up in the bridging
mode<00:03:31.269> so<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:31.690> it<00:03:31.780> takes<00:03:31.930> one<00:03:32.199> wireless

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
mode so that it takes one wireless

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.960 
mode so that it takes one wireless
network<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.129> connects<00:03:33.489> it<00:03:33.549> to<00:03:33.609> the<00:03:33.730> other<00:03:33.940> one

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
network and connects it to the other one

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.399 
network and connects it to the other one
so<00:03:34.090> I<00:03:34.239> figure<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:34.569> might<00:03:34.659> stick<00:03:35.109> it<00:03:35.230> in<00:03:35.319> an

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409 
so I figure I might stick it in an

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.349 
so I figure I might stick it in an
upstairs<00:03:35.739> room<00:03:35.919> and<00:03:36.340> use<00:03:36.489> it<00:03:36.669> to<00:03:36.940> just<00:03:37.150> sort<00:03:37.269> of

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
upstairs room and use it to just sort of

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:38.550 
upstairs room and use it to just sort of
extend<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.810> range<00:03:37.930> of<00:03:38.079> my<00:03:38.199> wireless<00:03:38.379> network

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
extend the range of my wireless network

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.869 
extend the range of my wireless network
of<00:03:38.980> course<00:03:39.159> at<00:03:39.250> that<00:03:39.280> point<00:03:39.400> you're<00:03:39.669> not<00:03:39.730> going

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
of course at that point you're not going

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.000 
of course at that point you're not going
to<00:03:39.940> be<00:03:40.000> getting<00:03:40.329> those<00:03:40.480> 802<00:03:40.900> 11<00:03:41.019> AC<00:03:41.470> speeds

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
to be getting those 802 11 AC speeds

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.469 
to be getting those 802 11 AC speeds
you're<00:03:42.190> not<00:03:42.280> gonna<00:03:42.370> be<00:03:42.519> seeing<00:03:42.760> anything<00:03:43.060> near

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:43.479 
you're not gonna be seeing anything near

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:45.420 
you're not gonna be seeing anything near
a<00:03:43.510> gigabit<00:03:44.139> per<00:03:44.319> second<00:03:44.739> so<00:03:44.889> I'm<00:03:44.949> kind<00:03:45.220> of<00:03:45.310> up

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
a gigabit per second so I'm kind of up

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.770 
a gigabit per second so I'm kind of up
in<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.549> air<00:03:45.639> about<00:03:45.940> it<00:03:46.000> so<00:03:46.299> as<00:03:46.419> far<00:03:46.569> as<00:03:46.629> my

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
in the air about it so as far as my

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.149 
in the air about it so as far as my
first<00:03:46.989> impressions<00:03:47.440> of<00:03:47.560> it<00:03:47.680> because<00:03:47.829> I<00:03:47.919> really

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 
first impressions of it because I really

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.259 
first impressions of it because I really
don't<00:03:48.370> want<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:48.549> call<00:03:48.699> this<00:03:48.790> a<00:03:48.940> review<00:03:49.209> or

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
don't want to call this a review or

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:50.939 
don't want to call this a review or
anything<00:03:49.629> the<00:03:50.079> setup<00:03:50.349> process<00:03:50.530> was<00:03:50.799> really

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:50.949 
anything the setup process was really

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.860 
anything the setup process was really
not<00:03:51.250> all<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.519> bad<00:03:51.699> the<00:03:51.940> UI<00:03:52.090> itself<00:03:52.359> looks

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
not all that bad the UI itself looks

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.569 
not all that bad the UI itself looks
very<00:03:53.139> nice<00:03:53.379> if<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:53.680> speak<00:03:53.919> Chinese<00:03:54.370> of<00:03:54.549> course

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
very nice if you speak Chinese of course

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:55.860 
very nice if you speak Chinese of course
it's<00:03:54.849> gonna<00:03:54.970> be<00:03:55.120> great<00:03:55.359> for<00:03:55.569> you

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
it's gonna be great for you

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.330 
it's gonna be great for you
I<00:03:55.900> did<00:03:56.199> read<00:03:56.409> somewhere<00:03:56.709> that<00:03:56.919> it<00:03:57.010> might<00:03:57.220> be

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
I did read somewhere that it might be

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.550 
I did read somewhere that it might be
possible<00:03:57.579> to<00:03:57.819> flash<00:03:58.060> dd-wrt<00:03:58.629> to<00:03:59.199> it<00:03:59.319> so<00:03:59.470> that's

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
possible to flash dd-wrt to it so that's

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.349 
possible to flash dd-wrt to it so that's
another<00:03:59.889> good<00:04:00.099> option<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.760> in<00:04:00.970> terms<00:04:01.150> of<00:04:01.299> the

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
another good option and in terms of the

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:02.759 
another good option and in terms of the
base<00:04:01.540> software<00:04:01.959> that<00:04:02.049> comes<00:04:02.169> on<00:04:02.379> it<00:04:02.470> it<00:04:02.620> does

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
base software that comes on it it does

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:03.960 
base software that comes on it it does
have<00:04:02.799> a<00:04:03.040> decent<00:04:03.220> amount<00:04:03.430> of<00:04:03.579> options

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
have a decent amount of options

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.129 
have a decent amount of options
available<00:04:04.090> you<00:04:04.419> can<00:04:04.659> use<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:04.930> in<00:04:05.049> the

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
available you can use it in the

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:06.689 
available you can use it in the
traditional<00:04:05.260> routing<00:04:05.919> mode<00:04:06.099> you<00:04:06.280> can<00:04:06.430> use<00:04:06.459> it

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:06.699 
traditional routing mode you can use it

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:08.699 
traditional routing mode you can use it
in<00:04:06.790> a<00:04:06.879> wireless<00:04:07.329> relay<00:04:07.479> mode<00:04:07.810> or<00:04:08.109> in<00:04:08.290> a<00:04:08.379> wired

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
in a wireless relay mode or in a wired

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.559 
in a wireless relay mode or in a wired
bridge<00:04:09.370> mode<00:04:09.639> so<00:04:09.909> that<00:04:10.090> you<00:04:10.180> could<00:04:10.359> for

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
bridge mode so that you could for

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.089 
bridge mode so that you could for
example<00:04:10.599> have<00:04:10.959> your<00:04:11.290> wireless<00:04:11.500> network<00:04:11.949> on

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
example have your wireless network on

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.830 
example have your wireless network on
one<00:04:12.310> end<00:04:12.459> with<00:04:12.639> your<00:04:12.790> wired<00:04:13.030> connections<00:04:13.659> to

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
one end with your wired connections to

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.879 
one end with your wired connections to
it<00:04:13.959> and<00:04:14.109> then<00:04:14.229> your<00:04:14.379> wireless<00:04:14.829> network

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
it and then your wireless network

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.310 
it and then your wireless network
bridged<00:04:15.729> over<00:04:15.909> to<00:04:16.209> another<00:04:16.720> section<00:04:17.109> with

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
bridged over to another section with

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.990 
bridged over to another section with
more<00:04:17.500> wired<00:04:17.799> connections<00:04:18.400> so<00:04:18.699> to<00:04:18.760> wrap<00:04:18.940> things

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
more wired connections so to wrap things

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.509 
more wired connections so to wrap things
up<00:04:19.329> so<00:04:19.539> far<00:04:19.780> I'm<00:04:20.019> pleased<00:04:20.799> with<00:04:21.039> it<00:04:21.219> to<00:04:21.340> some

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
up so far I'm pleased with it to some

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.640 
up so far I'm pleased with it to some
extent<00:04:21.940> I<00:04:22.120> just

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
extent I just

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.110 
extent I just
to<00:04:22.770> those<00:04:22.919> hundred<00:04:23.250> megabit<00:04:23.580> ports<00:04:23.910> were

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
to those hundred megabit ports were

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.760 
to those hundred megabit ports were
gigabit<00:04:24.690> ports<00:04:25.050> that<00:04:25.350> way<00:04:25.530> it<00:04:25.650> would

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
gigabit ports that way it would

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.110 
gigabit ports that way it would
integrate<00:04:25.949> really<00:04:26.400> well<00:04:26.550> with<00:04:26.759> the<00:04:26.850> rest<00:04:27.000> of

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
integrate really well with the rest of

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.400 
integrate really well with the rest of
my<00:04:27.180> network<00:04:27.419> because<00:04:27.660> everything<00:04:28.110> else<00:04:28.229> at

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
my network because everything else at

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.930 
my network because everything else at
this<00:04:28.500> point<00:04:28.740> is<00:04:28.889> gigabit<00:04:29.340> but<00:04:29.699> that<00:04:29.820> will

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
this point is gigabit but that will

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.310 
this point is gigabit but that will
probably<00:04:30.240> be<00:04:30.330> about<00:04:30.509> all<00:04:30.660> for<00:04:30.840> me<00:04:30.930> for<00:04:31.110> today

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
probably be about all for me for today
