hey<00:00:14.099> guys<00:00:14.340> we<00:00:14.490> got<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.670> kind<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:14.969> unique<00:00:15.269> theory

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
hey guys we got a kind of unique theory

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.170 
hey guys we got a kind of unique theory
from<00:00:15.900> Adrienne<00:00:16.260> February<00:00:16.619> or<00:00:17.430> disprove<00:00:17.850> today

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
from Adrienne February or disprove today

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.500 
from Adrienne February or disprove today
using<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:19.109> this<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.560> an<00:00:19.680> Avis<00:00:20.039> model<00:00:20.460> 24<00:00:21.029> RK

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
using this this is an Avis model 24 RK

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.720 
using this this is an Avis model 24 RK
which<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.869> reachable<00:00:22.289> 70<00:00:23.189> millimeters<00:00:23.640> across

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
which is reachable 70 millimeters across

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.560 
which is reachable 70 millimeters across
all<00:00:24.300> solid<00:00:24.869> steel<00:00:25.109> pretty<00:00:25.859> nice<00:00:26.039> lock<00:00:26.570> and

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
all solid steel pretty nice lock and

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.910 
all solid steel pretty nice lock and
they're<00:00:27.840> not<00:00:27.960> really<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.289> difficult<00:00:28.560> to

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
they're not really that difficult to

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.650 
they're not really that difficult to
pick<00:00:29.130> here's<00:00:29.429> what<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.760> fitting<00:00:30.269> looks<00:00:30.480> like

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
pick here's what the fitting looks like

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.359 
pick here's what the fitting looks like
on<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:30.990> one<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:31.920> got<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> pretty

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
on this one so you got a pretty

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.950 
on this one so you got a pretty
challenging<00:00:32.610> bidding<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:33.329> even<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.719> it's

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
challenging bidding but even so it's

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.209 
challenging bidding but even so it's
only<00:00:34.079> 5<00:00:34.380> pins<00:00:34.760> it<00:00:35.760> contains<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.950> believe<00:00:37.950> it's

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
only 5 pins it contains I believe it's

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.240 
only 5 pins it contains I believe it's
probably<00:00:38.610> one<00:00:39.239> standard<00:00:39.840> pin<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.440> then<00:00:42.590> 5<00:00:43.590> or

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
probably one standard pin and then 5 or

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.330 
probably one standard pin and then 5 or
sorry<00:00:44.610> 4<00:00:44.820> spools<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.480> total<00:00:45.750> 5<00:00:45.930> pins<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:47.070> this

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
sorry 4 spools for total 5 pins so this

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.720 
sorry 4 spools for total 5 pins so this
has<00:00:47.460> not<00:00:47.610> not<00:00:47.850> too<00:00:48.149> difficult<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.809> pick<00:00:49.730> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
has not not too difficult to pick and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.340 
has not not too difficult to pick and
just<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.090> prove<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.660> let's<00:00:51.809> see<00:00:51.960> if<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.140> can't

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
just to prove it let's see if we can't

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.920 
just to prove it let's see if we can't
get<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.710> cooperate<00:00:53.309> here<00:00:53.690> can<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.750> get<00:00:54.870> a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
get it to cooperate here can we get a

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.810 
get it to cooperate here can we get a
false<00:00:55.140> set

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.530 

feedback<00:01:03.879> and<00:01:04.879> get<00:01:05.059> on<00:01:05.210> them

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
feedback and get on them

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.970 
feedback and get on them
hardest<00:01:06.020> part<00:01:06.200> of<00:01:06.290> this<00:01:06.380> little<00:01:06.620> bitty<00:01:06.740> key

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
hardest part of this little bitty key

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:18.820 
hardest part of this little bitty key
way<00:01:07.510> they<00:01:08.510> got<00:01:08.690> a<00:01:08.720> good<00:01:08.900> fault<00:01:09.170> set<00:01:09.470> gone<00:01:17.830> deep

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
way they got a good fault set gone deep

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.219 
way they got a good fault set gone deep
vault<00:01:19.190> settling<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:20.540> feedback<00:01:20.960> on<00:01:20.990> that

first<00:01:21.590> pin<00:01:21.979> there<00:01:22.280> if<00:01:22.430> I<00:01:22.490> can<00:01:22.610> just<00:01:22.700> get<00:01:22.880> on<00:01:23.030> it

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
first pin there if I can just get on it

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.190 
first pin there if I can just get on it
I<00:01:23.270> think<00:01:23.510> we<00:01:23.600> can<00:01:23.720> get<00:01:23.810> this<00:01:23.930> thing<00:01:23.990> done

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
I think we can get this thing done

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.590 
I think we can get this thing done
anyway<00:01:24.770> not<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:25.490> hard<00:01:25.729> to<00:01:25.790> pick<00:01:26.060> as<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:26.390> see

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
anyway not that hard to pick as you see

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.750 
anyway not that hard to pick as you see
well<00:01:27.410> what<00:01:27.560> that's<00:01:27.890> not<00:01:28.130> what<00:01:28.340> Adrienne's

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
well what that's not what Adrienne's

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.310 
well what that's not what Adrienne's
theory<00:01:29.030> is<00:01:29.150> all<00:01:29.240> about<00:01:29.510> he<00:01:29.750> wants<00:01:29.990> to<00:01:30.080> defeat

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
theory is all about he wants to defeat

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.490 
theory is all about he wants to defeat
this<00:01:30.530> lock<00:01:30.770> in<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:31.010> different<00:01:31.340> way<00:01:32.110> these<00:01:33.110> locks

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
this lock in a different way these locks

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.499 
this lock in a different way these locks
are<00:01:34.190> repeatable<00:01:34.640> which<00:01:35.090> means<00:01:35.300> you<00:01:35.390> can

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
are repeatable which means you can

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.600 
are repeatable which means you can
replace<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:36.020> cylinder<00:01:36.500> and<00:01:36.650> the<00:01:37.220> way<00:01:37.340> you<00:01:37.400> do

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
replace the cylinder and the way you do

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.249 
replace the cylinder and the way you do
that<00:01:37.790> you<00:01:38.000> just<00:01:38.150> take<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:38.330> feeler<00:01:38.660> gauge<00:01:38.900> and

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
that you just take a feeler gauge and

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:40.900 
that you just take a feeler gauge and
Adrian<00:01:39.710> did<00:01:39.860> a<00:01:39.890> video<00:01:40.070> on<00:01:40.250> this<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:40.729> if<00:01:40.820> you

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
Adrian did a video on this so if you

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:41.980 
Adrian did a video on this so if you
don't<00:01:41.090> get<00:01:41.210> it<00:01:41.330> here<00:01:41.479> you<00:01:41.540> can<00:01:41.630> go<00:01:41.690> watch<00:01:41.810> his

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
don't get it here you can go watch his

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.200 
don't get it here you can go watch his
video<00:01:42.290> jam<00:01:43.130> it<00:01:43.280> down<00:01:43.310> in<00:01:43.640> there<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.000> there's

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
video jam it down in there and there's

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.820 
video jam it down in there and there's
that<00:01:44.330> point<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:44.810> jiggle<00:01:45.110> a<00:01:45.170> little<00:01:45.410> bit<00:01:45.590> and

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
that point you jiggle a little bit and

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.530 
that point you jiggle a little bit and
the<00:01:46.580> core<00:01:46.820> pops<00:01:47.240> out<00:01:47.479> like<00:01:47.720> that<00:01:48.790> if<00:01:49.790> we<00:01:50.360> could

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
the core pops out like that if we could

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.889 
the core pops out like that if we could
remove<00:01:50.750> this<00:01:50.990> core<00:01:51.490> somehow<00:01:52.570> then<00:01:53.570> we<00:01:53.750> could

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
remove this core somehow then we could

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.630 
remove this core somehow then we could
take<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.080> large<00:01:54.350> screwdriver<00:01:54.619> if<00:01:55.160> this<00:01:55.460> thing

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
take a large screwdriver if this thing

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.240 
take a large screwdriver if this thing
was<00:01:55.790> locked<00:01:56.030> up<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.590> then<00:01:57.590> we<00:01:57.800> could<00:01:57.950> stick<00:01:58.130> it

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
was locked up and then we could stick it

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.620 
was locked up and then we could stick it
in<00:01:58.369> there<00:01:58.550> and<00:01:58.580> we<00:01:58.729> could<00:01:58.880> just<00:01:59.090> turn<00:01:59.300> it<00:01:59.479> and

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
in there and we could just turn it and

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.340 
in there and we could just turn it and
open<00:01:59.930> it<00:02:00.050> so<00:02:00.590> as<00:02:00.680> you<00:02:00.770> see<00:02:00.979> opens<00:02:01.460> right<00:02:01.610> up<00:02:02.350> but

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
open it so as you see opens right up but

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.930 
open it so as you see opens right up but
the<00:02:03.500> trick<00:02:03.800> is<00:02:04.009> going<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.220> be<00:02:04.369> getting<00:02:04.640> past

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
the trick is going to be getting past

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.760 
the trick is going to be getting past
this<00:02:05.149> core<00:02:05.509> because<00:02:05.810> it's<00:02:05.960> got<00:02:06.080> a<00:02:06.110> really<00:02:06.470> good

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
this core because it's got a really good

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.620 
this core because it's got a really good
locking<00:02:07.190> mechanism<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:07.819> it<00:02:07.880> fits<00:02:08.149> into<00:02:08.509> the

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
locking mechanism and it fits into the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.280 
locking mechanism and it fits into the
side<00:02:08.899> of<00:02:09.259> this<00:02:10.360> let<00:02:11.360> me<00:02:11.420> take<00:02:11.630> this<00:02:11.750> lock<00:02:12.050> out

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
side of this let me take this lock out

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.920 
side of this let me take this lock out
this<00:02:13.190> little<00:02:13.460> groove<00:02:13.790> in<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.360> side<00:02:14.569> of<00:02:14.600> this

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
in fact adrian tells me this is made out

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.110 
in fact adrian tells me this is made out
of<00:02:20.660> cast<00:02:20.900> zinc<00:02:21.080> now<00:02:21.800> zinc<00:02:22.190> for<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:22.730> guys<00:02:22.880> that

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
of cast zinc now zinc for you guys that

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.360 
of cast zinc now zinc for you guys that
haven't<00:02:24.110> had<00:02:24.230> science<00:02:24.950> in<00:02:25.069> quite<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.280> while

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
haven't had science in quite a while

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.760 
haven't had science in quite a while
like<00:02:25.730> me<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.180> had<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.870> look<00:02:27.020> it<00:02:27.170> up<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.470> tells<00:02:27.650> me

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
like me I had to look it up and tells me

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.770 
like me I had to look it up and tells me
the<00:02:27.890> ink<00:02:28.069> has<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.400> melting<00:02:28.760> temperature<00:02:29.180> of<00:02:29.209> 400

degrees centigrade or at 783 787 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:02:34.160> so<00:02:34.970> theoretically<00:02:35.569> while<00:02:35.990> this

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
Fahrenheit so theoretically while this

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.699 
Fahrenheit so theoretically while this
is<00:02:36.410> in<00:02:36.590> place<00:02:36.830> if<00:02:37.160> we<00:02:37.790> can<00:02:38.000> melt<00:02:38.420> this<00:02:39.050> housing

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
is in place if we can melt this housing

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.440 
is in place if we can melt this housing

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
with a torch which we're going to try to

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.050 
with a torch which we're going to try to
do<00:02:41.690> take<00:02:42.350> a<00:02:42.380> pair<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.680> pliers<00:02:42.770> remove<00:02:43.610> the

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
do take a pair of pliers remove the

brass which has a higher melting

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.540 
brass which has a higher melting
temperature<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.040> get<00:02:46.099> it<00:02:46.220> out<00:02:46.310> of<00:02:46.400> our<00:02:46.459> way

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
temperature and get it out of our way

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.330
