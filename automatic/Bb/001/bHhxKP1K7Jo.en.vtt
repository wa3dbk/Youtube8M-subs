00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.480
 All right, Gabriel, I'm fine. 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.480
 I'll teach you to play online and 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.940
 victory was going to the 3 a game 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.080
 well cool then hospital are more 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.940
 fast as possible 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.230
 first we will need two 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.820
 links that is the male and the download and I 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.830
 I'll leave everything in the description 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.670
 Calm down, I'll download it. 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.230
 by the bassaki orra male because he has 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.710
 a direct download option I think 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.920
 easier than entering the site and 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.320
 demand 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.110
 click below it's free it does not have 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.260
 no problem and click on download without 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.350
 installer because if you stay here and I saw 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.390
 a good installer of bassaki 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.550
 unpleasant coming various advertisements 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.610
 and it's boring 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.399
 there were those who thought installer and leave the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.980
 steps or slopes and fossils 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.440
 Portuguese, then I will not even download 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.370
 here because you can see that 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.629
 There's already a streak right here. 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:09.420
 I want to show something to you. 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:13.260
 you later and finally it will automatically 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.280
 to do nothing else here is behind it goes and goes 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.409
 stay here at this link is the name of the corner 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.020

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.830
 I also already have the green installed 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.880
 by the world I have a little is this 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.710
 here if it's going to run he'll meet 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.720
 some options that I teach have already 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.060
 first you have to get into a 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.240
 Romario Network 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.090
 you can create your network here know that the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.799
 abv will give you the password for the network all 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.680
 You want without any problem, okay? 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.009

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.930
 It 's really great, it's really cool that 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.140
 here I will also leave in the inscription 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.610

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.310

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.600
 At last the ball was going into some 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.300
 Your friend's network has to create from the south 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:18.110
 comes in two steps, but one of them is 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:21.320
 For that the original and one is for breathing 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.900

 in saving co 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.310
 now is a very crucial part is a 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.000

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.639
