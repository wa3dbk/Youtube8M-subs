00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.539 
top what I'm gonna have to do is take
the<00:00:12.480> mainboard<00:00:13.110> out<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.740> see<00:00:14.040> if<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.219> could<00:00:14.280> see

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
the mainboard out to see if I could see

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.910 
the mainboard out to see if I could see
anything<00:00:15.049> sort<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.109> untoward<00:00:16.410> with<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
anything sort of untoward with the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.010 
anything sort of untoward with the
switch<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.460> then<00:00:17.730> move<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.270> lot<00:00:18.510> further<00:00:18.750> on

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
switch and then move a lot further on

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.080 
switch and then move a lot further on
we've<00:00:19.740> got<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> main<00:00:20.220> by<00:00:20.430> now<00:00:20.490> as<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.789> can<00:00:20.880> see

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
we've got the main by now as you can see

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.660 
we've got the main by now as you can see
in<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.300> screws<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.720> hold<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.109> down<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:23.189> area

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
in the screws that hold it down the area

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.060 
in the screws that hold it down the area
that<00:00:23.820> will<00:00:23.910> look<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.119> know<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.890> it's<00:00:25.890> here

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
sort of physical issue with it from what

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.910 
sort of physical issue with it from what
I<00:00:38.790> can<00:00:38.969> say<00:00:39.210> what's<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.110> say<00:00:40.530> I'm

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
going to be taking this off so there's

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.279 
going to be taking this off so there's
two<00:00:43.559> screws<00:00:44.030> that<00:00:45.030> hold<00:00:45.329> d<00:00:45.570> sort<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.930> bracket

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
two screws that hold d sort of bracket

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.130 
two screws that hold d sort of bracket
down<00:00:46.820> that<00:00:47.820> screw<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.840> screws

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
down that screw that and that screws

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.889 
down that screw that and that screws
that<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.649> will<00:00:50.550> take<00:00:50.760> those<00:00:50.940> out<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.539> got

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
that I will take those out so I just got

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.119 
that I will take those out so I just got
the<00:00:51.960> switch<00:00:52.170> out<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.739> look<00:00:52.829> at<00:00:52.980> that

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
the switch out to have a look at that

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.010 
the switch out to have a look at that
and<00:00:53.399> then<00:00:53.520> we'll<00:00:53.640> move<00:00:53.760> okay<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.180> here<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:54.989> are

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
and then we'll move okay so here we are

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.540 
and then we'll move okay so here we are
with<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.379> switch<00:00:55.649> now<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.250> found<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
with the switch now just found the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.209 
with the switch now just found the
problem<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.260> can<00:00:58.260> hopefully<00:00:58.620> look<00:00:58.949> through

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
problem I can hopefully look through

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.639 
problem I can hopefully look through
this<00:00:59.840> okay<00:01:00.840> know<00:01:00.899> about<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.140> center<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
this okay know about the center of the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.770 
this okay know about the center of the
circle<00:01:01.980> central<00:01:02.730> magnifying<00:01:03.210> glass<00:01:03.449> there's

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
circle central magnifying glass there's

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.679 
circle central magnifying glass there's
the<00:01:04.080> cable<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.650> sort<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.010> flat<00:01:05.280> cable<00:01:05.689> if

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
the cable that sort of the flat cable if

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.770 
the cable that sort of the flat cable if
you<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.930> make<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.170> out<00:01:07.350> that's<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.740> break<00:01:08.070> in

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
you can make this out that's a break in

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.710 
you can make this out that's a break in
the<00:01:09.780> ribbon<00:01:10.350> cable<00:01:10.740> itself<00:01:11.210> so<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.510> switch

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the ribbon cable itself so the switch

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.240 
the ribbon cable itself so the switch
isn't<00:01:12.900> making<00:01:13.320> contact<00:01:13.799> with<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.920> rest<00:01:14.130> of

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
isn't making contact with the rest of

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.249 
isn't making contact with the rest of
the<00:01:14.340> circuit<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.150> means<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.720> iPhone

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the circuit that means the iPhone

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.370 
the circuit that means the iPhone
doesn't<00:01:17.009> know<00:01:17.250> when<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.119> cable<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.110> being

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
doesn't know when the cable is being

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.840 
doesn't know when the cable is being
pressed<00:01:19.680> sorry<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.369> switch<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.700> being

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
pressed sorry the switch is being

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.840 
pressed sorry the switch is being
pressed<00:01:21.259> there<00:01:22.259> far<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.799> doesn't<00:01:23.280> switch<00:01:23.610> on

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
pressed there far it doesn't switch on

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.929 
pressed there far it doesn't switch on
one<00:01:24.180> switch<00:01:24.360> off<00:01:24.780> one<00:01:25.560> put<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.799> screen<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.070> or

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
one switch off one put the screen on or

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.359 
one switch off one put the screen on or
off<00:01:27.180> anything<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.799> what<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.189> fix

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369
