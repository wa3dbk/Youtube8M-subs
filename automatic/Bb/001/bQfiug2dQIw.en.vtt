the things I like to do with my maps is

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.149 
the things I like to do with my maps is
not<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:36.840> much<00:01:36.960> right<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> notes<00:01:37.860> on

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
not so much right on on the notes on

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.710 
not so much right on on the notes on
them<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:38.400> when<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.579> catch<00:01:38.880> fish<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.509> in

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
them but when I catch fish and in

them but when I catch fish and in
certain<00:01:39.930> areas<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.590> certain<00:01:40.860> pieces<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.280> want

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
certain areas in certain pieces I want

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.219 
certain areas in certain pieces I want
to<00:01:41.549> go<00:01:41.640> look<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.509> I'll<00:01:42.659> use<00:01:42.899> certain

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
to go look for and I'll use certain

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.749 
to go look for and I'll use certain
colors<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.710> know<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:43.979> pink<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.490> something

I'm catching fish on or a yellow to like

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.560 
I'm catching fish on or a yellow to like
go<00:01:48.750> investigate<00:01:49.470> or<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.680> blue<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.490> maybe<00:01:50.850> like

go investigate or a blue is a maybe like

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.510 
go investigate or a blue is a maybe like
for<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:51.930> map<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.439> went<00:01:52.740> out<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:53.280> found

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
for this map I went out and we found

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.230 
for this map I went out and we found
some<00:01:53.759> islands<00:01:54.180> we<00:01:54.270> got<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:55.399> mile<00:01:56.399> more<00:01:56.729> channel

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
some islands we got a mile more channel

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.700 
some islands we got a mile more channel
marker<00:01:57.540> right<00:01:57.750> here<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:58.140> here<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.530> had<00:01:58.680> a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
marker right here on here and it had a

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.980 
marker right here on here and it had a
very<00:01:59.009> shallow<00:01:59.340> hump<00:01:59.729> on<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.090> current<00:02:00.750> flowing

very shallow hump on it current flowing
around<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.469> we<00:02:01.560> was<00:02:01.680> able<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.920> catch<00:02:02.130> some<00:02:02.310> fish

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
around it we was able to catch some fish

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.490 
around it we was able to catch some fish
off<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.759> downside<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.840> right<00:02:04.259> here

off the downside on that right here

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.230 
off the downside on that right here
we've<00:02:04.649> got<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.829> corner<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> point<00:02:05.820> we<00:02:06.090> got

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
we've got a corner on a point we got

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.029 
we've got a corner on a point we got
current<00:02:06.689> coming<00:02:06.930> across<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.530> big<00:02:07.740> flat

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
current coming across that big flat

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.550 
current coming across that big flat
we've<00:02:08.849> got<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.119> really<00:02:09.599> deep<00:02:09.780> ledge<00:02:10.050> coming<00:02:10.440> off

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
we've got a really deep ledge coming off

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.380 
we've got a really deep ledge coming off
of<00:02:10.739> this<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.310> corner<00:02:11.760> on<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.910> upstream

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
of this and a corner on the upstream

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.820 
of this and a corner on the upstream
side<00:02:12.450> fish<00:02:13.110> we're<00:02:13.319> kind<00:02:13.530> of

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
side fish we're kind of

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.090 
side fish we're kind of
on<00:02:14.070> this<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.520> pretty<00:02:15.120> good<00:02:15.470> steep<00:02:16.470> walls<00:02:16.830> all

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
on this and pretty good steep walls all

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.410 
on this and pretty good steep walls all
the<00:02:17.130> way<00:02:17.310> around<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.760> then<00:02:17.850> we<00:02:17.940> had<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.090> flat

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
the way around it then we had a flat

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.930 
the way around it then we had a flat
spot<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.830> sole<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.220> fish<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.700> there<00:02:20.820> was

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
spot on the sole of fish and there was

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.780 
spot on the sole of fish and there was
grass<00:02:21.210> going<00:02:21.480> on<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.900> sold<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.350> fish<00:02:22.590> work<00:02:22.800> up<00:02:23.370> on

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
grass going on it sold a fish work up on

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.480 
grass going on it sold a fish work up on
those<00:02:24.000> kind<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.420> areas<00:02:24.780> um<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.830> just<00:02:26.070> need<00:02:26.400> to

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
those kind of areas um you just need to

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.000 
those kind of areas um you just need to
really<00:02:26.640> look<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.210> contours<00:02:27.990> look<00:02:28.110> for<00:02:28.440> islands

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
really look a contours look for islands

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.820 
really look a contours look for islands
look<00:02:29.370> for<00:02:29.610> markers<00:02:30.360> power<00:02:31.020> lines<00:02:31.440> coming

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
look for markers power lines coming

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.300 
look for markers power lines coming
across<00:02:32.570> bridges<00:02:33.570> we<00:02:34.410> got<00:02:34.560> some<00:02:34.710> bridges<00:02:35.130> right

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
across bridges we got some bridges right

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.130 
across bridges we got some bridges right
here<00:02:35.520> we<00:02:35.640> got<00:02:35.790> power<00:02:36.090> lines<00:02:36.210> coming<00:02:36.780> across

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
here we got power lines coming across

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.260 
here we got power lines coming across
and<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:38.160> then<00:02:38.310> when<00:02:38.490> you're<00:02:38.610> doing<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:39.090> then

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
and and then when you're doing that then

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.090 
and and then when you're doing that then
you<00:02:39.360> can<00:02:39.510> go<00:02:39.660> look<00:02:39.870> for<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.500> know<00:02:40.560> man-made

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
you can go look for you know man-made

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.520 
you can go look for you know man-made
structure<00:02:41.730> like<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.210> said<00:02:42.960> earlier<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.440> know

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
structure like I said earlier you know

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.200 
structure like I said earlier you know
maybe<00:02:43.710> some<00:02:43.980> towns<00:02:44.250> when<00:02:44.610> they<00:02:44.730> flooded<00:02:45.060> the

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
maybe some towns when they flooded the

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.660 
maybe some towns when they flooded the
place<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.660> it's<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.840> reservoir<00:02:46.400> if<00:02:47.400> it's<00:02:47.550> a

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
place of it's a reservoir if it's a

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.480 
place of it's a reservoir if it's a
natural<00:02:48.060> lake<00:02:48.210> you<00:02:48.420> can<00:02:48.570> maybe<00:02:48.720> go<00:02:48.960> look<00:02:49.170> for

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
natural lake you can maybe go look for

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.850 
natural lake you can maybe go look for
deep<00:02:50.490> ledges<00:02:51.090> or<00:02:51.270> grassy<00:02:51.840> stuff<00:02:52.110> when<00:02:52.709> you're

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
deep ledges or grassy stuff when you're

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.520 
deep ledges or grassy stuff when you're
using<00:02:53.160> your<00:02:53.310> your<00:02:53.700> paper<00:02:53.970> maps<00:02:54.300> get<00:02:55.140> the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
using your your paper maps get the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.530 
using your your paper maps get the
digital<00:02:56.310> maps<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:56.760> go<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.000> your<00:02:57.030> lawrence

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
digital maps that go in your lawrence

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.230 
digital maps that go in your lawrence
electronics<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:59.430> put<00:02:59.670> those<00:02:59.820> in<00:03:00.060> there

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
electronics and and put those in there

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.540 
electronics and and put those in there
so<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.570> can<00:03:00.780> coordinate<00:03:01.590> your<00:03:01.980> paper<00:03:02.190> map

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
so you can coordinate your paper map

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.760 
so you can coordinate your paper map
with<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.150> digital<00:03:03.720> map<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.200> they<00:03:04.380> don't<00:03:04.590> always

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
with a digital map and they don't always

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.680 
with a digital map and they don't always
all<00:03:05.070> line<00:03:05.490> up<00:03:05.520> all<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:05.910> same<00:03:06.209> or<00:03:06.390> have<00:03:06.420> the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
all line up all the same or have the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.540
