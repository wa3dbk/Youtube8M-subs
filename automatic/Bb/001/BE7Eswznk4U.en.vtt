00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:04.819
 Sunday is another day of direct confrontation in the 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:06.300
 Brazilian 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.920
 everything more than the second placed front in the table all in the fluminense 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.100
 knows the importance of the match but experienced muricy streak he discards the 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.230
 early decision label we were taken by surprise with what happened and 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.499
 also that it is a difficult game against the corinthians 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:24.099
 and it was nothing 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.929
 still ten games is missing is not a decisive game is an important game more 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.009
 He is an opponent. 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.009
 today is not playing the best football 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.970
 but the title matches 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.120
 so in fms go prepared for it 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.120
 This party was not so good in the orange trees. 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.350
 but still tend to lack of physical conditioning are outside the 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.080
 lateral-right marquinhos that debuted last Wednesday contrasting them 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.630
 suffered a stretch in the posterior muscle of the right thigh and is one more 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.280
 but the tricolor crowd can calm down 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.490
 also has this chat on the morning of this Tuesday was around 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.509
 recognition goes to the game the reporter goes to the missing milk 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:12.470
 preparation 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.409
 had not trained with a standing ball 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:15.510
 until yesterday 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.520
 leo jaime 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.900
 I felt better almost without pain 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.360
 It's still another two days a game. 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.580
 worlds ahead begins with the one I wanted to play which I do not want to play in a 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.490
 stretch 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.770
 in the last game and unfortunately no they did not let play the last game 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.330
 but this vision 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.840
 animated sets 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.840
 at the time of the coach of the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.350
 of the medical team knows the best 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.460
 but I'm going to the game and we'll see if the decision and grow as Fellini has more 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.520
 two days in each test read improvement 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.320
 it happens that the dÃ©cor of the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.620
 his pass is important for the team to lose a little more 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.319
 Why do we get a little ball? 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.680
 and so we do a lot of direct connection 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.680
 so there is not a guy who thinks a little about the game with the 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.110
 so it's very important because if you come back it will help us a lot
