you know if it's a little bit more
expensive<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.220> say<00:01:47.399> go<00:01:47.549> with<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.939> if<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.689> a

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
expensive I say go with that if it's a

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.899 
expensive I say go with that if it's a
lot<00:01:49.200> more<00:01:49.439> expensive<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.220> instance<00:01:50.340> you

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
lot more expensive like for instance you

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.760 
lot more expensive like for instance you
know<00:01:51.030> something<00:01:51.750> else<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.020> you'd<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:52.500> better

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
know something else you you'd be better

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.539 
know something else you you'd be better
off<00:01:53.899> you<00:01:54.899> know<00:01:54.930> buying<00:01:55.259> elsewhere<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:56.310> you

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
the Blackmagic camera I have also what's

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.699 
the Blackmagic camera I have also what's
called<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.340> battery<00:03:11.569> charger<00:03:12.569> yeah<00:03:13.349> I<00:03:13.379> mean

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
called a battery charger yeah I mean

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.619 
called a battery charger yeah I mean
generator<00:03:14.370> an<00:03:14.549> electronic<00:03:15.030> generator<00:03:15.420> that

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
generator an electronic generator that

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.960 
generator an electronic generator that
you<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:16.170> uses<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.099> Sun<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.489> solar<00:03:17.639> power

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
you that uses the Sun the solar power

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.270 
you that uses the Sun the solar power
but<00:03:18.269> also<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.930> can<00:03:19.260> be<00:03:19.380> charged<00:03:19.739> over<00:03:20.010> here<00:03:20.190> in

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
but also it can be charged over here in

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.559 
but also it can be charged over here in
your<00:03:20.400> home<00:03:20.519> which<00:03:20.670> I'll<00:03:20.790> be<00:03:20.910> reviewing<00:03:21.209> later

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569

have another five hours here and if you
have<00:03:24.900> like<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.049> 15<00:03:25.440> hour<00:03:25.620> shoot<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.549> could

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
have like a 15 hour shoot you could

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.860 
have like a 15 hour shoot you could
charge<00:03:26.970> this<00:03:27.180> in<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.389> meantime

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
charge this in the meantime

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.440 
charge this in the meantime
while<00:03:28.440> this<00:03:28.680> one<00:03:28.829> is<00:03:28.859> still<00:03:29.130> active<00:03:29.579> so<00:03:29.730> ok<00:03:30.420> and

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
while this one is still active so ok and

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.020 
while this one is still active so ok and
it<00:03:30.630> comes<00:03:30.810> with<00:03:30.930> this<00:03:31.230> right<00:03:31.560> here<00:03:31.880> which<00:03:32.880> is

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
it comes with this right here which is

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.490 
it comes with this right here which is
obviously<00:03:33.420> probably<00:03:33.810> I'm<00:03:34.079> guessing<00:03:34.230> the

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
obviously probably I'm guessing the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.190 
obviously probably I'm guessing the
adapter<00:03:35.010> okay<00:03:35.970> so<00:03:36.030> we're<00:03:36.420> gonna<00:03:36.510> check<00:03:36.989> this

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
adapter okay so we're gonna check this

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.849 
adapter okay so we're gonna check this
out<00:03:37.410> right<00:03:37.590> here<00:03:39.049> to<00:03:40.049> do<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.200> lot<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.530> things

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
out right here to do a lot of things

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.550 
out right here to do a lot of things
with<00:03:41.040> one<00:03:41.190> hand<00:03:41.430> here<00:03:41.700> okay<00:03:42.329> so<00:03:43.139> you<00:03:43.200> see<00:03:43.530> a

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
with one hand here okay so you see a

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.860 
with one hand here okay so you see a
regular<00:03:44.010> just<00:03:44.579> the<00:03:44.700> regular<00:03:44.849> cord<00:03:45.359> which

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
regular just the regular cord which

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.930 
regular just the regular cord which
attaches<00:03:46.230> right<00:03:46.440> into<00:03:46.859> there<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:47.280> I'll<00:03:47.790> be

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
attaches right into there and I'll be

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.159 
attaches right into there and I'll be
back<00:03:48.120> in<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.359> second<00:03:48.690> I'll<00:03:48.750> show<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:48.989> guys<00:03:49.109> how

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
back in a second I'll show you guys how

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:50.420 
back in a second I'll show you guys how
it<00:03:49.410> looks<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:49.829> have<00:03:49.919> a<00:03:50.010> good<00:03:50.130> one

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
it looks and have a good one

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.550 
it looks and have a good one
we<00:03:50.790> go<00:03:50.910> guys<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.180> put<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.599> light<00:03:51.930> on<00:03:52.109> right<00:03:52.139> here

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
we go guys I put the light on right here

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.080 
we go guys I put the light on right here
so<00:03:52.919> now<00:03:53.040> I'm<00:03:53.130> gonna<00:03:53.280> turn<00:03:53.489> it<00:03:53.669> on<00:03:53.790> in<00:03:54.060> the

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
so now I'm gonna turn it on in the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.589 
so now I'm gonna turn it on in the
switch<00:03:55.040> see<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.250> that's<00:03:57.150> gonna<00:03:57.389> do<00:03:57.569> the

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
switch see that that's gonna do the

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.360 
switch see that that's gonna do the
charge<00:03:57.959> but<00:03:58.200> what<00:03:58.319> I<00:03:58.349> like<00:03:58.590> about<00:03:58.769> it<00:03:59.040> is<00:03:59.190> it

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
charge but what I like about it is it

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.479 
charge but what I like about it is it
reads<00:04:00.560> you're<00:04:01.560> gonna<00:04:01.680> see<00:04:01.889> that<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.160> reaches

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
reads you're gonna see that it reaches

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.460 
reads you're gonna see that it reaches
see<00:04:02.609> it<00:04:02.700> reads<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.120> voltage<00:04:03.569> it<00:04:04.019> tells<00:04:04.319> you

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
see it reads the voltage it tells you

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.809 
see it reads the voltage it tells you
exactly<00:04:04.739> you<00:04:04.950> know<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.190> voltage<00:04:05.310> right<00:04:05.669> here

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
exactly you know the voltage right here

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.520 
exactly you know the voltage right here
it<00:04:05.910> tells<00:04:05.940> you<00:04:06.209> you<00:04:07.049> know<00:04:07.169> what's<00:04:07.410> the

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
it tells you you know what's the

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.589 
it tells you you know what's the
percentage<00:04:08.010> of<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.310> charge<00:04:08.609> it's<00:04:09.269> telling

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
percentage of the charge it's telling

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.089 
percentage of the charge it's telling
you<00:04:09.690> pretty<00:04:09.900> much<00:04:10.079> everything<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:10.620> need<00:04:10.769> to

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
you pretty much everything you need to

you pretty much everything you need to
know<00:04:11.250> which<00:04:11.489> I<00:04:11.639> really<00:04:12.090> really<00:04:12.359> do<00:04:12.510> like<00:04:12.690> now

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
know which I really really do like now

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.539 
know which I really really do like now
the<00:04:13.290> other<00:04:13.530> model<00:04:13.919> that<00:04:14.069> I<00:04:14.099> was<00:04:14.250> telling<00:04:14.489> you

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
the other model that I was telling you

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.060 
the other model that I was telling you
about<00:04:14.609> has<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:14.970> XLR<00:04:15.840> port<00:04:16.109> which<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:16.889> pretty

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
about has a XLR port which is pretty

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.440 
about has a XLR port which is pretty
darn<00:04:17.310> cool<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.609> I've<00:04:17.669> seen<00:04:17.849> this<00:04:17.970> this<00:04:18.180> is<00:04:18.299> the

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
darn cool and I've seen this this is the

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.629 
darn cool and I've seen this this is the
release<00:04:19.169> spot<00:04:19.470> in<00:04:19.590> here<00:04:19.859> you<00:04:20.340> know<00:04:20.430> so<00:04:20.549> you

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
release spot in here you know so you

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.339 
release spot in here you know so you
gotta<00:04:20.789> press<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.150> down<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.450> remove<00:04:21.750> it<00:04:21.900> so<00:04:22.289> it

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
gotta press it down to remove it so it

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.020 
gotta press it down to remove it so it
has<00:04:22.469> a<00:04:22.500> pretty<00:04:22.770> good<00:04:22.979> lock<00:04:23.219> mechanism<00:04:23.880> on<00:04:24.000> it

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
has a pretty good lock mechanism on it

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.760 
has a pretty good lock mechanism on it
and<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.690> see<00:04:24.719> it<00:04:24.930> tells<00:04:25.169> you<00:04:25.320> like<00:04:25.500> it

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
and you see it tells you like it

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.260 
and you see it tells you like it
actually<00:04:25.950> changes<00:04:26.729> you're<00:04:26.880> gonna<00:04:26.969> see

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
actually changes you're gonna see

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.499 
actually changes you're gonna see
so<00:04:27.930> it<00:04:28.050> tells<00:04:28.199> you<00:04:28.289> this<00:04:28.440> is<00:04:28.500> 13.9%

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509 
so it tells you this is 13.9%

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.020 
so it tells you this is 13.9%
oops<00:04:30.750> fourteen<00:04:31.410> point<00:04:32.190> sixty<00:04:32.580> two<00:04:32.729> volt

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
oops fourteen point sixty two volt

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.029 
oops fourteen point sixty two volt
voltage<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:34.110> it<00:04:34.169> was<00:04:34.259> just<00:04:34.500> changing<00:04:34.889> right

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
voltage and it was just changing right

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.469 
voltage and it was just changing right
now<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:35.370> it<00:04:35.460> changes<00:04:35.759> I<00:04:35.819> guess<00:04:36.000> eat<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:36.360> now

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
now so it changes I guess eat and now

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.260 
now so it changes I guess eat and now
again<00:04:36.630> says<00:04:37.500> charge<00:04:37.830> fourteen<00:04:38.729> point<00:04:38.940> sixty

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
again says charge fourteen point sixty

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.390 
again says charge fourteen point sixty
two<00:04:39.389> volt<00:04:39.630> voltage<00:04:39.930> sixteen<00:04:40.650> point<00:04:40.889> I<00:04:41.099> make

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
two volt voltage sixteen point I make

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.860 
two volt voltage sixteen point I make
fourteen<00:04:41.759> point<00:04:41.940> sixty<00:04:42.210> two<00:04:42.330> volt<00:04:42.539> that<00:04:42.810> means

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
fourteen point sixty two volt that means

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.589 
fourteen point sixty two volt that means
these<00:04:43.139> batteries<00:04:43.560> are<00:04:43.590> pretty<00:04:44.280> much<00:04:44.599> perfect

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
these batteries are pretty much perfect

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:47.150 
these batteries are pretty much perfect
perfect<00:04:46.229> right<00:04:46.380> now<00:04:46.410> because<00:04:46.889> they're<00:04:47.039> about

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
perfect right now because they're about

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.529 
perfect right now because they're about
the<00:04:47.430> same<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:47.729> they're<00:04:47.849> charging<00:04:48.030> right<00:04:48.389> now

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
the same and they're charging right now

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.270 
the same and they're charging right now
so<00:04:48.720> I'm<00:04:48.780> gonna<00:04:48.900> let<00:04:49.080> it<00:04:49.139> charge<00:04:49.470> but<00:04:50.009> as<00:04:50.160> you

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
so I'm gonna let it charge but as you

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.920 
so I'm gonna let it charge but as you
guys<00:04:50.460> could<00:04:50.669> see<00:04:50.729> it<00:04:51.000> reads<00:04:51.240> out<00:04:51.419> like<00:04:51.690> bad

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
guys could see it reads out like bad

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.020 
guys could see it reads out like bad
batteries<00:04:52.470> good<00:04:52.740> batteries<00:04:53.280> and<00:04:53.490> you<00:04:53.849> know<00:04:53.940> if

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
batteries good batteries and you know if

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.279 
batteries good batteries and you know if
you're<00:04:54.180> getting<00:04:54.300> ripped<00:04:54.599> off<00:04:54.810> or<00:04:55.020> not<00:04:55.169> when

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
you're getting ripped off or not when

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:56.960 
you're getting ripped off or not when
you<00:04:55.380> first<00:04:55.590> receive<00:04:55.770> batteries<00:04:56.490> and<00:04:56.699> all<00:04:56.789> that

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
you first receive batteries and all that

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.309 
you first receive batteries and all that
good<00:04:57.150> stuff<00:04:57.210> and<00:04:57.509> you<00:04:57.840> also<00:04:57.960> know<00:04:58.169> when

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:58.319 
good stuff and you also know when

00:04:58.319 --> 00:04:59.719 
good stuff and you also know when
they're<00:04:58.470> gonna<00:04:58.530> go<00:04:58.770> bad<00:04:58.979> which<00:04:59.220> obviously

this is a great great battery charger it
kinda<00:05:52.590> it's<00:05:52.740> all<00:05:52.919> metal<00:05:53.190> construction<00:05:53.780> I

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
kinda it's all metal construction I

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.089 
kinda it's all metal construction I
think<00:05:55.020> it's<00:05:55.139> probably<00:05:55.500> you<00:05:55.800> know<00:05:55.860> I<00:05:55.919> thought

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
think it's probably you know I thought

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:58.459 
think it's probably you know I thought
it<00:05:56.159> was<00:05:56.250> aluminum<00:05:56.639> but<00:05:56.789> it's<00:05:56.909> metal<00:05:57.240> and<00:05:57.990> it<00:05:58.319> is

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469 
it was aluminum but it's metal and it is

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:00.170 
it was aluminum but it's metal and it is
heavy<00:05:58.740> it<00:05:58.949> has<00:05:59.009> some<00:05:59.310> girth<00:05:59.490> on<00:05:59.699> and<00:05:59.880> yeah<00:06:00.030> it's

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
heavy it has some girth on and yeah it's

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.939 
heavy it has some girth on and yeah it's
definitely<00:06:00.300> heavy<00:06:00.750> feels<00:06:01.289> like<00:06:01.500> one<00:06:01.770> of<00:06:01.860> those

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
definitely heavy feels like one of those

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.719 
definitely heavy feels like one of those
old-fashioned<00:06:02.639> scales<00:06:03.000> or<00:06:03.409> VCR<00:06:04.409> but<00:06:04.650> it's<00:06:05.580> not

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
old-fashioned scales or VCR but it's not

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:07.100 
old-fashioned scales or VCR but it's not
that<00:06:05.940> that<00:06:05.969> heavy<00:06:06.389> you<00:06:06.509> could<00:06:06.659> still<00:06:06.870> fit<00:06:06.990> it

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
that that heavy you could still fit it

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.540 
that that heavy you could still fit it
