00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:04.950
 there are friends today we are 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.839
 found on face book cooking for a 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.910
 ultra fast recipe but that is 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.040
 delicious and that will pass perfectly 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.099
 with all your barbecues for this summer 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.190
 I named the recipe tabouleh 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.109
 Lebanese you will need a half boot 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.779
 coriander finely cut well 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.470
 half a bunch of flat parsley salt 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:29.699
 pepper 1 2 million finely cut a 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.430
 little couscous couscous 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.860
 water of olive oil 1 lemon and 2 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.600
 cut tomatoes is therefore the first 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.340
 step friends is to cook the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.230
 semolina that you are going to take the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.629
 semolina and you will add water 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.250
 bah just covered it wants 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.190
 to say that in fact an ol is not going 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.129
 overtaking the semolina and not smoking 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.600
 add a little bit of olive oil 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.940
 and this preparation that you go the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.309
 put in the micron for three minutes 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.059
 meanwhile the preparation and 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:04.710
 in the microwave you go that's fine 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:11.939
 less true add the juice of a half 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:13.770
 lemon tomatoes and onion we see 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.920
 mix well and there friends I can 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.619
 to tell you that it already feels beautiful and 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.220
 then friends we just add the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.049
 semolina 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.200
 once it has cooled slightly 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.430
 the bnl still a little hot on 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.009

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.079
 preparation here are friends it's over 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.329

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.710
 to serve that in plates in 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.840
 little bowls and there I thought 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.180
 directly to the tasting so 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.229
 look we really had a taboulÃ© 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.840
 with a beautiful color 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.490
 we called semolina leaves 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.979
 tomatoes it is well colored it smells great 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.560

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.770
 really advise what to do this 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.590
 recipe because for me it's a 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.630
 big killing then friends at the level of 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.130
 taste it's really delicious me it's 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.869
 a recipe that I love then for all 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.099
 the people who will say that it is not 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.489
 a recipe that's way too much 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.500
 short 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.500
 well I tell you friends that you 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.180
 mislead because this recipe is delicious 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.330
 even if she is very simple she 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.520
 will really go well with balibar bugs 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.319
 or in accompaniment for two for in 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.000
 the appetizers it's really a recipe 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.620
 which I particularly like 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.720
 and it's kind of tabu ley that's 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.180
 very different from the classic taboule and 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.640
