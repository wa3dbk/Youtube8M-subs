Viacom<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.579> again<00:01:56.909> he's<00:01:57.090> got<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.420> gun<00:01:57.630> he<00:01:58.259> can

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
Viacom and again he's got the gun he can

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
hold it like a sword I don't know why

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.990 
hold it like a sword I don't know why
you<00:02:03.810> want<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.049> hold<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.259> from<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.469> end<00:02:04.530> but

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
you want to hold it from that end but

Cliffjumper<00:02:12.189> has<00:02:12.870> his<00:02:13.870> robot<00:02:14.230> mode<00:02:14.260> is

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
Cliffjumper has his robot mode is

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.349 
Cliffjumper has his robot mode is
lacking<00:02:15.400> his<00:02:15.489> vehicle<00:02:15.849> mode<00:02:15.879> looks<00:02:16.120> kind<00:02:16.329> of

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:16.359 
lacking his vehicle mode looks kind of

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:17.970 
lacking his vehicle mode looks kind of
nice<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.719> looks<00:02:17.200> like<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.319> little<00:02:17.469> muscle<00:02:17.829> car

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
nice it looks like a little muscle car

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.580 
nice it looks like a little muscle car
that<00:02:18.010> he<00:02:18.219> is<00:02:18.370> his<00:02:19.150> vehicle<00:02:19.299> modes<00:02:19.689> a<00:02:20.019> little

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
that he is his vehicle modes a little

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.929 
that he is his vehicle modes a little
over<00:02:21.069> his<00:02:21.189> robot<00:02:21.459> modes<00:02:21.639> a<00:02:21.670> little<00:02:21.849> bit

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
over his robot modes a little bit

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.119 
over his robot modes a little bit
lacking<00:02:22.469> compared<00:02:23.469> especially<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.010> know

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
lacking compared especially you know

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.390 
lacking compared especially you know
even<00:02:24.760> for<00:02:24.969> a<00:02:25.319> he's<00:02:26.319> just<00:02:26.499> square<00:02:26.920> she's<00:02:27.219> real

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
even for a he's just square she's real

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.580 
even for a he's just square she's real
chunky<00:02:27.639> and<00:02:27.969> I<00:02:28.719> guess<00:02:28.870> that's<00:02:29.079> kind<00:02:29.349> of<00:02:29.409> to<00:02:29.500> be

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
chunky and I guess that's kind of to be

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.309 
chunky and I guess that's kind of to be
expected<00:02:29.620> with<00:02:30.219> a<00:02:30.609> cyberverse<00:02:31.299> figure<00:02:31.719> but

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
expected with a cyberverse figure but

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.530 
expected with a cyberverse figure but
his<00:02:32.829> transformation<00:02:33.310> is<00:02:33.730> very<00:02:34.209> very

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
his transformation is very very

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.349 
his transformation is very very
interesting<00:02:35.879> and<00:02:36.879> we'll<00:02:37.000> show<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.180> off

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
interesting and we'll show that off

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.599 
interesting and we'll show that off
right<00:02:37.480> now<00:02:37.599> because<00:02:37.959> these<00:02:38.230> feet<00:02:38.560> these<00:02:39.340> doors

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
right now because these feet these doors

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.580 
right now because these feet these doors
are<00:02:39.760> his<00:02:39.939> feet<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.419> you<00:02:41.079> want<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.319> start<00:02:41.499> off

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
are his feet and you want to start off

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.770 
are his feet and you want to start off
he<00:02:41.680> split<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.010> like<00:02:42.159> this<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:43.329> he<00:02:43.450> flipped<00:02:43.689> his

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
he split it like this and he flipped his

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.580 
he split it like this and he flipped his
legs<00:02:43.989> up<00:02:44.950> above<00:02:45.400> his<00:02:45.609> head<00:02:45.790> like<00:02:46.389> this<00:02:46.629> and<00:02:46.870> the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
legs up above his head like this and the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.679 
legs up above his head like this and the
doors<00:02:47.799> twist<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.730> form<00:02:48.969> the<00:02:49.060> feet<00:02:49.269> like<00:02:49.480> that

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
doors twist to form the feet like that

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.429 
doors twist to form the feet like that
and<00:02:50.790> then<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:51.879> bring<00:02:52.060> this<00:02:52.209> whole<00:02:52.480> waste

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
and then you bring this whole waste

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.189 
and then you bring this whole waste
assembly<00:02:53.919> down<00:02:54.099> and<00:02:54.340> out<00:02:54.400> like<00:02:54.579> that<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.209> then

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:56.199 
assembly down and out like that and then

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:59.849 
assembly down and out like that and then
you<00:02:56.319> split<00:02:57.389> the<00:02:58.389> front<00:02:58.659> of<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.810> car<00:02:59.019> flip<00:02:59.739> it

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
you split the front of the car flip it

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.490 
you split the front of the car flip it
up<00:02:59.949> like<00:03:00.099> this<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.699> then<00:03:01.329> even<00:03:01.719> then<00:03:01.989> the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
up like this and then even then the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.659 
up like this and then even then the
fists<00:03:02.829> and<00:03:03.639> the<00:03:03.699> forearm<00:03:04.209> flips<00:03:04.870> out<00:03:05.049> and<00:03:05.669> then

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:06.669 
fists and the forearm flips out and then

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.500 
fists and the forearm flips out and then
down<00:03:07.299> and<00:03:07.659> around<00:03:08.319> like<00:03:08.620> this<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.150> it

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
down and around like this so that it

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.020 
down and around like this so that it
doesn't<00:03:10.780> just<00:03:11.049> flip<00:03:11.680> out<00:03:11.829> and<00:03:12.159> fold<00:03:12.609> down<00:03:12.699> it

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
doesn't just flip out and fold down it

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.149 
doesn't just flip out and fold down it
actually<00:03:13.359> twists<00:03:13.900> around<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:16.030> give<00:03:16.239> you<00:03:16.359> the

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
actually twists around to give you the

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.520 
actually twists around to give you the
proper<00:03:18.159> elbow<00:03:18.430> movement<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.959> that<00:03:20.109> there<00:03:20.319> as

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
proper elbow movement and that there as

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.879 
proper elbow movement and that there as
of<00:03:20.680> right<00:03:20.799> now<00:03:21.009> the<00:03:21.759> only<00:03:22.709> cyberverse<00:03:23.709> I've
