00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
we're gonna take a look at it now I know

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.040 
we're gonna take a look at it now I know
it<00:00:08.639> doesn't<00:00:08.670> spin<00:00:09.210> I've<00:00:09.480> already<00:00:09.870> just

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
it doesn't spin I've already just

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.160 
it doesn't spin I've already just
plugged<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:10.530> in<00:00:10.759> put<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:11.849> on<00:00:11.940> spin<00:00:12.240> it's<00:00:12.900> making

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
plugged it in put it on spin it's making

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.209 
plugged it in put it on spin it's making
a<00:00:13.230> noise<00:00:13.320> but<00:00:13.530> it's<00:00:13.679> not<00:00:13.799> spinning

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
a noise but it's not spinning

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.599 
a noise but it's not spinning
so<00:00:14.639> let's<00:00:14.820> troubleshoot<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:16.279> all<00:00:17.279> right<00:00:17.460> so

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
so let's troubleshoot it all right so

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.160 
so let's troubleshoot it all right so
here's<00:00:17.760> our<00:00:17.880> Kenmore<00:00:18.090> washer<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.779> went<00:00:19.109> ahead

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
here's our Kenmore washer I went ahead

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.000 
here's our Kenmore washer I went ahead
and<00:00:19.410> put<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:20.420> fast<00:00:21.420> agitate<00:00:22.140> fast<00:00:22.529> spin

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
and put it on fast agitate fast spin

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.460 
and put it on fast agitate fast spin
Vance<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.180> timer<00:00:24.420> around<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.900> spin<00:00:25.170> cycle

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
Vance the timer around the spin cycle

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.859 
Vance the timer around the spin cycle
and<00:00:25.740> I'm<00:00:25.800> gonna<00:00:25.920> pull<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.189> knob<00:00:26.750> and<00:00:27.750> I'm

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
and I'm gonna pull the knob and I'm

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.940 
and I'm gonna pull the knob and I'm
gonna<00:00:28.019> go<00:00:28.109> ahead<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.289> press<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.859> lid<00:00:29.039> switch

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.560 

we<00:00:34.950> got<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.100> noise<00:00:35.250> but<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:35.610> not<00:00:35.730> spinning<00:00:36.059> now

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
we got a noise but it's not spinning now

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.639 
we got a noise but it's not spinning now
let<00:00:36.719> me<00:00:36.780> show<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:36.989> something<00:00:37.320> here<00:00:37.469> real

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
let me show you something here real

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.479 
let me show you something here real
quick<00:00:37.940> if<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.000> have<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> washer<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:40.489> doesn't

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
quick if you have a washer that doesn't

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.030 
quick if you have a washer that doesn't
spin<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:43.050> think<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.559> know<00:00:43.649> maybe<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
spin and you think you know maybe the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.450 
spin and you think you know maybe the
lid<00:00:44.219> switch<00:00:44.460> or<00:00:44.579> something<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:44.940> that's<00:00:45.149> bad

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.229 

[Music]

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
[Music]

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.580 
[Music]
there's<00:00:52.600> two<00:00:52.750> different<00:00:52.870> speeds<00:00:53.320> to<00:00:53.500> the

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
there's two different speeds to the

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.740 
there's two different speeds to the
motor

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
motor

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.560 
motor
and<00:00:56.050> fast<00:00:56.320> and<00:00:56.650> now<00:00:56.710> it's<00:00:56.860> possible<00:00:57.570> it's

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
and fast and now it's possible it's

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.800 
and fast and now it's possible it's
possible<00:00:59.050> to<00:00:59.110> one<00:00:59.260> of<00:00:59.350> those<00:00:59.440> speeds<00:00:59.860> are<00:01:00.190> out

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
possible to one of those speeds are out

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.680 
possible to one of those speeds are out
so<00:01:01.810> if<00:01:02.110> you<00:01:02.740> hear<00:01:02.890> a<00:01:02.950> noise<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:03.520> fast<00:01:04.120> we<00:01:04.449> flip

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
so if you hear a noise and fast we flip

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.730 
so if you hear a noise and fast we flip
it<00:01:04.750> over<00:01:04.870> and<00:01:05.020> hear<00:01:05.140> nothing<00:01:05.320> and<00:01:05.710> slow<00:01:06.120> then

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
it over and hear nothing and slow then

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.470 
it over and hear nothing and slow then
basically<00:01:08.740> you<00:01:08.920> don't<00:01:09.100> have<00:01:09.250> a<00:01:09.280> slow<00:01:09.940> speed<00:01:10.270> on

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
basically you don't have a slow speed on

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.350 
basically you don't have a slow speed on
your<00:01:10.590> or<00:01:11.590> your<00:01:11.710> motor<00:01:11.920> and<00:01:12.280> that<00:01:12.970> can<00:01:13.180> be<00:01:13.330> a

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
your or your motor and that can be a

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.660 
your or your motor and that can be a
problem<00:01:13.600> one<00:01:14.020> of<00:01:14.050> the<00:01:14.200> speeds<00:01:14.470> can<00:01:14.710> go<00:01:14.860> out<00:01:15.040> but

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
problem one of the speeds can go out but

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.650 
problem one of the speeds can go out but
that's<00:01:15.880> not<00:01:16.030> what<00:01:16.180> we're<00:01:16.300> looking<00:01:16.510> at<00:01:16.600> today

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
that's not what we're looking at today

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.940 
that's not what we're looking at today
today<00:01:17.080> we're<00:01:17.230> looking<00:01:17.440> at<00:01:17.530> a<00:01:17.560> machine<00:01:17.830> that

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
today we're looking at a machine that

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.730 
today we're looking at a machine that
makes<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.280> noise<00:01:18.370> like<00:01:18.640> it's<00:01:18.790> trying<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.120> spin

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
makes the noise like it's trying to spin

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.050 
makes the noise like it's trying to spin
but<00:01:20.740> it's<00:01:20.860> not<00:01:20.980> actually<00:01:21.280> spinning<00:01:21.550> so<00:01:21.910> what

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
but it's not actually spinning so what

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.850 
but it's not actually spinning so what
we're<00:01:22.180> going<00:01:22.270> to<00:01:22.330> do<00:01:22.420> now<00:01:22.600> is<00:01:22.870> flip<00:01:23.680> the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
we're going to do now is flip the

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.990 
we're going to do now is flip the
machine<00:01:24.100> over<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:24.460> look<00:01:24.550> underneath<00:01:26.940> okay<00:01:27.940> so

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
machine over and look underneath okay so

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.150 
machine over and look underneath okay so
we<00:01:28.180> got<00:01:28.330> our<00:01:28.360> machine<00:01:28.600> tilted<00:01:29.260> back<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:30.010> now

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
we got our machine tilted back and now

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.609 
we got our machine tilted back and now
what<00:01:30.310> we're<00:01:30.460> gonna<00:01:30.580> do<00:01:30.820> is<00:01:30.970> look<00:01:31.119> for<00:01:31.619> right

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
what we're gonna do is look for right

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.230 
what we're gonna do is look for right
behind<00:01:32.860> them<00:01:33.100> easy<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.820> pump<00:01:34.140> see<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.229> motor

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
behind them easy to pump see the motor

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.390 
behind them easy to pump see the motor
behind<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.360> motor<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.619> between<00:01:39.160> the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
behind the motor and between the

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.330 
behind the motor and between the
transmission<00:01:40.270> here<00:01:40.630> is<00:01:41.530> this<00:01:41.740> little<00:01:41.920> coupler

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
transmission here is this little coupler

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.820 
transmission here is this little coupler
and<00:01:42.550> that's<00:01:42.759> what<00:01:42.880> we're<00:01:43.000> gonna<00:01:43.090> look<00:01:43.650> now<00:01:44.650> if

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
and that's what we're gonna look now if

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.950 
and that's what we're gonna look now if
you<00:01:44.979> take<00:01:45.160> a<00:01:45.190> real<00:01:45.430> close<00:01:45.759> look<00:01:45.850> at<00:01:46.060> this<00:01:46.180> know

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
you take a real close look at this know

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.510 
you take a real close look at this know
that<00:01:47.110> before<00:01:47.920> you<00:01:47.979> stick<00:01:48.160> your<00:01:48.220> fingers<00:01:48.490> in

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
that before you stick your fingers in

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.010 
that before you stick your fingers in
there<00:01:48.700> make<00:01:48.850> sure<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.090> machine<00:01:49.390> is<00:01:49.420> unplugged

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
there make sure the machine is unplugged

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.900 
there make sure the machine is unplugged
so<00:01:50.890> there's<00:01:51.040> no<00:01:51.190> chance<00:01:51.400> that's<00:01:51.550> gonna<00:01:51.759> come

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
so there's no chance that's gonna come

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.969 
so there's no chance that's gonna come
on<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:52.180> tear<00:01:52.360> your<00:01:52.479> finger<00:01:52.720> off<00:01:52.860> but<00:01:53.860> we'll

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
on and tear your finger off but we'll

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.260 
on and tear your finger off but we'll
get<00:01:54.100> up<00:01:54.190> underneath<00:01:54.430> now<00:01:54.729> this<00:01:54.940> is<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.119> motor

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
get up underneath now this is the motor

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.590 
get up underneath now this is the motor
coupler<00:01:56.520> now<00:01:57.520> just<00:01:57.790> looking<00:01:58.030> at<00:01:58.150> it<00:01:58.270> it

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
coupler now just looking at it it

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.120 
coupler now just looking at it it
doesn't<00:01:58.780> appear<00:01:59.110> to<00:01:59.140> be<00:01:59.290> broken<00:01:59.530> now<00:01:59.980> there's

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
doesn't appear to be broken now there's

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.820 
doesn't appear to be broken now there's
a<00:02:00.190> crack<00:02:00.430> and<00:02:00.640> a<00:02:00.670> rubber<00:02:00.850> right<00:02:01.090> here<00:02:01.830> that's

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
a crack and a rubber right here that's

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.960 
a crack and a rubber right here that's
not<00:02:03.070> what<00:02:03.580> our<00:02:03.610> issue<00:02:03.880> is<00:02:05.190> and<00:02:06.190> I'm<00:02:06.520> not<00:02:06.820> gonna

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
not what our issue is and I'm not gonna

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.340 
not what our issue is and I'm not gonna
be<00:02:07.150> able<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.330> show<00:02:07.540> you<00:02:07.600> on<00:02:07.810> camera<00:02:07.840> because

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
be able to show you on camera because

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.110 
be able to show you on camera because
you<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:10.030> park<00:02:10.239> but<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:12.070> coupler<00:02:12.489> doesn't<00:02:12.970> look

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
you to park but the coupler doesn't look

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.550 
you to park but the coupler doesn't look
broken<00:02:14.459> both<00:02:15.459> pieces<00:02:15.790> are<00:02:16.030> together<00:02:16.560> connect

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
broken both pieces are together connect

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
broken both pieces are together connect
up<00:02:17.650> with<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.830> rubber<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.280> they're<00:02:18.370> spinning

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
up with a rubber and they're spinning

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.190 
up with a rubber and they're spinning
now<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.300> motor<00:02:19.570> should<00:02:19.780> be<00:02:19.870> spending<00:02:20.140> the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
now the motor should be spending the

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.280 
now the motor should be spending the
transmission<00:02:20.769> at<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:20.980> point<00:02:21.250> but<00:02:21.660> in<00:02:22.660> the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
transmission at this point but in the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.690 
transmission at this point but in the
center<00:02:23.530> here<00:02:23.739> where<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.130> shaft<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.670> the

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
center here where the shaft of the

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.880 
center here where the shaft of the
transmission<00:02:24.959> goes<00:02:25.959> through<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.290> coupler<00:02:26.650> is

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
transmission goes through the coupler is

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.070 
transmission goes through the coupler is
rounded<00:02:27.310> out<00:02:27.430> so<00:02:28.360> it<00:02:28.480> looks<00:02:28.630> like<00:02:28.690> it's<00:02:28.900> good

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
rounded out so it looks like it's good

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.860 
rounded out so it looks like it's good
but<00:02:29.620> it's<00:02:29.769> not<00:02:29.950> so<00:02:30.220> I'm<00:02:30.250> gonna<00:02:30.430> go<00:02:30.549> ahead<00:02:30.610> and

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
but it's not so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.890 
but it's not so I'm gonna go ahead and
take<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.989> cabinet<00:02:32.380> apart<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:33.750> pull<00:02:34.750> this

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
take the cabinet apart and pull this

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.990 
take the cabinet apart and pull this
motor<00:02:35.230> off<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.830> then<00:02:36.070> show<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.370> exactly<00:02:36.640> what

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
motor off and then show you exactly what

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.580 
motor off and then show you exactly what
it<00:02:37.390> looks<00:02:37.600> like<00:02:37.750> without<00:02:37.900> this<00:02:38.200> stuff<00:02:38.410> in<00:02:38.530> the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
it looks like without this stuff in the

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.680 
it looks like without this stuff in the
way<00:02:38.709> now<00:02:38.860> I<00:02:38.890> do<00:02:39.010> have<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.280> video<00:02:39.610> showing<00:02:39.940> you

and<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.700> motor<00:02:54.880> off<00:02:55.090> so<00:02:55.299> we<00:02:55.390> can<00:02:55.510> see<00:02:55.720> the

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
and the motor off so we can see the

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.270 
and the motor off so we can see the
coupler

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.490 

the<00:03:02.280> first<00:03:02.490> thing<00:03:02.610> we're<00:03:02.700> gonna<00:03:02.820> do<00:03:03.110> is<00:03:04.110> pop

the first thing we're gonna do is pop

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:12.650 
the first thing we're gonna do is pop
these<00:03:04.650> clips<00:03:04.920> off<00:03:09.350> he's<00:03:10.350> kind<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.590> turtle<00:03:11.660> pull

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
these clips off he's kind of turtle pull

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:37.580 
these clips off he's kind of turtle pull
them<00:03:12.780> out<00:03:36.020> you<00:03:37.020> always<00:03:37.230> want<00:03:37.380> to<00:03:37.410> do<00:03:37.500> the

them out you always want to do the
bottom<00:03:37.740> one<00:03:37.980> first<00:03:38.190> did<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.090> take<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.450> top

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
bottom one first did you take the top

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.940 
bottom one first did you take the top
one<00:03:39.840> off<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.080> motors<00:03:40.320> gonna<00:03:40.440> try<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.710> fall

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
one off the motors gonna try to fall

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.850 
one off the motors gonna try to fall
with<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:41.970> bottom<00:03:42.270> clip<00:03:42.450> still<00:03:42.720> on<00:03:42.870> so<00:03:43.740> go

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
with the bottom clip still on so go

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.230 
with the bottom clip still on so go
ahead<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.040> take<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.310> bottom<00:03:44.460> clip<00:03:44.790> off<00:03:44.940> first

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
ahead and take the bottom clip off first

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:52.430 
ahead and take the bottom clip off first
and<00:03:48.950> basically<00:03:49.950> just<00:03:50.160> turn<00:03:50.340> them<00:03:51.290> make<00:03:52.290> them

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
and basically just turn them make them

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.230 
and basically just turn them make them
out<00:03:52.560> of<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.740> slot<00:03:52.980> you'll<00:03:53.640> figure<00:03:53.850> that<00:03:53.940> out

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
out of the slot you'll figure that out

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.050 
out of the slot you'll figure that out
whenever<00:03:54.660> you<00:03:54.930> take<00:03:55.050> it<00:03:55.200> on<00:03:55.260> my<00:03:55.320> part<00:03:55.790> now<00:03:56.790> hold

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
whenever you take it on my part now hold

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:08.530 
whenever you take it on my part now hold
the<00:03:57.210> motor<00:03:57.390> when<00:03:57.900> you<00:03:57.960> take<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.260> top<00:03:58.440> clip<00:03:58.680> off

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.420 
loose and see how the shaft this
transmission<00:04:31.440> shaft<00:04:31.710> right<00:04:32.009> here<00:04:32.039> does<00:04:32.400> not

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
transmission shaft right here does not

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.100 
transmission shaft right here does not
spin<00:04:32.960> when<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.080> coupler<00:04:34.440> spinning<00:04:36.110> and

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
spin when the coupler spinning and

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.450 
spin when the coupler spinning and
that's<00:04:37.770> just<00:04:38.009> completely<00:04:38.509> wore<00:04:39.509> out

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
that's just completely wore out

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.800 
that's just completely wore out
hang<00:04:41.460> on<00:04:41.639> one<00:04:41.819> second<00:04:42.180> I'm<00:04:42.240> gonna<00:04:42.389> grab<00:04:42.539> a<00:04:42.569> good

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
hang on one second I'm gonna grab a good

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:52.040 
hang on one second I'm gonna grab a good
coupler<00:04:43.139> then<00:04:43.800> I'm<00:04:43.919> gonna<00:04:44.009> show<00:04:44.250> you<00:04:51.050> know

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
coupler then I'm gonna show you know

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.749 
coupler then I'm gonna show you know
what<00:04:52.169> I<00:04:52.229> have<00:04:52.349> here<00:04:52.590> is<00:04:52.860> a<00:04:52.889> good<00:04:53.190> coupler<00:04:53.550> it

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
what I have here is a good coupler it

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.219 
what I have here is a good coupler it
has<00:04:53.940> the<00:04:54.060> two<00:04:54.210> flat<00:04:54.449> spots<00:04:54.810> and<00:04:55.050> then<00:04:55.139> the

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
has the two flat spots and then the

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:05.210 
has the two flat spots and then the
round<00:04:55.789> we're<00:04:56.789> gonna<00:04:56.940> put<00:04:57.120> that<00:04:57.300> one<00:05:03.979> and<00:05:04.979> there

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
round we're gonna put that one and there

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.899 
round we're gonna put that one and there
we<00:05:05.310> go<00:05:05.430> that<00:05:05.699> was<00:05:05.729> spinning<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.210> shaft<00:05:07.909> okay

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:08.909 
we go that was spinning the shaft okay

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:10.670 
we go that was spinning the shaft okay
so<00:05:08.970> I<00:05:09.180> went<00:05:09.300> ahead<00:05:09.419> and<00:05:09.630> put<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:09.810> pump<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.590> the

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
so I went ahead and put the pump and the

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.189 
so I went ahead and put the pump and the
motor<00:05:10.860> back<00:05:11.069> one<00:05:11.310> plugged<00:05:11.580> everything<00:05:12.000> in<00:05:12.199> now

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
motor back one plugged everything in now

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.689 
motor back one plugged everything in now
what<00:05:13.380> I<00:05:13.409> did<00:05:13.650> was<00:05:13.680> before<00:05:14.009> I<00:05:14.220> plug<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.580> washer

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 
what I did was before I plug the washer

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:19.700 
what I did was before I plug the washer
into<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.180> wall<00:05:15.509> I<00:05:15.750> took<00:05:16.319> a<00:05:17.750> staple<00:05:18.750> and<00:05:18.930> jammed

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
into the wall I took a staple and jammed

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.230 
into the wall I took a staple and jammed
it<00:05:19.830> into<00:05:19.979> the<00:05:20.220> lid<00:05:20.400> switch<00:05:20.639> wire<00:05:20.669> so<00:05:21.180> I'm

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
it into the lid switch wire so I'm

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.540 
it into the lid switch wire so I'm
bypassing<00:05:21.900> the<00:05:21.990> lid<00:05:22.139> switch<00:05:22.380> so<00:05:23.130> I<00:05:23.220> don't<00:05:23.430> have

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
bypassing the lid switch so I don't have

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.249 
bypassing the lid switch so I don't have
to<00:05:23.639> put<00:05:23.789> the<00:05:23.880> cabinet<00:05:24.240> I<00:05:24.300> want<00:05:24.509> to<00:05:24.599> test<00:05:24.810> it<00:05:24.990> in

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
to put the cabinet I want to test it in

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:26.870 
to put the cabinet I want to test it in
case<00:05:25.530> this<00:05:25.710> does<00:05:25.979> not<00:05:26.159> work<00:05:26.400> I<00:05:26.550> don't<00:05:26.610> have<00:05:26.789> to

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
case this does not work I don't have to

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.540 
case this does not work I don't have to
go<00:05:27.030> through<00:05:27.210> that<00:05:27.300> process<00:05:27.479> again<00:05:28.400> here's<00:05:29.400> our

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
go through that process again here's our

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.209 
go through that process again here's our
bad<00:05:29.789> coupler<00:05:30.530> see<00:05:31.530> how<00:05:31.590> it's<00:05:31.740> round<00:05:31.979> in<00:05:32.130> the

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:32.219 
bad coupler see how it's round in the

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:34.459 
bad coupler see how it's round in the
center<00:05:32.490> there<00:05:32.669> and<00:05:32.849> I<00:05:33.750> should<00:05:33.900> have<00:05:34.020> two<00:05:34.199> flat

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
center there and I should have two flat

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.790 
center there and I should have two flat
spots<00:05:35.090> to<00:05:36.090> kind<00:05:36.360> of<00:05:36.449> grip<00:05:36.630> the<00:05:36.840> transmission

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
spots to kind of grip the transmission

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.649 
spots to kind of grip the transmission
shaft<00:05:38.009> so<00:05:38.340> that's<00:05:38.849> hard<00:05:39.030> to<00:05:39.150> see<00:05:39.330> from<00:05:39.539> looking

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
shaft so that's hard to see from looking

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:43.390 
shaft so that's hard to see from looking
up<00:05:39.870> underneath<00:05:41.030> so<00:05:42.030> when<00:05:42.690> I<00:05:42.750> plugged<00:05:43.080> it<00:05:43.199> in

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
up underneath so when I plugged it in

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.290 
up underneath so when I plugged it in
bypass<00:05:44.400> the<00:05:44.550> lid<00:05:44.699> switch<00:05:44.940> and<00:05:45.090> we're<00:05:45.210> gonna

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
bypass the lid switch and we're gonna

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:53.030 
bypass the lid switch and we're gonna
pull<00:05:45.509> it<00:05:45.599> off

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.200 

and<00:05:53.370> there<00:05:53.520> we<00:05:53.610> go<00:05:53.790> look<00:05:54.000> at<00:05:54.090> that

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.619 

and<00:05:59.210> the<00:05:59.479> washer<00:05:59.870> is<00:06:00.080> spinning<00:06:00.499> so<00:06:00.740> that

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:01.629 
and the washer is spinning so that

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:04.290 
and the washer is spinning so that
coupler<00:06:02.629> you<00:06:02.749> can<00:06:02.900> probably<00:06:03.110> find<00:06:03.529> them<00:06:03.680> on

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
coupler you can probably find them on

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.719 
coupler you can probably find them on
you<00:06:05.300> know<00:06:05.389> any<00:06:05.719> site<00:06:06.139> there's<00:06:07.009> a<00:06:07.069> number<00:06:07.610> of

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
you know any site there's a number of

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:11.379 
you know any site there's a number of
sites<00:06:07.969> that<00:06:08.089> sell<00:06:09.370> you<00:06:10.370> know<00:06:10.430> a<00:06:10.460> motor<00:06:10.939> coupler

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
sites that sell you know a motor coupler

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.350 
sites that sell you know a motor coupler
for<00:06:11.990> a<00:06:12.050> world<00:06:12.289> poor<00:06:12.529> kenmore<00:06:12.949> washer<00:06:13.099> and<00:06:13.909> they

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
for a world poor kenmore washer and they

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.850 
for a world poor kenmore washer and they
are<00:06:14.479> cheap<00:06:14.749> I<00:06:14.960> think<00:06:15.169> you<00:06:15.259> can<00:06:15.379> get<00:06:15.499> them<00:06:15.650> for

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
are cheap I think you can get them for

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.179 
are cheap I think you can get them for
five<00:06:16.039> to<00:06:16.219> ten<00:06:16.430> dollars<00:06:16.610> and<00:06:17.259> that's<00:06:18.259> a<00:06:18.589> very

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:19.189 
five to ten dollars and that's a very

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:21.070 
five to ten dollars and that's a very
common<00:06:19.460> problem<00:06:20.120> with<00:06:20.419> these<00:06:20.539> machines<00:06:20.749> where

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
common problem with these machines where

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.540 
common problem with these machines where
they<00:06:21.169> don't<00:06:21.259> spin<00:06:21.589> so<00:06:22.099> if<00:06:22.189> it<00:06:22.279> sounds<00:06:22.520> like

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
they don't spin so if it sounds like

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.890 
they don't spin so if it sounds like
it's<00:06:22.729> trying<00:06:22.909> to<00:06:22.969> spin<00:06:23.210> and<00:06:23.569> it's<00:06:23.719> not

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
it's trying to spin and it's not

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.839 
it's trying to spin and it's not
spinning<00:06:24.490> the<00:06:25.490> coupler<00:06:25.819> may<00:06:25.939> look<00:06:26.150> fine<00:06:26.499> but

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:27.849 
spinning the coupler may look fine but

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:33.610 
spinning the coupler may look fine but
as<00:06:28.849> we<00:06:29.180> saw<00:06:29.360> here<00:06:29.710> it's<00:06:30.710> not<00:06:30.919> so<00:06:32.409> alright<00:06:33.409> so

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
as we saw here it's not so alright so

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.619 
as we saw here it's not so alright so
there<00:06:33.770> you<00:06:33.800> go<00:06:34.039> that's<00:06:34.370> how<00:06:34.520> easy<00:06:34.550> it<00:06:34.879> how<00:06:35.360> easy

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:35.629 
there you go that's how easy it how easy

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:37.989 
there you go that's how easy it how easy
it<00:06:35.810> is<00:06:35.839> to<00:06:36.229> change<00:06:36.439> a<00:06:36.800> coupler<00:06:37.490> want<00:06:37.789> to<00:06:37.849> come

00:06:37.989 --> 00:06:37.999 
it is to change a coupler want to come

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:39.519 
it is to change a coupler want to come
more<00:06:38.120> washer<00:06:38.509> now<00:06:38.749> I<00:06:38.779> know<00:06:38.930> you<00:06:39.080> can<00:06:39.289> do<00:06:39.409> it

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:39.529 
more washer now I know you can do it

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:41.469 
more washer now I know you can do it
maybe<00:06:39.710> watch<00:06:40.009> the<00:06:40.039> video<00:06:40.460> I<00:06:40.789> have<00:06:41.240> a<00:06:41.300> couple

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 
maybe watch the video I have a couple

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:42.909 
maybe watch the video I have a couple
other<00:06:41.629> videos<00:06:41.900> on<00:06:42.289> troubleshooting<00:06:42.620> these

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 
other videos on troubleshooting these

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.010 
other videos on troubleshooting these
things<00:06:43.189> but<00:06:43.939> this<00:06:44.089> one<00:06:44.240> here<00:06:44.419> was<00:06:44.569> basically

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
things but this one here was basically
