be based on this prestigious stem and

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.160 
be based on this prestigious stem and
that's<00:02:27.430> what<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.760> will<00:02:27.970> affect<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:28.810> such<00:02:29.020> as

lot of arguments in the changing rooms

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.680 
lot of arguments in the changing rooms
with<00:02:51.340> players<00:02:51.670> maybe<00:02:52.120> because<00:02:52.360> you<00:02:52.480> want<00:02:52.630> to

go officer Ricky no well knowing then

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.790 
go officer Ricky no well knowing then
that<00:02:55.090> could<00:02:55.210> be<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.450> case<00:02:55.480> so<00:02:56.260> if<00:02:56.320> i<00:02:56.410> can<00:02:56.620> and

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
that could be the case so if i can and

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.290 
that could be the case so if i can and
players<00:02:56.980> more<00:02:57.280> out<00:02:57.430> can<00:02:57.610> go<00:02:57.700> down<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.030> whatnot

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
players more out can go down and whatnot

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.330 
players more out can go down and whatnot
from<00:02:58.540> this<00:02:58.990> and<00:02:59.410> I'll<00:02:59.530> see<00:02:59.710> so<00:02:59.890> starting<00:03:00.280> off

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
from this and I'll see so starting off

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.560 
from this and I'll see so starting off
can<00:03:00.580> be<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:00.700> lot<00:03:00.850> more<00:03:00.910> difficult<00:03:01.420> than<00:03:01.510> it

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
can be a lot more difficult than it

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.330 
can be a lot more difficult than it
would<00:03:01.810> be<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:02.470> think<00:03:02.500> that's<00:03:02.920> kind<00:03:03.160> of<00:03:03.220> how

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
would be and I think that's kind of how

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.800 
would be and I think that's kind of how
it<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.610> lot<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:03.910> management<00:03:04.360> first<00:03:04.600> start

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
it is a lot of management first start

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.320 
it is a lot of management first start
off<00:03:04.930> isn't<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.380> easy<00:03:05.590> isn't<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.460> nice<00:03:06.640> this

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
off isn't it easy isn't it nice this

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.480 
off isn't it easy isn't it nice this
ranking<00:03:07.930> system<00:03:08.350> which<00:03:08.470> I<00:03:08.590> really<00:03:09.220> want<00:03:09.430> to

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.670 
ranking system which I really want to
bring<00:03:09.640> in<00:03:09.790> will<00:03:10.210> affect<00:03:10.630> like<00:03:10.810> such<00:03:11.170> as<00:03:11.320> trans

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
bring in will affect like such as trans

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.590 
bring in will affect like such as trans

battle<00:03:31.570> so<00:03:31.720> why<00:03:31.900> would<00:03:32.140> a<00:03:32.820> national<00:03:33.820> team

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
battle so why would a national team

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.330 
battle so why would a national team
wanna<00:03:34.150> tea<00:03:34.420> for<00:03:34.870> him<00:03:34.900> for<00:03:35.680> example<00:03:36.100> so<00:03:36.190> this

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
wanna tea for him for example so this

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.949 
wanna tea for him for example so this
prestigious<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:37.090> will<00:03:37.240> help<00:03:37.480> run<00:03:37.720> quite<00:03:37.900> a

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
prestigious and will help run quite a

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.140 
prestigious and will help run quite a
bit<00:03:38.140> but<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:39.130> thing<00:03:39.310> is<00:03:39.340> with<00:03:39.520> the<00:03:39.640> prestige

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
bit but the thing is with the prestige

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.390 
bit but the thing is with the prestige
system<00:03:40.690> it's<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.290> lot<00:03:41.440> more<00:03:41.470> of<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.740> long<00:03:41.980> haul

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
system it's a lot more of a long haul

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.070 
system it's a lot more of a long haul
type<00:03:42.760> thing<00:03:43.060> wouldn't<00:03:43.450> step<00:03:43.660> on<00:03:43.810> happen

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
type thing wouldn't step on happen

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.320 
type thing wouldn't step on happen
overnight<00:03:44.320> so<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.490> only<00:03:45.640> way<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:45.820> carry<00:03:46.120> that

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
overnight so the only way to carry that

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.520 
overnight so the only way to carry that
for<00:03:47.080> example<00:03:47.170> is<00:03:47.800> by<00:03:48.550> winning<00:03:48.850> trophies

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
for example is by winning trophies

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.860 
for example is by winning trophies

note<00:04:41.440> if<00:04:41.650> you're<00:04:41.889> ranked<00:04:42.520> systems<00:04:42.970> gone<00:04:43.120> up

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
note if you're ranked systems gone up

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.629 
note if you're ranked systems gone up
because<00:04:43.360> you're<00:04:43.690> developing<00:04:43.990> the<00:04:44.319> team<00:04:44.639> then

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
because you're developing the team then

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.360 
because you're developing the team then
so<00:04:46.120> I'm<00:04:46.270> so<00:04:46.509> far<00:04:46.810> it's<00:04:47.080> a<00:04:47.169> bit<00:04:47.349> like<00:04:47.560> having

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
so I'm so far it's a bit like having

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.670 
so I'm so far it's a bit like having
accomplishment<00:04:49.090> in<00:04:49.300> my<00:04:50.020> player<00:04:50.319> so<00:04:50.560> if<00:04:50.620> you

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
accomplishment in my player so if you

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.860 
accomplishment in my player so if you
had<00:04:50.770> a<00:04:50.800> lot<00:04:51.009> more<00:04:51.039> a<00:04:51.400> lot<00:04:51.430> of<00:04:51.789> compliments<00:04:52.389> it's

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
had a lot more a lot of compliments it's

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.300 
had a lot more a lot of compliments it's
kind<00:04:52.990> of<00:04:53.110> very<00:04:53.169> similar<00:04:53.770> but<00:04:53.830> also<00:04:54.069> you

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
kind of very similar but also you

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.570 
kind of very similar but also you
affects<00:04:54.639> you<00:04:54.819> and<00:04:54.940> prestige<00:04:55.360> and<00:04:56.220> this<00:04:57.220> can

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
affects you and prestige and this can

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.029 
affects you and prestige and this can
work<00:04:57.759> on<00:04:59.099> manager<00:05:00.099> and<00:05:00.599> team<00:05:01.599> level<00:05:02.169> but<00:05:02.800> I

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
work on manager and team level but I

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.520 
work on manager and team level but I
think<00:05:03.460> there<00:05:03.580> should<00:05:03.759> be<00:05:03.789> a<00:05:03.909> couple<00:05:04.389> of<00:05:04.659> levels

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
think there should be a couple of levels

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.110 
think there should be a couple of levels
i<00:05:05.860> think<00:05:06.039> it<00:05:06.130> should<00:05:06.250> be<00:05:06.280> a<00:05:06.370> personal<00:05:06.729> manager

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
i think it should be a personal manager

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.719 
i think it should be a personal manager
one<00:05:07.300> in<00:05:08.169> my<00:05:08.409> opinion<00:05:08.710> it<00:05:09.069> should<00:05:09.159> be<00:05:09.430> a<00:05:09.460> team

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
one in my opinion it should be a team

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.540 
one in my opinion it should be a team
won<00:05:10.030> and<00:05:10.470> they<00:05:11.470> should<00:05:11.680> be<00:05:11.710> an<00:05:11.830> overall<00:05:12.250> one

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
won and they should be an overall one

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.080 
won and they should be an overall one
and<00:05:12.990> for<00:05:13.990> example<00:05:14.319> the<00:05:14.409> manager<00:05:14.770> one<00:05:14.979> would<00:05:15.639> be

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
and for example the manager one would be

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.240 
and for example the manager one would be
affected<00:05:16.960> by<00:05:18.270> say<00:05:19.270> the<00:05:19.539> outside<00:05:20.050> world<00:05:20.409> so<00:05:21.190> you

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
affected by say the outside world so you

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.070 
affected by say the outside world so you
are<00:05:21.550> winning<00:05:21.940> trophies<00:05:22.479> you<00:05:22.630> wins<00:05:22.870> what

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
are winning trophies you wins what

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.809 
are winning trophies you wins what
people<00:05:23.349> actually<00:05:23.440> look<00:05:23.830> at<00:05:24.009> statistics<00:05:24.220> but

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
people actually look at statistics but

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:26.460 
people actually look at statistics but
then<00:05:24.970> if<00:05:25.389> you're<00:05:25.599> going<00:05:25.780> to<00:05:25.870> look<00:05:25.960> at<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.169> club

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
then if you're going to look at the club

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.890 
then if you're going to look at the club
one<00:05:26.740> you're<00:05:27.280> a<00:05:27.400> player<00:05:27.909> morale<00:05:28.330> type<00:05:28.659> thing

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
one you're a player morale type thing

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.540 
one you're a player morale type thing
will<00:05:29.050> affect<00:05:29.380> it<00:05:29.560> players<00:05:29.860> be<00:05:30.069> in<00:05:30.099> place<00:05:30.310> so<00:05:30.460> if

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
will affect it players be in place so if

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.950 
will affect it players be in place so if
you<00:05:30.639> stop<00:05:30.880> playing<00:05:31.060> a<00:05:31.180> certain<00:05:31.419> player<00:05:31.659> all

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
you stop playing a certain player all

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.270 
you stop playing a certain player all
the<00:05:32.080> time<00:05:32.259> and<00:05:32.440> he's<00:05:32.560> moaning<00:05:32.800> you're<00:05:33.190> not

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
doing anything about it that will then

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.439 
doing anything about it that will then
