00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:19.220
 In the event of a serious accident , a 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.150
 alluvium of information that generates a 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.110
 overexposure to images to sounds and 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.540
 all kinds of news about what happened 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.180
 these images are present in the 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.880
 television we see ourselves on the covers of 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.450
 the newspapers through the streets we hear 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.170
 about that accident on the radio and that 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:45.129
 generates in our children the presence 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.260
 constant news that 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.530
 they raise questions and they can generate 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.530
 anxiety 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.590
 the images us as adults 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.470
 we can understand that we are seeing a 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:03.130
 and again a one-time information 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:07.060
 incident but when a child by 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.160
 example of 46 years sees 20 times the 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.110
 information of an accident reaches the 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.990
 conclusion that there have been 20 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.810
 serious accidents and therefore gets 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.619
 a logical consequence if that happens 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.020
 so many times it's going to happen to me tomorrow and that 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.360
 happens to these people and if I 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.420
 happen to me that's what I'm going to 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.509
 feel and who will take care of me so 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.320
 both understanding that it is impossible and 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:38.649
 maybe it's not convenient to protect our 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.630
 children of that flood of information what 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.060
 what we have to do is 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.700
 sit down with years to explain what 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.580
 who are watching and help them understand 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.970
 that information in terms of age 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.399
 which is how we can do that because 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.710
 we should always start from a question 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.950
 a very generic question 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.490
 for example is seen something yesterday today in the 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:07.180
 press on the radio that you thought 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.320
 I miss you that has caught your attention 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.230
 Obviously before so much information 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.170
 our children will answer if there has been 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.890
 an accident and there were many people who 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.400
 they were there and ambulances worth starting 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.890
 of what our children tell us 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.070
 we can according to the questions and 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.580
 just based on your questions and go 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:34.730
 answering what they want to know and about 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.430
 all generating a feeling of 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.610
 security but never making false 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.550
 promises we can tell you that that's not 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.400
 happens very often we can tell you that 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.190
 if they happen to them, surely 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.510
 will take care but we can not assure you that 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.510
 they will never happen to you
