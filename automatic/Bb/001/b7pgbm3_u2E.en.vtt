00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello today I want to show you how we can 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.980
 decorate a cookie with an ideal angel 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.990
 for the holidays or for 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.599
 time of the first communions 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.849
 for this we start with a cookie in the 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.460
 that we have previously drawn with 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:22.060
 the help of edible markers the 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.000
 little angel we make the outline of the face 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:29.240
 with flesh colored glaze and from the 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.760
 edges inwards we are filling 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.150
 we just have to tap it 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.410
 so that the fat extends to us from a 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.900
 uniform way 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.690
 for the outline of the cookie has 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.780
 decided to opt for a blue sky and as 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.510
 we always start at the edges and go 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.840
 filling in in this case 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.530
 like a very fluid fat now we are going to 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.110
 make the wings white with a 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.050
 glasa a little more fluid making the 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.350
 cuts and then again from the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.640
 edges inward of the fill 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.640
 that would be the whole wing 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.530
 now let's make the angel's clothes 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.650
 in this case green as you 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.410
 I want to give the effect of relief we are going 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.750
 to do in two steps the first we do 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.840
 all the outline of the whole figure 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.580
 making the edges and then filling 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.730
 inward 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.150
 and once it's dry we 're going to paint 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.850
 I read to decorate the sleeves 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:46.160
 so that we have the effect of 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:48.470
 that stand out anything that 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.330
 we need to touch up the power we can 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.330
 do with the help of a toothpick 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.770
 Now let's paint or decorate the hair 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.270
 of the angel in this case is colored 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:09.190
 Yellow as you can see is a fat 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:12.370
 very fluid since their own since the 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.160
 own background the face the hair the wings 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.250
 etcetera is already dry and therefore we 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.739
 allows it to be a dam so in this 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.099
 case as you can see I'm not using 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.620
 I did not even mouthpiece I just did it 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.760
 a little hole in the pastry bag and I 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.760
 I have dedicated to fill 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.980
 once the glaze has dried 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:39.830
 base we will use grease to 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.849
 write and a number mouthpiece very 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.520
 small in this case 1.5 to do the 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.850
 hair lines what would be the 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.700
 bangs the loops and so on so 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:57.209
 that we can notice perceiving movement 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.310
 every time I'm separating the mouthpiece 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.360
 of the cookie what I'm doing is 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.300
 clean it to prevent that fat from 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.819
 be a bit harder to be 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.489
 can dry us and is not put the 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.510
 nozzle and we can get dirty or 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.510
 spoil work 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.970
 As you can see the line is in the air 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.459
 so that when we do the drawing 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.410
 we will be much finer and the 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.410
 lines are going to be uniform 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:39.739
 we entertain ourselves and we thus two 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.739
 loops or ornaments as we want 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.380
 Now let's proceed to decorate the 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.760
 wings that as you can see are 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:55.000
 decorated with edible glitter for 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.300
 we start from a number nozzle 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.060
 very small and with icing to write and 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:04.240
 keeping the line in the air we are going to 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.770
 go doing the outline and some 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.100
 drawings that also give movement or 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.100
 relief 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.290
 once we have already given it for 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.870
 finished and before the 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.930
 class let's put the glitter 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:24.500
 over so that when it is that 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.170
 I have already caught that glitter and I do not know 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.440
 It will knock us out there and it also gives 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:33.230
 very nice effect to the cookie and the 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.920
 same way we will proceed to do the 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.790
 halo of the angel we extend first 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.790
 the real fat 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:48.490
 and before it has dried we put it 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.490
 our our edible glitter 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.210
 you see that the house has already dried 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:58.180
 the return to the cookie and we give you some 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:02.229
 taps so that the glitter 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:05.080
 surplus is discarded in the event that 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:07.060
 do not take it off easily or that 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.240
 everything has been filled with glitter 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:15.210
 As in this case, we can help 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.210
 a brush and that's how we're getting 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.920
 now let's finish with the details 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.920
 that are the neck 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.660
 and the hands with a very finite mouthpiece 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.819
 we make a line that we then cross 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.580
 down to be the shape of the two 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:39.180
 hands as if our little angel was 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.180
 praying 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.530
 to finish with the help of a 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.960
 edible marker we are going to do the 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.750
 nose 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.120
 mouth 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.290
 and in this case a single eye because the 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:58.280
 another is covered by the fringe and 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.280
 we also put an eyebrow 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.280
 and so our cookie was left 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.280
 completed 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:13.039
 because this is the final result of the 

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:15.619
 cookie I hope you liked it 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:19.839
 is it so please give it to me like and if 

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:19.839
