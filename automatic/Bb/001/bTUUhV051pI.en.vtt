00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
guys another Easter egg in Ascension

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.620 
guys another Easter egg in Ascension
today<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.060> we're<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.210> head<00:00:24.359> over<00:00:24.390> to

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
today and we're going to head over to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.080 
today and we're going to head over to
the<00:00:24.810> PhD<00:00:25.260> flopper<00:00:25.380> straight<00:00:25.859> away<00:00:26.090> there's

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
the PhD flopper straight away there's

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.550 
the PhD flopper straight away there's
two<00:00:27.269> Easter<00:00:27.539> eggs<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.869> show<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.109> guys<00:00:28.199> but

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
two Easter eggs and show you guys but

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.220 
two Easter eggs and show you guys but
this<00:00:28.680> one's<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.949> main<00:00:29.160> one<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:30.300> one<00:00:30.359> is

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
this one's the main one and this one is

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.590 
this one's the main one and this one is
included<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.920> kahlua<00:00:32.340> included<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.420> our

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
included in kahlua included in our

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.350 
included in kahlua included in our
theory<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.980> as<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.640> see<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:35.969> have<00:00:36.000> like<00:00:36.329> a

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
theory so as you can see we have like a

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.160 
theory so as you can see we have like a
nice<00:00:36.600> little<00:00:36.809> symbol<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.350> slide<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.860> PhD<00:00:39.170> bit

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
nice little symbol and slide the PhD bit

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.590 
nice little symbol and slide the PhD bit
and<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.399> actually<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> Russian<00:00:42.149> for<00:00:42.420> hell

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
and that is actually a Russian for hell

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.350 
and that is actually a Russian for hell
does<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:44.000> this<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.930> bit<00:00:46.079> strange<00:00:46.320> because

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
does and this it's a bit strange because

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.790 
does and this it's a bit strange because
from<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.510> sixth<00:00:48.899> step<00:00:49.110> until<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.680> eighth

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
from the sixth step until the eighth

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.189 
from the sixth step until the eighth
step<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> wall<00:00:50.520> cooter<00:00:50.879> thing<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.449> they

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
step in the wall cooter thing and they

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.270 
step in the wall cooter thing and they
actually<00:00:52.320> goes<00:00:52.710> from<00:00:53.250> six<00:00:54.110> raise<00:00:55.110> hell<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.770> in

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
actually goes from six raise hell and in

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.229 
actually goes from six raise hell and in
seven<00:00:56.699> with<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> divine<00:00:57.480> eight<00:00:57.899> William<00:00:58.559> and

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
seven with the divine eight William and

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.790 
seven with the divine eight William and
we're<00:01:00.239> going<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.420> go<00:01:00.510> back<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.690> step<00:01:01.199> 6<00:01:01.590> here

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
we're going to go back to step 6 here

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.090 
we're going to go back to step 6 here
guys<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.370> step<00:01:02.609> 6<00:01:02.910> raise<00:01:03.449> hell<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.559> what<00:01:04.920> me

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
guys and step 6 raise hell is what me

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.570 
guys and step 6 raise hell is what me
and<00:01:05.240> chaos<00:01:06.240> come<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.350> with<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.740> far<00:01:07.770> basically

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
and chaos come up with so far basically

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.179 
and chaos come up with so far basically
guys<00:01:09.500> we're<00:01:10.500> not<00:01:10.590> sure<00:01:10.770> whether<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.130> is

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
guys we're not sure whether this is

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.039 
guys we're not sure whether this is
confirmed<00:01:11.700> or<00:01:12.090> true<00:01:12.390> or<00:01:12.630> anything<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:12.930> that

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
confirmed or true or anything like that

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.230 
confirmed or true or anything like that
it's<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.860> refuse<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.970> fury

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
it's just I refuse just the fury

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.810 
it's just I refuse just the fury
polished<00:01:15.869> piece<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.140> us<00:01:16.320> spend<00:01:17.070> criticize<00:01:17.580> us

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
polished piece of us spend criticize us

polished piece of us spend criticize us
or<00:01:18.000> anything<00:01:18.180> just<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.170> know<00:01:19.310> if<00:01:20.310> not<00:01:20.640> just

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
or anything just you know if not just

or anything just you know if not just
leave<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.659> comment<00:01:21.900> saying<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.770> think

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
leave a comment saying what you think

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.870 
leave a comment saying what you think
might<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.240> useful<00:01:24.360> but<00:01:24.750> anyway<00:01:25.189> raise<00:01:26.189> hell<00:01:26.430> so

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
might be useful but anyway raise hell so

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.149 
might be useful but anyway raise hell so
basically<00:01:27.270> what<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:27.960> thought<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.590> when<00:01:28.860> your

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
basically what we thought is when your

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.800 
basically what we thought is when your
screen<00:01:29.520> goes<00:01:29.670> blue<00:01:29.970> after<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> whole<00:01:30.570> death

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
screen goes blue after the whole death

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.200 
screen goes blue after the whole death
machine<00:01:31.140> crap<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:32.430> are<00:01:32.549> sort<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.880> coming

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
machine crap and we are sort of coming

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.539 
machine crap and we are sort of coming
off<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.750> air<00:01:33.930> sparking<00:01:34.530> battery<00:01:35.220> theory

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
off the air sparking battery theory

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.929 
off the air sparking battery theory
thing<00:01:35.909> here<00:01:36.119> now<00:01:36.329> all<00:01:37.220> perhaps<00:01:38.220> if<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.640> take

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
thing here now all perhaps if you take

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.399 
thing here now all perhaps if you take
it<00:01:38.970> if<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.750> raise<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.530> lunar<00:01:41.159> than<00:01:41.850> PhD<00:01:42.509> as

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
it if you raise the lunar than PhD as

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.520 
it if you raise the lunar than PhD as
the<00:01:43.680> blue<00:01:44.040> thing<00:01:44.640> goes<00:01:44.909> off<00:01:45.229> then<00:01:46.229> perhaps

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
the blue thing goes off then perhaps

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.620 
the blue thing goes off then perhaps
something<00:01:46.950> will<00:01:47.100> happen<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.939> if<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.329> get<00:01:48.509> on

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
something will happen like if you get on

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.080 
something will happen like if you get on
it<00:01:48.659> or<00:01:48.899> something<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.460> but<00:01:50.460> again<00:01:50.520> if

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
it or something like that but again if

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.090 
it or something like that but again if
so<00:01:51.720> you're<00:01:51.869> going<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.140> be<00:01:52.350> doing<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.829> while

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
so you're going to be doing that while

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.109 
so you're going to be doing that while
you<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:54.380> death<00:01:55.380> machine<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:57.090> know

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
you have the death machine and you know

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.139 
you have the death machine and you know
we're<00:01:57.360> doing<00:01:57.450> step<00:01:57.869> 6<00:01:58.110> after<00:01:58.500> step<00:01:58.829> 7<00:01:59.399> which<00:02:00.000> is

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
we're doing step 6 after step 7 which is

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.090 
we're doing step 6 after step 7 which is
kind<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.420> confusing<00:02:00.600> if<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.469> get<00:02:01.710> that

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
kind of confusing if you get that

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.690 
kind of confusing if you get that
won't<00:02:03.250> be<00:02:03.430> so<00:02:03.820> confusing<00:02:04.210> but<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:05.700> that's

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
won't be so confusing but and that's

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.540 
won't be so confusing but and that's
what<00:02:07.080> that's<00:02:08.080> what<00:02:08.170> we've<00:02:08.500> sort<00:02:09.160> of<00:02:09.220> problem

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
what that's what we've sort of problem

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.350 
what that's what we've sort of problem
with<00:02:09.670> at<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:09.970> moment<00:02:10.000> so<00:02:10.479> perhaps<00:02:12.270> we're<00:02:13.270> just

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
with at the moment so perhaps we're just

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.120 
with at the moment so perhaps we're just
trying<00:02:13.569> to<00:02:13.630> play<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.900> back<00:02:14.050> now<00:02:14.260> browser<00:02:14.590> just

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
trying to play the back now browser just

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.040 
trying to play the back now browser just
trying<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.400> think<00:02:15.520> how<00:02:15.670> we<00:02:15.730> can<00:02:16.030> raise<00:02:16.690> hell
