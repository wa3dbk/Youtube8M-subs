00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
to set the lights up each time so I

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.529 
to set the lights up each time so I
really<00:00:43.530> wanted<00:00:43.770> some<00:00:44.129> way<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:45.030> sort<00:00:45.510> of

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.420 
really wanted some way of a sort of
positioning<00:00:45.930> them<00:00:46.050> permanently<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:47.100> what<00:00:47.399> I

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
positioning them permanently so what I

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.549

that both angled up towards the ceiling

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.009 
that both angled up towards the ceiling

mixer<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.570> have<00:02:00.810> behind<00:02:01.079> me<00:02:01.320> I'll<00:02:01.920> probably

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
mixer I have behind me I'll probably

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.889 
mixer I have behind me I'll probably
keep<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.310> for<00:02:02.640> now<00:02:02.759> until<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.299> get<00:02:03.479> used<00:02:03.689> to

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
keep that for now until I get used to

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.170 
keep that for now until I get used to
this<00:02:04.020> particular<00:02:04.259> one<00:02:04.590> but<00:02:04.909> again<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:05.939> just

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
this particular one but again I just

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.119 
this particular one but again I just
need<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.329> find<00:02:06.479> some<00:02:06.689> time<00:02:06.869> now<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.129> experiment

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
need to find some time now to experiment

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.979 
need to find some time now to experiment
with<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.310> get<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.580> rigged<00:02:08.759> up<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.959> a

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
with this get it rigged up and have a

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.990 
with this get it rigged up and have a
play<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.760> hopefully<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:11.910> should<00:02:11.940> make

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
play so hopefully that should make

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.520 
play so hopefully that should make
big<00:02:13.180> difference<00:02:13.360> in<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.750> sound<00:02:14.080> quality<00:02:14.260> on

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
big difference in the sound quality on

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.610 
big difference in the sound quality on
the<00:02:14.770> screen<00:02:15.040> casts<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.440> only<00:02:17.560> other

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
the screen casts and the only other

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.440 
the screen casts and the only other
thing<00:02:17.770> for<00:02:18.040> today<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.580> just<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.030> mention<00:02:19.240> this
