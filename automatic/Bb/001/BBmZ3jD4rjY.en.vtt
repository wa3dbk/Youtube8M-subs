00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
now I fade out that line this is an

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.830 
now I fade out that line this is an
excellent<00:01:41.220> excellent<00:01:41.520> way<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.450> show<00:01:42.659> your

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
excellent excellent way to show your

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.810 
excellent excellent way to show your
work<00:01:43.049> not<00:01:43.259> everybody<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:43.890> do<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.490> take<00:01:44.759> it

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
work not everybody can do this I take it

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.850 
work not everybody can do this I take it
at<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.210> zero<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.960> start<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.290> work<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.619> up<00:01:46.680> into

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
at a zero and I start to work it up into

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.130 
at a zero and I start to work it up into
really<00:01:47.100> small<00:01:47.220> C<00:01:47.820> shaping<00:01:48.299> sections<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.020> then

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
really small C shaping sections and then

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.780 
really small C shaping sections and then
I<00:01:49.170> work<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.560> right<00:01:49.770> through<00:01:50.070> until<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.610> line

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
I work it right through until that line

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.210 
I work it right through until that line
softly<00:01:51.240> disappears<00:01:51.810> therefore<00:01:52.619> creating<00:01:53.100> a

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
softly disappears therefore creating a

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.049 
softly disappears therefore creating a
shave<00:01:53.579> into<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.689> fade
