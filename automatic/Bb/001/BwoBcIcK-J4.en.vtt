00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
because I do not feel like bursting your

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.630 
because I do not feel like bursting your
eardrums<00:01:02.609> with<00:01:02.850> my<00:01:03.030> rage<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.920> so<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
eardrums with my rage so so this is a

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.700 
eardrums with my rage so so this is a
first<00:01:06.090> goal<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.600> believe<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.200> easy<00:01:07.470> to

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
first goal that I believe is easy to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.510 
first goal that I believe is easy to
score<00:01:08.040> ass

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
score ass

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.280 
score ass
it's<00:01:08.880> basically<00:01:09.299> backhand<00:01:09.990> forehand

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
it's basically backhand forehand

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.530 
it's basically backhand forehand
backhand<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:11.220> hold<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.670> backhand<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.390> you

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
backhand you hold the backhand and you

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.600 
backhand you hold the backhand and you
go<00:01:12.659> forehand<00:01:13.380> backhand<00:01:13.590> really<00:01:14.250> quick<00:01:14.460> and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
go forehand backhand really quick and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.219 
go forehand backhand really quick and
you<00:01:14.700> got<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.939> get<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> timing<00:01:15.420> down<00:01:15.600> as<00:01:15.930> always

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
you got to get the timing down as always

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.920 
you got to get the timing down as always
I<00:01:16.259> can't<00:01:16.590> do<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.830> for<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.810> of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
I can't do it for you but that is one of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.280 
I can't do it for you but that is one of
the<00:01:19.020> big<00:01:19.200> goals<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.600> another<00:01:21.600> way<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:22.110> do

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
the big goals and another way you can do

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.260 
the big goals and another way you can do
it<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.710> by<00:01:22.950> putting<00:01:23.280> one<00:01:23.460> hand<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.090> stick

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
it is by putting one hand on the stick

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.570 
it is by putting one hand on the stick
which<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.540> pretty<00:01:24.930> much<00:01:25.080> equivalent<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:26.009> would

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
which is pretty much equivalent I would

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.840 
which is pretty much equivalent I would
say<00:01:26.729> don't<00:01:26.909> use<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.390> unless<00:01:27.720> you're<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.409> a

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
say don't use this unless you're in a

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.080 
say don't use this unless you're in a
pen<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.090> penalty<00:01:30.540> shot<00:01:30.979> or<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> lot

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
pen on a penalty shot or you have a lot

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.749 
pen on a penalty shot or you have a lot
of<00:01:33.119> time<00:01:33.570> because<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.619> really<00:01:35.070> not<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
of time because it is really not the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.670 
of time because it is really not the
quickest<00:01:36.150> deke<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> world<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.079> would<00:01:37.229> say

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
quickest deke in the world I would say

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.859 
quickest deke in the world I would say
you're<00:01:38.310> better<00:01:38.460> off<00:01:38.640> using<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.270> other<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.689> in

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
you're better off using the other one in

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.100 
you're better off using the other one in
this<00:01:40.460> instance<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.720> still<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.020> very

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
this instance but that is still a very

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.679 
this instance but that is still a very
good<00:01:43.829> move<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.939> next<00:01:45.270> one<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.540> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
good move and then the next one is the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.350 
good move and then the next one is the
forehand<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.649> same<00:01:46.890> same<00:01:47.549> thing<00:01:48.030> pretty

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
forehand but the same same thing pretty

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.120 
forehand but the same same thing pretty
much<00:01:48.600> you're<00:01:48.840> going<00:01:48.990> forehand<00:01:49.619> backhand

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
much you're going forehand backhand

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.429 
much you're going forehand backhand
forehand<00:01:50.549> you're<00:01:51.450> doing<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.170> got<00:01:52.320> to

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
forehand you're doing that you got to

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.270 
forehand you're doing that you got to
get<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.740> timing<00:01:53.070> down<00:01:53.369> as<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:54.060> said<00:01:54.299> before

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
get that timing down as I said before

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.429 
get that timing down as I said before
and<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.360> yet<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.600> our<00:01:57.810> example<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.649> a

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
and this is yet in our example of a

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.730 
and this is yet in our example of a
forehand<00:02:01.439> backhand<00:02:01.890> forehand<00:02:02.990> that's<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.170> good

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
forehand backhand forehand that's a good

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.560 
forehand backhand forehand that's a good
