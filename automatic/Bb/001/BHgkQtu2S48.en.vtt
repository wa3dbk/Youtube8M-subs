00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
the same goes for this part where you

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.080 
the same goes for this part where you
have<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.709> blow<00:03:07.890> up<00:03:08.040> jets<00:03:08.370> sitting<00:03:08.849> on<00:03:08.940> the

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
the Super Nintendo version but it seems

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.809 
the Super Nintendo version but it seems
to<00:03:30.389> have<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.569> lot<00:03:30.840> more<00:03:30.900> pizzazz<00:03:31.530> for<00:03:32.370> lack<00:03:32.549> of<00:03:32.579> a

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
better term it definitely took a

graphical hit when it was ported to the
Super<00:03:37.590> Nintendo<00:03:38.209> this<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.359> the<00:03:39.450> opposite<00:03:39.870> what

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
Super Nintendo this is the opposite what

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.020 
Super Nintendo this is the opposite what
happened<00:03:40.470> when<00:03:40.590> Smash<00:03:40.889> TV<00:03:40.920> was<00:03:41.519> ported<00:03:41.910> over

happened when Smash TV was ported over
that<00:03:42.930> version<00:03:43.319> actually<00:03:43.440> looked<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:44.040> lot

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
that version actually looked a lot

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.940 
that version actually looked a lot
better<00:03:44.489> than<00:03:44.609> the<00:03:44.850> arcade<00:03:45.299> version<00:03:45.950> this

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
better than the arcade version this

to see which version to recommend if

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.220 
to see which version to recommend if

things but it doesn't result in a lot of
fun<00:04:12.100> I<00:04:12.430> think<00:04:13.360> it's<00:04:13.480> only<00:04:13.600> worth<00:04:13.870> tracking

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170
