most common stroke faults we see in

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.200 
most common stroke faults we see in
athletes<00:02:33.280> who<00:02:33.460> don't<00:02:33.700> have<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:33.910> lot<00:02:34.180> of

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
strength and maybe who are a little bit

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.920 
strength and maybe who are a little bit
younger<00:02:36.100> is<00:02:36.400> trying<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.030> do<00:02:37.150> too<00:02:37.420> much<00:02:37.630> with

younger is trying to do too much with
the<00:02:38.110> pull<00:02:38.350> so<00:02:38.860> maybe<00:02:39.070> they'll<00:02:39.280> get<00:02:39.400> out<00:02:39.460> to

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
the pull so maybe they'll get out to

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.550 
the pull so maybe they'll get out to
nine<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.240> three<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:40.840> they'll<00:02:41.230> let<00:02:41.350> those

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
nine and three and they'll let those

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.170 
nine and three and they'll let those
elbows<00:02:41.800> come<00:02:42.280> back<00:02:42.490> and<00:02:42.730> they'll<00:02:42.850> get<00:02:43.030> their

elbows come back and they'll get their

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.970 
elbows come back and they'll get their
hands<00:02:43.630> stuck<00:02:43.840> in<00:02:44.020> what<00:02:44.170> we<00:02:44.290> call<00:02:44.500> no-man's
