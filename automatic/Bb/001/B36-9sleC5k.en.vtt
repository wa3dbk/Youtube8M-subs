00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.530 
about quarter to 12 absolutely no action
on<00:02:57.510> either<00:02:57.840> rod<00:02:58.310> when<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.340> round<00:02:59.670> in<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.030> right

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
on either rod when I round in the right

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.300 
on either rod when I round in the right
rod<00:03:00.780> unfortunately<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.620> hook<00:03:01.770> was<00:03:02.010> then

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
rod unfortunately the hook was then

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.880 
rod unfortunately the hook was then
buried<00:03:03.209> in<00:03:03.510> half<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.959> boy<00:03:04.110> who<00:03:04.290> sells<00:03:04.620> me<00:03:04.770> in

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
buried in half the boy who sells me in

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.830 
buried in half the boy who sells me in
the<00:03:04.950> bag<00:03:05.160> he<00:03:05.819> did<00:03:05.970> have<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.120> few<00:03:06.300> bits<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.690> that

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
the bag he did have a few bits of that

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.390 
the bag he did have a few bits of that
so<00:03:07.050> maybe<00:03:07.230> simple<00:03:07.650> words<00:03:07.830> around<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.220> rig

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
so maybe simple words around that rig

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.220 
so maybe simple words around that rig
but<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.209> wouldn't<00:03:09.420> be<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.600> first<00:03:09.750> about<00:03:09.989> that

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
but it wouldn't be the first about that

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.350 
but it wouldn't be the first about that
a<00:03:10.260> boy<00:03:10.470> Leon<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.890> they<00:03:11.160> were<00:03:11.360> unfortunate

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360
