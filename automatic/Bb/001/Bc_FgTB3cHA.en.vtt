00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
to try out a new method for doing

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.379 
to try out a new method for doing
redstone<00:00:13.080> tutorials<00:00:13.650> so<00:00:14.460> how<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.000> works<00:00:15.179> is

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
redstone tutorials so how it works is

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.939 
redstone tutorials so how it works is
you<00:00:15.420> step<00:00:15.809> on<00:00:16.049> this<00:00:16.289> pressure<00:00:16.529> plate<00:00:16.680> a

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
you step on this pressure plate a

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.010 
you step on this pressure plate a
minecart<00:00:17.609> shoots<00:00:17.940> out<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.270> wall<00:00:18.420> when<00:00:18.900> you

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
minecart shoots out of the wall when you

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.490 
minecart shoots out of the wall when you
hop<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.859> minecart<00:00:20.250> will<00:00:20.369> launch<00:00:20.840> and<00:00:21.840> I've

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
hop in the minecart will launch and I've

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.920 
hop in the minecart will launch and I've
added<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:23.070> second<00:00:23.640> story<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.420> minecart

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
added a second story for a minecart

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.019 
added a second story for a minecart
unloader<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> top<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.250> as<00:00:26.670> you're<00:00:26.849> coming

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
unloader on the top so as you're coming

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.779 
unloader on the top so as you're coming
back<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.630> just<00:00:27.810> get<00:00:27.960> pasta<00:00:28.560> pasta<00:00:29.460> push<00:00:29.640> out

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
back you just get pasta pasta push out

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.070 
back you just get pasta pasta push out
of<00:00:29.880> your<00:00:30.000> mind<00:00:30.150> card<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> minecart<00:00:30.960> goes

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
of your mind card and the minecart goes

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.959 
of your mind card and the minecart goes
right<00:00:31.289> back<00:00:31.439> into<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> dispenser<00:00:32.399> down<00:00:32.579> here

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
right back into the dispenser down here

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.479 
right back into the dispenser down here
so<00:00:33.510> here's<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.079> basic<00:00:34.200> unit<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.100> pretty

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
so here's the basic unit it's pretty

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.090 
so here's the basic unit it's pretty
compact<00:00:35.960> it's<00:00:36.960> only<00:00:37.110> two<00:00:37.410> blocks<00:00:37.559> behind<00:00:38.010> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
compact it's only two blocks behind the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.470 
compact it's only two blocks behind the
wall<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.280> that's<00:00:38.670> only<00:00:38.850> because<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.390> to

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
wall and that's only because you have to

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.110 
wall and that's only because you have to
have<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.809> block<00:00:40.079> right<00:00:40.260> here<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.879> I<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:42.090> it

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
have this block right here and I like it

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.270 
have this block right here and I like it
you<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.570> actually<00:00:42.719> lower<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.350> ceiling<00:00:44.070> by

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
you can actually lower this ceiling by

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.190 
you can actually lower this ceiling by
one<00:00:44.579> if<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.940> want<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.300> ceiling<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:45.989> too

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
one if you want a ceiling that is too

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.319 
one if you want a ceiling that is too
high<00:00:46.440> that's<00:00:46.800> completely<00:00:47.190> optional<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.940> you

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
high that's completely optional and you

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.880 
high that's completely optional and you
can<00:00:48.450> also<00:00:48.570> change<00:00:48.899> out<00:00:49.170> these<00:00:49.320> stairs<00:00:49.590> or

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
can also change out these stairs or

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.400 
can also change out these stairs or
regular<00:00:50.340> blocks<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.180> I'm<00:00:51.449> like<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.020> said<00:00:52.170> I'm

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
regular blocks so I'm like I said I'm

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.770 
regular blocks so I'm like I said I'm
going<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.070> be<00:00:53.160> doing<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.579> different<00:00:54.239> method<00:00:54.600> of

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
going to be doing a different method of

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.029 
going to be doing a different method of
showing<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.230> guys<00:00:55.320> how<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.530> build<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.920> I'm

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
showing you guys how to build it I'm

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.040 
showing you guys how to build it I'm
going<00:00:56.399> piece<00:00:56.670> by<00:00:56.850> piece<00:00:56.879> like<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.899> think

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
going piece by piece like this I think

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.869 
going piece by piece like this I think
it's<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.410> little<00:00:58.500> bit<00:00:58.739> crisper<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.760> can

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
it's a little bit crisper and you can

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.610 
it's a little bit crisper and you can
kind<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.120> pause<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.510> video<00:01:00.719> each<00:01:00.930> step<00:01:01.230> if<00:01:01.440> you

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
kind of pause the video each step if you

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.189 
kind of pause the video each step if you
need<00:01:01.770> help<00:01:02.149> so<00:01:03.149> first<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.510> need<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.690> get<00:01:03.960> a

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
need help so first you need to get a

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.649 
need help so first you need to get a
three<00:01:05.040> wide<00:01:05.220> floor<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> wall<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.570> is

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
three wide floor and have a wall that is

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.300 
three wide floor and have a wall that is
three<00:01:06.930> wide<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.380> three<00:01:07.590> high<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.130> said

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
three wide and three high like I said

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.160 
three wide and three high like I said
you<00:01:08.430> could<00:01:08.640> do<00:01:08.760> two<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.780> think<00:01:09.990> three

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
you could do two I but I think three

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.929 
you could do two I but I think three
high<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.320> definitely<00:01:10.830> better<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.250> don't<00:01:11.820> know

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
high is definitely better I don't know

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.580 
high is definitely better I don't know
it's<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.150> more<00:01:12.360> room<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.869> seems<00:01:13.229> less

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
it's just more room and it seems less

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.190 
it's just more room and it seems less
cramped<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.700> all<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.150> need<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:16.020> start

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
cramped so all you need is this to start

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.649 
cramped so all you need is this to start
off<00:01:16.350> with<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.640> second<00:01:17.909> step<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.630> need

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
off with and the second step is you need

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.230 
off with and the second step is you need
to<00:01:18.900> add<00:01:19.560> stairs<00:01:20.310> right<00:01:20.460> here<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.210> also

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
to add stairs right here you can also

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.749 
to add stairs right here you can also
add<00:01:21.479> blocks<00:01:21.810> at<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.170> block<00:01:22.619> down<00:01:22.890> here<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.400> that

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
add blocks at a block down here and that

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.370 
add blocks at a block down here and that
one<00:01:24.030> powered<00:01:24.330> rail<00:01:24.509> here<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.840> two<00:01:25.200> regular

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
one powered rail here and two regular

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.550 
one powered rail here and two regular
rails<00:01:25.950> right<00:01:26.220> here<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.570> next<00:01:27.900> step<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.259> pretty

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
rails right here the next step is pretty

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.609 
rails right here the next step is pretty
easy<00:01:28.710> add<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.610> pressure<00:01:29.970> plate<00:01:30.180> right<00:01:30.450> here

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
easy add a pressure plate right here

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.380 
easy add a pressure plate right here
down<00:01:31.619> here<00:01:31.680> place<00:01:32.340> two<00:01:32.610> blocks<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.090> two

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
down here place two blocks and two

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.390 
down here place two blocks and two
powered<00:01:33.750> rails<00:01:33.960> right<00:01:34.229> here<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:35.040> powered

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
powered rails right here this powered

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.520 
powered rails right here this powered
rail<00:01:35.520> will<00:01:35.700> automatically<00:01:36.570> be<00:01:36.780> diagonal

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
rail will automatically be diagonal

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.410 
rail will automatically be diagonal
because<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.130> power<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.880> regular<00:01:39.270> rail

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
because of this power this regular rail

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.539 
because of this power this regular rail
right<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.560> need<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.860> add<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> block

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
torch on the side of the block like this

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.700 
torch on the side of the block like this
so<00:01:54.540> you're<00:01:54.869> actually<00:01:55.020> done<00:01:55.350> with<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> bottle

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
so you're actually done with the bottle

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.380 
so you're actually done with the bottle
level<00:01:56.070> when<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.430> step<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:57.030> minecart

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
level when you step on this a minecart

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.179 
level when you step on this a minecart
will<00:01:57.570> dispense<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.799> powered<00:01:59.040> wheel

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
will dispense and that powered wheel

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.620 
will dispense and that powered wheel
will<00:01:59.399> turn<00:01:59.430> off<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.060> when<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.210> step<00:02:00.450> off

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
will turn off and when you step off

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.469 
will turn off and when you step off
powered<00:02:01.140> rail<00:02:01.350> will<00:02:01.530> turn<00:02:01.829> back<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.420> for<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
powered rail will turn back on for the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.660 
powered rail will turn back on for the
ceiling<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.020> simply<00:02:04.350> need<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.560> add<00:02:04.710> hoppers

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
ceiling you simply need to add hoppers

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.910 
ceiling you simply need to add hoppers
going<00:02:06.570> all<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.810> way<00:02:06.840> up<00:02:06.899> like<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.680> over

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
going all the way up like this and over

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.010 
going all the way up like this and over
here<00:02:08.190> make<00:02:09.179> sure<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.629> hoppers<00:02:09.899> are

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
here make sure that the hoppers are

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.869 
here make sure that the hoppers are
facing<00:02:10.379> into<00:02:10.649> each<00:02:10.770> other<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.430> items<00:02:11.730> will

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
facing into each other so the items will

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.460 
facing into each other so the items will
flow<00:02:12.060> through<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.569> you

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
flow through and you

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.200 
flow through and you
to<00:02:13.710> place<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:14.010> block<00:02:14.250> right<00:02:14.430> here<00:02:14.880> block<00:02:15.060> of

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
to place a block right here block of

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.910 
to place a block right here block of
sand<00:02:15.390> on<00:02:15.570> top<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:16.020> cactus<00:02:16.380> on<00:02:16.500> top<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.800> that

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
sand on top and a cactus on top of that

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.280 
sand on top and a cactus on top of that
and<00:02:17.160> then<00:02:17.910> your<00:02:18.120> minecart<00:02:18.600> track<00:02:18.690> will<00:02:19.140> just

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
and then your minecart track will just

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.080 
and then your minecart track will just
come<00:02:19.470> into<00:02:19.620> here<00:02:19.980> hit<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.490> characters<00:02:20.880> and

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
come into here hit the characters and

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.490 
come into here hit the characters and
you'll<00:02:21.330> be<00:02:21.450> pushed<00:02:21.720> off<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.140> minecart

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
you'll be pushed off and the minecart

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.720 
you'll be pushed off and the minecart
will<00:02:22.620> be<00:02:22.710> collected<00:02:23.070> back<00:02:23.220> into<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
will be collected back into the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.630 
will be collected back into the
dispenser<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.920> final<00:02:25.920> step<00:02:26.070> is<00:02:26.220> just<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.490> make

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
dispenser and final step is just to make

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.460 
dispenser and final step is just to make
it<00:02:26.670> look<00:02:26.790> nicer<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.510> like<00:02:27.840> flattening<00:02:28.260> out<00:02:28.320> the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
it look nicer I like flattening out the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.680 
it look nicer I like flattening out the
ceiling<00:02:28.800> up<00:02:28.920> here<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.790> can<00:02:29.940> add<00:02:30.090> some<00:02:30.360> details

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
ceiling up here you can add some details

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.080 
ceiling up here you can add some details
if<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:30.960> like<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.440> that's<00:02:32.400> pretty<00:02:32.610> much<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.910> so
