00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
make orange and then finally I'm going

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.010 
make orange and then finally I'm going

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
with the remaining Department you could

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.249 
with the remaining Department you could
also<00:01:57.030> make<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.329> bunch<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.689> different<00:01:57.990> colors

also make a bunch of different colors
but<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.439> just<00:01:58.680> chose<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.189> stick<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.700> these<00:01:59.909> six

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
but I just chose to stick to these six

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.350 
but I just chose to stick to these six
ones<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.630> have<00:02:00.840> here<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:02.030> now<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.090> actually

start<00:02:03.689> making<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.110> gummies<00:02:04.409> I'm<00:02:04.560> going<00:02:04.829> to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
start making the gummies I'm going to

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.830 
start making the gummies I'm going to
put<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> cookie<00:02:05.520> cutter<00:02:05.700> into<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.180> sugar<00:02:06.509> part

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
put a cookie cutter into the sugar part

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.449 
put a cookie cutter into the sugar part
and<00:02:07.079> then<00:02:07.560> I'm<00:02:07.649> just<00:02:07.710> going<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.009> add<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> few

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
and then I'm just going to add a few

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.730 
and then I'm just going to add a few
drops<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.300> color

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
drops of the color

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.280 
drops of the color
to<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.610> cookie<00:02:10.910> cutter<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.900> can<00:02:12.080> see<00:02:12.200> you

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
to the cookie cutter and you can see you

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.410 
to the cookie cutter and you can see you
get<00:02:12.440> this<00:02:12.530> really<00:02:12.770> cute<00:02:13.070> shape<00:02:13.370> then<00:02:14.090> just<00:02:14.300> let

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
get this really cute shape then just let

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.940 
get this really cute shape then just let
that<00:02:14.540> sit<00:02:14.780> for<00:02:14.990> a<00:02:15.020> few<00:02:15.080> seconds<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:15.740> then<00:02:15.890> you

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
that sit for a few seconds and then you

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.560 
that sit for a few seconds and then you
can<00:02:16.040> go<00:02:16.280> ahead<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.490> pop<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.880> out<00:02:18.460> and<00:02:19.460> here<00:02:20.450> you

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
can go ahead and pop it out and here you

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.510 
can go ahead and pop it out and here you
can<00:02:20.750> see<00:02:20.930> up<00:02:21.140> close<00:02:21.170> how<00:02:21.590> nice<00:02:21.860> this<00:02:22.040> comes<00:02:22.310> out

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
can see up close how nice this comes out

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.670 
can see up close how nice this comes out
I<00:02:22.700> have<00:02:23.180> no<00:02:23.360> idea<00:02:23.600> how<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:23.870> works<00:02:24.140> but<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:24.470> just

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
I have no idea how this works but I just

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.830 
I have no idea how this works but I just
think<00:02:24.860> that<00:02:24.950> is<00:02:25.100> really<00:02:25.220> cool<00:02:25.490> so<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:26.540> can<00:02:26.690> see

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
think that is really cool so you can see

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.600 
think that is really cool so you can see
our<00:02:26.990> cute<00:02:27.230> little<00:02:27.260> flower<00:02:27.620> we've<00:02:27.830> made<00:02:28.040> then

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
our cute little flower we've made then

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.680 
our cute little flower we've made then
you're<00:02:28.730> just<00:02:28.850> going<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.000> go<00:02:29.120> ahead<00:02:29.240> and<00:02:29.450> repeat

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
you're just going to go ahead and repeat

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.240 
you're just going to go ahead and repeat
this<00:02:29.870> for<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.230> rest<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.680> cookie<00:02:30.920> cutters

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
this for the rest of the cookie cutters

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.500 
this for the rest of the cookie cutters
so<00:02:32.000> here<00:02:32.180> I'm<00:02:32.300> just<00:02:32.510> making<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.930> carrot<00:02:34.510> here

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
so here I'm just making a carrot here

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.840 
so here I'm just making a carrot here
I'm<00:02:35.690> also<00:02:35.870> making<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.380> rabbit<00:02:36.830> so<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:37.490> can<00:02:37.670> see

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
I'm also making a rabbit so you can see

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.430 
I'm also making a rabbit so you can see
I<00:02:37.880> just<00:02:37.970> added<00:02:38.270> a<00:02:38.480> bunch<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:38.930> different<00:02:39.170> colors

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
I just added a bunch of different colors

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.060 
I just added a bunch of different colors
and<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.620> think<00:02:39.800> that<00:02:39.950> turns<00:02:40.190> out<00:02:40.340> really<00:02:40.580> nicely

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.510 

and<00:02:47.290> then<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.380> tried<00:02:48.590> using<00:02:48.740> my<00:02:49.010> own<00:02:49.160> cookie

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
and then I tried using my own cookie

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.070 
and then I tried using my own cookie
cutters<00:02:49.790> for<00:02:49.910> this<00:02:50.030> as<00:02:50.150> well<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.930> found

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
cutters for this as well and I found

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.980 
cutters for this as well and I found
that<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.380> worked<00:02:51.530> just<00:02:51.650> fine<00:02:52.420> so<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.540> can<00:02:53.720> see

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
that it worked just fine so you can see

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.630 
that it worked just fine so you can see
I<00:02:54.020> just<00:02:54.230> use<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.680> little<00:02:54.830> rabbit<00:02:55.310> one<00:02:55.430> that<00:02:55.610> I

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
I just use a little rabbit one that I

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.350 
I just use a little rabbit one that I
have<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:57.410> it<00:02:58.280> turns<00:02:58.490> are<00:02:58.640> really<00:02:58.940> cute<00:02:59.210> as

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
have and it turns are really cute as

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.320 
have and it turns are really cute as
well<00:03:00.130> another<00:03:01.130> way<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.340> do<00:03:01.550> this<00:03:01.700> is<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.090> push

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
well another way to do this is to push

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.450 
well another way to do this is to push
all<00:03:02.510> these<00:03:02.690> sugar<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.230> side<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:03.770> then<00:03:04.340> go

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
all these sugar to the side and then go

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.980 
all these sugar to the side and then go
ahead<00:03:04.580> and<00:03:04.730> spoon<00:03:05.060> it<00:03:05.090> inside<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:05.720> cookie

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
ahead and spoon it inside the cookie

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.050 
ahead and spoon it inside the cookie
cutter<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.470> then<00:03:07.220> I<00:03:07.250> added<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.580> drops<00:03:07.880> in

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
cutter and then I added the drops in

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.520 
cutter and then I added the drops in
there<00:03:08.270> and<00:03:08.480> this<00:03:08.630> helps<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.990> make<00:03:09.020> a<00:03:09.290> nice<00:03:09.470> neat

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
there and this helps to make a nice neat

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.570 
there and this helps to make a nice neat
shape<00:03:11.350> so<00:03:12.350> I<00:03:12.380> use<00:03:12.560> whatever<00:03:12.740> method<00:03:13.220> you<00:03:13.250> want

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
shape so I use whatever method you want

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.000 
shape so I use whatever method you want
I<00:03:13.790> think<00:03:13.970> that<00:03:14.090> they<00:03:14.180> both<00:03:14.390> work<00:03:14.660> fine<00:03:16.390> and

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
I think that they both work fine and

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.560 
I think that they both work fine and
that's<00:03:19.010> basically<00:03:19.430> it<00:03:19.580> so<00:03:19.880> you<00:03:20.210> just<00:03:20.240> go<00:03:20.450> ahead

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
that's basically it so you just go ahead

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.910 
that's basically it so you just go ahead
and<00:03:20.840> create<00:03:20.960> the<00:03:21.230> rest<00:03:21.350> of<00:03:21.470> your<00:03:21.590> gummies

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
and create the rest of your gummies

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.230 
and create the rest of your gummies
until<00:03:22.220> you<00:03:22.280> run<00:03:22.430> out<00:03:22.490> of<00:03:22.640> either<00:03:22.850> sugar

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
until you run out of either sugar

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.140 
until you run out of either sugar
solution<00:03:23.750> or<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.170> coloring<00:03:24.470> solution<00:03:25.150> so
