00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
especially the Fox because they can't

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.380 
especially the Fox because they can't
really<00:02:04.440> eat<00:02:04.680> foods<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.280> are<00:02:05.550> low<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.180> protein

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
just won't eat as much of it usually if

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.509 
just won't eat as much of it usually if
I<00:02:25.380> put<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.830> floor<00:02:26.040> like<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.370> you

I put it on the floor like this you

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:32.390 
I put it on the floor like this you
won't<00:02:26.670> even<00:02:26.790> try<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:30.560> but<00:02:31.560> here<00:02:31.950> you'll<00:02:32.130> see

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
won't even try it but here you'll see

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:51.070 
won't even try it but here you'll see
he'll<00:02:32.940> just<00:02:33.090> keep<00:02:33.299> eating<00:02:33.420> away

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:03:19.730 

fell<00:02:51.680> for<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:52.220> like<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.400> don't<00:02:52.730> you

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.170 

I<00:03:20.450> always<00:03:21.450> wondered<00:03:21.900> why<00:03:22.250> cats<00:03:23.250> clean

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
I always wondered why cats clean

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.600 
I always wondered why cats clean
themselves<00:03:24.360> after<00:03:25.020> they<00:03:25.170> eat<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:26.310> looked

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
themselves after they eat and I looked

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.310 
themselves after they eat and I looked
it<00:03:26.730> up<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.940> few<00:03:27.150> years<00:03:27.360> ago<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:27.900> found<00:03:28.080> out

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
it up a few years ago and I found out

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.070 
it up a few years ago and I found out
it's<00:03:28.530> because<00:03:28.620> in<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.730> wild<00:03:29.940> they<00:03:30.600> don't<00:03:30.840> want

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
it's because in the wild they don't want

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.530 
it's because in the wild they don't want
other<00:03:31.380> animals<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:32.100> smell<00:03:32.490> the<00:03:32.970> food<00:03:33.180> on<00:03:33.360> them

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
other animals to smell the food on them

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.870 
other animals to smell the food on them
and<00:03:33.720> be<00:03:33.810> able<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.080> track<00:03:34.350> them<00:03:34.530> down<00:03:34.700> so<00:03:35.700> it's

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
and be able to track them down so it's

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.080 
and be able to track them down so it's
kind<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.150> how<00:03:36.300> they<00:03:36.500> stay<00:03:37.500> hidden<00:03:37.710> from<00:03:38.190> other

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
kind of how they stay hidden from other

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.480 
kind of how they stay hidden from other
animals<00:03:39.510> who<00:03:39.600> might<00:03:39.780> try<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:39.990> eat<00:03:40.110> them

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
animals who might try to eat them

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.350 
animals who might try to eat them
obviously<00:03:41.490> you<00:03:41.910> won't<00:03:42.000> have<00:03:42.180> that<00:03:42.210> problem

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
obviously you won't have that problem

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.900 
obviously you won't have that problem
here<00:03:42.930> in<00:03:43.020> a<00:03:43.080> house<00:03:43.230> but<00:03:43.800> you<00:03:44.070> were<00:03:44.610> running

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
here in a house but you were running

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.950 
here in a house but you were running
around<00:03:45.030> out<00:03:45.300> in<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.450> wild<00:03:45.750> we<00:03:45.840> would<00:03:47.870> so<00:03:48.870> they

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
around out in the wild we would so they

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.540 
around out in the wild we would so they
usually<00:03:49.110> get<00:03:49.470> all<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.710> smells<00:03:50.010> off<00:03:50.250> of<00:03:50.430> them

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
usually get all the smells off of them

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:57.170 
usually get all the smells off of them
