 leaves to the trees and we are 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.140
 hair falls something that affects both 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.640

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.840
 we in Madrid today, you know 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.190

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.570
 treatments so that they do not suffer this 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.360
 problem or at least if they have it 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.440
 be as small as possible 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.480
 we have sent and I think that calm that 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.000
 I'm watching live is the leo leo 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.620
 I had this box that was going 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.090
 to tell me that I was going to finish the day that 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.250
 I was going to end the day by clicking on what 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.809
 What do you call cardboard? Yes, I already have 41 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.250
 years and hey look, it's already clarifying truth 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.930
 that you see there, Álvarez is giving the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.400
 good plane of my crown good I'm 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.600
 with Dr. Martín from the clinic 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.759
 french drag and let's see 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.490
 is clicking, I'm not mistaken 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.650
 vitamins to revitalize my hair go 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.780
 yes to stimulate the follicles that 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.400
 they are still with good vitality but 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.049
 you have to revitalize it I have something of 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.149
 live hair up there is a lot of hair 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.100
 I live and can only be done in this 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.930
 stage because if it's in a phase in the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.729
 that the follicle is already atrophied 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.009
 we can revitalize you stay there 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.170
 thinking that by the way you click very 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.369
 well this does not hurt anything I have to 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.899
 tell 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.180
 Well the truth is that it is not hurting me 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.100
 nothing and is here very well and today 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.990
 true the doctor is doing this 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.149
 you with vitamins but you can do 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.039
 with blood can be done with plasma has 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.569
 Won time but almost 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.950
 it also lends me to take blood 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.170
 put simply looks not tell me everything 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.179
 have it go if it 's the technique of 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.000
 Platelet-rich plasma draws blood 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.619
 the patient is centrifuged and the part 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.569
 transparent that is the plasma there 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.240
 we take out what are the factors of 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.580
 platelet regeneration this more 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.289
 in men than in women, of course, not in 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.090
 platelets go better in women 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.890
 but it's not done in both sexes but the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.869
 result is better in women who do not 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.130
 are output that the unit is part 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.080
 maradona but 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.400
 in the image and the missing images there 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.290
 when this is while they are 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.920
 piercing the skull you with the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.920
 microphone like this 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.290
 I have a good question result in 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.970
 how much time are we going to write down that this 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.360
 it works and that gives us advice 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.700
 feeding so that the hair grows 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.930
 fundamental the doctor me how many times 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.400
 I have to do this treatment for 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.110
 that this I begin to see results 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.820
 because the first sessions are convenient 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.190
 make them one a week the first the 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.770
 second after every 15 days until 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.450
 let's see that there is a started 15 days each 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.340
 15 days until one appreciates 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.860
 decrease in hair loss and 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.690
 after a maintenance once a year 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.430
 well, once a month once a month 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.650
 Well, the doctor told me before 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.720
 this connection does not spend too much stress 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.920
 do not smoke take care that you do not give us 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.110
 too much sun in the head are 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.930
 advice that we have to save and for 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.430
 true by the way autumn I know there's 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.050
 a lot of hair but not us 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.580
 worry that is normal when 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.990
 we see a lot a lot a lot of hair yes 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.540
 we have to go to one of these 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.790
 clinics today not and if you hear if you drop the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.930
 hair well that nothing happens either 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.930
 nothing good is missing
