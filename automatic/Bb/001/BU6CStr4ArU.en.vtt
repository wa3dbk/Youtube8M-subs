00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 I think I do not approve many 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.120
 projects during the year and then when 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:12.059
 I realize many are the 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.889
 favorites so much that I had to start 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.320
 with the products of the skin 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.080
 you know to start on my skin is 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.699
 of mixed fat since I do them the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.490
 videos I like to try new products 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.830
 constantly and that includes also the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.560
 of the skin, although it makes me a 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.660
 bit difficult being that once 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.700
 think I'm used to something I do not like 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.960
 take it out of your routine but I do it for 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.420
 you so it is that so that they see in 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.520
 how much I sacrifice myself do not create the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.010
 First of all, I want to show you this 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.500
 of wave fruit of neutrogena that follows 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.719
 liking this and what is the scrum that 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.030
 it's like the pair fascinates me this line 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.910
 It is excellent for the skin that is 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.789
 prone acne I was using the yellow 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.860
 of this and I liked it but not as much as 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.870
 I really feel that I do not feel 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.250
 that helped me so much more than the other 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.500
 apart from that the other felt that I 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.080
 He left his face super stretched after 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.949
 for a while it contains salicylic acid 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.810
 to see the mornings 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.820
 for the aroma I feel that wakes me up 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.729
 I feel that smells delicious america and I 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.070
 very much like it is a cleansing cream 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.409
 they 'll make fun of it because it 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.409
 flame cream and when you apply it 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.280
 It feels like a cream but it's 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.530
 transparent is like it's my 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.630
 solution in this texture for skins 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.210
 fats soy is not here she has the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.670
 of dry skin you are dry skin and that 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.770
 if it's like cream and I did not feel that 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.219
 I left like I do not know how to like me 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.630
 I left grease on my face and I thought that 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:38.280
 It was going to be very different but the truth 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.319
 is that they did it differently for 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.509
 every skin type so that's what I 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.459
 does very very well from medicaid other 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.009
 cleaner and this if it looks like cream 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:48.990
 when you open it, it surprised me a lot 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.939
 much liked me because as 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.939
 I say to me I almost do not like them but 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.280
 this one does not leave me that feeling like I do not know 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.369
 how sticky as what kind you can not 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.099
 rinse and it has some microspheres 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.470
 I kind of like they expose you but they are not for 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:06.720
 nothing abrasive contains an ingredient 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.729
 which is called descents today I'm not 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.289
 sure as it is said in Spanish something that 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.709
 help that ingredient is 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.560
 skin looks more full of light and what 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.299
 I have been using for almost three months now 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.120
 especially when I have to remove 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.069
 makeup and that brings me to the next 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.650
 what is this cream that is the same 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.269
 line and together really we thought 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.849
 that neither the one that I would like the most 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.370
 when I touched it with my fingers and felt 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.890
 that it was like enough moisturizer 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.900
 but I decided to use it because as I 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.540
 I say prevents stains other than that 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.370
 contains the spf 15 so I started it 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.470
 to use just to get out and to 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.930
 put it under my makeup and that 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.569
 believe girls I started to like it so much that 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.459
 I really have not stopped using that 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.980
 take my next favorite because 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.129
 there is the cream that does not contain oils 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.989
 it was my favorite in the summer already for 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.019
 put me down my makeup 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.290
 during what is now the cold season already 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.959
 I did not like it 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.790
 too much mars then this was 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.730
 perfect for summer the truth but 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.610
 this has been what I have been using 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.440
 all winter since it started 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.900
 that has made a difference 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.430
 makeup because I felt that my skin with 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.670
 this new way the skin as well as 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.560
 quartered and me as well as what the fuck 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.210
 it's happening because I lost my skin 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.190
 but I just changed the moisturizer 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.110
 what he was using but what he has 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.330
 made nothing difference in what is my 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.670
 skin tone and I really have a lot 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.850
 problem with that because thanks to acne 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.920
 I suffer a lot of spots and scars 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.140
 so I have to put a lot 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.330
 effort to fade those because as 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.590
 you know these are enough videos 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.450
 to get rid of her 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.430
 the first is to be listening to 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.739
 a lot of people who speak wonders of 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.350
 this cream and it contains retinol and 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.690
 girls , I've run out of a bottle and this is 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.000
 a new one I can not tell you what 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.489
 amazing how it feels my skin is 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.010
 it's only for night use for me 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.230
 has made a world of difference 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.010
 first day my skin woke up like that 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.530
 with a brightness like it is not exceeded if 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.630
 is that this mega recommended is 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.910
 next is this one that is called by the 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.090
 panismo strasser and also used it 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.470
 night because it contains water yes 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.000
 late but I prefer not to risk it and 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.550
 use it at night because it can stain you 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.860
 the face if I do not know if you are very exposed 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.350
 The sun says it reduces the appearance of 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.510
 pores and that leaves your skin much softer 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.150
 and that's really the reason why 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.370
 I liked another favorite has been this 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.860
 joint green lotion may like that 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.040
 this is to apply in the granites that 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.970
 they are going like this and I do it with a 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.350
 I promise you and then if I 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.870
 are coming out if I feel that I am 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.150
 coming out a granite I put it like that left it 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.919
 in the night and the next day is ready 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.530
 so that as who says only 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.660
 clean grease no other product 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.450
 that I have tried makes that the truth is 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.490
 that start to dry up they start like this 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.950
 like you have to wear not all 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.260
 days and I loved it because it works 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.360
 from one day to another better that was that I 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.310
 loved discovering it in 2014 I have 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.410
 also for you what are the 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.330
 favorites in terms of makeup by 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.729
 course they can not miss and also 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.470
 lose of products that hate the 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.130
 2014 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.130
 suddenly
