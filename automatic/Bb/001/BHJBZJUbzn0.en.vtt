write my review for the app because when

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.320 
write my review for the app because when
you<00:03:06.030> try<00:03:06.240> it'll<00:03:06.600> say<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:07.880> know<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.150> don't

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
you try it'll say you know it you don't

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.210 
you try it'll say you know it you don't
own<00:03:09.420> this<00:03:09.600> app<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.900> can't<00:03:10.080> do<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.320> but<00:03:11.040> it'll

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
own this app you can't do it but it'll

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.740 
own this app you can't do it but it'll
pretend<00:03:11.640> like<00:03:11.850> when<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.120> go<00:03:12.240> do<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.420> in<00:03:12.630> the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
pretend like when you go do it in the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.150 
pretend like when you go do it in the
app<00:03:12.870> store<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.140> say<00:03:13.380> you<00:03:13.440> know<00:03:13.560> installed<00:03:13.920> but

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
app store and say you know installed but

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.260 
app store and say you know installed but
when<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.310> try<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.460> write<00:03:14.610> a<00:03:14.670> review<00:03:14.880> it'll<00:03:15.150> say

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
when you try to write a review it'll say

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.760 
when you try to write a review it'll say
you<00:03:15.300> don't<00:03:15.510> own<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:15.930> that's<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.620> only

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
you don't own it so that's the only

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.860 
you don't own it so that's the only
downside<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.580> you<00:03:18.270> might<00:03:18.420> have<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.600> wait<00:03:18.750> like

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
downside and you might have to wait like

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.230 
downside and you might have to wait like
