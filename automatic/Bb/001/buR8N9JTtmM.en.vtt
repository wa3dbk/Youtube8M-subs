be frayed over time so a really good
thing<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.569> do<00:02:10.980> is<00:02:11.980> actually<00:02:12.310> replace<00:02:13.769> the

lot of time the robot will be sometimes

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.720 
lot of time the robot will be sometimes
it<00:02:41.319> will<00:02:41.410> work<00:02:41.680> it'll<00:02:41.950> be<00:02:42.099> intermittent<00:02:42.610> and

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
it will work it'll be intermittent and

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.789 
it will work it'll be intermittent and
that's<00:02:43.510> due<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.870> short<00:02:44.290> in<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.470> embel

that's due to a short in the embel

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.699 
that's due to a short in the embel
achill<00:02:45.099> connecting<00:02:45.670> these<00:02:46.470> limit<00:02:47.470> switches

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
achill connecting these limit switches

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.520 
achill connecting these limit switches
and<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:50.700> it's<00:02:51.700> really<00:02:51.870> inconsistent<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.290> gets

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
and so it's really inconsistent and gets

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.259 
and so it's really inconsistent and gets
annoying<00:02:53.860> it's<00:02:54.280> hard<00:02:54.459> to<00:02:54.489> troubleshoot<00:02:54.849> and

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
annoying it's hard to troubleshoot and

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.900 
annoying it's hard to troubleshoot and
find<00:02:55.480> out<00:02:55.660> so<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:56.400> find<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:57.549> it's<00:02:57.700> just

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
find out so I find that it's just

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.360 
find out so I find that it's just
