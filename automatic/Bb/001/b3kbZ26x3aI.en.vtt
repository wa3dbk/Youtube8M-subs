a<00:01:25.560> six<00:01:25.799> minute<00:01:26.130> workout<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.600> does<00:01:27.869> it

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
a six minute workout and it does it

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.810 
a six minute workout and it does it
automatically<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:29.130> neuroscience

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
automatically it's like neuroscience

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.359 
automatically it's like neuroscience
muscle<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:30.960> easy<00:01:31.380> people<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.250> first

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
muscle so easy people do this the first

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.950 
muscle so easy people do this the first
time<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.850> they<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.030> no<00:01:33.270> problem<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:33.930> it

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
time and they have no problem with it

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.719 
time and they have no problem with it
and<00:01:34.259> as<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.590> saw<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.009> animation<00:01:35.579> it

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
and as you saw in that animation it

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.890
