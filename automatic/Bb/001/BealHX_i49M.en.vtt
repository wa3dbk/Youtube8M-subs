00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.750 
well one thing I like to do when I'm
explaining<00:00:39.960> wetsuits<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.980> take<00:00:41.309> one<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
explaining wetsuits is take one of the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.400 
explaining wetsuits is take one of the
styles<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.270> flip<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.600> inside<00:00:42.899> out

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
styles and flip it inside out

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.830 
styles and flip it inside out
there's<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.070> lot<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.640> make<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.149> inside<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
there's a lot of make on the inside and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.380 
there's a lot of make on the inside and
you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.200> see<00:00:46.530> exactly<00:00:46.920> what<00:00:47.610> construction<00:00:48.239> is

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
you can see exactly what construction is

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.090 
you can see exactly what construction is
going<00:00:48.450> into<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.200> what<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.829> use<00:00:50.070> for

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
going into it what we use for

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.209 
going into it what we use for
construction<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.390> split<00:00:51.809> neoprene<00:00:52.260> gate<00:00:52.680> it

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
construction is a split neoprene gate it

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.000 
construction is a split neoprene gate it
holds<00:00:53.579> up<00:00:53.670> great<00:00:53.699> under<00:00:54.360> UV<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.680> stretch

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
holds up great under UV and the stretch

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.279 
holds up great under UV and the stretch
is<00:00:56.190> amazing<00:00:56.480> super<00:00:57.480> consistent<00:00:57.840> with<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
is amazing super consistent with the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.549 
is amazing super consistent with the
materials<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.570> addition<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.199> our

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
materials in addition to that in our

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.009 
materials in addition to that in our
chest<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.039> back<00:01:02.250> panel<00:01:02.760> we<00:01:03.149> utilize<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> hollow

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
chest and back panel we utilize a hollow

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.590 
chest and back panel we utilize a hollow
fiber<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:05.280> has<00:01:05.489> an<00:01:05.670> engineered<00:01:06.180> jacquard

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
fiber that has an engineered jacquard

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.560 
fiber that has an engineered jacquard
print<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.439> what<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.799> does<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.790> helps<00:01:08.820> wick

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
print so what that does is it helps wick

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.289 
print so what that does is it helps wick
water<00:01:09.960> away<00:01:10.350> from<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.770> body<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.850> other<00:01:12.030> thing

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
water away from the body the other thing

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.300 
water away from the body the other thing
to<00:01:12.450> call<00:01:12.630> out<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> interior<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.920> what

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
to call out on the interior is what

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.070 
to call out on the interior is what
we're<00:01:14.490> doing<00:01:14.790> for<00:01:15.030> our<00:01:15.060> wrist<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.540> leg<00:01:15.720> cuffs

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
we're doing for our wrist and leg cuffs

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.410 
we're doing for our wrist and leg cuffs
we're<00:01:16.710> using<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.189> liquid<00:01:17.460> tape<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.180> really

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
we're using this liquid tape to really

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.780 
we're using this liquid tape to really
anchor<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.960> cuffs<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.439> stabilize<00:01:20.310> them

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
anchor the cuffs and stabilize them

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.600 
anchor the cuffs and stabilize them
we<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.659> breaks<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> liquid<00:01:22.710> neoprene<00:01:23.100> so

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
we have breaks in the liquid neoprene so

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.090 
we have breaks in the liquid neoprene so
that<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:23.909> easy<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.210> get<00:01:24.450> into<00:01:24.920> but<00:01:25.920> then

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
that it's easy to get into but then

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.859 
that it's easy to get into but then
they're<00:01:26.250> also<00:01:26.430> very<00:01:26.970> stable<00:01:27.270> when<00:01:27.630> they're<00:01:27.780> in

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
they're also very stable when they're in

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.590 
they're also very stable when they're in
the<00:01:27.990> water<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:29.159> next<00:01:29.460> we<00:01:29.579> move<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
the water so next we move on to the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.010 
the water so next we move on to the
design<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.259> components<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.070> wetsuit

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
design and the components of the wetsuit

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.100 
design and the components of the wetsuit
first<00:01:34.020> off<00:01:34.290> we've<00:01:34.860> got<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> chest<00:01:35.490> zip<00:01:35.610> closure

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
first off we've got a chest zip closure

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.289 
first off we've got a chest zip closure
the<00:01:37.110> reason<00:01:37.470> we<00:01:37.650> use<00:01:37.680> an<00:01:38.130> open<00:01:38.340> end<00:01:38.729> zipper<00:01:39.000> is

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
the reason we use an open end zipper is

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.090 
the reason we use an open end zipper is
because<00:01:39.840> zippers<00:01:40.229> are<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.650> number<00:01:40.890> one

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
because zippers are the number one

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.630 
because zippers are the number one
repair<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.850> wet<00:01:42.119> suits<00:01:42.590> so<00:01:43.590> by<00:01:43.799> using<00:01:44.040> an<00:01:44.310> open

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
repair in wet suits so by using an open

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.910 
repair in wet suits so by using an open
end<00:01:44.790> zipper<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.140> tell<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.680> zipper

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
end zipper you can tell that the zipper

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.620 
end zipper you can tell that the zipper
is<00:01:47.250> separated

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
is separated

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.050 
is separated
this<00:01:48.960> high<00:01:49.200> stress<00:01:49.590> point<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.880> when

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
this high stress point so that when

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.819 
this high stress point so that when
you're<00:01:51.210> getting<00:01:51.539> in<00:01:51.719> and<00:01:51.899> out<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.380> you're

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
you're getting in and out of it you're

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.069 
you're getting in and out of it you're
putting<00:01:53.100> no<00:01:53.399> pressure<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.149> zipper<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.750> it

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
putting no pressure on the zipper and it

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.859 
putting no pressure on the zipper and it
won't<00:01:55.259> break<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:56.039> addition<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.909> we've

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
won't break in addition to that we've

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.359 
won't break in addition to that we've
engineered<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.619> drawcord

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
engineered a drawcord

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.669 
engineered a drawcord
you<00:01:59.970> could<00:02:00.149> see<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.509> cyan<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.380> black

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
you could see the cyan in the black

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.830 
you could see the cyan in the black
these<00:02:02.130> are<00:02:02.189> two<00:02:02.520> different<00:02:02.700> materials<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.600> so

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
these are two different materials and so

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.020 
these are two different materials and so
what<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.110> does<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.130> holds<00:02:05.369> up<00:02:05.640> great

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
what that does is it holds up great

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.660 
what that does is it holds up great
under<00:02:06.539> pressure<00:02:06.570> with<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.470> barrel<00:02:07.860> lock<00:02:08.069> one<00:02:08.640> of

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
under pressure with a barrel lock one of

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.759 
under pressure with a barrel lock one of
the<00:02:08.789> best<00:02:09.090> things<00:02:09.450> about<00:02:09.599> this<00:02:09.959> wetsuit<00:02:10.530> is

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
the best things about this wetsuit is

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.670 
the best things about this wetsuit is
really<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.400> seam<00:02:11.640> placement<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:13.260> seams

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
really the seam placement and so seams

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.770 
really the seam placement and so seams
don't<00:02:14.040> stretch<00:02:14.340> as<00:02:14.519> much<00:02:14.730> as<00:02:14.910> materials<00:02:15.540> and

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
don't stretch as much as materials and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.110 
don't stretch as much as materials and
so<00:02:16.200> what<00:02:16.410> we<00:02:16.530> try<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.800> do<00:02:17.069> is<00:02:17.370> put<00:02:17.670> all<00:02:17.849> of<00:02:17.880> the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
so what we try to do is put all of the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.930 
so what we try to do is put all of the
seams<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.630> compression<00:02:19.170> zones<00:02:19.440> if<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:20.730> look

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
seams and compression zones if you look

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.390 
seams and compression zones if you look
at<00:02:21.150> any<00:02:21.450> wetsuit<00:02:22.049> on<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.319> market<00:02:22.769> you'll<00:02:23.160> see

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
at any wetsuit on the market you'll see

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.280 
at any wetsuit on the market you'll see
that<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.790> has<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.000> steam<00:02:24.540> going<00:02:24.930> straight

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
that it has a steam going straight

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.130 
that it has a steam going straight
across<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.830> shoulder<00:02:26.220> blade<00:02:26.459> right<00:02:26.700> here<00:02:27.140> so

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
across the shoulder blade right here so

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.710 
across the shoulder blade right here so
what<00:02:28.319> we<00:02:28.470> did<00:02:28.650> was<00:02:28.950> we<00:02:29.549> designed<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.090> seam<00:02:30.420> to

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
what we did was we designed the seam to

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.500 
what we did was we designed the seam to
go<00:02:31.019> around<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.650> shoulder<00:02:32.010> blade<00:02:32.510> continued

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
go around the shoulder blade continued

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.850 
go around the shoulder blade continued
underneath<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.650> underarm<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:36.830> have<00:02:37.830> a

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
underneath the underarm and have a

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.640 
underneath the underarm and have a
closing<00:02:38.220> team<00:02:38.580> right<00:02:38.880> here<00:02:39.349> so<00:02:40.349> what<00:02:40.500> that

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
closing team right here so what that

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.009 
closing team right here so what that
does<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.310> allows<00:02:41.519> for<00:02:42.120> full<00:02:42.360> range<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.840> motion

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
does it allows for full range of motion

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.380 
does it allows for full range of motion
when<00:02:43.410> you're<00:02:43.590> paddling<00:02:43.799> because<00:02:44.640> we<00:02:45.209> have

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
when you're paddling because we have

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.210 
when you're paddling because we have
expansion<00:02:46.049> areas<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.680> back<00:02:46.860> and

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
expansion areas in the back and

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.520 
expansion areas in the back and
compression<00:02:48.030> areas<00:02:48.360> in<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.630> front<00:02:48.810> in

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
compression areas in the front in

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.140 
compression areas in the front in
addition<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.280> closing<00:02:50.549> seen<00:02:50.880> being

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
addition to the closing seen being

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.539 
addition to the closing seen being
placed<00:02:51.480> on<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.810> front<00:02:52.110> we<00:02:52.769> also<00:02:52.950> took<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.400> look

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
this back panel right here wraps all the

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.520 
this back panel right here wraps all the
way<00:02:59.609> to<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.940> front<00:03:00.150> area<00:03:00.540> right<00:03:00.780> here<00:03:01.200> what

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
way to the front area right here what

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.670 
way to the front area right here what
that<00:03:01.709> does<00:03:02.040> is<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.910> really<00:03:02.940> addresses<00:03:03.900> your
