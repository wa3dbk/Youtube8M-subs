00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.369
 and that is that we wanted to live in a privileged area and we do not have money to 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:14.509
 now to live there because he rent or buy a house in that 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.270
 sector where we wanted to live put anette k very high and we could not 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.339
 face it 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.039
 then commissions a wood 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.010
 Well look at alternatives this is a good alternative 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.510
 It is true that now he is very happy because we have a house where we wanted 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.210
 live 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.080
 i at the price of laughter 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.080
 of laughter another that could catch 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.160
 240 appreciated by the square meter in the area with the mets 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.220
 April 4 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.360
 109 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.810
 around a thousand euros 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.469
 less than 20 million 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.920
 On the other hand, other aspects 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.130
 15 15 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.370
 sagarra teaching 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.340
 h 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.650
 it seems complicated to participate 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.960
 not at all 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.879
 and more if you take a person a consultant who informs you of everything obama 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.239
 with him and knows exactly the people the steps that he will have to give for 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.290
 nothing the president estimated 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.220
 by the way, it's fun 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.700
 because the price bid the born forward that was not out of time so that 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.649
 I was the person who 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.200
 where I want to bid is to say she nobody loves you 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.320
 a minimum 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.190
 and at that minimum you play about the amount you want you do not want 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.920
 to participate placed more fun to involve me good direct way in my 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.579
 house says 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.789
 I want dead such a limit love well gives the circumstances of the bidding already 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.880
 I say I want it or invest a little more as I invest less than I 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.050
 are trying I already knew that existed 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.020
 I had to appear like this 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.810
 this public pact as the 3ds as investment yes 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.940
 interesting and 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.610
 you get profitable because for less than what you would pay if you want it 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.620
 particularly to another person 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.620
 and I had much harder still 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.770
 but the cicr need cash 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.940
 I need you to whom you will vote 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.030
 relevant document to be able to constitute mortgages 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.269
 did not clarify if it is an investment to anyone who takes profit 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.649
 with those quotes cash the director pete docter 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:17.829
 the only problem is clear that the result obtained is not like that 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.829
 yes i would do it again 

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:24.169
