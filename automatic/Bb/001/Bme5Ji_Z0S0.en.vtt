00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.469
 W 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.109
 people have been protesting 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:14.279
 comments on youtube channel showing quite 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.820
 someone talked about the elimination really the nation was still with the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.409
 impasse 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:24.149
 I was to put together a tutorial underline how to make a sport dominate your 

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:24.939
 blog 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.159
 I just could not even call 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.369
 is with material needed to make 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.610
 this tutorial 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.590
 but always groups betting this complete real institute for you to ride 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.090
 to your own home 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.020
 in the sport of lighting 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.020
 which helps a lot and the case can not 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.550
 It's provisional plus sale teresa I think it's because it improved 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.720
 I'm here I have a scrap this is a cartridge of paula tries x-men 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.240
 of the ink cartridge 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.500
 and I really like it, try to do nothing 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.510
 the same in my things that I'm building 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.130
 and just hurricane rick decisive furadão 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.400
 here is my bike 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.560
 and heard the little postman argues in the street look how cool the team 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.610
 will deliver 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.500
 a fiscal antenna 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.000
 that there will probably be something similar to the Flemish behind 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.630
 I do not know very well how I'm going to do more 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.800
 with that kind of trash I like to find on the street 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.800
 so also if piece of camouflage 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.510
 a piece of pipe that will move away the next project is from here 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.370
 I think it's very little little time a little 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.290
 had a good one here it's a silly attack from the botafogo that was jumping that the 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.900
 first time there is 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.380
 today with my son 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.470
 if you go on the channel 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.690
 it will be educatoris hugo like to tidy quiquiqui always do something a 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.610
 niche that is the guy 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.440
 Photograph 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.120
 look what I think is unfair because it would mean a lamp 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.910
 Look at the way kids 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.910
 I think I feel very conditioned 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:14.709
 to or with the bolt is what I said twelve trades 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.819
 gets you to pierce the material 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.089
 and now 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.149
 faith does fit that effectively programs 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:26.529
 I'm fed up with the electric welding the first time an antenna over the beam 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:28.949
 the program was perfect 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.219
 but it's okay 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:35.879
 pure here I have a movement that is going to be a movement of his leg 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.129
 and if I want to stop the movement of the ice here 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.139
 the movement stays locked 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.799
 It was very funny when I used the welding machine that when 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.349
 first weld 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.569
 disarmed with the clock and the house stayed in the dark 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:53.839
 and I had to change one on the circuit breaker to be able to use a 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:55.760
 weld because it draws a lot of energy 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.629
 I want it to happen with the right tool. 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:03.799
 I listen very much the people talk about the team in the document are projects 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.810
 determines the fate of this blatant election that people can speak 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.229
 because in the creative process of something you end up inventing another 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:14.840
 hehehehe is this 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.160
 one thing pulls the other and when you see life working on your project 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
 different creating five different things 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:25.779
 Imagine if you took one at a time 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:27.489
 when you create the air project 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.440
 and in the middle of the project when having idea of ​​the bia project 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.480
 for each care project 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.749
 I particularly think it's all very easy. 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:40.079
 My mother and my brother-in-law went to the people who brought me 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.869
 despite having the daughter of dafne 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:45.069
 this respect the environment 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.149
 in the drawing 

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:50.630
 on top of autonomy cessation rafa has a beer 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.509
 It's true. 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:55.529
 it's a shelter I did not drink nor lose a taste of beer 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.069
 No, I'm not a believer. 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.499
 it is not for any religious reason I do not like beer in a merger on board and 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:03.429
 beer 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:05.949
 and it's cool to have a 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:09.709
 a bottle I had a bottle of paint glue 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.709
 in cacoal is a soda that comes from macchu pichu 

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:15.979
 present in turkey 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:20.189
 which is a chl made out of string I do not know why I never 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:22.759
 I gave Pinhão hiking and packing 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:27.300
 the cool thing is that they should go to england because they dedicated yesterday only here 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.720
 which was all concluding with a drawing 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.720
 dunga still traded alan defended inter 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.610
 He'll reach agreement, but again 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.449
 A housemaid working, I think it was that day. 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:41.540
 Yes, certainly 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.009
 opened in cacoal is to import this 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.249
 ef 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:48.620
 education also this shirt 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.050
 and the count 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.120
 blubber 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.779
 all tousled with 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:54.400
 like the accordion 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.870
 I really like ash I think it's 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.059
 the best drawings of the last 20 years 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:02.990
 the most seen on the internet and in other places 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.190
 it is that it has heated up a lot of the way and the most famous ones live complaining that the 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.229
 easy is that source did that so 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:15.860
 not my point of view this is the price you pay for being famous 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:19.809
 elected can no longer be something that everyone wants to win 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:21.810
 the tricks 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.949
 formed 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.360
 every muso fan out on the street 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.939
 people change stations wit sarcomas the one that I 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:32.879
 at least what you pay for being famous and that I believe you are arrested 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:34.779
 people stay I care about the world 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:37.300
 tourism namely fonseca 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.300
 here you 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:44.489
 commanding the current sound
