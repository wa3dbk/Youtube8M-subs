that's too thick figure chainsaw need a
bigger<00:01:18.330> chainsaw<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:20.810> guess<00:01:21.810> my<00:01:21.960> only<00:01:21.990> other

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
bigger chainsaw I guess my only other

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.890 
bigger chainsaw I guess my only other
option<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.890> could<00:01:23.090> auger<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.300> bunch<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.720> ice

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
option is I could auger a bunch of ice

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.690 
option is I could auger a bunch of ice
holes<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.800> ice<00:01:27.170> beside<00:01:28.170> each<00:01:28.200> other<00:01:28.700> like

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
holes in the ice beside each other like

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.870 
holes in the ice beside each other like
10<00:01:29.940> holes<00:01:30.890> that's<00:01:31.890> gonna<00:01:32.070> suck<00:01:34.640> do<00:01:35.640> what<00:01:35.760> you

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
10 holes that's gonna suck do what you

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.300 
10 holes that's gonna suck do what you
got<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.060> do<00:01:36.440> probably<00:01:37.440> a<00:01:37.560> little<00:01:37.710> bit<00:01:37.890> safer

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
got to do probably a little bit safer

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.650
