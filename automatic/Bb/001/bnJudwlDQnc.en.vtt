how<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:00.790> feel<00:03:01.150> this<00:03:01.330> is<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.599> case<00:03:01.810> we<00:03:02.500> take<00:03:02.680> a

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
how I feel this is the case we take a

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.410 
how I feel this is the case we take a
look<00:03:02.920> here<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:03.130> voiceover<00:03:03.640> we<00:03:03.910> have<00:03:04.000> 29

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
look here a voiceover we have 29

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.290 
look here a voiceover we have 29
different<00:03:04.599> languages<00:03:05.200> here<00:03:05.440> but<00:03:06.220> if<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.180> have

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
different languages here but if you have

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.850 
different languages here but if you have
an<00:03:07.390> ipod<00:03:07.690> shuffle<00:03:08.200> you'll<00:03:08.319> notice<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:08.650> your

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
an ipod shuffle you'll notice that your

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.010 
an ipod shuffle you'll notice that your
capacity<00:03:09.730> has<00:03:09.819> gone<00:03:10.060> down<00:03:10.270> quite<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.569> bit<00:03:10.660> well

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
capacity has gone down quite a bit well

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.670 
capacity has gone down quite a bit well
maybe<00:03:11.349> not<00:03:11.500> quite<00:03:11.770> a<00:03:11.830> bit<00:03:12.040> but<00:03:12.190> a<00:03:12.220> little<00:03:12.970> bit

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
maybe not quite a bit but a little bit

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.979 
maybe not quite a bit but a little bit
the<00:03:14.680> shuffle<00:03:15.340> uses<00:03:15.819> essentially<00:03:16.360> voice

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
the shuffle uses essentially voice

your<00:03:19.330> computer<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:22.180> basically<00:03:22.480> creates<00:03:22.930> a

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
your computer and it basically creates a

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.980

is<00:03:46.629> the<00:03:46.750> same<00:03:46.989> thing<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.709> only<00:03:48.040> difference<00:03:48.250> is

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
is the same thing the only difference is

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.580 
is the same thing the only difference is
your<00:03:48.700> double<00:03:49.030> tap<00:03:49.209> and<00:03:49.390> hold<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:50.200> go<00:03:50.319> back<00:03:50.470> to

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
the home screen and you use two fingers

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.490 
the home screen and you use two fingers
to<00:03:53.200> pan<00:03:53.830> across<00:03:54.040> pages<00:03:54.400> instead<00:03:54.760> of<00:03:54.940> three

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
to pan across pages instead of three

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.020

other<00:03:56.500> than<00:03:56.799> that<00:03:57.010> is<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.430> exact<00:03:57.790> same

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
other than that is the exact same

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.030 
other than that is the exact same
interface<00:03:58.480> which<00:03:59.170> is<00:03:59.319> really<00:03:59.530> nice<00:03:59.739> because

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
interface which is really nice because

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.860

so<00:04:09.069> that's<00:04:09.340> pretty<00:04:09.579> much<00:04:09.670> what<00:04:10.000> I<00:04:10.030> was

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
so that's pretty much what I was

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.580 
so that's pretty much what I was
thinking<00:04:10.450> about<00:04:10.599> doing<00:04:10.840> was<00:04:11.109> to<00:04:11.260> just<00:04:11.410> get<00:04:11.560> a

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
thinking about doing was to just get a

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.140 
thinking about doing was to just get a
16<00:04:12.010> gig<00:04:12.160> ipod<00:04:12.489> nano<00:04:12.760> and<00:04:12.940> use<00:04:13.120> that

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
16 gig ipod nano and use that

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.690 
16 gig ipod nano and use that
specifically<00:04:13.989> for<00:04:14.230> music<00:04:14.680> and<00:04:14.859> it<00:04:15.579> is

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
specifically for music and it is

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.949 
specifically for music and it is
accessible<00:04:16.030> for<00:04:16.479> those<00:04:16.510> of<00:04:16.690> you<00:04:16.780> who<00:04:16.900> are

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
accessible for those of you who are

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.409 
accessible for those of you who are
wondering<00:04:17.199> I<00:04:17.680> do<00:04:18.100> not<00:04:18.459> believe<00:04:18.699> this<00:04:19.060> has<00:04:19.269> the

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
wondering I do not believe this has the

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.729 
wondering I do not believe this has the
screen<00:04:19.690> curtain<00:04:19.900> but<00:04:20.109> I<00:04:20.169> haven't<00:04:20.350> looked<00:04:20.590> into

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
screen curtain but I haven't looked into

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.409 
screen curtain but I haven't looked into
that<00:04:20.829> but<00:04:21.130> I<00:04:21.160> do<00:04:21.250> know<00:04:21.669> it<00:04:21.850> does<00:04:21.970> not<00:04:22.120> have<00:04:22.300> the

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
that but I do know it does not have the

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.820 
that but I do know it does not have the
zoom<00:04:22.630> magnifier<00:04:23.139> which<00:04:23.320> makes<00:04:23.560> sense<00:04:23.710> because

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
zoom magnifier which makes sense because

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.200 
zoom magnifier which makes sense because
if<00:04:24.070> you<00:04:24.130> have<00:04:24.220> a<00:04:24.280> one<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:24.490> a<00:04:24.550> half<00:04:24.580> inch<00:04:24.940> screen

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
if you have a one and a half inch screen

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.860 
if you have a one and a half inch screen
you're<00:04:25.330> not<00:04:25.449> going<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:25.660> be<00:04:25.750> using<00:04:26.430> the

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.060 

you<00:04:30.870> know<00:04:30.960> it<00:04:31.020> was<00:04:31.139> such<00:04:31.320> a<00:04:31.350> small<00:04:31.590> screen<00:04:31.830> for

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
you know it was such a small screen for

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.189 
you know it was such a small screen for
magnification<00:04:32.310> anyway<00:04:32.970> so<00:04:33.360> if<00:04:33.570> you<00:04:33.690> do<00:04:33.960> need

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
magnification anyway so if you do need

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.140 
magnification anyway so if you do need
to<00:04:34.230> zoom<00:04:34.530> in<00:04:34.740> if<00:04:35.160> it<00:04:35.370> hurts<00:04:35.580> to<00:04:35.760> get<00:04:35.880> up<00:04:36.000> close

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
to zoom in if it hurts to get up close

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.240 
to zoom in if it hurts to get up close
to<00:04:36.449> your<00:04:36.660> to<00:04:36.900> your<00:04:36.930> device<00:04:37.350> just<00:04:38.010> use
