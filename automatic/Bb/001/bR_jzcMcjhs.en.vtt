00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
battery life like well I've only had it

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.130 
battery life like well I've only had it
for<00:00:26.789> one<00:00:27.119> day<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.539> that's<00:00:27.720> usually<00:00:27.900> pretty

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
for one day and that's usually pretty

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.259 
for one day and that's usually pretty
difficult<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:29.039> tell<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.279> exact<00:00:29.730> battery<00:00:30.090> life

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
difficult to tell the exact battery life

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.700 
difficult to tell the exact battery life
but<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.539> seems<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.869> get<00:00:31.050> through<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> day<00:00:31.349> okay

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
but it seems to get through a day okay

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.280 
but it seems to get through a day okay
we're<00:00:32.460> down<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.820> half<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.390> had<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.870> charged

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
we're down to half I had it charged

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.770 
we're down to half I had it charged
earlier<00:00:34.820> yesterday<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.180> only<00:00:36.329> came<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
earlier yesterday it only came to the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.630 
earlier yesterday it only came to the
half<00:00:36.930> charge<00:00:37.320> when<00:00:37.590> i<00:00:37.620> unboxed<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.309> into<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
half charge when i unboxed it into the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.600 
half charge when i unboxed it into the
first<00:00:38.879> look<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.260> seems<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.649> be<00:00:40.770> pretty

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
first look but it seems to be pretty

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.910 
first look but it seems to be pretty
good<00:00:41.910> for<00:00:42.239> one<00:00:42.480> full<00:00:42.750> day<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.260> haven't<00:00:43.649> gotten

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
good for one full day I haven't gotten

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.100 
good for one full day I haven't gotten
much<00:00:44.100> more<00:00:44.340> out<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.850> but<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.450> don't<00:00:45.960> know

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
much more out of that but I don't know

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.930 
much more out of that but I don't know
what<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.379> will<00:00:46.469> do<00:00:46.649> over<00:00:46.950> time<00:00:47.190> usually<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.700> day

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
what it will do over time usually a day

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.000 
what it will do over time usually a day
or<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.149> day<00:00:48.600> or<00:00:48.750> two<00:00:48.930> really<00:00:49.680> makes<00:00:49.890> a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
or so day or two really makes a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.500 
or so day or two really makes a
difference<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.610> I'll<00:00:50.879> get<00:00:51.059> back<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.270> you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
difference so I'll get back to you

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.240 
difference so I'll get back to you
during<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> review<00:00:52.320> as<00:00:52.590> far<00:00:52.920> as<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.190> goes

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
during the review as far as that goes

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.910 
during the review as far as that goes
one<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.360> questions<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.960> had<00:00:54.989> was<00:00:55.530> how<00:00:55.770> is

decent there about the quality of a
resounding<00:01:12.350> cyl<00:01:13.350> camera<00:01:13.770> we<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.700> take<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
here but you can see that that was a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.890 
we go back home you'll see that I have
to<00:01:31.770> benchmark<00:01:32.280> utilities<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:33.000> here<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.420> will

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
to benchmark utilities on here I will

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.840 
to benchmark utilities on here I will
start<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.259> quadrant<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.520> we'll<00:01:35.700> go<00:01:35.820> to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
start with quadrant and then we'll go to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.359 
start with quadrant and then we'll go to
in<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.630> two<00:01:36.840> after<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:38.040> let's<00:01:38.189> go<00:01:38.340> ahead

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
in to two after that so let's go ahead

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.039 
in to two after that so let's go ahead
and<00:01:38.579> start<00:01:39.000> with<00:01:39.119> quadrant<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:39.720> what<00:01:39.840> kind<00:01:39.990> of

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
and start with quadrant see what kind of

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.980 
and start with quadrant see what kind of
benchmarks<00:01:40.530> we<00:01:40.680> get<00:01:44.509> let's<00:01:45.509> go<00:01:45.600> ahead<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.810> run

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
benchmarks we get let's go ahead and run

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.429 
benchmarks we get let's go ahead and run
a<00:01:46.049> full<00:01:46.229> benchmark<00:01:46.740> it'll<00:01:47.520> take<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> moment<00:01:48.000> and

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
a full benchmark it'll take a moment and

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.230 
a full benchmark it'll take a moment and
you'll<00:01:49.439> see<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:50.340> comes<00:01:50.610> back<00:01:50.820> with<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.030> pretty

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
you'll see it comes back with a pretty

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.450 
you'll see it comes back with a pretty
good<00:01:51.420> score<00:01:51.689> I've<00:01:51.840> run<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.170> before<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.280> we'll

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
good score I've run this before so we'll

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.179 
good score I've run this before so we'll
zip<00:01:53.850> through<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.770> let<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.860> know<00:01:55.890> how<00:01:56.159> it

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
zip through this and let you know how it

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.380 
zip through this and let you know how it
goes<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.700> other<00:01:56.880> end<00:01:57.000> here

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.390 

for<00:02:01.229> those<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.650> wondering<00:02:01.830> this<00:02:02.220> is

for those of you wondering this is

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.640 
for those of you wondering this is
running<00:02:02.580> anywhere<00:02:02.940> between<00:02:03.120> 40<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.930> 60<00:02:04.350> frames

running anywhere between 40 to 60 frames

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.070 
running anywhere between 40 to 60 frames
per<00:02:04.770> second

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
per second

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.930 
per second
and<00:02:07.400> we<00:02:08.400> have<00:02:08.700> our<00:02:08.850> results<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:10.670> here<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.790> can

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.200 
and we have our results and here you can
see<00:02:12.380> your<00:02:13.380> device<00:02:13.680> it's<00:02:14.010> up<00:02:14.160> near<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.370> HTC<00:02:15.000> One

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
see your device it's up near the HTC One

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.760 
see your device it's up near the HTC One
X<00:02:15.360> it's<00:02:16.700> 4221<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.360> pretty<00:02:18.660> good<00:02:18.720> up<00:02:19.710> there

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
X it's 4221 so pretty good up there

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.250 
X it's 4221 so pretty good up there
right<00:02:20.640> at<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.850> top<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.270> list<00:02:21.450> near<00:02:22.140> the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
right at the top of the list near the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.160 
right at the top of the list near the
HTC<00:02:22.800> One<00:02:22.950> X<00:02:23.130> so<00:02:23.280> that's<00:02:23.430> pretty<00:02:23.640> impressive

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
HTC One X so that's pretty impressive

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.000 
HTC One X so that's pretty impressive
let's<00:02:25.170> go<00:02:25.290> back<00:02:25.500> home<00:02:26.000> let's<00:02:27.000> go<00:02:27.120> here<00:02:27.450> and

the the incredible seems to have a

little bit brighter screen in these
bright<00:04:48.450> lights<00:04:48.480> that<00:04:48.900> i'm<00:04:49.080> using<00:04:49.410> it<00:04:49.770> also

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
bright lights that i'm using it also

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.590 
bright lights that i'm using it also
seems<00:04:50.400> to<00:04:50.580> be<00:04:50.670> a<00:04:50.700> little<00:04:50.790> bit<00:04:50.940> closer<00:04:51.210> to<00:04:51.480> the

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
seems to be a little bit closer to the

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.170 
seems to be a little bit closer to the
screen<00:04:51.720> itself<00:04:52.310> they<00:04:53.310> both<00:04:53.550> feel<00:04:53.820> pretty<00:04:54.060> good

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
screen itself they both feel pretty good

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.600 
screen itself they both feel pretty good
in<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.330> hand<00:04:54.480> but<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:55.770> incredible<00:04:56.490> is<00:04:56.550> a

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
in the hand but the the incredible is a

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.890 
in the hand but the the incredible is a
little<00:04:56.850> bit<00:04:56.970> smaller<00:04:57.330> so<00:04:57.480> if<00:04:57.690> you<00:04:57.780> have

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
little bit smaller so if you have

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.930 
little bit smaller so if you have
smaller<00:04:58.860> hands<00:04:59.190> this<00:04:59.340> is<00:04:59.490> probably<00:04:59.700> going<00:04:59.880> to

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
smaller hands this is probably going to

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.970 
smaller hands this is probably going to
be<00:05:00.000> a<00:05:00.060> little<00:05:00.180> bit<00:05:00.330> better<00:05:00.450> for<00:05:00.840> you<00:05:00.990> if<00:05:01.590> you

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
be a little bit better for you if you

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.290 
be a little bit better for you if you
have<00:05:02.100> any<00:05:02.220> other<00:05:02.370> questions<00:05:02.460> I'll<00:05:03.090> go<00:05:03.180> ahead

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
and try and answer those but overall
