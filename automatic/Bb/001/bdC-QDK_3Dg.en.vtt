very<00:01:04.199> issue<00:01:04.470> between<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.010> two<00:01:05.040> weapons

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
with the SRS just a quick note before we

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.630 
with the SRS just a quick note before we

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.280 
shot this we had the barrel out of the
gun<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.270> three<00:02:36.450> three<00:02:36.690> barrel<00:02:37.020> was<00:02:37.140> in

gun and the three three barrel was in
this<00:02:37.410> gun<00:02:37.730> so<00:02:38.730> our<00:02:39.270> first<00:02:39.660> shot

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
this gun so our first shot

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.770 
this gun so our first shot
putting<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.500> 308<00:02:40.950> Barrel<00:02:41.280> in<00:02:41.430> here<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:42.000> the

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
putting the 308 Barrel in here is the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.610 
putting the 308 Barrel in here is the
cohort<00:02:43.170> shot<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.620> our<00:02:43.740> rapid-fire<00:02:44.400> group

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
cohort shot of our rapid-fire group

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.590 
cohort shot of our rapid-fire group
anyhow<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:47.130> return<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.760> zero

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
anyhow so return to zero

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.880 
anyhow so return to zero
I<00:02:48.630> guess<00:02:49.530> proven<00:02:50.280> yet<00:02:50.580> again
