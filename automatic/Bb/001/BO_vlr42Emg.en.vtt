00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.919 

these<00:00:00.810> little<00:00:01.230> straight<00:00:01.589> join<00:00:01.920> us<00:00:02.100> on<00:00:02.340> PVC<00:00:02.939> are

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
these little straight join us on PVC are

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.590 
these little straight join us on PVC are
great<00:00:04.230> for<00:00:04.440> tapping<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.920> side<00:00:05.130> of<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.310> bucket

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:05.600 
great for tapping the side of the bucket

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.100 
great for tapping the side of the bucket
what<00:00:06.600> you<00:00:06.720> do<00:00:06.899> is<00:00:08.240> cut<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:10.370> adjoining<00:00:11.370> piece

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
what you do is cut the adjoining piece

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.129 
what you do is cut the adjoining piece
about<00:00:13.110> two<00:00:13.710> or<00:00:13.860> three<00:00:13.889> mil<00:00:14.400> shorter<00:00:15.150> than<00:00:15.929> the

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
about two or three mil shorter than the

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.279 
about two or three mil shorter than the
joiner<00:00:16.410> piece<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.310> I'll<00:00:17.520> just<00:00:17.789> show<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.390> how

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
joiner piece and I'll just show you how

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.290 
joiner piece and I'll just show you how
we<00:00:19.350> put<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.680> together<00:00:19.830> but<00:00:20.340> now<00:00:20.550> I've<00:00:21.000> put<00:00:21.210> it

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
we put it together but now I've put it

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.590 
we put it together but now I've put it
together<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:22.380> can<00:00:22.560> see<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.010> basically<00:00:23.789> this

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
together you can see that basically this

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.040 
together you can see that basically this
thing<00:00:24.660> forms<00:00:25.410> what<00:00:26.279> looks<00:00:26.490> like<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.730> grommet<00:00:27.210> so

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
thing forms what looks like a grommet so

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.380 
thing forms what looks like a grommet so
that's<00:00:28.920> what<00:00:29.189> that's<00:00:29.580> where<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.880> bucket<00:00:30.210> goes

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
that's what that's where the bucket goes

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.490 
that's what that's where the bucket goes
and<00:00:30.689> these<00:00:31.230> two<00:00:31.529> walls<00:00:32.460> they<00:00:33.329> sit<00:00:34.110> up<00:00:34.200> against

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
and these two walls they sit up against

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.620 
and these two walls they sit up against
the<00:00:34.649> bucket<00:00:34.950> face<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.149> seal<00:00:36.420> them<00:00:36.570> with

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
the bucket face you can seal them with

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.680 
the bucket face you can seal them with
either<00:00:37.590> PVC<00:00:38.309> glue<00:00:38.489> or<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.180> can<00:00:39.300> do<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.540> with

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
either PVC glue or you can do it with

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.790 
either PVC glue or you can do it with
hot<00:00:40.320> glue<00:00:40.350> gun<00:00:40.800> or<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.610> can<00:00:41.790> do<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.059> with

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
hot glue gun or you can do it with

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.319 
hot glue gun or you can do it with
silastic<00:00:43.800> or<00:00:44.160> some<00:00:44.399> sort<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.879> silicon

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
silastic or some sort of a silicon

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.569 
silastic or some sort of a silicon
sealant<00:00:45.840> that's<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.770> one<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.129> find<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
sealant that's the one that I find the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.180 
sealant that's the one that I find the
best<00:00:47.760> because<00:00:48.079> when<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.170> want<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.410> come<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
best because when you want to come to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.920 
best because when you want to come to
winter<00:00:50.550> time<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.000> store<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> buckets<00:00:51.719> away

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
winter time and store the buckets away

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.650 
winter time and store the buckets away
you<00:00:52.469> can<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:52.649> break<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.160> seal<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.640> take<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
you can just break the seal and take the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.529 
you can just break the seal and take the
tap<00:00:55.320> out<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:56.030> put<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> back<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.420> way

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
tap out and put the back of the way

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.299 
tap out and put the back of the way
stacked<00:00:58.550> here<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.820> see<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:02.039> tap

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
stacked here you can see the the tap

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.310 
stacked here you can see the the tap
through<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.730> side<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.180> bucket<00:01:03.359> I've<00:01:04.019> used

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
through the side of the bucket I've used

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.140 
through the side of the bucket I've used
a<00:01:04.439> very<00:01:04.619> small<00:01:04.890> bucket<00:01:05.250> here<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.640> reason<00:01:05.970> for

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
a very small bucket here the reason for

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.560 
a very small bucket here the reason for
that<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.659> because<00:01:06.869> it's<00:01:07.439> got<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.740> most<00:01:08.570> severe

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
that is because it's got the most severe

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.420 
that is because it's got the most severe
curve<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.200> it'll<00:01:10.380> work<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:10.979> it'll<00:01:11.189> work

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
curve if it'll work on this it'll work

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.609 
curve if it'll work on this it'll work
on<00:01:11.610> anything<00:01:11.909> that's<00:01:12.240> either<00:01:13.020> flat<00:01:13.350> or<00:01:13.380> a

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
on anything that's either flat or a

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.179 
on anything that's either flat or a
bigger<00:01:13.979> curve<00:01:15.290> now<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.350> way<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.619> seal<00:01:17.009> this

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
bigger curve now the way you seal this

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.910 
bigger curve now the way you seal this
thing<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.630> run<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> silicon<00:01:19.409> bead<00:01:19.619> around

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
thing is you run a silicon bead around

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.800 
thing is you run a silicon bead around
here<00:01:20.189> essentially<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.060> grab<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> silicon

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
here essentially you grab the silicon

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.940 
here essentially you grab the silicon
gun<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.250> you<00:01:23.250> rotate<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.939> through<00:01:24.950> 360

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
gun and you rotate this through 360

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.590 
gun and you rotate this through 360
degrees<00:01:26.250> while<00:01:26.580> running<00:01:26.820> your<00:01:26.970> silicon<00:01:27.390> bead

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
degrees while running your silicon bead

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.560 
degrees while running your silicon bead
on<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.950> if<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.100> then<00:01:29.280> do<00:01:29.460> exactly<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.299> same

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
on it if you then do exactly the same

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.920 
on it if you then do exactly the same
thing<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.710> inside<00:01:34.970> you<00:01:35.970> then<00:01:36.180> do<00:01:36.390> exactly

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
thing on the inside you then do exactly

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.109 
thing on the inside you then do exactly
the<00:01:37.110> same<00:01:37.170> thing<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> inside<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.729> simply

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
the same thing on the inside you simply

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.819 
the same thing on the inside you simply
rotate<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:40.670> 360<00:01:41.670> degrees<00:01:42.649> while<00:01:43.649> you're

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
rotate this 360 degrees while you're

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.670 
rotate this 360 degrees while you're
running<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.100> silicon<00:01:44.520> bead<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.680> after

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
running a silicon bead on it after

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.770 
running a silicon bead on it after
you've<00:01:47.070> run<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.369> silicon<00:01:47.759> bead<00:01:47.970> i've<00:01:48.240> come<00:01:48.750> up

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
you've run the silicon bead i've come up

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.260 
you've run the silicon bead i've come up
with<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.140> little<00:01:49.350> thing<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:50.490> snag<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.180> up

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
with this little thing to snag it up

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.420 
with this little thing to snag it up
I'll<00:01:51.570> have<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.439> put<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.680> camera<00:01:52.979> down<00:01:53.009> while<00:01:53.399> I

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
I'll have to put the camera down while I

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.050 
I'll have to put the camera down while I
put<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.850> into<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.890> tap<00:01:56.100> we'll<00:01:56.820> just

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
put this into the the the tap we'll just

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.950 
put this into the the the tap we'll just
be<00:01:57.210> back<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.600> moment

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
be back in a moment

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.050 
be back in a moment
well<00:01:58.770> what<00:01:59.070> I've<00:01:59.130> done<00:01:59.340> here<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.670> I've<00:01:59.850> run<00:02:00.030> a

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
well what I've done here is I've run a

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.190 
well what I've done here is I've run a
bolt<00:02:00.390> through<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.259> middle<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.740> pipe<00:02:01.979> with

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
bolt through the middle of a pipe with

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.539 
bolt through the middle of a pipe with
basically<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> large<00:02:04.469> washer<00:02:04.979> on<00:02:05.070> either<00:02:05.280> end

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
basically a large washer on either end

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.700 
basically a large washer on either end
now<00:02:06.180> I'm<00:02:06.270> going<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.479> tighten<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.110> bolt<00:02:07.409> up

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
now I'm going to tighten that bolt up

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.279 
now I'm going to tighten that bolt up
and<00:02:07.950> that's<00:02:08.160> going<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.459> squeeze<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:09.660> down<00:02:09.720> so

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
and that's going to squeeze this down so

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.870 
and that's going to squeeze this down so
that<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.530> face<00:02:10.830> comes<00:02:11.610> up

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
that this face comes up

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.640 
that this face comes up
flush<00:02:12.060> with<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.390> bucket<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:12.960> that's<00:02:13.380> what<00:02:13.620> a

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
flush with the bucket and that's what a

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.650 
flush with the bucket and that's what a
seal<00:02:13.980> was<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.520> silicon<00:02:14.970> if<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.270> had<00:02:15.450> put

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
seal was the silicon if I had put

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.610 
seal was the silicon if I had put
silicon<00:02:16.110> on<00:02:16.260> him

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
silicon on him

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.620 
silicon on him
and<00:02:17.220> then<00:02:17.340> now<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.670> I've<00:02:17.910> tightened<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.540> up

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
and then now that I've tightened it up

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.960 
and then now that I've tightened it up
you<00:02:19.320> can<00:02:19.470> see<00:02:19.740> that<00:02:19.950> there's<00:02:20.190> no<00:02:20.670> room<00:02:20.940> left

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
you can see that there's no room left

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.020 
you can see that there's no room left
there<00:02:21.450> that's<00:02:22.170> snug<00:02:23.160> up<00:02:23.340> against<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:23.820> if

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
there that's snug up against it and if

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.310 
there that's snug up against it and if
you<00:02:24.120> had<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.270> put<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.540> silicon<00:02:24.960> bead<00:02:25.170> on

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
you had to put that silicon bead on

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.900 
you had to put that silicon bead on
there<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.920> would<00:02:26.100> have<00:02:26.130> been<00:02:26.370> squeezed<00:02:26.760> out

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
there it would have been squeezed out

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.370 
there it would have been squeezed out
and<00:02:27.150> that's<00:02:27.300> going<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.600> provide<00:02:27.900> your<00:02:28.140> seal

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
and that's going to provide your seal

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.890 
and that's going to provide your seal
this<00:02:29.100> is<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> pressure<00:02:29.610> fit<00:02:29.880> system<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:30.600> it's<00:02:30.780> as

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
this is a pressure fit system so it's as

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.380 
this is a pressure fit system so it's as
solid<00:02:31.200> as<00:02:31.320> a<00:02:31.350> rock<00:02:31.440> anyway<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.910> silicon<00:02:33.270> is

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
solid as a rock anyway the silicon is

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.810 
solid as a rock anyway the silicon is
just<00:02:33.900> there<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.740> make<00:02:34.920> sure<00:02:35.100> it's<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.490> complete

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
just there to make sure it's a complete

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.760 
just there to make sure it's a complete
water<00:02:36.030> seal<00:02:36.300> I'll<00:02:36.810> just<00:02:37.050> show<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.470> inside

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
water seal I'll just show you the inside

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.260 
water seal I'll just show you the inside
you<00:02:40.770> can<00:02:40.860> see<00:02:41.130> there<00:02:41.370> there's<00:02:41.790> no<00:02:42.000> room<00:02:42.240> left

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
you can see there there's no room left

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.710 
you can see there there's no room left
for<00:02:42.720> anything<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.230> get<00:02:43.680> up<00:02:43.910> in<00:02:44.910> this<00:02:45.030> case<00:02:45.270> to

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
for anything to get up in this case to

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.970 
for anything to get up in this case to
get<00:02:46.650> into<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:46.980> seal<00:02:47.490> of<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.670> doing<00:02:48.980> here

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
get into the the seal of the doing here

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.310 
get into the the seal of the doing here
I've<00:02:50.130> taken<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.580> waiver<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.540> compression<00:02:52.080> bolt

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
I've taken a waiver the compression bolt

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.800 
I've taken a waiver the compression bolt
you<00:02:53.040> can<00:02:53.220> see<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:53.730> joint<00:02:54.060> is<00:02:54.210> as<00:02:54.570> solid

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
you can see that that joint is as solid

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.930 
you can see that that joint is as solid
as<00:02:55.050> a<00:02:55.080> rock

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
as a rock

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.500 
as a rock
I'll<00:02:56.940> just<00:02:57.120> give<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.570> bit<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.870> wiggle<00:02:58.320> like

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
I'll just give it a bit of a wiggle like

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.880 
I'll just give it a bit of a wiggle like
it's<00:03:00.510> certainly<00:03:01.170> going<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.410> be<00:03:01.470> solid<00:03:01.740> enough

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
it's certainly going to be solid enough

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.060 
it's certainly going to be solid enough

the bucket you've got a joiner and I'm

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.260 
the bucket you've got a joiner and I'm
going<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:07.980> show<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:08.220> why<00:03:08.610> that's<00:03:08.850> handy

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
going to show you why that's handy

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.530 
going to show you why that's handy
because<00:03:09.840> if<00:03:10.200> you<00:03:10.290> remember<00:03:10.650> in<00:03:10.800> Bobby's

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
because if you remember in Bobby's

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.770 
because if you remember in Bobby's
system<00:03:12.540> he<00:03:13.080> uses<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.710> the<00:03:14.070> paint<00:03:14.880> bag<00:03:15.090> paint

strainer<00:03:16.080> bag<00:03:16.320> filter<00:03:16.770> you<00:03:17.460> know<00:03:17.520> this<00:03:17.760> is<00:03:18.000> a

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
strainer bag filter you know this is a

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.480 
strainer bag filter you know this is a
universal<00:03:19.140> joint<00:03:19.410> so<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:19.710> allows<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.220> put

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
universal joint so it allows you to put

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.430 
universal joint so it allows you to put
up<00:03:20.610> several<00:03:21.270> different<00:03:21.390> filters<00:03:22.110> that<00:03:22.230> are

up several different filters that are

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.160 
up several different filters that are
much<00:03:22.890> cheaper<00:03:22.920> than<00:03:23.310> Bobby's<00:03:23.870> this<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:24.990> one

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
much cheaper than Bobby's this is one

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
outside all I've done is hot glue them

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.730 
outside all I've done is hot glue them
together<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.480> drill<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.230> little<00:03:34.380> bit<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.650> a

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
together and drill a little bit of a

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.220 
together and drill a little bit of a
hole<00:03:34.920> for<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.190> pipe<00:03:35.430> put<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.030> piping<00:03:36.450> the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
hole for the pipe put the piping the

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.950 
hole for the pipe put the piping the
piping<00:03:37.650> then<00:03:38.270> hot<00:03:39.270> glue<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.570> whole<00:03:39.690> thing

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
piping then hot glue the whole thing

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.260 
piping then hot glue the whole thing
together<00:03:40.140> you<00:03:40.530> know<00:03:40.920> that's<00:03:41.610> a<00:03:41.850> really<00:03:42.120> high

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
together you know that's a really high

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.630 
together you know that's a really high
volume<00:03:42.510> filter<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.680> works<00:03:43.890> really<00:03:44.130> good<00:03:44.250> and

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
volume filter it works really good and

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.300 
volume filter it works really good and
it's<00:03:45.000> really<00:03:45.450> cheap<00:03:45.660> I<00:03:46.290> think<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:46.950> can<00:03:47.100> make

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
it's really cheap I think you can make

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.330 
it's really cheap I think you can make
three<00:03:47.700> filters<00:03:48.120> for<00:03:48.720> about<00:03:49.350> three<00:03:49.590> bucks<00:03:49.770> when

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
three filters for about three bucks when

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.250 
three filters for about three bucks when
it's<00:03:50.490> most<00:03:50.670> into<00:03:50.850> my<00:03:50.940> favorite<00:03:51.209> filter<00:03:51.630> all

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
it's most into my favorite filter all

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.680
