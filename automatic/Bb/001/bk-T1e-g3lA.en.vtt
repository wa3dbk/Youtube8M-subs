00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.920
 hello now I'm going to teach you 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.469
 recipe for the whole family including 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.420
 your children my son really likes what 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.189
 all chicken fingers from views of 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.260
 chicken as it can be are the chicken 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.230
 fingers then what I did is that 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.900
 buy the chicken is already in strips or the 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:30.410
 chicken scripts or chicken bits 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:32.800
 and I'm going to put the beaten egg 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.720
 you do not need to put anything else in the egg 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.660
 here I have 3 eggs for this little package 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.170
 chicken after software grab it 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.960
 what is it? 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.730
 and cotija cheese the cotija cheese is not going to 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.220
 try what is calcium and protein 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.630
 little salt and pepper 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:58.340
 and also applies 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:01.710
 and that's it, then I'm going to mix it 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.360
 remember that cotija cheese has salt 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.790
 it's high in sodium so I did not have to 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.220
 add a lot of salt the paprika of many 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.470
 people think that it has nothing of 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.900
 nutritional value but the reality that 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.960
 has vitamin a vitamin and iron 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.590
 then I'm going to take the egg I'm going to 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.590
 bread 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:31.710
 it is very important that the chicken that is 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.320
 high in protein keep everything cold 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.260
 time so you do not have problems with 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.130
 bacteria then as soon as they take it out 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:45.380
 the refrigerator was already going to put 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.380
 It is a lathe at 350 degrees 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.710
 to cook until the juices are 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.710
 clear 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:58.350
 let's review this is ready 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.780

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.250

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.790
