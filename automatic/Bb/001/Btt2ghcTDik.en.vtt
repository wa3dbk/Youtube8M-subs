00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.340
 ah 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.000
 or the classics of intermediate tv and friends 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.100
 of intermediate point mx as they are I am 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.110
 Luis, what did I do and one of the questions 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.660
 more they have done us so much in illness 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.310
 point mx like in intermediate tv is how 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.099
 set up several email accounts 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.320
 electronic inside the samsung galaxy s 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.390
 4 so far I have to be a confession 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.420
 the truth is that in my case I am 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.420
 user if of the google platform if of 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.670
 android but as a main client of 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.500
 email I use gmail because 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.120
 because all the platforms work 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.670
 about gmail and the truth is that I was 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.309
 makes it as comfortable however if 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.649
 I must say that the adaptation that has 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.530
 made samsung for various applications 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.289
 it has been most useful, so here 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.600
 let's show you how to set up a 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.219
 mail account and how to append more than 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.399
 some something that has been very interesting 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.140
 is that samsung has facilitated the way 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.520
 to set up an email 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.870
 before 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.119
 the truth is that it had to be several 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.830
 data from your account and if you did not know one of 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.840
 the data did not work so much for 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.119
 receive or to send emails now is 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.710
 as simple as it proves what 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.170
 I'm going to do is set one of my 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.110
 but inside the mack platform one 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.940
 account that works 100% with the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.979
 apple platform and that the truth is 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.570
 that does not give any problem at the moment of 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.260
 configure it let's go do it from 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.260
 quick way 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.570
 and we go to the next 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.979
 at this time I can program the 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.369
 synchronization of this account if it is each 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.840
 15 minutes during peak hours also the 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.310
 peak number good refers to the hours 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.310
 where we use the most I can 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.020
 define when here for example 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.340
 I can say if I get notifications 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.890
 or even download at a time in the 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.899
 attachments if I'm connected to 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.360
 a wifi network and in that way save 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.130
 data an important point with all this 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.289
 is that unlike other accounts 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.750
 you will see him later with a 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.849
 mac account the options that gives me the 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.429
 mail client included the samsung 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.349
 galaxy s 4 are quite limited but 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.450
 let's say that does not imply that it does not go to 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.130
 work well within the account i 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.319
 I can give this account a name 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.900
 I can also put the name that 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.489
 will appear when I sent messages and good 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.410
 the time is very simple here 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.400
 I'm just going to put it done I'm not going 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.909
 to do any configuration 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.819
 are loading the last messages and the 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:36.939
 time very very quickly realizes this is 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.220
 very very easy and good here I see the 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:41.890
 main mailboxes now if I want 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.840
 another load another mail account 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.939
 another platform what I have to do 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.420
 is to press the button go to the part of 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:51.790
 configuration and press add account 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.060
 in this case what I'm going to include is going to 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.409
 be a microsoft account an account 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.989
 hotmail for you to see how it is 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:02.139
 that also this android platform 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.269
 this samsung platform works with 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:07.510
 accounts that may be from a company 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.819
 that would be a google competitor 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.640
 put this account 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.650
 here I can send mail from 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.150
 default account I can say yes 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.060
 this account is the account to determine 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.439
 that is the main account that if I 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.450
 I decide to send an email from a 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.939
 application as whatsapp or image or 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.980
 dropbox I can configure or decide which 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:29.849
 is the main account in this case I'm going 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.849
 to next person 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.370
 ready very well here we come to the 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.750
 options of the account and you as 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.540
 you can see as you had mentioned 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.160
 a few minutes ago 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.170
 there are many more configuration options 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.700
 here for example I can configure the 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.710
 mail synchronization period that 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.020
 It can be automatic all day one day 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:52.200
 three days a week a month and so on 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.940
 I can schedule the synchronization that 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.230
 it can be by diffusion I do not understand 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.850
 exactly what you mean 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.720
 from diffusion but can be manual 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.190
 every 15 minutes and so on is also the 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.130
 part of the recovery size of 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.900
 mail can say up to what size 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.490
 I can receive a very good email 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.680
 heavy that is have a lot of text 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.120
 then they only receive a certain part 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.940
 and I press a button so that 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.730
 download the rest of the mail I can 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.560
 synchronize even the calendar and in 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.900
 how long within my calendar 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.000
 hotmail if it's two weeks three weeks 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.460
 etc. I can send mail from 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.560
 default account locate it as the 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.020
 default account and the part 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.880
 interesting I can synchronize contacts 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.130
 contacts that are included in hotmail 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.080
 without growing the calendar or synchronize 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.810
 tasks and also obviously 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.060
 download attachments as long as 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.390
 in a wifi network we put here following 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.580
 it is being processed 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.410
 here we can give the same name to 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.360
 this account decide what name goes to 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.000
 have this account I can put my account 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.350
 of hotmail or my account alternates and so on 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.350
 and put done 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.509
 they are loading the last mails 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.990
 It is important to mention that obviously 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.580
 We are working at this time 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.010
 during this test with a connection 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:25.830
 wi-fi but this is one of the phones 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.830
 that work with the 4g lte network of telcel 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.330
 good they are loading must be very 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.220
 heavy the load finally appeared 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.220
 mails that arrived yesterday Tuesday 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:39.130
 Monday we open here the menu we see the 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.900
 different mailboxes here where the view 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.110
 combined with all the accounts the view 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.480
 by account in this case the mac's the 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.370
 hotmail and we can press to see 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.110
 all the folders that can be 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.570
 you saw the truth is that it is very 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.340
 simple very easy and here you can 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.800
 fill out another question or ice and you know that 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.360
 I do not want that account to be 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.270
 I do very well the truth is that it is 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.110
 very very easy here we can go by 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.000
 example 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.940
 configuration we see accounts and 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.030
 we press this icon with this pot of 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.610
 trash and we decide what account we can 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.280
 eliminate pressure here eliminate and the 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.470
 you collaborate that is very very simple 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.800
 we are going to delete for example the account 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:25.080
 from the sea 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:29.120
 the whole account will be deleted to talk 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.460
 account removed ready we return 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.960
 and will only offer the account of 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.360

 integral way the mail client with 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.550
 all the applications that come 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.949
 preloaded that were designed by the 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:50.380
