00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
again continuing along kind of like go

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.920 
again continuing along kind of like go
really<00:00:51.820> slowly<00:00:52.090> like<00:00:52.239> I<00:00:52.480> said<00:00:52.690> if<00:00:52.840> you're

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930

doing something too hard or exerting too

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.240 
doing something too hard or exerting too
much<00:00:55.840> energy<00:00:56.140> when<00:00:56.350> butchering<00:00:56.800> you're

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
much energy when butchering you're

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.130 
much energy when butchering you're
probably<00:00:57.489> doing<00:00:57.700> something<00:00:58.000> wrong<00:00:58.180> then

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
probably doing something wrong then
