00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.090 
go we got two scoops of whey protein
here<00:00:39.579> i<00:00:40.480> don't<00:00:40.989> think<00:00:41.050> i<00:00:41.350> have<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.680> container

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
here i don't think i have the container

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.430 
here i don't think i have the container
for<00:00:42.340> that<00:00:42.460> no<00:00:42.640> i<00:00:42.670> don't<00:00:43.030> it's<00:00:43.870> just<00:00:44.110> the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
for that no i don't it's just the

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.470 
for that no i don't it's just the
protein<00:00:45.340> you<00:00:45.460> can<00:00:45.520> get<00:00:45.670> at<00:00:45.760> costco<00:00:45.940> by

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
protein you can get at costco by

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.290 
protein you can get at costco by
cytosport<00:00:47.309> there<00:00:48.309> whey<00:00:48.489> protein<00:00:48.940> i<00:00:49.090> think

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
cytosport there whey protein i think

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.139 
cytosport there whey protein i think
it's<00:00:49.390> like<00:00:49.539> two<00:00:49.809> and<00:00:49.960> a<00:00:49.989> half<00:00:50.109> grams<00:00:50.379> of<00:00:50.590> fat<00:00:51.149> a

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
it's like two and a half grams of fat a

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.170 
it's like two and a half grams of fat a
couple<00:00:52.660> carbs<00:00:53.170> and<00:00:53.410> 27<00:00:54.100> protein<00:00:54.489> per<00:00:54.699> scoop<00:00:55.000> so

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
couple carbs and 27 protein per scoop so

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.420 
couple carbs and 27 protein per scoop so
I've<00:00:55.239> got<00:00:55.390> two<00:00:55.539> scoops<00:00:55.809> there<00:00:56.079> I've<00:00:56.289> got<00:00:57.129> three

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
I've got two scoops there I've got three

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.209 
I've got two scoops there I've got three
servings<00:00:57.879> of<00:00:58.289> one<00:00:59.289> of<00:00:59.379> my<00:00:59.469> favorites<00:00:59.859> cinnamon

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
toast crunch and this I believe is 75

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.010

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
fat per serving I guess at 25 per

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.100 
fat per serving I guess at 25 per
serving<00:01:12.520> our<00:01:12.610> three<00:01:12.909> servings<00:01:13.330> and<00:01:13.600> three
