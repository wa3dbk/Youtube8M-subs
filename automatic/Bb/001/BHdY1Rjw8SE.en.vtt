00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
you probably shouldn't do this directly

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.159 
you probably shouldn't do this directly
over<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:29.979> bowl<00:04:30.190> if<00:04:30.400> you're<00:04:30.520> worried<00:04:30.849> about

over the bowl if you're worried about
spillage<00:04:32.190> in<00:04:33.190> general<00:04:33.960> hmm<00:04:34.960> let's<00:04:35.320> see

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
spillage in general hmm let's see

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.180 
spillage in general hmm let's see
little<00:04:36.490> bit<00:04:36.610> a<00:04:36.849> little<00:04:37.360> bit<00:04:37.450> more<00:04:37.719> than<00:04:37.960> to<00:04:38.380> be

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
little bit a little bit more than to be

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.730 
little bit a little bit more than to be
careful<00:04:39.550> with<00:04:39.640> the<00:04:39.729> tapioca<00:04:40.200> from<00:04:41.200> experience

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
careful with the tapioca from experience

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.240 
careful with the tapioca from experience
I've<00:04:42.010> learned<00:04:42.310> that<00:04:42.610> if<00:04:42.760> you<00:04:42.880> put<00:04:43.150> too<00:04:43.360> much

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
I've learned that if you put too much

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.620 
I've learned that if you put too much
you're<00:04:45.250> because<00:04:45.610> tapioca<00:04:46.150> is<00:04:46.240> the<00:04:46.360> thing<00:04:46.599> that

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
you're because tapioca is the thing that

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.040 
you're because tapioca is the thing that
makes<00:04:47.140> it<00:04:47.409> gel<00:04:48.190> makes<00:04:48.610> it<00:04:48.909> stick<00:04:49.840> together

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
makes it gel makes it stick together

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.719 
makes it gel makes it stick together
you're<00:04:50.500> feeling<00:04:50.830> there<00:04:51.070> and<00:04:51.250> if<00:04:51.310> you<00:04:51.400> put<00:04:51.610> too

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
you're feeling there and if you put too

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.310 
you're feeling there and if you put too
