00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.010
 Y 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.160
 greetings to all users 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.570
 I want to show you this new video of 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.570
 so be it 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.739
 the last steps that are missing for the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.960
 fish tank like those that have takayama not 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.960
 they sold it to me like 50 liters but 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:53.930
 for the measures that are 50 centimeters 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:55.440
 long 27 centimeters wide and the 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.270
 height of this one 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:03.500
 37 centimeters 38 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:06.440
 by 26 millimeters thick video 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.010
 which is very different this for example 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.490
 which equals the same caliber as the 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.490
 tortuguero 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.810
 I do not know if you notice the difference 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.270
 it's 3 millimeters that's the video 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.090
 normal 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.149
 and to my consideration 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.840
 I was not going to bear the weight of 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:40.049
 substrate that are 8 kilos 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.200
 it would not hold a normal tank by 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:48.049
 that reason apart from that which back 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.049
 It measures about 27 centimeters nothing more 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.450
 of height about 30 then 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.590
 direct a little higher 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.830
 Actually, the one behind here is 33 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.620
 liters 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:09.090
 It is like you sell 50 but 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.100
 The thickness of the glass thickness 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.970
 circumstances 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.420
 in if they are going to be about 43 liters more 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.420
 or less 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.730
 and then here is 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.360
 I sent this do for the 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.110
 features came out a little each 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:36.140
 because I got the same price that is 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:39.650
 of 100 liters of my tortuguero 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.680
 and they charge you practically 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.780
 the video the crystal 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.930
 quite tough is a job of 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.850
 first the silicon too 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.190
 it's pretty good 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.190
 and you already do in the finishes in a child 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.209
 the brand I had told them to me 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.209
 to my taste here in Mexico 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.930
 the best place where you can make your 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.910
 fish tanks is the triton aquarium from the 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.400
 label all the equipment for fish 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.140
 tropical and marine variety of 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.200
 accessories for dogs cats ferrets 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.450
 iguanas etcetera the street is 20 of 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.050
 November of number 10 in the colony 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.050
 mixhuca cupcake 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:34.820
 well, there on the phone of 36 12 17 18 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.820
 26 12 17 18 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.880
 in this aquarium is where I buy 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.069
 fish tanks basically make them very 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.690
 well and I have not had any problem 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.599
 in that place 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.080
 the other fish tanks in the market 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:55.410
 from the same PC market has already gone to 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.020
 all markets in models those that 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.640
 they are here in my house I have gone to others 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:04.020
 markets where they also recommend 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.000
 I have gone to the PC market 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.730
 here in the north the one of oaks dominguez 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.730
 and all have unfortunately all been 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.650
 dislodged 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.560
 this is the only place where they come out well 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.299
 the fish tanks 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.450
 and well, I already told you a little more 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.919
 about fish tanks and equipment and already
