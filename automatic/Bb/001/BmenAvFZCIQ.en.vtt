00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
actually still use the same computer

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.010 
actually still use the same computer
which<00:05:48.229> works<00:05:48.500> for<00:05:48.770> me<00:05:48.950> and<00:05:49.539> just<00:05:50.539> a<00:05:50.750> dual

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
too bad that helps me out a lot because

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.330 
too bad that helps me out a lot because
it<00:05:57.110> gets<00:05:57.320> a<00:05:57.410> little<00:05:57.500> hard<00:05:57.800> to<00:05:57.919> see<00:05:58.070> when<00:05:58.220> you're

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340

editing<00:05:58.490> sometimes<00:05:59.240> and<00:05:59.510> then<00:06:00.050> what<00:06:00.200> also

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
editing sometimes and then what also

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.260 
editing sometimes and then what also
really<00:06:01.010> comes<00:06:01.250> in<00:06:01.400> handy<00:06:01.430> was<00:06:01.910> just<00:06:02.150> some

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
really comes in handy was just some
