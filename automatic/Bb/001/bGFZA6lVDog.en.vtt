 improvisation with the triads 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.380
 last week you learned to 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.210
 improvise with the triads 1 3 5 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.640
 today in this second course we 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.699
 let's focus on triads 3 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.199
 5 7 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:27.510
 the third the fifth and the 7th the grid 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.119
 chords and the same family 9.7 soil 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.119
 minor this d minor 7 2 times 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.210
 so feel free to download the 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.490

 surprises the first agreement the f minor 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:52.390
 7 and play the triad 3 5 7 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:56.920
 this will give us a triad during the 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:01.060
 flat A flat major then on the bass 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:06.000
 it will give us the Eb and flight in 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:09.340
 castrais re body that will be the 7th 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.920
 the lab is soft in castrais body two 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.270
 only who will be the third tierce 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:20.020
 minors for is exact back in box 12 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.770
 core 2 duo that's going to be the fifth and the 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.080
 mit flat again in box 15 body of 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.970
 back that's going to be enough so keep on 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.930
 going to see four notes to improvise on 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.390
 a family of recipes 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.780
 the four notes of the triad of the 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.780
 flat major 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.500
 second agreement the 5th of recipes 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.030
 we're going to improvise with a triad of if 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.710
 flat major which therefore corresponds to the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:55.069
 third the fifth and the 7th on the base 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.090
 will give us their and in case 12 body 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:01.520
 of the fifth 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:06.619
 the lighthouse breaks 15 places was 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:11.930
 minor May 6 flight that will be managed 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:14.750
 szpiner and the sandstone that is going to be the fifth 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.379
 then the ray and gas fourteen bodies of 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:23.959
 back and the B flat is cascading rope 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:27.470
 of soil so cats endows our island has 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:31.840
 of whether the major flights third and 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.840
 last agreement bring it together 7 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.049
 if we play the 3,500 triad, that's fine 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:43.129
 give a sorting of F major and on the 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:46.670
 base we're going to have the lighthouse cascade a 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:50.150
 golden glove the fail that will be the third 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:54.129
 the third riner we'll see him art in 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.950
 15 body of soil that is going to be the fifth 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:00.500
 and the name in gas 12 core 2 duo that will 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.760
 to be the seventh minor so a trial 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.760
 of F major 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.810
 so I start my chord grid with 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.049

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.049
 improvise 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.490
 my 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.090
