the Saturn so let's take a look at one
of<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.629> new<00:00:40.809> designs<00:00:41.590> if<00:00:41.800> they've<00:00:41.949> done<00:00:42.100> for

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
of the new designs if they've done for

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.430 
of the new designs if they've done for
2014<00:00:42.940> which<00:00:43.150> is<00:00:43.180> called<00:00:43.510> their<00:00:43.660> power<00:00:43.870> pyramid

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
2014 which is called their power pyramid

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.410 
2014 which is called their power pyramid
we<00:00:45.130> can<00:00:45.280> look<00:00:45.400> right<00:00:45.550> down<00:00:45.610> here<00:00:45.940> at<00:00:46.030> this<00:00:46.180> seat

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
we can look right down here at this seat

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.510 
we can look right down here at this seat
tube<00:00:46.660> and<00:00:46.900> we<00:00:47.260> can<00:00:47.440> see<00:00:47.650> how<00:00:47.829> it's<00:00:48.010> divided

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
tube and we can see how it's divided

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.630 
tube and we can see how it's divided
right<00:00:48.880> into<00:00:49.239> the<00:00:49.390> bottom<00:00:49.750> bracket<00:00:50.079> area<00:00:50.320> here

stays have been designed to dampen the
road<00:01:25.389> vibration<00:01:25.630> so<00:01:26.380> it's<00:01:26.529> going<00:01:26.679> to<00:01:26.770> actually

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 
road vibration so it's going to actually

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.160 
road vibration so it's going to actually
add<00:01:27.609> into<00:01:28.060> some<00:01:28.299> more<00:01:28.420> comfort<00:01:28.840> into<00:01:28.959> that

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
105 you've got ten gears in the back and

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.719 
105 you've got ten gears in the back and
in<00:01:43.240> our<00:01:43.389> front<00:01:44.159> section<00:01:45.159> here<00:01:45.369> we're<00:01:45.700> using

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
in our front section here we're using

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.889 
in our front section here we're using
the<00:01:46.329> compact<00:01:46.840> chain<00:01:47.079> rings<00:01:47.380> which<00:01:47.619> is<00:01:47.829> a<00:01:47.859> 50<00:01:48.899> 34

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
the compact chain rings which is a 50 34

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.410 
the compact chain rings which is a 50 34
and<00:01:50.319> the<00:01:51.009> compact<00:01:51.369> chain<00:01:51.700> rings<00:01:51.969> have<00:01:52.209> been

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
and the compact chain rings have been

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.499 
and the compact chain rings have been
designed<00:01:53.109> to<00:01:53.549> somewhat<00:01:54.549> replace<00:01:54.939> the<00:01:55.179> triple

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
designed to somewhat replace the triple

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.149 
designed to somewhat replace the triple
chain<00:01:55.749> ring<00:01:55.990> so<00:01:56.229> we're<00:01:56.529> still<00:01:56.799> going<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.039> get

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
chain ring so we're still going to get

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.370 
chain ring so we're still going to get
the<00:01:57.310> same<00:01:58.209> high<00:01:58.509> and<00:01:58.749> low<00:01:58.869> as<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.049> triple

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
the same high and low as a triple

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.769 
the same high and low as a triple
without<00:02:00.219> some<00:02:00.459> of<00:02:00.490> those<00:02:00.639> crossover<00:02:01.299> gears<00:02:01.599> or

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:04.029 
some of that chain you might see with

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:05.180 
some of that chain you might see with
the<00:02:04.149> triple<00:02:04.539> when<00:02:04.689> you<00:02:04.779> have

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190
