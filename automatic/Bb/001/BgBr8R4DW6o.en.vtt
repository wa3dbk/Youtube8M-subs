bottom<00:00:57.520> of<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.790> base<00:00:57.969> so<00:00:58.270> you<00:00:58.300> can<00:00:58.420> recess<00:00:58.930> it

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
bottom of the base so you can recess it

down<00:00:59.260> into<00:00:59.469> the<00:00:59.559> subfloor<00:01:00.070> more<00:01:00.340> we<00:01:01.059> also<00:01:01.210> mold

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
down into the subfloor more we also mold

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.079 
down into the subfloor more we also mold
in<00:01:01.809> four<00:01:02.079> holes<00:01:02.410> so<00:01:03.010> you<00:01:03.040> can<00:01:03.280> anchor<00:01:03.489> it<00:01:03.670> to

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089

in four holes so you can anchor it to
the<00:01:04.210> subfloor<00:01:04.600> I'll<00:01:04.930> demonstrate<00:01:05.500> now

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.790 

you<00:01:12.130> would<00:01:12.280> then<00:01:12.460> slope<00:01:13.000> a<00:01:13.210> mortar<00:01:13.600> bed<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:14.350> the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
you would then slope a mortar bed to the

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.070 
you would then slope a mortar bed to the
drain<00:01:15.159> after<00:01:15.460> that<00:01:16.360> we<00:01:16.510> would<00:01:16.630> apply<00:01:16.720> our

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
drain after that we would apply our

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.530 
drain after that we would apply our
membrane<00:01:17.500> over<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.400> sloped<00:01:18.700> mortar<00:01:19.119> bed<00:01:19.270> and

apply<00:01:20.380> our<00:01:20.409> clamping<00:01:21.040> collar<00:01:21.280> here<00:01:22.090> we'll<00:01:22.300> go

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
apply our clamping collar here we'll go

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.380 
apply our clamping collar here we'll go
ahead<00:01:22.510> and<00:01:22.750> bolt<00:01:22.930> it<00:01:23.050> down

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
ahead and bolt it down

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.460 
ahead and bolt it down
after<00:01:25.390> we<00:01:25.479> finished<00:01:25.869> tightening<00:01:26.290> down<00:01:26.320> our
