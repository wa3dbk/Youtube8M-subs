configuration<00:00:57.690> click<00:00:58.649> Next<00:01:01.609> now<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.940> part

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
configuration click Next now this part

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.570 
configuration click Next now this part
is<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.690> bit<00:01:03.960> tricky<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.739> pay<00:01:04.769> attention<00:01:05.010> here

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
is a bit tricky so pay attention here

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.350 
is a bit tricky so pay attention here
first<00:01:06.479> we'll<00:01:06.810> select<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.260> first<00:01:07.590> two<00:01:07.860> drives

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
first we'll select the first two drives

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.350 
first we'll select the first two drives
and<00:01:10.010> then<00:01:11.010> add<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.520> span<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:12.150> we<00:01:12.659> add<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.080> array

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
and then add to span as we add to array

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.640 
and then add to span as we add to array
so<00:01:15.360> that's<00:01:16.080> one<00:01:16.409> drive<00:01:17.280> grub<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.470> accept<00:01:19.470> our

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
so that's one drive grub and accept our

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.789 
so that's one drive grub and accept our
drive<00:01:19.979> drop<00:01:20.310> by<00:01:20.670> hitting<00:01:20.850> accept<00:01:21.360> eg<00:01:21.799> now

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
drive drop by hitting accept eg now

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.070 
drive drop by hitting accept eg now
you're<00:01:23.130> going<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.580> go<00:01:23.729> back<00:01:24.000> on<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> left<00:01:24.630> side

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
you're going to go back on the left side

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.560 
you're going to go back on the left side
here<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.619> select<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.310> other<00:01:26.820> tool<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:29.570> add

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
here and select the other tool and add

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:41.289 
here and select the other tool and add
to<00:01:31.020> earn<00:01:33.650> accept<00:01:37.009> DG<00:01:38.009> back<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.420> update<00:01:39.780> driver

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
to earn accept DG back the update driver

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.240 
to earn accept DG back the update driver
so<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.689> created<00:01:43.170> two<00:01:43.409> separate<00:01:43.920> Drive<00:01:44.250> grubs

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
so it created two separate Drive grubs

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.300 
so it created two separate Drive grubs
now<00:01:47.250> hit<00:01:47.520> next

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.399 

okay<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.700> can<00:01:54.030> see<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:55.970> array

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
okay so you can see you have to array

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.960 
okay so you can see you have to array
here<00:01:58.880> so<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.420> need<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.960> add<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.320> span<00:02:01.979> both<00:02:02.790> of

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
here so you need to add to span both of

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:03.380 
here so you need to add to span both of
them

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
them

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.139 
them
I<00:02:04.939> had<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.970> dry<00:02:06.479> crop<00:02:06.979> one<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.310> now<00:02:08.519> right<00:02:08.849> group

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
I had a dry crop one and now right group

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:19.339 
I had a dry crop one and now right group
2<00:02:09.450> are<00:02:09.720> 0<00:02:10.349> or<00:02:11.009> 1<00:02:12.530> now<00:02:13.530> click<00:02:14.010> Next<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:18.170> will<00:02:19.170> have

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
2 are 0 or 1 now click Next I will have

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.920 
2 are 0 or 1 now click Next I will have
this<00:02:19.590> option<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.190> right<00:02:20.430> right<00:02:20.760> 10<00:02:21.030> otherwise

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
this option of right right 10 otherwise

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.020 
this option of right right 10 otherwise
you<00:02:22.170> wouldn't<00:02:22.530> get<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.040> rate<00:02:23.310> an<00:02:23.580> option

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
you wouldn't get this rate an option

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.620 
you wouldn't get this rate an option
