00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.670
 hello to all welcome to the iphone 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.380
 tweak tv for a new video tutorial 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.809
 today I am going to present you a 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.340
 tweak it's called ap cap and will you 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.199
 to manage the number of 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.850
 launches of one of your applications in 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.140
 according to certain criteria like the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.150
 time frequency etc 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.560
 for that you go to 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.060
 settings after installing the tweak 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.580
 you go to the section that 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.650
 is called ac cap you turn on the tweak 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.510
 if it is already turn off the most 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.040
 reactive and it will avoid some 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.329
 problems 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.469
 you then return the name of 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.760
 the application to whoever you want 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.070
 apply restrictions 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.250
 I will choose the mobile browser 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.100
 safari I enter the name of the application 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.660
 as it surely is springboard you 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.969
 then choose an action either 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.629
 disabled the launch be displayed a 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.480
 notification 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.010
 I 'm going to disable the launch and 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.930
 now I will choose when 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.550
 apply the restrictions first 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.239
 I will choose the number of launch 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.250
 of the application 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.409
 I put on ron I will choose by 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.930
 example after three launch of 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.270
 the game app would disable the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.180
 launching the application you 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.250
 choose what time so I 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.180
 going active and I'm going to put between a 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.670
 hour of the afternoon and 8 hours of 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.229
 the afternoon 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.290
 you also choose and the frequency or 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.450
 put on own I will choose apply 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.140
 these changes all three 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.090
 hours for example I also choose the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.630
 days to which to apply these 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.210
 restrictions 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.100
 so if you put limit salutes 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.850
 mithra everyday I'm going 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.409
 choose Wednesday tuesday 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.180
 finally the limit is rather 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.869
 apply the restrictions to certain 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.909
 days of the week 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.409
 so if you clear Monday there is 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.600
 have no such restrictions for life 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.210
 so I remain active and limits of 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.380
 Killer of the windows ie 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.360
 Tuesday and Wednesday 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.610
 I'm coming back the tree they could 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.439
 choose whether or not to activate the restrictions 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.670
 when we are not wifi there by 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.899
 example if I put wifi only game 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.640
 could activate these restrictions 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.149
 only that I am connected to a 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.120
 wi fi network so here's the little one 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.980
 reset athletes section at next lounge 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.180
 ie you apply the 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.549
 changes and you want to put everything back 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.349
 the changes to zero so that all 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.819
 the applications to which you have 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.180
 applied the instructions get back to 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.680
 zero 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.120
 so now i'm going to launch safari 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.680
 I had applied the changes for 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.049
 three times so I have the right to launch 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.420
 three times alas g of bacon threw three 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.819
 times so he puts me the price miles to 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.349
 wait three orbiters using safari from 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.970
 ghayne say that I have to wait 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.730
 three hours now in order to be able to 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.540
 revive safari so that's it 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.849
 what does this tweak offer 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.069
 it is available for free on rest 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.569
