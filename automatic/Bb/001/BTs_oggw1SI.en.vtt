00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
what makes them so so good is that they

let's<00:00:51.629> talk<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> little<00:00:51.930> bit<00:00:52.230> about<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
let's talk a little bit about the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.369 
let's talk a little bit about the
defense<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.160> we're<00:00:53.280> gonna<00:00:53.370> go<00:00:53.610> over<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
defense so we're gonna go over the

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.630 
defense so we're gonna go over the
4-2-3-1<00:00:55.379> formation<00:00:55.649> which<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.460> most

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
4-2-3-1 formation which is the most

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.860 
4-2-3-1 formation which is the most
common<00:00:56.969> formation<00:00:57.360> you're<00:00:57.420> gonna<00:00:57.570> run<00:00:57.780> up

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
common formation you're gonna run up

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.349 
common formation you're gonna run up
against<00:00:58.260> if<00:00:58.379> you're<00:00:58.980> facing<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.789> Bayern<00:01:00.059> Munich

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
against if you're facing a Bayern Munich

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.760 
against if you're facing a Bayern Munich
player<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.870> that's<00:01:01.199> because<00:01:01.469> they<00:01:01.590> just

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
player and that's because they just

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.349 
player and that's because they just
their<00:01:01.949> whole<00:01:02.070> squad<00:01:02.370> fills<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.789> out<00:01:02.850> great

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
their whole squad fills that out great

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.380 
their whole squad fills that out great
so<00:01:03.750> you've<00:01:03.870> got<00:01:04.019> no<00:01:04.199> angle<00:01:04.650> who<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:06.150> best

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
so you've got no angle who is the best

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.270 
so you've got no angle who is the best
keeper<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:06.990> FIFA<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.680> year<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.890> think<00:01:08.070> that

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
keeper in FIFA this year I think that

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.770 
keeper in FIFA this year I think that
he's<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> most<00:01:08.729> consistent<00:01:08.939> he<00:01:09.450> makes<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.689> lot

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
he's the most consistent he makes a lot

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.260 
he's the most consistent he makes a lot
of<00:01:09.840> great<00:01:10.049> saves<00:01:10.500> he<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.729> tough<00:01:12.000> for

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
of great saves he just it's tough for

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.149 
of great saves he just it's tough for
any<00:01:12.479> opponent<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> score<00:01:13.260> goals<00:01:13.290> ondoy<00:01:13.920> he's

you're<00:01:43.229> playing<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.649> 4-2-3-1<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:45.000> need

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
you're playing in the 4-2-3-1 you need

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.880 
you're playing in the 4-2-3-1 you need
to<00:01:45.240> play<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.689> defensive<00:01:46.110> mentality<00:01:46.290> and

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
to play on the defensive mentality and

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.550 
to play on the defensive mentality and
then<00:01:47.369> counter-attack<00:01:48.299> tactic<00:01:48.720> tactic

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
then counter-attack tactic tactic

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.050 
then counter-attack tactic tactic
counter<00:01:49.920> attack<00:01:50.100> counter<00:01:50.399> attack<00:01:50.670> counter

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
counter attack counter attack counter

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.639 
counter attack counter attack counter
attack<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:52.020> reason<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.290> say<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.470> is

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
attack and the reason I say that is

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.410 
attack and the reason I say that is
because

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
because

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.490 
because
rebury<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.630> Robin<00:01:54.930> aren't<00:01:55.110> gonna<00:01:55.200> play<00:01:55.350> any

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
rebury and Robin aren't gonna play any

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.840 
rebury and Robin aren't gonna play any
defense<00:01:55.860> for<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.070> that's<00:01:56.340> not<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.670> their<00:01:56.820> DNA

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
defense for you that's not in their DNA

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.630 
defense for you that's not in their DNA
they're<00:01:57.630> not<00:01:57.780> out<00:01:57.930> there<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.560> make<00:01:59.130> tackles

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
they're not out there to make tackles

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.950 
they're not out there to make tackles
that's<00:01:59.969> they're<00:02:00.270> not<00:02:00.420> gonna<00:02:00.509> intercept

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
that's they're not gonna intercept

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.929 
that's they're not gonna intercept
passes<00:02:01.110> forget<00:02:01.619> about<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.670> they<00:02:02.790> are

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
passes forget about it but they are

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.030 
passes forget about it but they are
going<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.450> be<00:02:03.600> able<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.869> score<00:02:04.110> goals<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.710> make

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
going to be able to score goals and make

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.800 
going to be able to score goals and make
things<00:02:05.250> happen<00:02:05.369> on<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.640> offensive<00:02:06.329> side<00:02:06.360> of

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
things happen on the offensive side of

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.050 
things happen on the offensive side of
the<00:02:07.469> pitch<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.459> need<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.819> be<00:02:08.910> on<00:02:09.030> that

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
the pitch so you need to be on that

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.339 
the pitch so you need to be on that
counter-attack<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.869> that's<00:02:10.020> why<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.200> need

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
counter-attack and that's why you need

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.730 
counter-attack and that's why you need
to<00:02:10.410> have<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.590> defensive<00:02:11.039> mentality

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
to have the defensive mentality

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.140 
to have the defensive mentality
and<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.010> next<00:02:12.250> formation<00:02:12.490> we're<00:02:12.730> looking<00:02:13.000> at

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
and the next formation we're looking at

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.810 
and the next formation we're looking at
is<00:02:13.360> my<00:02:14.290> favorite<00:02:14.710> with<00:02:15.100> Bayern<00:02:15.370> Munich<00:02:15.700> the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
is my favorite with Bayern Munich the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.240 
is my favorite with Bayern Munich the
4-3-3<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.630> attacking<00:02:16.960> setup<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.800> that's

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
4-3-3 and the attacking setup and that's

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.740 
4-3-3 and the attacking setup and that's
because<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:18.760> just<00:02:18.850> feels<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:19.270> natural<00:02:19.420> with

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
because it just feels so natural with

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.200 
because it just feels so natural with
them<00:02:19.960> and<00:02:20.230> having<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:20.980> big<00:02:21.310> physical<00:02:21.850> striker

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
them and having a big physical striker

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.950 
them and having a big physical striker
like<00:02:22.480> Gomez<00:02:22.930> up<00:02:23.200> fits<00:02:23.860> perfectly<00:02:24.520> with<00:02:25.390> these

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
like Gomez up fits perfectly with these

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.290 
like Gomez up fits perfectly with these

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
eight they're just kind of a high number

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.670 
eight they're just kind of a high number
actually<00:03:27.760> with<00:03:28.240> Bayern<00:03:28.900> Munich<00:03:29.260> II<00:03:29.380> yeah<00:03:29.650> I

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
actually with Bayern Munich II yeah I

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.320 
actually with Bayern Munich II yeah I
didn't<00:03:30.130> think<00:03:30.280> I'd<00:03:30.340> even<00:03:30.370> concede<00:03:31.150> eight

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
didn't think I'd even concede eight

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.690 
didn't think I'd even concede eight
goals<00:03:31.570> and<00:03:31.870> I<00:03:32.410> did<00:03:32.620> lose<00:03:32.830> a<00:03:32.890> game<00:03:33.160> when<00:03:33.340> I<00:03:33.370> hate

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
goals and I did lose a game when I hate

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.250 
goals and I did lose a game when I hate
losing<00:03:34.060> when<00:03:34.180> you're<00:03:34.270> using<00:03:34.420> premium<00:03:34.780> teams

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
losing when you're using premium teams

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.160 
losing when you're using premium teams
because<00:03:36.010> Bayern<00:03:36.340> Munich<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:37.510> me<00:03:37.660> is<00:03:37.780> just<00:03:37.990> one

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
because Bayern Munich to me is just one

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.010 
because Bayern Munich to me is just one
of<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.410> elite<00:03:39.340> squads<00:03:39.820> this<00:03:40.090> year<00:03:40.360> and<00:03:40.570> I

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
of the elite squads this year and I

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.240 
of the elite squads this year and I
don't<00:03:41.050> need<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.350> be<00:03:41.440> losing<00:03:41.740> games<00:03:41.920> with<00:03:42.100> them

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
don't need to be losing games with them

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.560 
don't need to be losing games with them
but<00:03:42.400> sometimes<00:03:42.580> that's<00:03:42.880> how<00:03:43.000> it<00:03:43.090> goes

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
but sometimes that's how it goes

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.020 
but sometimes that's how it goes
it's<00:03:43.900> how<00:03:43.990> the<00:03:44.080> cookie<00:03:44.410> crumbles<00:03:44.440> you<00:03:45.100> also<00:03:45.760> go

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
it's how the cookie crumbles you also go

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.540 
it's how the cookie crumbles you also go
up<00:03:46.150> against<00:03:46.510> almost<00:03:46.990> all<00:03:47.530> Real<00:03:48.010> Madrid

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
up against almost all Real Madrid

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.250 
up against almost all Real Madrid
players<00:03:48.820> when<00:03:49.360> you're<00:03:49.510> using<00:03:49.660> Bayern<00:03:49.930> Munich

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
players when you're using Bayern Munich

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.020 
players when you're using Bayern Munich
or<00:03:50.380> you're<00:03:50.620> matched<00:03:50.770> up<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:51.100> mere<00:03:51.460> match<00:03:51.670> first

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
or you're matched up a mere match first

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.400 
or you're matched up a mere match first
Bayern<00:03:52.300> Munich<00:03:52.660> I<00:03:52.780> don't<00:03:52.960> know<00:03:53.050> how<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.260> a

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
Bayern Munich I don't know how the a

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.810 
Bayern Munich I don't know how the a
decides<00:03:53.920> these<00:03:54.100> kind<00:03:54.310> of<00:03:54.340> things<00:03:54.550> but<00:03:54.730> that's

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
decides these kind of things but that's

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.490 
decides these kind of things but that's
what<00:03:55.060> it<00:03:55.150> felt<00:03:55.330> like<00:03:55.420> when<00:03:55.690> I<00:03:55.720> was<00:03:55.810> playing<00:03:56.170> in

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
what it felt like when I was playing in

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.260 
what it felt like when I was playing in
the<00:03:56.800> last<00:03:57.010> formation<00:03:57.490> we<00:03:57.550> got<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.820> four<00:03:58.030> three

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
the last formation we got the four three

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.790 
the last formation we got the four three
two<00:03:58.480> one<00:03:58.690> which<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:59.020> one<00:03:59.200> of<00:03:59.290> my<00:03:59.350> favorite

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
two one which is one of my favorite

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.940 
two one which is one of my favorite
formations<00:04:00.310> this<00:04:01.120> year<00:04:01.360> in<00:04:01.540> FIFA<00:04:01.960> and<00:04:02.200> I<00:04:02.710> use

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
formations this year in FIFA and I use

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.820 
formations this year in FIFA and I use
it<00:04:02.980> to<00:04:03.550> pressure<00:04:04.150> once<00:04:04.810> again<00:04:05.080> like<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.410> 4-3-3

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
it to pressure once again like the 4-3-3

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.890 
it to pressure once again like the 4-3-3
it's<00:04:06.100> very<00:04:06.310> similar<00:04:06.790> and<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:07.420> actually<00:04:07.570> brought

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
it's very similar and I actually brought

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.170 
it's very similar and I actually brought
on<00:04:08.110> Shaqiri<00:04:08.560> to<00:04:09.160> add<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.340> little<00:04:09.670> more<00:04:09.820> speed

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
on Shaqiri to add a little more speed

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.199 
on Shaqiri to add a little more speed
and<00:04:10.510> just<00:04:11.080> go<00:04:11.500> forward<00:04:11.800> and<00:04:12.190> see<00:04:13.090> what

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
and just go forward and see what

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.580 
and just go forward and see what
happened<00:04:13.510> it<00:04:13.600> was<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.780> little<00:04:13.990> bit<00:04:14.110> of<00:04:14.170> a<00:04:14.230> risky

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
happened it was a little bit of a risky

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.979 
happened it was a little bit of a risky
move<00:04:14.910> because<00:04:15.910> he's<00:04:16.060> not<00:04:16.330> good<00:04:16.690> on<00:04:16.900> the

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
move because he's not good on the

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:17.800 
move because he's not good on the
defensive<00:04:17.380> end

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
defensive end

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.170 
defensive end
and<00:04:17.959> I<00:04:18.410> didn't<00:04:18.739> really<00:04:19.190> replace<00:04:19.519> anybody<00:04:20.030> on

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
and I didn't really replace anybody on

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.729 
and I didn't really replace anybody on
there<00:04:20.389> with<00:04:20.540> defense<00:04:20.930> because<00:04:21.200> Mulder<00:04:21.500> is<00:04:21.709> a

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
there with defense because Mulder is a

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.260 
there with defense because Mulder is a
pretty<00:04:22.040> balanced<00:04:22.490> midfielder<00:04:23.000> but<00:04:23.030> he's

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
pretty balanced midfielder but he's

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.300 
pretty balanced midfielder but he's
trying<00:04:23.570> to<00:04:23.630> get<00:04:23.720> forward<00:04:24.020> a<00:04:24.080> score<00:04:24.380> so<00:04:24.620> in<00:04:25.220> the

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
trying to get forward a score so in the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.770 
trying to get forward a score so in the
four<00:04:25.550> three<00:04:26.000> two<00:04:26.270> one

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
four three two one

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.020 
four three two one
and<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.620> only<00:04:27.800> defensive<00:04:28.370> option<00:04:28.730> I<00:04:28.820> have<00:04:29.000> is

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
and the only defensive option I have is

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.950 
and the only defensive option I have is
Gustavo<00:04:29.680> which<00:04:30.680> is<00:04:30.919> that<00:04:31.330> at<00:04:32.330> least<00:04:32.450> I<00:04:32.600> got<00:04:32.720> one

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
Gustavo which is that at least I got one

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.020 
Gustavo which is that at least I got one
back<00:04:33.200> there<00:04:33.440> but<00:04:33.740> that's<00:04:34.340> gonna<00:04:34.520> be<00:04:34.610> a<00:04:34.700> lot<00:04:34.880> of

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
back there but that's gonna be a lot of

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.430 
back there but that's gonna be a lot of
space<00:04:35.270> in<00:04:35.540> the<00:04:35.690> midfield<00:04:35.870> for<00:04:36.169> you<00:04:36.230> to<00:04:36.320> be

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
space in the midfield for you to be

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.110 
space in the midfield for you to be
counter-attack<00:04:37.010> especially<00:04:37.669> you're<00:04:37.790> pushing

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
counter-attack especially you're pushing

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.700 
counter-attack especially you're pushing
up<00:04:38.240> like<00:04:38.389> I<00:04:38.510> am<00:04:38.660> I<00:04:38.780> like<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:38.990> play<00:04:39.110> balanced<00:04:39.590> or

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
up like I am I like to play balanced or

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.260 
up like I am I like to play balanced or

attacking sometimes with the four three
two<00:04:41.419> one<00:04:41.660> and<00:04:41.840> I<00:04:42.680> like<00:04:42.860> also<00:04:43.370> to<00:04:43.730> be<00:04:43.880> narrow

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
two one and I like also to be narrow

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.960 
two one and I like also to be narrow
everybody<00:04:45.260> pushed<00:04:45.470> in<00:04:45.650> a<00:04:45.740> lot<00:04:45.919> closer<00:04:46.190> and<00:04:46.580> I
