00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.700 
staying on the with the fifth string
root<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.670> it's<00:02:43.330> your<00:02:43.600> choice<00:02:43.630> I<00:02:44.020> think<00:02:44.110> she

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
root so it's your choice I think she

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.200 
root so it's your choice I think she
actually<00:02:45.660> goes<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.930> sixth<00:02:47.260> string<00:02:48.210> but

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
actually goes to the sixth string but

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.940 
actually goes to the sixth string but
whatever<00:02:49.510> you<00:02:49.720> feel<00:02:49.930> like<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.230> want<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.440> do<00:02:50.590> do

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
whatever you feel like you want to do do

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.920 
whatever you feel like you want to do do
it<00:02:51.070> it's<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.400> exact<00:02:51.730> same<00:02:51.940> chord<00:02:52.300> exact<00:02:52.690> same

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
it it's the exact same chord exact same

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.270 
it it's the exact same chord exact same
notes<00:02:53.260> so<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:53.500> don't<00:02:53.710> have<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:53.950> worry<00:02:54.130> about

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
notes so you don't have to worry about

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.340 
notes so you don't have to worry about
playing<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.240> a<00:02:55.390> right<00:02:55.660> or<00:02:55.810> wrong<00:02:55.840> way<00:02:56.200> because

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
playing it a right or wrong way because

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:04.820 
playing it a right or wrong way because
it's<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.710> same<00:02:56.920> thing

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
exact same thing as the a section C v g5

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.980 
exact same thing as the a section C v g5
f<00:04:40.080> 5c

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:59.000 

five<00:04:47.640> five<00:04:48.640> or<00:04:49.450> again<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:49.840> arpeggiation

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.710 

and<00:05:00.010> that's<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.400> whole<00:05:00.550> song<00:05:00.850> it's<00:05:01.180> great<00:05:01.690> I

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
and that's the whole song it's great I

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.630 
and that's the whole song it's great I
think<00:05:01.990> it's<00:05:02.140> a<00:05:02.260> great<00:05:02.590> song<00:05:02.860> if<00:05:03.130> you're<00:05:03.280> just

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
think it's a great song if you're just

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.510 
think it's a great song if you're just
getting<00:05:03.940> into<00:05:04.090> power<00:05:04.450> chords<00:05:05.190> because<00:05:06.190> it's

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
getting into power chords because it's

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.710 
getting into power chords because it's
only<00:05:06.760> a<00:05:06.940> couple<00:05:07.210> different<00:05:07.750> shapes<00:05:08.050> and<00:05:09.720> it's

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
only a couple different shapes and it's

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.720 
only a couple different shapes and it's
relatively<00:05:11.350> simple<00:05:11.620> it's<00:05:11.890> a<00:05:11.920> little<00:05:12.280> bit<00:05:12.400> fast

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
relatively simple it's a little bit fast

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.630 
relatively simple it's a little bit fast
