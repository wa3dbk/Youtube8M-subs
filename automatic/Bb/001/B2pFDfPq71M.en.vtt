00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:04.030
 hi to all from iphon assist 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.090
 we have opened an iphon 3gs 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.799
 as you see the glass for mourning 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:12.839
 we must change this visa 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.689
 let's see this aifon 3gs 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:18.210
 if we go 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.720
 on the right side 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.390
 we notice that it is not there 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.300
 the part of the black ribbon means this 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.199
 that these phones already been opened crossed aspic can be seen this way 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.690
 it lacks 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:33.800
 tape 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.300
 you see it on the side 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.770
 of the key. 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.010
 here is a sticky adhesive tape that should not be there 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.930
 someone put it there I don't think that 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.480
 without opening it, you can either go 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.140
 another thing to note immediately 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.750
 and that the lcd screen has been changed is no longer the original one 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.650
 and they changed it with one 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.710
 as can be said with a non-original epol screen 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.620
 this connector is not the one that turns it off, and palms it 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.890
 serial from bed approached him 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.060
 and see that there is nothing on these other dogs for example 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.550
 that of the 1 - 2 legal connector is not connected 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.160
 if you want we will notice that the serial number of the original apple is e 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.750
 also this one other than the audio part 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.500
 here is original 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.450
 so it was opened 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.900
 the lcd has already been changed 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.900
 we want to change the title of this instead 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.570
 with 3gs 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.570
 we must first remove the lcd screen 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.870
 so let's get started 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.870
 let's mount the screw up here 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.860
 these screws are all the same so there is no problem to put them all together 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.420
 there are then 2pt on this side 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.420
 this is the audio part then right side 2dt 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.550
 one of these 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.660
 dismantle 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.170
 they come away easily 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.690
 how can you see why 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.300
 it has already been opened but in any case usually the name that these screws are 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:16.839
 so difficult to remove left side tripiti a quiche here one here 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:17.729
 fault. 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:19.919
 dismantle 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.919
 let's start from this he's dead 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:37.399
 and finally head down 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.289
 twist these vines 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:45.449
 we can free the lct screen 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:48.449
 we put ourselves condemned we start rialto 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:52.269
 the button as down we turn 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.599
 we press the slotted screwdriver I have fouled 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.659
 and let's act on the two side parts to free the lamina 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:03.339
 the arrest 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:05.979
 you start from right to left 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:07.339
 differences 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:10.049
 all you need to do is get in the way 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.749
 and literatura the destroyed part was freed we do the left part 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.029
 tells the left side 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:29.139
 you see 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:30.739
 the screen 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.769
 it is freeing itself 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.769
 we can challenge the arrest slowly 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:38.289
 and now 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:40.709
 the part comes 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.299
 complicated 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.249
 connect our forum we must 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:47.779
 heat 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:51.169
 the glass which is everything not to remove it 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.389
 from the surface and then release it as you could 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.109
 change the glass 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:01.450
 all right then, let's see if we can stop this need stop 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.109
 to think our source we have put aside
