00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
out just like you're sewing that way you

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.649 
out just like you're sewing that way you
can<00:01:05.220> go<00:01:05.369> ahead<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.760> try<00:01:05.939> these<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.540> see

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
can go ahead and try these on and see

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.090 
can go ahead and try these on and see
how<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.840> pattern<00:01:07.049> looks<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.590> because

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
how the pattern looks on because

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.320 
how the pattern looks on because
sometimes<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.760> looks<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.000> little<00:01:09.119> bit

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
sometimes it looks a little bit

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.090 
sometimes it looks a little bit
different<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.930> flat<00:01:10.260> surface<00:01:10.439> versus<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
different on a flat surface versus the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.160 
different on a flat surface versus the
round<00:01:11.310> surface<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.880> your<00:01:12.000> body<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.960> make<00:01:13.140> sure

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
round surface of your body so make sure

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.870 
round surface of your body so make sure
that<00:01:13.320> all<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> pointy<00:01:14.040> ends<00:01:14.220> are<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.640> top<00:01:14.850> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
that all the pointy ends are on top of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.490 
that all the pointy ends are on top of
the<00:01:15.119> shorts<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.689> way<00:01:15.810> they<00:01:15.930> don't<00:01:16.049> poke<00:01:16.320> you

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the shorts that way they don't poke you

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.960 
the shorts that way they don't poke you
and<00:01:16.710> then<00:01:17.159> once<00:01:17.340> you've<00:01:17.430> got<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.670> done<00:01:17.790> you

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
and then once you've got that done you

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.609 
and then once you've got that done you
can<00:01:18.000> go<00:01:18.210> ahead<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.630> try<00:01:18.750> them<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.020> now<00:01:19.259> it's

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
can go ahead and try them on now it's

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.080
