00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hello my name is Ali or not a book about 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.429
 which I will tell so the trilogy time i 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.530
 lose which i'm quite literally 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.860
 I recently read what I can say about 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.139
 this 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.260
 about these books would like it to be 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.480
 not three different books 1 but plump 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.340
 because actually the whole event in 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.880
 this book takes place literally at 2 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.300
 of the week 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.849
 why was it necessary to break all the events on 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.250
 Separately three books I do not know which 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.779
 I rated this book first 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.360
 when I started I thought that I 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.360
 I will put 5 5 new closer picking up 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.059
 the end, I realized that most likely I 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.670
 put so foursome nowhere because 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.180
 I did not quite understand the ending I did not understand 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.370
 what happened there and why it all happened 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.890
 so how come I'd like to throw 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.789
 talk about this book with spoilers 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.770
 because 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.680
 to explain to me what is the essence 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.649
 finally the ending briefly about this 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.300
 the book girl of his 17th birthday understands that 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.730
 she can travel through time 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.650
 and in all her generation someone one 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.409
 could move in time all up 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.750
 On her 18th birthday, gwendolyn thought it was 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.150
 her sister is more accurate cousin 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.549
 cousin charlotte but it goes without saying 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.790
 plot development turns out to be a niche 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.080
 like this gwendolyn and this is the first time she 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.509
 moves in time she is not a movie 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.030
 understands what is happening well, sort of like everything 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.290
 went fine and and nobody there 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.360
 whips do not have anything like it 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.310
 what mortal danger by itself 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.930
 the plot begins to twist starting at 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.970
 more often get into the past but already 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.189
 systematically using strange 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.140
 a device called a chronograph 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.970
 using it and using your booth 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.770
 blood time travelers can 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.740
 go already in a given period 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.840
 time there is a bunch of rules and then the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.729
 despite the fact that the traveler can not 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.110
 be driven into the past by more than 5 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.610
 hours otherwise then you some 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.350
 consequences he can't contract 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.390
 to contact someone from the past 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.430
 change that is, he cannot 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.560
 travel past your period 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.299
 when he already lives a lot of everything 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.670
 the rest of course gwendolyn nothing 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.200
 this does not know because no one in 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.360
 it did not dedicate anything to her 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.560
 a very strictest secret fool leads 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.270
 myself in the past because she doesn't know 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.730
 how to file herself she knows nothing of 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.069
 stories she does not know how to properly 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.550
 talk about from curtsy his fan 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.770
 dance in just 3-4 days and and teach 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.720
 dancing my teaches how to speak 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.060
 on this gwendolen not so easy because 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.760
 that gwendolyn has a secret gift 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.420
 which is to the top of everything here 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.610
 This constellation 12-12 travelers 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.920
 Of course he says he understands that no 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.750
 especially he has no gift she does not see him 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.959
 also not to see others is a gift and all 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.000
 think that the magic of crows is a legend 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.830
 besides this gwendolyn has another 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.470
 rare gift and she can communicate with 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.930
 ghosts with spirits with demons and with 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.040
 the second part appears amazing 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.940
 character who 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.010
 name is perfume he is a demon and he just 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.380
 awesome i over each of his cues and 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.420
 so burst out laughing I want myself 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.730
 such before cooking water monitors want to 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.799
 I flew this creature and spoke and 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.630
 what a ridiculous thing I would be 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.400

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.049
 thanks to him, he is just a miracle 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.150
 for his sake you can read all these books 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.950
 because otherwise if 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.170
 consider heroes nothing in them 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.420
 this surprising itself heroine 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.459
 who almost fool almost fool 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.100
 the guy who is a knight on a white horse 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.350
 He is in love with the main character on the ears have 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.480
 her best friend who is a genius to everyone 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.760
 helps by itself this guy miracle

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.239
 riddle of this whole trilogy want to give 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.760
 the trilogy I liked it colorful 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.739
 on bright it is funny you can really 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.630
 it would be a little more to continue further 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.209
 because what ends from a little bit 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.220
 smeared as if its already just 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.370
 sucked from the finger really 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.780

 decent teenage literature she 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.610
 much more worthy than the other one now 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.290
 go out read that eye rejoice 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.390
 despite the fact that u would have it 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.410
 so thick not fat I read 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:40.680
