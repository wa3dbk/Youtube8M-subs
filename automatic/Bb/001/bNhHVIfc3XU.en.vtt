00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.300
 Lance of ears for the louse miguel 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.860
 herrera and is that the directive 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.630
 full americanist asked his 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.700
 helmsman to refrain from statements 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.260
 as controversial as those that made a medium 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.660
 of communication against Miguel Mejía 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.820
 former technical baron of the tri he criticized 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.010
 for their sexual preferences let's say 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.960
 the directive is not that usually not 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.940
 they like me not to do that kind of 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.380
 statements I'm committing fire 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.750
 because I do not have to be thinking about the 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.340
 people who are not in the middle us 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.829
 let's cut to the bone of this topic 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.480
 It is not going to talk more 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.579
 what he has to say I said it already 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.920
 ended up there I say is not happy 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.820
 with that then we're going to cut so 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.739
 healthy 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.739
 let's cut through the angles 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.379
 that's why we're going to cut to the bone if 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.940
 Cashew time should not be so if not 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.570
 they are upset they do not have that kind of 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.610
 claims 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.530
 Herrera flatly closed the subject 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.969
 and preferred to talk about his visit 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.219
 team next Friday to keep 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.199
 where centers will be measured with all 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.930
 support of its people not equal the new the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.970
 people are still enthusiastic at the last 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.190
 putting people we're going to need the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.229
 flu people and assert their condition 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:15.000
 of local is a people that demands that 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.920
 demand the difficult referee of the mante 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.350
 tries to intimidate the opponent with his 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.420
 screaming with your team's support not only 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.970
 making people for our people 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.380
 very very involved in his in his team and 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.030
 although oribe peralta gunner 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.979
 centers assured that before america is a 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.720
 duel plus the louse remembered when he 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.729
 he was out of coapa and said to measure himself 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.810
 the eagles will always be special not 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.819
 do not be a liar 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.920
 I think obviously they too 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:41.369
 all teams have to put on the rise 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.600
 your level of play and the word behind are and 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.850
 Suddenly say then that they are not 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.009
 special parties but not that they are 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.479
 liars and suddenly it is to protect a 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.550
 little bit also the interests of being a 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.810
 important team also saints that 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.570
 also 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.030
 people that's a stadium that people are 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.630
 mess with your team not then 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.040
 no doubt say america chivas are not 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.570
 teams that suddenly dress the 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.310
 parties does not say thousands of times when 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.810
 I was on other teams, I'm not 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.970
 say it today hear the other teams 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.190
 with others also strengthen a little 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.580
 their ego not feeling too 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.840
 strong is valid is valid but if 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.090
 america I'm sure it 's a match 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.520
 different from affective production for 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.260
 finish reaffirmed that his team does not 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.390
 obsesses superliderato and is that the 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.300
 true finish of leader in the table no 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.340
 it gives no advantage if it does not obsess us 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.230
 is something that we want because 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.269
 I think the team works for that 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.400
 to be in the best moment of the 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.980
 best tournament plans makes good 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.769
 parties already escaped us this end of 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.420
 week may dawn of leaders is not 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.980
 an obsession to say we want to be leaders 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.500
 because it's no use being a super leader 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.959
 as a session it is not think that if we want 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.900
 be super-leaders because the group knew 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.900
 that idea today depends on what we will study and 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.720
 I returned I did not know how to win his match 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.700
 to access that to that part of the 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.350
 table but we are going to try to be 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.819
 our work and then it will be the other 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.349
 how good no yes no 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.680
 we will go with the idea of ​​working as 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.680
 forever
