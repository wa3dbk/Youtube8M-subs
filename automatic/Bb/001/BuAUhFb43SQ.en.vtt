we could then do is say for instance
bring<00:02:47.609> this<00:02:47.730> up<00:02:48.139> slide<00:02:49.139> on<00:02:49.290> over<00:02:49.319> there<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:50.040> if

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
bring this up slide on over there and if

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.460 
bring this up slide on over there and if
we<00:02:50.280> wanted<00:02:50.579> to<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:51.090> could<00:02:51.329> you<00:02:51.540> know<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:52.230> don't

we wanted to you could you know I don't

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.770 
we wanted to you could you know I don't
know<00:02:52.560> just<00:02:52.769> let's<00:02:53.069> say<00:02:53.280> toggle<00:02:53.879> torch<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:54.599> from

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
know just let's say toggle torch so from

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.569 
know just let's say toggle torch so from
that<00:02:54.810> point<00:02:55.079> on<00:02:55.260> we<00:02:55.439> would<00:02:55.560> then<00:02:55.769> skip<00:02:56.220> on<00:02:56.370> over

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
that point on we would then skip on over

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:57.800 
that point on we would then skip on over
to<00:02:56.730> actually<00:02:57.000> if<00:02:57.090> we<00:02:57.120> go<00:02:57.299> from<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.629> home

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
to actually if we go from the home

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.899 
to actually if we go from the home
screen<00:02:57.840> here<00:02:58.319> drag<00:02:58.859> on<00:02:59.040> up<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.519> can<00:02:59.639> see<00:02:59.790> that

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
screen here drag on up you can see that

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.849 
screen here drag on up you can see that
the<00:03:00.000> torch<00:03:00.239> icon<00:03:00.629> is<00:03:00.810> there<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.200> then<00:03:01.709> of

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
the torch icon is there and then of

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.199 
the torch icon is there and then of
course<00:03:01.889> it<00:03:02.219> turns<00:03:02.400> on<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.669> torch<00:03:02.909> so<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.090> can

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
course it turns on the torch so you can

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.729 
course it turns on the torch so you can
add<00:03:03.329> for<00:03:03.689> whatever<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:04.109> is<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.379> you<00:03:04.469> want

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
add for whatever it is that you want

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.159 
add for whatever it is that you want
which<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.579> pretty<00:03:05.730> darn<00:03:06.000> cool<00:03:06.269> so<00:03:06.599> I<00:03:06.629> think<00:03:06.780> if

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169 
which is pretty darn cool so I think if

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.740 
which is pretty darn cool so I think if
we<00:03:07.379> plug<00:03:08.069> then<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.430> turns<00:03:08.669> it<00:03:08.819> off<00:03:08.939> nice<00:03:09.540> and

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
we plug then it turns it off nice and

number a bunch of times back

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.339 
number a bunch of times back
they're<00:04:17.879> that<00:04:18.060> thing<00:04:18.269> expands<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:19.049> gives<00:04:19.229> us

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
they're that thing expands and gives us

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.409 
they're that thing expands and gives us
the<00:04:19.470> options<00:04:19.889> or<00:04:20.280> access<00:04:20.699> to<00:04:20.849> them<00:04:20.939> sorry<00:04:21.180> for

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
the options or access to them sorry for

the options or access to them sorry for
performance<00:04:22.049> as<00:04:22.169> well<00:04:22.289> as<00:04:22.409> developer<00:04:22.860> options

so<00:04:23.310> jumping<00:04:23.970> into<00:04:24.120> performance<00:04:24.689> here<00:04:25.080> this<00:04:25.439> is

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
so jumping into performance here this is

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.170 
so jumping into performance here this is
where<00:04:25.710> if<00:04:25.979> you<00:04:26.280> wanted<00:04:26.699> to<00:04:26.789> you<00:04:26.939> can<00:04:27.030> either

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
where if you wanted to you can either

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.149 
where if you wanted to you can either

with the stock kernel it comes with an

with the stock kernel it comes with an
engine<00:04:29.370> mod<00:04:29.550> 11<00:04:29.939> you<00:04:30.090> can<00:04:30.120> either<00:04:30.330> underclock

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
engine mod 11 you can either underclock

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.330 
engine mod 11 you can either underclock
it<00:04:31.199> if<00:04:31.319> you<00:04:31.439> want<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:31.800> so<00:04:31.919> we<00:04:32.009> can<00:04:32.129> go<00:04:32.189> into

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
it if you want to so we can go into

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.369 
it if you want to so we can go into
processor<00:04:32.939> and<00:04:33.150> of<00:04:33.569> course<00:04:33.780> you<00:04:33.900> can<00:04:34.020> type<00:04:34.199> in

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:34.379 
processor and of course you can type in

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.589 
processor and of course you can type in
what<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.770> dialing<00:04:35.460> with<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.729> minimum<00:04:36.210> cpu

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
what the dialing with the minimum cpu

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:37.999 
what the dialing with the minimum cpu
frequency<00:04:36.810> is<00:04:37.199> if<00:04:37.319> you<00:04:37.409> really<00:04:37.620> want<00:04:37.800> to<00:04:37.860> save

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
frequency is if you really want to save

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.850 
frequency is if you really want to save
battery<00:04:38.430> life<00:04:38.750> as<00:04:39.750> well<00:04:39.930> as<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.199> maximum<00:04:40.650> if

you want to bump it up of course just

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.399 
you want to bump it up of course just

difference<00:05:24.210> so<00:05:24.389> I<00:05:24.419> have<00:05:24.690> noticed<00:05:25.409> difference

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
difference so I have noticed difference

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.369 
difference so I have noticed difference
in<00:05:25.860> performance<00:05:26.009> overall<00:05:27.050> of<00:05:28.050> course<00:05:28.259> you

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:28.379 
in performance overall of course you

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:30.140 
in performance overall of course you
also<00:05:28.529> have<00:05:28.830> kill<00:05:29.129> app<00:05:29.340> with<00:05:29.580> the<00:05:29.610> back<00:05:29.879> button

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
also have kill app with the back button

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.969 
also have kill app with the back button
but<00:05:30.419> that<00:05:30.690> can<00:05:30.990> also<00:05:31.139> be<00:05:31.319> achieved<00:05:31.740> through

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
but that can also be achieved through

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.610 
but that can also be achieved through
that<00:05:32.520> sort<00:05:33.389> of<00:05:33.419> swiping<00:05:33.690> up<00:05:33.900> from<00:05:33.960> their<00:05:34.379> thing

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
that sort of swiping up from their thing
