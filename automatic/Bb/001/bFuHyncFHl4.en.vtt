and<00:02:51.250> entertainers<00:02:51.670> are<00:02:51.850> liberals<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.510> they

think it actually might be something

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.780 
think it actually might be something
more<00:02:55.959> simple<00:02:56.260> than<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:57.040> as<00:02:57.220> someone<00:02:57.670> who
