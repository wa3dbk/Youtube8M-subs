00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
channel setup for mixing or you can even

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.690 
channel setup for mixing or you can even
attach<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.650> dial<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.160> program<00:02:13.550> it<00:02:13.670> for

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
attach it to the dial and program it for

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
attach it to the dial and program it for
that<00:02:13.970> as<00:02:14.120> well<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:15.110> it's<00:02:15.319> got<00:02:15.670> programmable

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
that as well so it's got programmable

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.449 
that as well so it's got programmable

features as you can move switches around

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.100 
features as you can move switches around
and<00:02:19.640> stuff<00:02:19.819> how<00:02:20.030> does<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.269> work<00:02:20.420> absolutely

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
and stuff how does that work absolutely

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.739 
and stuff how does that work absolutely
you<00:02:21.319> can<00:02:21.469> assign<00:02:21.769> the<00:02:21.950> different<00:02:22.310> menus<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:23.090> be

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:23.749 
you can assign the different menus to be

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:25.300 
you can assign the different menus to be
associated<00:02:24.319> with<00:02:24.349> either<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.829> lever<00:02:25.040> or<00:02:25.280> the

dual<00:02:31.970> speed<00:02:32.420> control<00:02:32.750> setups<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:33.920> you<00:02:34.010> can<00:02:34.250> do

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
dual speed control setups so you can do

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.580 
dual speed control setups so you can do
the<00:02:34.670> big<00:02:35.090> rock<00:02:35.390> crawlers<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:36.260> can<00:02:36.410> do<00:02:36.500> the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
the big rock crawlers and you can do the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.590 
the big rock crawlers and you can do the
smaller<00:02:36.830> ones<00:02:37.070> absolutely<00:02:38.060> you<00:02:38.210> can<00:02:38.360> do<00:02:38.450> the

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
smaller ones absolutely you can do the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.230 
smaller ones absolutely you can do the
the<00:02:38.630> 2.2<00:02:39.290> inch<00:02:39.560> crawlers<00:02:39.980> with<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:41.030> lock

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
the 2.2 inch crawlers with the the lock

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.330 
the 2.2 inch crawlers with the the lock
or<00:02:41.510> free<00:02:41.810> transmissions<00:02:42.740> or<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.100> could<00:02:43.250> do

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
or free transmissions or you could do

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.190 
or free transmissions or you could do
the<00:02:43.460> motor<00:02:43.670> on<00:02:43.880> axle<00:02:44.300> setups<00:02:44.630> for<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.870> larger

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
the motor on axle setups for the larger

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.930 
the motor on axle setups for the larger
super<00:02:45.500> scale<00:02:45.710> setups<00:02:46.130> so<00:02:46.400> there's<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.640> lot<00:02:46.820> of

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
super scale setups so there's a lot of

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.720 
super scale setups so there's a lot of
stuff<00:02:47.150> in<00:02:47.330> here<00:02:47.540> for<00:02:47.720> that<00:02:47.840> but<00:02:48.130> you<00:02:49.130> also<00:02:49.340> do

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
stuff in here for that but you also do

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.360 
stuff in here for that but you also do
on<00:02:50.000> road<00:02:50.360> racing<00:02:50.780> so<00:02:51.290> that<00:02:51.620> requires<00:02:52.010> high

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
on road racing so that requires high

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.730 
on road racing so that requires high
performance<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.480> can't<00:02:54.200> settle<00:02:54.530> for

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
performance you can't settle for

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.470 
performance you can't settle for
anything<00:02:54.980> slower<00:02:55.400> than<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.790> best<00:02:56.000> stuff<00:02:56.300> when

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
anything slower than the best stuff when

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.140 
anything slower than the best stuff when
you're<00:02:56.600> on<00:02:56.720> on-road<00:02:57.080> right<00:02:57.380> correct<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.310> this

mentioned<00:03:45.560> it<00:03:45.650> but<00:03:45.860> it's<00:03:46.370> got<00:03:46.519> a<00:03:46.550> really<00:03:46.640> new

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
mentioned it but it's got a really new

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.870 
mentioned it but it's got a really new
lightweight<00:03:47.780> new<00:03:48.320> case<00:03:48.980> there's<00:03:49.340> no<00:03:49.489> antenna

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
lightweight new case there's no antenna

lightweight new case there's no antenna
I<00:03:50.239> see<00:03:51.050> we've<00:03:51.200> got<00:03:51.350> an<00:03:51.560> extra<00:03:52.040> grip<00:03:52.310> here

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
I see we've got an extra grip here

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.540 
I see we've got an extra grip here
that's<00:03:52.760> different<00:03:54.100> so<00:03:55.100> this<00:03:55.220> thing<00:03:55.430> is

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
that's different so this thing is

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.090 
that's different so this thing is
customizable<00:03:56.239> too<00:03:56.480> right<00:03:56.720> absolutely<00:03:57.530> the

is or if you want a different feel for
the<00:04:24.590> radio<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:25.400> can<00:04:25.550> apply<00:04:25.850> it<00:04:25.910> where<00:04:26.270> it

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
the radio you can apply it where it

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.900 
the radio you can apply it where it
extends<00:04:26.930> it<00:04:26.990> out<00:04:27.110> further<00:04:27.530> or<00:04:27.890> closer<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:28.640> you

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
extends it out further or closer to you

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.590 
extends it out further or closer to you
for<00:04:29.120> a<00:04:29.150> better<00:04:29.360> reach<00:04:29.650> so<00:04:30.970> just<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.120> grip<00:04:32.360> and

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
for a better reach so just the grip and

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.659 
for a better reach so just the grip and
I<00:04:32.720> have<00:04:33.200> a<00:04:33.229> smaller<00:04:33.560> hand<00:04:33.830> so<00:04:34.070> I<00:04:34.100> like<00:04:34.430> the

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
I have a smaller hand so I like the

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.820 
I have a smaller hand so I like the
smaller<00:04:35.270> grip<00:04:35.510> that's<00:04:35.720> here<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.140> your<00:04:36.650> radio

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
smaller grip that's here and your radio

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.130 
smaller grip that's here and your radio
has<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.490> deeper<00:04:37.850> grip<00:04:38.060> so<00:04:38.390> whether<00:04:39.020> you've

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
has the deeper grip so whether you've

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.570 
has the deeper grip so whether you've
got<00:04:39.289> a<00:04:39.320> small<00:04:39.680> hand<00:04:40.010> or<00:04:40.190> big

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
got a small hand or big

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.520 
got a small hand or big
and<00:04:40.699> you<00:04:41.330> can<00:04:41.509> make<00:04:41.720> this<00:04:41.900> radio<00:04:42.259> feel

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
and you can make this radio feel

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.490 
and you can make this radio feel
comfortable<00:04:43.039> for<00:04:43.310> you<00:04:43.430> I<00:04:44.120> guess<00:04:44.990> we<00:04:45.259> need<00:04:45.379> to

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
comfortable for you I guess we need to

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.960 
comfortable for you I guess we need to
talk<00:04:45.680> about<00:04:45.710> what<00:04:46.099> everybody<00:04:46.310> wants<00:04:46.729> to<00:04:46.789> hear

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
talk about what everybody wants to hear

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.330 
talk about what everybody wants to hear
about<00:04:47.030> which<00:04:47.780> is<00:04:48.050> how<00:04:48.680> does<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:48.979> telemetry

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
about which is how does the telemetry

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.540 
about which is how does the telemetry
work<00:04:49.699> so<00:04:50.449> what<00:04:51.050> we'd<00:04:51.199> like<00:04:51.229> to<00:04:51.379> do<00:04:51.620> is<00:04:51.889> we've

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
work so what we'd like to do is we've

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.490 
work so what we'd like to do is we've
got<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:52.969> accelerator<00:04:53.689> set<00:04:53.990> up<00:04:54.110> here

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
got the accelerator set up here

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.399 
got the accelerator set up here

Craig's put in the sensors and let's

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:59.499 
Craig's put in the sensors and let's
show<00:04:57.590> you<00:04:57.650> exactly<00:04:58.009> how<00:04:58.219> it<00:04:58.430> works<00:04:58.610> this<00:04:59.330> is

it's<00:05:53.779> the<00:05:53.990> voltage<00:05:54.409> that<00:05:54.440> the<00:05:55.430> receiver<00:05:55.759> is

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:55.969 
it's the voltage that the receiver is

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:57.550 
it's the voltage that the receiver is
picking<00:05:56.330> up<00:05:56.509> and<00:05:56.779> then<00:05:56.900> sending<00:05:57.409> that

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
picking up and then sending that

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.529 
picking up and then sending that
information<00:05:57.740> back<00:05:58.250> to<00:05:58.520> the<00:05:58.639> transmitter

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539

the voltage from the speed control into
the<00:06:07.009> receiver<00:06:07.400> to<00:06:07.550> power<00:06:07.729> it<00:06:08.029> so<00:06:08.210> it's<00:06:08.360> usually

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
the receiver to power it so it's usually

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:09.670 
the receiver to power it so it's usually
around<00:06:08.779> five<00:06:09.139> volts

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
around five volts

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:04.489 
letting it just drain all the way out

00:07:04.489 --> 00:07:05.829 
letting it just drain all the way out
and<00:07:04.519> having<00:07:04.909> your<00:07:04.999> car<00:07:05.179> take<00:07:05.389> off<00:07:05.509> when<00:07:05.749> you

00:07:05.829 --> 00:07:05.839 
and having your car take off when you

and having your car take off when you
don't<00:07:06.019> want<00:07:06.169> it<00:07:06.259> to<00:07:06.409> yeah<00:07:06.979> that's<00:07:07.249> a<00:07:07.399> great

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:07.699 
don't want it to yeah that's a great

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:08.999

feature right

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:11.469 
feature right
so<00:07:10.009> it<00:07:10.129> adds<00:07:10.279> a<00:07:10.489> level<00:07:10.610> of<00:07:10.819> safety<00:07:10.879> that<00:07:11.419> you
