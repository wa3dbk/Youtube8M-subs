00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.870 

so<00:00:51.140> we<00:00:51.350> got<00:00:51.470> to<00:00:51.560> use<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:51.860> sanchez<00:00:52.340> to<00:00:52.550> collect

Stories<00:01:03.530> scrapyard<00:01:04.430> challenge<00:01:04.790> which<00:01:05.030> is

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
Stories scrapyard challenge which is

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.010 
Stories scrapyard challenge which is
exactly<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.260> same<00:01:06.440> principle<00:01:06.950> as<00:01:07.370> this<00:01:07.990> but<00:01:08.990> I

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
exactly the same principle as this but I

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.970 
exactly the same principle as this but I
guess<00:01:09.230> this<00:01:09.380> is<00:01:09.560> a<00:01:09.590> little<00:01:09.860> bit<00:01:09.950> easier<00:01:11.860> so<00:01:12.860> the

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
guess this is a little bit easier so the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.500 
guess this is a little bit easier so the
game<00:01:13.130> tells<00:01:13.400> us<00:01:13.580> to<00:01:13.700> collect<00:01:13.940> as<00:01:14.060> many<00:01:14.210> points

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
game tells us to collect as many points

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.410 
game tells us to collect as many points
as<00:01:14.750> possible<00:01:15.850> but<00:01:16.850> I<00:01:16.910> could<00:01:17.090> tell<00:01:17.180> you<00:01:17.300> that

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
as possible but I could tell you that

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.800 
as possible but I could tell you that
you<00:01:17.510> have<00:01:17.720> to<00:01:17.840> beat<00:01:17.990> at<00:01:18.110> least<00:01:18.320> twenty-five<00:01:19.810> so

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
you have to beat at least twenty-five so

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.180 
you have to beat at least twenty-five so
that<00:01:20.960> means<00:01:21.140> that<00:01:21.350> 26<00:01:22.040> is<00:01:22.190> the<00:01:22.220> minimum<00:01:24.190> and

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
that means that 26 is the minimum and

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.010 
that means that 26 is the minimum and
just<00:01:25.460> like<00:01:25.580> to<00:01:25.700> scrap<00:01:25.940> your<00:01:25.970> challenge<00:01:26.540> and

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
you're probably best stuff to collect as

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.390 
you're probably best stuff to collect as
many<00:01:29.540> of<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.869> easy<00:01:30.080> ones<00:01:30.500> first<00:01:33.130> so<00:01:34.130> I'm<00:01:34.220> just

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
when I covered that one back when I did

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.100 
when I covered that one back when I did
my<00:01:49.850> liberty<00:01:50.180> City<00:01:50.390> Stories<00:01:50.450> walkthrough

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
good now let's get this red one over

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.300 
good now let's get this red one over
here<00:03:02.030> oh<00:03:03.130> come<00:03:04.130> on

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
here oh come on

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.100

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.840 

okay<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.710> should<00:03:11.010> not<00:03:11.220> screw<00:03:11.670> up<00:03:11.700> right<00:03:12.120> now

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
okay I should not screw up right now

let's see
here's<00:03:15.660> another<00:03:15.780> easy<00:03:16.230> yellow<00:03:16.650> when<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:16.860> guess

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
here's another easy yellow when I guess

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:32.080 
here's another easy yellow when I guess
there<00:03:19.560> we<00:03:19.680> go

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:39.030 

oh<00:03:32.150> come<00:03:32.930> on

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:46.880 

Jesus

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.400 

all<00:03:47.890> right<00:03:48.099> another<00:03:48.430> amber<00:03:49.120> one<00:03:49.300> let's<00:03:50.050> try

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
all right another amber one let's try

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.270 
all right another amber one let's try
and<00:03:50.560> get<00:03:50.709> up<00:03:50.860> here<00:03:50.890> now<00:03:53.130> I'll<00:03:54.130> screw<00:03:54.489> this

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
and get up here now I'll screw this

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.920 
and get up here now I'll screw this
so<00:03:57.280> I<00:03:57.310> need<00:03:57.580> at<00:03:57.760> least<00:03:57.790> two<00:03:58.240> more<00:03:58.480> points<00:03:58.690> so

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
so I need at least two more points so

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:07.350 
so I need at least two more points so
let's<00:03:59.440> try<00:03:59.680> and<00:03:59.800> get<00:03:59.920> this<00:04:00.130> one<00:04:04.380> huh<00:04:06.360> school

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
let's try and get this one huh school

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.340 
let's try and get this one huh school
not<00:04:07.570> big<00:04:07.750> time<00:04:07.990> here

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
not big time here

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.380 
not big time here
luckily<00:04:08.680> my<00:04:08.950> bike<00:04:09.160> skill<00:04:09.430> was<00:04:09.580> pretty<00:04:09.880> high<00:04:10.120> so

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
luckily my bike skill was pretty high so

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.530 
luckily my bike skill was pretty high so
CJ<00:04:11.170> doesn't<00:04:11.440> fall<00:04:11.770> off<00:04:11.950> that<00:04:11.980> easily

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.360 

it's<00:04:17.110> probably<00:04:17.530> a<00:04:17.560> good<00:04:17.800> tip<00:04:18.040> for<00:04:18.070> this

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
it's probably a good tip for this

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.830 
it's probably a good tip for this
mission<00:04:18.730> to<00:04:18.820> get<00:04:18.970> your<00:04:19.120> bike<00:04:19.330> skill<00:04:19.630> up<00:04:19.780> a

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.580 

wasting<00:04:27.130> a<00:04:27.190> lot<00:04:27.430> of<00:04:27.610> time<00:04:27.850> here<00:04:28.170> but<00:04:29.170> I<00:04:29.230> got<00:04:29.410> it

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
wasting a lot of time here but I got it

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.140 
wasting a lot of time here but I got it
so<00:04:29.800> at<00:04:29.920> least<00:04:29.950> I've<00:04:30.310> beaten<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.760> challenge

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
now so now I can just play around and

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.010 
now so now I can just play around and
try<00:04:34.000> and<00:04:34.330> get<00:04:34.540> some<00:04:34.780> more<00:04:34.930> easy<00:04:35.200> ones<00:04:37.020> there's

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
try and get some more easy ones there's

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.989 
try and get some more easy ones there's
an<00:04:38.110> easy<00:04:38.260> green<00:04:38.620> one

00:04:41.989 --> 00:04:41.999 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:43.609 

okay<00:04:42.689> so<00:04:42.749> now<00:04:42.959> that<00:04:42.989> I've<00:04:43.259> passed<00:04:43.439> the

00:04:43.609 --> 00:04:43.619 
okay so now that I've passed the

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:51.840 
okay so now that I've passed the
challenge<00:04:43.979> might<00:04:44.159> as<00:04:44.279> well<00:04:44.429> try<00:04:44.729> this

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.270 

so<00:04:52.330> a<00:04:52.360> few<00:04:52.510> minutes<00:04:52.810> to<00:04:52.900> get<00:04:53.050> 26<00:04:53.710> then<00:04:53.980> you<00:04:54.100> can

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
so a few minutes to get 26 then you can

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.160 
so a few minutes to get 26 then you can
probably<00:04:54.520> relax<00:04:57.690> yeah<00:04:58.690> and<00:04:58.900> then<00:04:58.990> you're

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
probably relax yeah and then you're

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.480 
probably relax yeah and then you're
pretty<00:04:59.410> much<00:04:59.590> done<00:04:59.800> with<00:04:59.830> this<00:05:02.190> let's<00:05:03.190> see<00:05:03.340> if

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
pretty much done with this let's see if

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.560 
pretty much done with this let's see if
I<00:05:03.550> can<00:05:03.700> get<00:05:03.910> it<00:05:05.310> I'm<00:05:06.310> not<00:05:06.430> really<00:05:06.490> into<00:05:07.150> luck<00:05:07.540> I

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
I can get it I'm not really into luck I

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.220
