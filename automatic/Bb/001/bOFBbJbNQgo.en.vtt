00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:13.349
 at this time it is a party while my name has been on the lekstraat for years 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.659
 delayed a new bowl i have you 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:17.730
 so this is a nice cup of channel 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.890
 maybe I still know how to ski I know 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.980
 zero 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.660
 but agree with 17 years in maastricht and i can do about 4 march 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.579
 his youtube 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.789
 and if i like it but i can't work on it myself i can 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:30.949
 to have 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.140
 call of Duty 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.510
 is commissioned by BP of course it is the same in knowledge 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.170
 on the maps or alone 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.260
 a very slow one knows its own account knows five of property six 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
 minutes I sing so it really is a whole country of fame 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.980
 and it came every i had never played this man 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.780
 the property speaks 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.130
 maybe twice 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.310
 but until real cup match third day of the world very quiet play 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.910
 and there came to study you know also ecolo really can not work the 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.950
 play streak whole game 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.280
 yes it is perhaps also a little bit in Kempi that stayed that way 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.490
 already 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.110
 could you camp trained I don't know 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.130
 decide for yourself where much we think so 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.860
 I want with this second team 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.829
 and 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:19.200
 it is really recommended by the way, I would sometimes put his mark on his side 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.159
 because then my part two is the strongest and lots of bullets and I am 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.170
 naturally states 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.860
 so yes i would just do that 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.930
 in addition, with the puck I am a voice and pippa at the youth council 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.010
 by if you want 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.020
 well i will come back to all those projects and i will 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.860
 all of them 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.580
 but I will continue with my set up because I have with me 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.409
 first special 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.800
 bystanders 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.110
 Sargent Stalker and Ted Ajax he was seeing 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.430
 and next to that a LSD that has a quick breakthrough and something like that 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.390
 the cause came to my 10 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.229
 hassle everyone what makes play so today we have a go 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.290
 over the beam and in my eyes the press must be come by kotur tiamat one 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.490
 other in short it's just gotta change 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.769
 in my opinion 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.590
 because I think menno normal time is a conservatory of call of duty in the mood 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.959
 was just business 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.299
 usually just boring percent gives nothing else 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.739
 then I think in all others I try to tidy up probably I didn't stand 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:24.969
 mean 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:28.679
 then you might be in one of the five gate leaflets 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:31.659
 now you are at one of the one gates 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:32.950
 in the saker lobby 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.209
 that is just how it is next year 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.279
 and yes I did get myself in an expensive suit 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:41.899
 i walked i also sewed myself for a while with everything just for fun 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:46.540
 a bit of the poppy reason to get bikes and get rich scientific knowledge 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.000
 be able to make assembly for assembly and he decided to take two minutes 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:54.199
 and always pretty reasonable on just three weeks so boring problems 2 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.329
 at the last because I no longer had xenon, however, and soak 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.199
 all of them 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:02.429
 so you can just take a bit of this 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:04.019
 then Ajax once came 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.500
 so I want him to make that so 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.539
 the rest own bit is finished 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:10.979
 In addition, I also like them 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:14.109
 both clubs in sports 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.369
 there were two also those extra points you should do if you are somewhere on it 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:18.559
 have a mess 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:21.199
 where you can just die 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:24.199
 that you really need more points than what you for example 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:29.219
 certain people use the brit or after me myself that does not amount to i have out 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:29.999
 not that 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:31.989
 and I think so 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.659
 because I don't think that professional football player is his son 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:37.539
 I do not use the brit myself 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:39.880
 but for example kept bladder 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.769
 and 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.689
 Jaap just really gets the club so really need it 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:45.229
 in one this time 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:48.229
 and you can use them for example because they have too few points 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.779
 and that has been approved 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:53.089
 so yes i would like to be there 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:54.489
 say two out of three 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.489
 don't have to bring those extra points too early 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.709
 standard points would say 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.899
 so that it can use a little more purps in the slump 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:11.959
 in addition, I am also because they are the ajacied who already a little bit of fun 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.979
 because I just think that she is super over in terms of whether you made a mistake 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:17.169
 it actually 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.039
 if you are just there is a string of ecabo dead if you for example no 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.129
 tax or if you blow you put up with special sf 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:25.999
 so if you don't start on a yes 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:29.229
 For example, he is on a tidy once before special is dead in Haiti 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:32.170
 but i like smoking in between and doing nothing 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.820
 do the diary that arsenal for example could jump on jumpers open 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.849
 so yes you do that and only knowledge and not in 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:41.780
 yeah just dead right away 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.479
 I am sure my bosses bettina and bart in with the king of egypt 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.430
 and yes the rosseroni 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.770
 nothing was wrong 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.430
 you can almost not be lucky with that 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.169
 that you also just as if they also that you ever 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:57.889
 the sharks that boy fails 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.180
 only then will you be lucky until you don't die there 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.270
 the owner wants that a bit allowed with that 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.410
 nothing is missing where I criticize myself first that the helicopter is not 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.479
 about how strong the helicopter is around I think it is very strong or not 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.259
 Sure, a bit of a bullshit is that he can also shoot a rocket and stuff 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:17.339
 necessary 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:19.889
 you might have liked it a little less 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.740
 but I find it very annoying 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.650
 if you like the sound of the control tower i turned so loud 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.660
 That's just no more German Dewaay with Dope himself and the VARA 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.819
 saikur nothing more than that 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:33.819
 yes if the normal 3d helicopter flies over you 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:37.629
 for the rest of the team again a tough one and just nothing at all 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:41.349
 so yes I do not really like it myself so they like me a bit 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:42.759
 cap 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.740
 they can also be my hat 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.240
 oleko ormel I think 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.009
 look like you myself 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:52.009
 you have everything out as a team and keeping order essential 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.949
 then 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:57.669
 do you really have something on the assistant who is really yours 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:59.849
 his and dennis in north korea 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:03.259
 part of the dick that organ that really keeps evaporating 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:06.349
 and also if, for example, they glow orange 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:08.039
 it is really growing 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.589
 yes then i just have you sometimes what you really just do 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:14.069
 perisic among such images and the eight countries and 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:18.189
 I myself say kurt when I see the death of millions coming or something 

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:21.430
 that jansen the pri a wolf fajad the weeks all soared 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:25.759
 nr the tribe our mile also do a little bit with it 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:28.759
 and the last thing they do is mole hat for me 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:30.449
 the STIB 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:33.979
 I really have to be way too simple and the Steenplein to Nicolaj this was real 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:35.659
 very difficult to sew 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:39.159
 I wanted to straighten chill link I well I almost never imagine 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:42.979
 and I was always sewn and was with psv was there says absolutely not 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:46.310
 so if for me like that may linger like that they have not done so 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.470
 but also good because I am going to get you there against alf close that I am standing thirty 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.779
 the currently and alexa i none of it 

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:55.149
 34 or 35 hildesheim miss 

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:56.879
 both not in any case 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:58.009
 So 

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:01.110
 so austere view you buy you have liked this a bit 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:05.259
 yes if you like buro humo 

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:07.569
 at least for that look the unborn child
