00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
to do three just to make sure I I cover

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.719 
to do three just to make sure I I cover
all<00:01:32.549> my<00:01:32.579> bases<00:01:32.729> that's<00:01:33.509> one<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.840> big

all my bases that's one of the big

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.609 
all my bases that's one of the big
so<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.760> put<00:01:36.390> about<00:01:36.570> 20<00:01:36.869> ounces<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.229> water<00:01:37.380> in

so I put about 20 ounces of water in

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.760 
so I put about 20 ounces of water in
here<00:01:37.799> mix<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.909> up<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.540> kind<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.810> drink<00:01:40.619> it
