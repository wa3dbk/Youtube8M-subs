00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 plus 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.130
 hello everyone today I bring you a trick to 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.860
 butterfield 3 specifically on the map 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.710
 great bazaar and good so that the 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.750
 trick we have to go out in the 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.660
 American detachment is worth and catch 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.250
 the hammer that you see here in front and go 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.020
 towards a site not if we go out in the 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.000
 rival team 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.530
 it's not a hammer and it's kind of like 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.390
 truck and then when we look around here 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.530
 we can not enter but we can 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.180
 climb the stairs that you have to climb 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.920
 then you have to come here with the 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.290
 car now I'm in the normal mode for 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.610
 that you see it like that in the third person 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.250
 car 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.320
 so you have to come here and 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.150
 climb these stairs and glued to the 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.100
 wall left here at the beginning 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.380
 of like a bicycle and paste it to 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.720
 She sometimes costs a little but good 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.580
 You can upload it if you go out on the computer 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.720
 opposite with the truck that could 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.430
 get here but you can not climb 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.140
 the stairs are worth personal 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.970
 glued to that the staircase we passed to 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.560
 the turret and the turret you have to aim 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.350
 towards the wall when we point to the 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.729
 fence to the wall you have to press circle 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.710
 and forward or as if it came out 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.240
 of the car but from the turret 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.160
 climb to the turret press that circle and 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.600
 for alante is worth just at that point of 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.460
 then you will leave here out of the map 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.040
 Monkey is not out of the map 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.320
 we are really inside the map but 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.360
 in a separate area below the ground 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.770
 It looks like we're under the ground 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.270
 it is also a is within the map 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.640
 let's say and it's kind of like 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.410
 labyrinth so it looks like it's a 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.450
 glacier or something inside a glacier or something 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.899
 weird but we can get here to 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.270
 The flag must and we can capture worth 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.490
 now as you can see I am here in myself alone in 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.110
 a ship server that was testing and 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.970
 the bullets in principle do not pass 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.470
 but if we are in the fanatic mode that 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.480
 it would be like the new end but of the 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.080
 butterfield yes they go through 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.660
 and put it putting a shotgun with the 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.540
 grained fire of this good grained is 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.580
 like explosive cartridges it seems to me and 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.920
 that does not go beyond what they are 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.470
 the bullets of any other weapons no no 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.100
 they are worth only what are the 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.540
 grained cartridges these good of 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.380
 these is that I do not know what they are called in it 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.930
 butterfield or I remember well 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.910
 or fragmentation or graining that is called 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.450
 something so good for those cartridges and that 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.450
 traspasa vale 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.010
 simply those that you do not want if you see 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.720
 They kill or something like below 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.280
 I already know how they have done it already 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.510
 you know that they have gotten in there and 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.420
 is 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.579
 but good now you will see that good a 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.560
 piece that I tried online to see if 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.939
 back passed other passes and if it continues 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.409
 go through but as I say it has to be 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:42.260
 in fanatic mode since in the mode 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.930
 normal does not get to kill worth then 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.610
 Well this I suppose they will leave 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.110
 because normal these tricks of 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.700
 butterfield usually go patching because 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.790
 it's something that people take advantage of 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.950
 too much and well just that is not 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.840
 for those who want to do it, you do it and 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.359
 those that you do not like because you already know how 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.780
 you can defend you can enter and do 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:04.970
 the same or catch and not directly pass 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.900
 around here and little more so I hope 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.310
 that you liked the video if you have 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.720
