00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
hey guys this Webbie o is about a new

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.970 
hey guys this Webbie o is about a new
competition<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.900> he<00:00:22.020> decided<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.470> get<00:00:22.710> into

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
competition that he decided to get into

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.570 
competition that he decided to get into
it's<00:00:23.850> on<00:00:24.119> building<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.660> computer<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.590> costs

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
it's on building a computer that costs

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.929 
it's on building a computer that costs
as<00:00:26.699> low<00:00:27.150> or<00:00:28.109> lower<00:00:28.410> than<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> playstation<00:00:29.429> 4<00:00:29.730> and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
as low or lower than a playstation 4 and

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.620 
as low or lower than a playstation 4 and
performs<00:00:30.900> as<00:00:31.019> well<00:00:31.470> or<00:00:31.710> better<00:00:31.740> than<00:00:32.130> a

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
performs as well or better than a

performs as well or better than a
playstation<00:00:33.630> 4<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.890> build<00:00:35.100> I

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
playstation 4 so this is the build I

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.709 
playstation 4 so this is the build I
came<00:00:35.640> up<00:00:35.820> with<00:00:36.680> first<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> case<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.489> DIY<00:00:39.090> PC
