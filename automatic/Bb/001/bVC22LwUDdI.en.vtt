00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
pretty much the timeframe between each

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.890 
pretty much the timeframe between each
relaxer<00:00:27.460> so<00:00:27.640> if<00:00:27.790> you<00:00:27.880> got<00:00:28.000> a<00:00:28.060> relaxer<00:00:28.480> in<00:00:28.630> March

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
course we know that the line of

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.319 
course we know that the line of
demarcation<00:00:35.350> which<00:00:36.010> is<00:00:36.550> that<00:00:36.760> line<00:00:37.000> between

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
demarcation which is that line between

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.509 
demarcation which is that line between
your<00:00:37.780> relaxed<00:00:38.140> and<00:00:38.350> natural<00:00:38.410> hair<00:00:38.829> you<00:00:39.129> need

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:02.319 
stretch for maybe three months max I've

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:04.530 
stretch for maybe three months max I've
been<00:01:02.379> watching<00:01:02.949> my<00:01:03.219> growth<00:01:03.519> and<00:01:03.879> my<00:01:04.330> hair<00:01:04.510> has

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
been watching my growth and my hair has

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.719 
been watching my growth and my hair has
actually<00:01:04.960> been<00:01:05.110> growing<00:01:05.229> really<00:01:05.740> really<00:01:06.220> fast

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
actually been growing really really fast

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.490 
actually been growing really really fast
the<00:01:07.090> last<00:01:07.330> time<00:01:07.510> I<00:01:07.540> did<00:01:07.750> a<00:01:07.780> relaxer<00:01:08.260> was

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
the last time I did a relaxer was

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.740 
the last time I did a relaxer was
October<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:09.430> 20th<00:01:09.880> I<00:01:10.060> didn't<00:01:10.329> leave<00:01:10.479> it<00:01:10.509> on

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
October the 20th I didn't leave it on

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.060 
October the 20th I didn't leave it on
long<00:01:11.200> at<00:01:11.500> all

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
long at all

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.760 
long at all
and<00:01:12.430> so<00:01:12.670> my<00:01:12.909> hair<00:01:13.240> will<00:01:13.689> probably<00:01:14.350> not<00:01:14.560> need

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
and so my hair will probably not need

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.770 
and so my hair will probably not need
another<00:01:14.890> one<00:01:15.159> until<00:01:15.340> January<00:01:15.939> and<00:01:16.210> that<00:01:16.600> will

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
another one until January and that will

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.289 
another one until January and that will
be<00:01:16.930> my<00:01:17.079> three<00:01:17.259> month<00:01:17.560> time<00:01:17.770> span<00:01:18.130> there's<00:01:19.090> only

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
be my three month time span there's only

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.179 
be my three month time span there's only
two<00:01:19.960> things<00:01:20.200> that<00:01:20.380> I<00:01:20.500> worry<00:01:20.740> about<00:01:20.979> when<00:01:21.100> it

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
two things that I worry about when it

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:22.410

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
that my edges and my line of demarcation

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.170 
that my edges and my line of demarcation
is<00:01:25.390> laid<00:01:26.380> down<00:01:26.409> and<00:01:27.130> properly<00:01:27.430> taken<00:01:27.880> care<00:01:28.149> of
