the back I've also reviewed this in the
aluminium<00:00:13.950> finish<00:00:14.549> as<00:00:14.730> well<00:00:14.759> brushed

aluminium<00:00:15.420> which<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:15.990> really<00:00:16.230> nice<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:17.130> you've

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
aluminium which is really nice so you've

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.800 
aluminium which is really nice so you've
got<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.400> rubber<00:00:17.699> inside<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.359> pattern<00:00:18.720> on

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
got this rubber inside of the pattern on

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.050 
got this rubber inside of the pattern on
he's<00:00:19.320> actually<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.680> two-part<00:00:19.920> case<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:20.910> you're

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
he's actually a two-part case so you're

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.179 
he's actually a two-part case so you're
just<00:00:21.180> getting<00:00:21.510> here<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:22.410> pop<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.859> apart

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
just getting here you can pop it apart

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.420 
just getting here you can pop it apart
little<00:00:23.880> tubs<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.300> run<00:00:24.600> round<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:25.830> can<00:00:26.160> see

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
little tubs that run round you can see

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.740 
little tubs that run round you can see
if<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.880> just<00:00:27.029> show<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.269> there<00:00:27.510> where<00:00:27.689> they

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
if I just show you there where they

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.529 
if I just show you there where they
actually<00:00:27.840> fix<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.769> locks<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.369> place

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
actually fix in so that locks in place

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.020 
actually fix in so that locks in place
so<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.570> take<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.900> year<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.500> z10<00:00:31.980> place<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.910> in

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
so you take the year the z10 place it in

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.139 
so you take the year the z10 place it in
this<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:34.079> be<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> little<00:00:34.380> bit<00:00:34.559> awkward<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
this can be a little bit awkward and the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.330 
this can be a little bit awkward and the
idea<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.540> if<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.840> start<00:00:37.170> at<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> top<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.890> work

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
idea is if you start at the top and work

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.100 
idea is if you start at the top and work
your<00:00:38.579> way<00:00:38.760> around<00:00:38.969> just<00:00:39.270> make<00:00:39.540> sure<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
your way around just make sure that the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.889 
your way around just make sure that the
yet<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> tubs<00:00:40.770> clicking<00:00:41.219> nicely<00:00:41.760> I've<00:00:42.690> done

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
yet the tubs clicking nicely I've done

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.330 
yet the tubs clicking nicely I've done
quite<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.170> few<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.530> these<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.860> still<00:00:44.160> they

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
quite a few of these and still they

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.740 
quite a few of these and still they
managed<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.670> catch<00:00:45.000> me<00:00:45.180> out<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:45.539> there<00:00:45.660> you

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
managed to catch me out but there you

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.910 
managed to catch me out but there you
can<00:00:45.870> see<00:00:45.899> that's<00:00:46.260> got<00:00:46.440> an<00:00:46.530> absolutely<00:00:46.920> fine
