00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hi people to youtube today I bring you a 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.430
 Video of the Gran Turismo 6 and dribling for 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.469
 7 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.039
 let's call the video enjoy 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:15.010
 skidding with wheat a struggle and 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:17.170
 because we're going to call him that because we're going 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.830
 to enjoy cast of triumphs cgt 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:24.520
 because I have not found logical way 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.650
 to skid or make wheat with this 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.340
 flyer there's no way to give a damn 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.439
 curve without you crossing the car and it's 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.449
 a line I have been practicing for a long time 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.930
 I have seen videos that neither is there 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:39.700
 found great thing and there is no way and 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.579
 I bring you this video because I've 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.699
 found 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.399
 and a configuration for this car that 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.320
 It is 4x4 that if many will say it is easier 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.479
 of driving well if it's easier but 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.640
 that's why this video is called enjoy 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:56.989
 stealing because we're going to enjoy 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.640
 easy or difficult nor do you host then 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:03.420
 let's see now the configuration that 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.240
 I made this car and then we'll see 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.759
 a live gameplay like I do and 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.700
 so that you see let's see the 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.500
 configuration of this car 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.399
 well here we are going to give the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.399
 configuration 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.680
 and tires we are going to put him as two 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.110
 soft 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.450
 comfortable soft tires after 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.760
 sell what you have caught the trick I 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.580
 I can continue to download read as 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.590
 means like hard or sporting power 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.350
 hard what you see raises like the 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.680
 soft 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.200
 suspension 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.590
 125 front height to 125 rear 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.270
 start of many 8 55 front 7 44 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.680
 behind shock absorber 4 front 4 behind 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.450
 shock absorber extension 4 24 behind 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.630
 stabilizer bars 6 of nantes and 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.369
 central are dropping balloons 1 to 0 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.750
 forward 0.5 behind angle of 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:04.479
 convergence minus 0.15 in front plus 0.20 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.689
 behind we were 5 for 5 after box of 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.320
 changes 250 kilometers per hour 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.510
 simply 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.520
 hector transmission that starts the end 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.310
 world ahead 50 behind sensitivity 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.340
 of 40 40 this you can change if you want 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.400
 to more sensitive brake equal 20 east 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:28.100
 and here front pair distribution 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.630
 back you have to put 30 70 and then 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.380
 according to vallÃ©s caught the trick you can 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:39.720
 keep going down to the left 25 75 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:42.090
 20 80 15 85 up to 10 190 that would be the 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.150
 maximum power to the rear wheels 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.680
 but at the moment 30 70 that is the one 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.650
 I'm using to go practicing and 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.069
 catching the boosted trick 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.290
 maximum 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:57.019
 in every story the same here in 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.579
 in 70 position aerodynamic grip 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:04.930
 forward and 130 behind good let's see 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.930
 how this configuration works 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.000
 and then later we will see another 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.630
 configuration of the controls 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.160
 of the controls of the steering wheel and the abs and 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.160
 all that comes 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.780
 it's worth here in driving options this 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.630
 it is very important we are going to put 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.110
 manual transmission 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.910
 like the car and tires like two 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.190
 soft in front like two soft behind 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.960
 active tracing disabled depends 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.220
 indicated to the point they close without further 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.530
 activate this active address you have to 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.620
 put it in a strong traction control 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.890
 make or disable management 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.620
 stability 0 also asm abs system 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.470
 of 5 for example because you can not either 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.390
 lower the amount rappel off and 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.820
 this also rotational sensitivity of the 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.820
 butt control to 7 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.340
 and well let's see how
