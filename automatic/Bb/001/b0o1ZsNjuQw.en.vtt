00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
pack analysis results all you have to do

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.380 
pack analysis results all you have to do
is<00:03:21.930> unpack<00:03:22.470> results<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:23.250> take<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:23.910> look<00:03:24.090> at<00:03:24.239> all

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
is unpack results and take a look at all

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.789 
is unpack results and take a look at all
the<00:03:24.570> different<00:03:24.690> results<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.350> have<00:03:25.410> in<00:03:25.620> front

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
the different results you have in front

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.400 
the different results you have in front
of<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.100> from<00:03:26.910> here<00:03:27.450> get<00:03:28.049> an<00:03:28.140> idea<00:03:28.620> of

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
of you from here get an idea of

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.890 
of you from here get an idea of
happens<00:03:29.890> at<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.490> packing<00:03:30.910> stage<00:03:31.180> and<00:03:31.690> how<00:03:31.840> the

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
happens at the packing stage and how the

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.940 
happens at the packing stage and how the
part<00:03:32.260> will<00:03:32.440> look<00:03:32.620> like<00:03:33.600> step<00:03:34.600> 13<00:03:34.830> looking<00:03:35.830> at

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
part will look like step 13 looking at

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.310 
part will look like step 13 looking at
the<00:03:36.100> profile<00:03:36.490> curve<00:03:36.760> results<00:03:37.330> all<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:38.140> have

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
the profile curve results all you have

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.530 
the profile curve results all you have
to<00:03:38.440> do<00:03:38.620> is<00:03:38.860> click<00:03:39.010> on<00:03:39.190> profile<00:03:39.670> other<00:03:39.940> results

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
to do is click on profile other results

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.810 
to do is click on profile other results
so<00:03:41.410> it's<00:03:41.560> meant<00:03:41.800> to<00:03:41.950> take<00:03:42.130> you<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.340> an<00:03:42.520> Excel
