00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.160 
much on the commentary saying you know
they've<00:01:33.030> been<00:01:33.060> champions<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.840> four<00:01:33.869> months

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
they've been champions for four months

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.249 
they've been champions for four months
but<00:01:34.439> who<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.890> beach<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:36.020> you<00:01:37.020> know<00:01:37.079> it's

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
but who have a beach and you know it's

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.140 
but who have a beach and you know it's
it's<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.920> truth<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.369> think<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.640> McGillicuddy

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
it's the truth I think the McGillicuddy

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.210 
it's the truth I think the McGillicuddy
is<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.570> big<00:01:39.960> warm<00:01:40.229> future<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.950> would<00:01:41.040> be<00:01:41.189> I

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
is a big warm future that it would be I

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.160 
is a big warm future that it would be I
think<00:01:41.369> he<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.790> future<00:01:42.270> champion<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.810> think<00:01:43.079> they

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
think he is future champion I think they

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.560 
think he is future champion I think they
needed<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.590> way<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:44.210> get<00:01:45.210> him<00:01:45.299> out<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.479> that

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
needed a way to get him out of that

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.569 
needed a way to get him out of that
