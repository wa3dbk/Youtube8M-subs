and<00:00:26.490> there's<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.210> power<00:00:27.449> vacuum<00:00:27.599> there<00:00:28.260> now

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
and there's a power vacuum there now

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.999 
and there's a power vacuum there now
sirrah<00:00:29.279> dill<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:30.210> big<00:00:30.570> prize<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.349> fertile

sirrah dill is a big prize a fertile

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.670 
sirrah dill is a big prize a fertile
heartland<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.450> continent<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.230> it's<00:00:34.469> also

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
heartland of the continent and it's also

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
the symbol of power over Tamriel in the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.440 
the symbol of power over Tamriel in the
white<00:00:38.160> gold<00:00:38.399> tower<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:39.059> has<00:00:39.149> been<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
white gold tower that has been the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.209 
white gold tower that has been the
center<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.899> Empire<00:00:40.230> for<00:00:40.620> millennia<00:00:41.190> now

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
center of the Empire for millennia now

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.180 
center of the Empire for millennia now
so<00:00:41.879> three<00:00:42.360> alliances<00:00:42.660> all<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.950> their<00:00:44.160> own

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
so three alliances all have their own

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.060 
so three alliances all have their own
reasons<00:00:44.780> why<00:00:45.780> they<00:00:46.230> feel<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.590> they<00:00:47.039> should

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
reasons why they feel like they should

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.880 
reasons why they feel like they should
be<00:00:47.430> ruling<00:00:48.360> cyrodiil<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.559> fundamental

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
be ruling cyrodiil but the fundamental

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.520 
be ruling cyrodiil but the fundamental
reason<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.360> Empire<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.020> Sarah<00:00:52.289> dill

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
reason is that the Empire and Sarah dill

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.369 
reason is that the Empire and Sarah dill
and<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.949> family<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.760> nobles<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.780> thorns<00:00:55.199> that

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
and the family of nobles the thorns that

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.560 
and the family of nobles the thorns that
are<00:00:55.500> ruling<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.890> are<00:00:56.070> weak<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.570> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
are ruling it are weak and the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:09.250 
are ruling it are weak and the
Alliance's<00:00:58.140> are<00:00:58.170> strong

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.320 

so<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> Empire<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.770> weak<00:01:11.040> but<00:01:11.670> their<00:01:11.940> leaders

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
so the Empire is weak but their leaders

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.740 
so the Empire is weak but their leaders
are<00:01:12.570> cunning<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:14.280> current<00:01:15.000> occupant<00:01:15.480> of<00:01:15.630> the
