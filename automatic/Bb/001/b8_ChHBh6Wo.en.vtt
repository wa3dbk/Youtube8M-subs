00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
the main reason actually is I have done

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.560 
the main reason actually is I have done
that<00:01:36.060> login<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.110> use<00:01:37.410> my<00:01:37.590> facebook<00:01:38.010> account

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570

that login and I use my facebook account
the<00:01:39.570> problem<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.229> doesn't<00:01:40.350> really<00:01:40.619> sink<00:01:41.010> so

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
the problem is it doesn't really sink so

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.990 
the problem is it doesn't really sink so
it<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.210> mean<00:01:42.690> it<00:01:42.810> does<00:01:43.020> sink<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.880> have

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
it I mean it does sink but it you have

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.790 
it I mean it does sink but it you have
to<00:01:45.150> try<00:01:45.390> multiple<00:01:45.780> times<00:01:46.050> I<00:01:46.320> don't<00:01:46.380> know<00:01:46.650> if

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
to try multiple times I don't know if

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.650 
to try multiple times I don't know if
because<00:01:47.190> the<00:01:47.369> new<00:01:47.670> version<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:48.150> came<00:01:48.450> out

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
because the new version just came out

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.980 
because the new version just came out
and<00:01:49.130> or<00:01:50.130> its<00:01:50.400> resembling<00:01:51.030> end<00:01:51.180> these<00:01:51.780> guys

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
and or its resembling end these guys

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.900 
and or its resembling end these guys
can't<00:01:52.380> handle<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.800> traffic<00:01:53.100> or<00:01:53.430> something's

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
can't handle it traffic or something's

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.050 
can't handle it traffic or something's
breaking<00:01:54.680> so<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.710> have<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.979> try<00:01:56.250> really<00:01:56.520> hard<00:01:56.670> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
breaking so I have to try really hard to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.390 
breaking so I have to try really hard to
sync<00:01:57.600> my<00:01:57.690> tasks<00:01:58.290> now<00:01:58.650> this<00:01:58.860> wasn't<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> case

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
sync my tasks now this wasn't the case

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.810 
sync my tasks now this wasn't the case
before<00:02:00.470> so<00:02:01.470> I'm<00:02:01.740> not<00:02:01.770> sure<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.400> something

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
before so I'm not sure this is something

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.840 
before so I'm not sure this is something

whole<00:02:08.100> online<00:02:08.490> service<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.090> took<00:02:09.270> me<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> while

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
whole online service it took me a while

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.960 
whole online service it took me a while
to<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.200> download<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.800> latest<00:02:10.920> version<00:02:11.130> but

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
they had a note under website saying

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.350 
they had a note under website saying
that<00:02:13.950> there<00:02:14.160> was<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.340> lot<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.640> low<00:02:14.940> than<00:02:15.180> their

tasks<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.890> then<00:02:29.390> stop<00:02:30.390> tasks<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.170> can

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
tasks and then stop tasks so you can

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:56.770 
tasks and then stop tasks so you can
create

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.350 

two<00:02:57.170> projects<00:02:57.830> shows<00:02:58.490> i<00:02:58.670> might<00:02:58.850> ask<00:02:59.060> each<00:02:59.330> of

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:13.469 
that was the sync option that I don't

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.339 
that was the sync option that I don't

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:42.930 

I<00:03:35.110> can<00:03:35.980> drag<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:36.550> drop<00:03:36.640> these<00:03:37.060> projects<00:03:41.940> you

I can drag and drop these projects you

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.120 
I can drag and drop these projects you
can<00:03:43.090> edit<00:03:44.250> list<00:03:45.250> names<00:03:45.550> I<00:03:45.910> can<00:03:46.900> go<00:03:47.200> and<00:03:47.590> let's

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
can edit list names I can go and let's

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:55.800 
can edit list names I can go and let's
say<00:03:48.370> I<00:03:48.430> want<00:03:48.670> to<00:03:49.470> add<00:03:50.470> a<00:03:50.530> new<00:03:50.770> task<00:03:51.190> here<00:03:54.810> and

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
say I want to add a new task here and

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.740 
say I want to add a new task here and
once<00:03:55.990> I<00:03:56.110> added<00:03:56.500> it<00:03:56.620> shows<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.160> number<00:03:57.520> of<00:03:58.180> task

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
once I added it shows the number of task

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.190 
once I added it shows the number of task
right<00:03:59.200> there<00:03:59.500> so<00:04:00.070> it's<00:04:00.190> pretty<00:04:00.820> intuitive<00:04:01.360> in

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
right there so it's pretty intuitive in

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.820 
right there so it's pretty intuitive in
that<00:04:02.440> regard<00:04:06.630> in<00:04:07.630> order<00:04:07.990> for<00:04:08.290> me<00:04:08.350> to<00:04:08.440> share<00:04:08.770> my

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
that regard in order for me to share my

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.880 
that regard in order for me to share my
list<00:04:09.190> i<00:04:09.280> also<00:04:09.490> need<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:09.790> have<00:04:09.880> an<00:04:10.120> account<00:04:10.530> and

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.440 

but<00:04:14.890> as<00:04:15.010> far<00:04:15.220> as<00:04:15.280> adding<00:04:15.730> new<00:04:15.880> task<00:04:16.150> that's

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
but as far as adding new task that's

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.020 
but as far as adding new task that's
pretty<00:04:16.720> easy<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:17.109> do<00:04:17.290> so<00:04:17.920> I<00:04:17.980> seeing<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.580> whole

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
pretty easy to do so I seeing the whole

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.770 
pretty easy to do so I seeing the whole
user<00:04:19.209> interface<00:04:19.750> and<00:04:21.150> you<00:04:22.150> can<00:04:22.330> see<00:04:22.600> it<00:04:22.660> in

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
user interface and you can see it in

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.900 
user interface and you can see it in
both<00:04:24.240> orientations<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:26.820> portrait<00:04:27.820> and

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
both orientations and portrait and

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.170 
both orientations and portrait and
landscape<00:04:28.120> it<00:04:28.690> it<00:04:28.990> works<00:04:29.560> just<00:04:29.650> fine<00:04:30.180> either

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
landscape it it works just fine either

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.430 
landscape it it works just fine either
way<00:04:31.390> I<00:04:31.680> prefer<00:04:32.680> it<00:04:32.830> this<00:04:32.980> way<00:04:33.040> but<00:04:34.230> it's<00:04:35.230> your

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
way I prefer it this way but it's your

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.070 
way I prefer it this way but it's your
choice<00:04:35.500> you<00:04:36.490> do<00:04:36.640> also<00:04:36.850> have<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.630> option<00:04:37.780> to

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
choice you do also have the option to

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:45.030 
choice you do also have the option to
choose<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:39.280> iphone<00:04:39.730> version<00:04:43.590> so<00:04:44.590> the<00:04:44.740> iphone

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
choose the iphone version so the iphone

vision<00:04:45.370> is<00:04:45.490> very<00:04:45.669> similar<00:04:46.240> except<00:04:46.690> that<00:04:46.750> it's

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
vision is very similar except that it's

vision is very similar except that it's
designed<00:04:47.410> for<00:04:47.530> a<00:04:47.650> smaller<00:04:47.950> screen<00:04:48.250> you<00:04:48.460> can

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
designed for a smaller screen you can

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.680 
designed for a smaller screen you can
tell<00:04:48.940> that<00:04:49.350> some<00:04:50.350> elements<00:04:50.890> are<00:04:51.010> different

tomorrow next 7 days later note due date
and<00:05:29.150> setting<00:05:29.750> now<00:05:30.200> this<00:05:30.440> was<00:05:30.800> if<00:05:31.460> you<00:05:31.550> go<00:05:31.700> to

the other app these were shown here
right<00:05:36.530> there<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:37.370> filters<00:05:37.820> so<00:05:38.150> there<00:05:38.630> are

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
right there the filters so there are

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.200 
right there the filters so there are
minor<00:05:39.200> differences<00:05:39.560> between<00:05:40.070> the<00:05:40.370> apps<00:05:40.520> but

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
minor differences between the apps but

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.680 
minor differences between the apps but
overall<00:05:41.600> it<00:05:42.320> works<00:05:43.070> fine<00:05:43.850> except<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:44.419> sync

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
overall it works fine except the sync

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
feature and i'm hoping that that's going

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.230 
feature and i'm hoping that that's going
to<00:05:46.370> get<00:05:46.490> fixed<00:05:46.880> soon<00:05:46.940> i<00:05:48.610> did<00:05:49.610> manage<00:05:49.790> to

excited about but in general the app has
been<00:06:52.550> always<00:06:52.910> great<00:06:53.300> for<00:06:53.540> me<00:06:53.690> personally<00:06:53.960> i've

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:54.350 
been always great for me personally i've

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.040 
been always great for me personally i've
been<00:06:54.500> using<00:06:54.650> it<00:06:54.860> for<00:06:54.890> a<00:06:55.100> while<00:06:55.250> now<00:06:55.520> and<00:06:56.050> as
