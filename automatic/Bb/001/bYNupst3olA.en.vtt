another<00:00:54.939> three<00:00:55.299> feet<00:00:55.539> so<00:00:56.369> we'll<00:00:57.369> see<00:00:57.579> what

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
another three feet so we'll see what

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.840 
another three feet so we'll see what
happens<00:00:57.760> I<00:00:59.100> probably<00:01:00.100> should<00:01:00.519> not<00:01:00.640> be

might might be brought down there
swaying<00:01:17.440> right<00:01:17.709> now<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:19.240> not<00:01:19.420> a<00:01:19.450> good<00:01:19.659> scene

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869

we have a driftwood coming all across

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:26.520 
we have a driftwood coming all across
the<00:01:23.140> field<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:25.690> lower<00:01:25.899> section<00:01:26.200> of<00:01:26.440> the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
the field the lower section of the

the field the lower section of the
fields<00:01:26.920> over<00:01:27.159> there<00:01:27.399> is<00:01:27.610> is<00:01:28.179> probably<00:01:29.110> three

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
fields over there is is probably three

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.279 
fields over there is is probably three
to<00:01:30.189> four<00:01:30.399> feet<00:01:30.429> underwater<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:31.899> practice

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
to four feet underwater the practice

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.540 
to four feet underwater the practice
range<00:01:32.470> three<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.369> four<00:01:33.580> feet<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.979> it's<00:01:36.369> only

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
range three to four feet and it's only

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.440 
range three to four feet and it's only
going<00:01:36.819> to<00:01:36.879> get<00:01:37.269> worse<00:01:37.479> as<00:01:37.899> time<00:01:38.470> goes<00:01:38.920> on<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
going to get worse as time goes on the

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.949 
going to get worse as time goes on the
problem<00:01:40.780> is<00:01:40.869> once<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.259> storm<00:01:41.580> stops<00:01:42.959> it'll

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:43.959 
problem is once the storm stops it'll

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:46.380 
problem is once the storm stops it'll
just<00:01:44.349> keep<00:01:44.530> coming<00:01:45.009> up<00:01:45.129> because<00:01:45.489> of<00:01:45.640> all<00:01:46.179> the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
just keep coming up because of all the

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.910 
just keep coming up because of all the
runoff<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:48.250> so<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:50.200> runoff<00:01:50.530> is<00:01:50.709> going<00:01:50.739> to

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
runoff and so the runoff is going to

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.130 
runoff and so the runoff is going to
create<00:01:51.129> huge<00:01:51.580> problems<00:01:52.060> because<00:01:52.450> even<00:01:52.869> you

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
create huge problems because even you

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.400 
create huge problems because even you
know<00:01:53.170> 24<00:01:53.679> hours<00:01:54.009> after<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:55.030> storm<00:01:55.360> ends<00:01:55.750> it

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
know 24 hours after the storm ends it

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.630 
know 24 hours after the storm ends it
could<00:01:56.700> could<00:01:57.700> keep<00:01:57.940> going

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
could could keep going

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.310 
could could keep going
so<00:02:00.360> we'll<00:02:00.600> see<00:02:00.780> we'll<00:02:00.990> see<00:02:01.050> what<00:02:01.229> happens

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
so we'll see we'll see what happens
