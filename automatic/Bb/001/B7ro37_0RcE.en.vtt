00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
an idea of what it looks like after dark

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:12.410 
an idea of what it looks like after dark
okay<00:04:08.330> this<00:04:09.330> gives<00:04:09.569> you<00:04:09.750> an<00:04:09.810> idea<00:04:09.959> of<00:04:10.319> what<00:04:11.420> it

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
okay this gives you an idea of what it

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.039 
okay this gives you an idea of what it
will<00:04:12.720> look<00:04:12.840> like<00:04:12.900> in<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.980> water<00:04:14.750> kind<00:04:15.750> of<00:04:15.870> get

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
will look like in the water kind of get

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.690 
will look like in the water kind of get
over<00:04:16.200> and<00:04:16.530> get<00:04:16.680> a<00:04:16.739> little<00:04:16.890> bit<00:04:17.130> of<00:04:17.280> that<00:04:17.400> light

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
over and get a little bit of that light

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.460 
over and get a little bit of that light
but<00:04:18.799> probably<00:04:19.799> it's<00:04:19.979> better<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:21.109> look<00:04:22.109> at<00:04:22.320> it

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
but probably it's better to look at it

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.880 
but probably it's better to look at it
from<00:04:22.800> behind<00:04:24.919> and<00:04:25.919> see<00:04:26.190> how<00:04:26.460> it<00:04:26.610> likes<00:04:26.850> that<00:04:27.030> VR

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
from behind and see how it likes that VR

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.170 
from behind and see how it likes that VR
that's<00:04:28.890> what<00:04:29.100> we're<00:04:29.220> hoping<00:04:29.310> for<00:04:29.520> underwater

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
that's what we're hoping for underwater

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.710 
that's what we're hoping for underwater
with<00:04:30.570> this<00:04:30.810> flounder<00:04:31.260> giggin<00:04:31.380> light
