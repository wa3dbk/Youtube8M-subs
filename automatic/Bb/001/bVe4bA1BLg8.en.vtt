00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
okay so to know how to play a swung feel

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.380 
okay so to know how to play a swung feel
I'm<00:00:04.980> going<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.250> demonstrate<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.670> straight<00:00:06.089> feel

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
I'm going to demonstrate a straight feel

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.509 
I'm going to demonstrate a straight feel
first<00:00:06.720> so<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.319> straight<00:00:07.740> feel<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.309> going<00:00:08.460> to

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
first so a straight feel is going to

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:19.290 
first so a straight feel is going to
sound<00:00:08.639> like<00:00:08.790> this

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.630 

and<00:00:20.650> so<00:00:21.650> every<00:00:21.949> single<00:00:22.130> note<00:00:22.400> that<00:00:22.520> I'm

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
and so every single note that I'm

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.089 
and so every single note that I'm
playing<00:00:22.849> here<00:00:23.090> it's<00:00:23.270> like<00:00:23.830> it's<00:00:24.830> just<00:00:25.010> very

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
playing here it's like it's just very

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.999 
playing here it's like it's just very
like<00:00:25.550> equally<00:00:26.029> spaced<00:00:26.330> out<00:00:26.509> right<00:00:27.009> very

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
like equally spaced out right very

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.940 
like equally spaced out right very
precise<00:00:28.520> and<00:00:28.880> very<00:00:29.419> like<00:00:29.599> dodo<00:00:30.380> dodo<00:00:30.619> dodo

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
precise and very like dodo dodo dodo

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.660 
precise and very like dodo dodo dodo
dodo

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.460 

this<00:00:37.120> is<00:00:37.300> kind<00:00:37.510> of<00:00:37.570> more<00:00:37.840> what<00:00:37.990> you<00:00:38.140> were<00:00:38.230> doing

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
this is kind of more what you were doing

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.130 
this is kind of more what you were doing
classical<00:00:39.010> music<00:00:39.340> but<00:00:40.240> then<00:00:40.360> when<00:00:40.480> you<00:00:40.570> swing

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
classical music but then when you swing

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.200 
classical music but then when you swing
it<00:00:41.170> then<00:00:42.040> you're<00:00:42.220> going<00:00:42.340> to<00:00:42.400> take<00:00:42.610> this<00:00:42.820> this

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
it then you're going to take this this

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.790 
it then you're going to take this this
rhythm<00:00:43.690> that<00:00:43.780> I<00:00:43.870> was<00:00:43.990> doing<00:00:44.170> before<00:00:44.290> so

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
rhythm that I was doing before so

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.670 
rhythm that I was doing before so
instead<00:00:45.190> of<00:00:45.250> being<00:00:45.460> so<00:00:45.820> precise<00:00:46.330> is<00:00:46.660> I'm<00:00:47.380> going

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
instead of being so precise is I'm going

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.200 
instead of being so precise is I'm going
to<00:00:47.770> take<00:00:47.920> it<00:00:48.070> and<00:00:48.220> I'm<00:00:48.310> going<00:00:48.430> to<00:00:48.520> swing<00:00:49.000> it<00:00:49.030> a

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
to take it and I'm going to swing it a

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.550 
to take it and I'm going to swing it a
little<00:00:49.360> bit<00:00:49.540> I'm<00:00:49.690> going<00:00:49.810> to<00:00:49.870> I'm<00:00:50.350> going<00:00:50.440> to

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
little bit I'm going to I'm going to

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.990 
little bit I'm going to I'm going to
kind<00:00:50.770> of<00:00:50.800> make<00:00:50.920> it<00:00:51.040> looser<00:00:51.580> than<00:00:51.730> it<00:00:51.880> was

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
kind of make it looser than it was

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.460 
kind of make it looser than it was
before<00:00:52.450> I'm<00:00:52.660> going<00:00:52.780> to<00:00:52.840> go<00:00:52.960> ahead<00:00:53.110> of<00:00:53.410> the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
before I'm going to go ahead of the

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.020 
before I'm going to go ahead of the
rhythm<00:00:53.770> and<00:00:53.980> behind<00:00:54.340> the<00:00:54.489> rhythm<00:00:54.820> and<00:00:54.970> just

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
rhythm and behind the rhythm and just

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.590 
rhythm and behind the rhythm and just
kind<00:00:55.870> of<00:00:55.960> weave<00:00:56.800> in<00:00:57.250> and<00:00:57.430> out<00:00:57.520> of<00:00:57.700> the<00:00:57.760> beat<00:00:58.000> so

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
kind of weave in and out of the beat so

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.920 
kind of weave in and out of the beat so
instead<00:00:58.930> of<00:00:58.989> going<00:01:02.640> I'm<00:01:03.640> going<00:01:03.820> to<00:01:03.910> weave<00:01:04.390> in

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
instead of going I'm going to weave in

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:23.959 
instead of going I'm going to weave in
between<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.470> beats<00:01:05.650> so<00:01:05.860> I'm<00:01:05.950> going<00:01:06.100> to<00:01:06.130> go

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.690 

and<00:01:25.259> that's<00:01:26.259> the<00:01:26.469> swung<00:01:26.799> feel<00:01:27.039> and<00:01:27.249> I<00:01:27.310> love

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
and that's the swung feel and I love

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.940 
and that's the swung feel and I love
playing<00:01:28.179> that<00:01:28.329> way<00:01:28.479> because<00:01:28.749> it's<00:01:28.899> like<00:01:29.049> it's

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
playing that way because it's like it's

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.319 
playing that way because it's like it's
like<00:01:30.100> you're<00:01:30.219> just<00:01:30.250> walking<00:01:30.759> along<00:01:30.850> you<00:01:31.240> know

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
like you're just walking along you know

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:32.760 
like you're just walking along you know
you're<00:01:31.479> weaving<00:01:31.960> in<00:01:32.109> and<00:01:32.200> out<00:01:32.319> of<00:01:32.469> the<00:01:32.530> beat

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
you're weaving in and out of the beat

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.980 
you're weaving in and out of the beat
and<00:01:32.950> you're<00:01:33.069> just<00:01:33.219> really<00:01:33.399> free<00:01:33.909> to<00:01:34.210> just

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
and you're just really free to just

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.599 
and you're just really free to just
swing<00:01:35.289> to<00:01:36.009> go<00:01:37.649> rather<00:01:38.649> than<00:01:38.799> having<00:01:39.159> to<00:01:39.250> be<00:01:39.340> so

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
swing to go rather than having to be so

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:42.120 
swing to go rather than having to be so
regimented<00:01:39.939> or<00:01:40.359> very<00:01:40.569> precise<00:01:41.109> like<00:01:41.799> in<00:01:42.039> a

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
regimented or very precise like in a

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.589 
regimented or very precise like in a
classical<00:01:42.609> manner<00:01:42.819> where<00:01:43.209> are<00:01:43.299> you<00:01:43.359> just

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:43.599 
classical manner where are you just

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:53.000 
classical manner where are you just
going

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.180 

and<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.480> the<00:01:54.630> way<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:56.160> can

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
and so the way that you can you can

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.650 
and so the way that you can you can
count<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.880> because<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.510> really

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
count this because this is really

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.850 
count this because this is really
important<00:01:58.170> because<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.410> want<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.590> learn<00:01:58.680> how

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
important because you want to learn how

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.850 
important because you want to learn how
to<00:01:58.890> vocalize<00:01:59.600> this<00:02:00.600> way<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.900> playing<00:02:01.020> because

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
to vocalize this way of playing because

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.630 
to vocalize this way of playing because
if<00:02:01.980> you<00:02:02.070> can<00:02:02.190> sing<00:02:02.550> this<00:02:02.730> if<00:02:02.970> you<00:02:03.120> can<00:02:03.270> go<00:02:04.640> dude

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
if you can sing this if you can go dude

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.730 
if you can sing this if you can go dude
you<00:02:06.120> know<00:02:06.240> if<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.960> can<00:02:07.110> actually<00:02:07.470> do<00:02:07.590> that

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
you know if you can actually do that

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.950 
you know if you can actually do that
with<00:02:07.950> your<00:02:08.369> voice<00:02:08.400> and<00:02:08.850> with<00:02:09.000> your<00:02:09.150> body<00:02:09.360> then

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
with your voice and with your body then

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.780 
with your voice and with your body then
you'll<00:02:10.410> get<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.619> swing<00:02:11.040> feeling<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.550> lot

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
you'll get that swing feeling a lot

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.890 
you'll get that swing feeling a lot
faster<00:02:12.180> than<00:02:12.210> you<00:02:12.390> would<00:02:12.540> if<00:02:12.630> you're<00:02:12.720> just

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
faster than you would if you're just

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.590 
faster than you would if you're just
thinking<00:02:13.170> about<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.920> or<00:02:14.070> or<00:02:14.310> trying<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:15.330> play<00:02:15.570> a

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
thinking about it or or trying to play a

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.930 
thinking about it or or trying to play a
certain<00:02:16.080> amount<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.070> notes<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.430> know<00:02:17.580> you

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
certain amount of notes you know you

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.480 
certain amount of notes you know you
want<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.150> feel<00:02:18.600> this<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.860> order<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.190> count

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
want to feel this so in order to count

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.280 
want to feel this so in order to count
it<00:02:20.700> we're<00:02:21.420> going<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.600> use<00:02:21.690> this<00:02:21.810> method<00:02:22.050> of

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
it we're going to use this method of

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.630 
it we're going to use this method of
counting<00:02:22.710> like<00:02:23.010> 1<00:02:23.700> &amp;<00:02:24.000> 2<00:02:24.330> &amp;<00:02:24.630> 3<00:02:24.660> &amp;<00:02:25.140> 4<00:02:25.200> end<00:02:25.800> rather

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640
