aside<00:04:02.970> from<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.209> it<00:04:03.569> was<00:04:03.720> very<00:04:04.110> very<00:04:04.980> good<00:04:05.489> I

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
aside from that it was very very good I

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.780

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
very unexpected and I think it has a lot

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.330 
very unexpected and I think it has a lot
of<00:04:15.700> potential<00:04:16.150> to<00:04:16.419> be<00:04:16.539> very<00:04:17.109> very<00:04:18.039> very<00:04:18.940> famous

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340
