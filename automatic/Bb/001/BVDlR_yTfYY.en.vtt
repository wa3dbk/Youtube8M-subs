00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:08.870
 out of plastic that's the motto that 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:13.019
 here of course now since summer 2011 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.790
 Put food on the plastic sheets 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.699
 at the packaging exchange against 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.710
 sustainable wood foil which effort 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.100
 lies behind this green packaging 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.600
 project in the summer of 2011 we have the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.449
 first products in the wood foil 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.429
 presented, however, the project is running 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.960
 green packaging sustainable packaging 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.590
 for us you, of course, team already 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.870
 much longer 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.020
 if you thought years ago 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.480
 How can we avoid plastic 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.739
 which guidelines are there for ours 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.500
 sustainable packaging which 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.079
 possibilities there is the phase was very 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.789
 time-consuming and cost-intensive have here 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.539
 actually no cost and effort 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.739
 spared to drive the project forward 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.350
 and our very strict guidelines 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.840
 what rules have yes 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.460
 of course defined here it was whole 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.109
 important that the packaging is not in 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.480
 competition with a food stands 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.489
 such as corn starch and that 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.400
 material definitely needs to be GMO-free 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.159
 the wood has to be a fsc 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.600
 bear the seal of quality 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.159
 Forests are becoming high 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.990
 economic so much a standard 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.990
 manages when you are in the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.930
 Supermarket then looked around 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.820
 sometimes a mess here 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.560
 packaging also in the fruit and 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.560
 vegetable area what ever again 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.850
 is criticized why must because bio 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.000
 be packed 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.110
 it is obvious 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.549
 packaging bio must be in the sense of 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.020
 Sustainability is particularly critical 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.670
 to be taken the magnifying glass 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.159
 the situation is just making it 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.200
 over is prescribed that the bi 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.369
 Products need to be packed around them 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.840
 conventional products too 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:53.049
 differentiate so now for example 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.080
 zucchini and and walk are not 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.970
 packed why this related if no 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.500
 comparable product in the whole market 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.720
 is offered then this product 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.710
 We are selling loose 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.200
 moreover he could be scary 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.280
 of course you say 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.479
 Well then we pack all the conventional ones 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.030
 food a 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.590
 so that the products are not in 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.580
 to have to pack plastic 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.769
 but you like that much more 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.480
 waste and garbage significantly more clearly 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.130
 more conventional products sold 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.360
 become 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.100
 have begun with the conversion 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.900
 and have discovered the charcoal for us 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.519
 and then very quickly draufgekommen 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.989
 Unfortunately, not all of them are 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.819
 to pack charcoal 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.069
 she is from the structures of the 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.010
 texture paper and compare 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.600
 work with me and in the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.010
 Of course, it does not work with moisture 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.190
 optimal for the product and for the 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.079
 Packaging products where we use the charcoal 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.150
 are particularly well used 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:53.709
 parade paprika apples melanzani 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.570
 products are not so on the surface 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.250
 high humidity have that kind 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.200
 was easy after an hour's world because 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.970
 the films has removed moisture 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.609
 So it affects the quality of that 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.739
 product then crucial from exactly 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:08.829
 there are always innovations 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.390
 our latest innovation is at 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.230
 the onions at the summit below the 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.390
 red turnips 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.420
 Here we have the plastic nets 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.400
 also on an aimless net a wood 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.320
 network switched we have one too 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.820
 large garden assortment that means we 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.690
 We have a lot of young plants 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.579
 to offer 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.560
 they would all be earlier 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.660
 plastic box have been here too 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.880
 We are all in one 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.560
 suburb bangkoks an important question 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.109
 of course for all consumers 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.780
 consumers like charcoal 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.870
 the cartonage discards the cash register 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.879
 I give six in charge 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.080
 quite normal to old paper and then have 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.459
 I film where I now different 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.260
 have options if I have one 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.269
 biotonne then it is if the 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.640
 to give optimum consistently in the compost bin 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.580
 if I have no biotonne at home 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.250
 then it is best to plastic 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.129
 to give them a collection there as they do then 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.049
 finally co2 neutral burned like 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.069
 a lot of plastic could so far 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.260
 be saved 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.690
 So we can with today 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.090
 they say that since 2011 already 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.299
 100 tons of plastic saved 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.400
 We are very happy about that and we are very proud 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.319
 that we have already done that 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.850
 keep working to find new ones 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.650
 possibilities for the products where the 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.359
 Charcoal is not possible where 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.150
 is she still possible over all 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.310
 across our groups and ours 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.820
 motto is also for the future 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.820
 plastic
