there yet and you go back and forth with

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.070 
there yet and you go back and forth with
the<00:02:13.950> two<00:02:14.299> vials<00:02:15.299> they're<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.630> two<00:02:15.810> power

the two vials they're the two power
supplies<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.650> once<00:02:17.100> they're<00:02:17.280> both<00:02:17.459> generated

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
supplies and once they're both generated

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.020 
supplies and once they're both generated
to<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> hundred<00:02:19.170> percent<00:02:19.230> here<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.819> takes

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
to a hundred percent here and it takes

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.990 
to a hundred percent here and it takes
your<00:02:21.209> time<00:02:21.350> and<00:02:22.350> that's<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.819> that's<00:02:23.819> my
