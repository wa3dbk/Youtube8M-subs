00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.509
 Hello I now have a video ever 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.719
 still from a new camera perspective 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.130
 but I hope it is alright yes 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.160
 I was shopping a bit again 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.920
 and I bought a dvd one 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.930

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.439
 nintendo wii play actually canori 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.880
 play that even before the view is long 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.460
 if i upload the video it will 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.900
 probably already give but we do not care 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.279
 I'll start with the dvd now 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.269
 I have the second season of the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.210
 walking dead 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.880
 I have rtl2 here two weeks ago 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.840
 Chucked every day and the series is 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.040
 just terrific 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.379
 So I like the series of great characters 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.329
 great story okay what's great 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.219
 Characters annoy me and packages to 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.100
 example of rick and his son him 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.559
 something on the turks but right to 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.129
 example cool even if he is now 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.329
 changed in the reader not so 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.940
 Democratic but so he is now I am 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.739
 again the boss of decisions but that 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.320
 no matter how much it is still good and 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.689
 also the card of the return falls to me 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.460
 situation seems hopeless 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.970

 I hope you have not heard anything now 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.390
 because someone wanted to be called and 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:45.400
 so just a bit disturbed like that 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.400
 see also in a row 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:54.110
 so Saturn costs 24 eur 99 you have to 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.820
 also buy the first season 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.959

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.580
 actually, the next buy actually knows 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.980
 I do not dislike having where I am 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.420
 not the first season of any kind 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.050

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:11.570
 I think a postcard is that 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:28.400
 cup-out with slipcase five beautiful that was 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:34.600
 so what I do not do it then have 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.200
 the postcard of the class is good 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.860
 our children 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.860

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.569
 premiere on vox be the series 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.870
 that was the first good series I can 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.140
 recommend 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.180
 then I got the metro 2033 times 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.550
 is an exclusive tip the xbox 360 volt 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.530
 takeover of the software preda mine 20 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.780

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.510
 ps3 and xbox and pc 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.130
 yes and that is the first part based 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.570
 unfortunately not on the novels then 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.400
 have never read them face the 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.590
 darkness in the great mutant 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.060
 been chasing their prey, they were able to 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.760
 Desolate city ​​on the surfaces and 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.370
 use the mask weapons and the 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.070
 wants to protect the poisoned world 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.160
 Going forward and that could be here now 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.690
 not read through the camera ps from 16 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.960
 a player plays when the two 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.640
 megabyte hdtv 120 to 1080p own 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.860
 soundtracks like digital support 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.720

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:58.260
 fluent german complete and manual 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:05:00.479
 is also in german but i find it 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.390
 good with the masks with the title 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.040
 So I'm already with the masks 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.510
 to survive up there one has otherwise 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.600
 no air because it is poisoned 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:14.010
 it simply lacks guidance is the 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.540
 sect leader on it is not cool though 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.500
 in black and white or correct instructions 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:23.160
 Followed by xbox live 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.720

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.370
 Diplomatic team award an epic attack 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.169
