00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
you about the same length to go on

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.700 
you about the same length to go on
longer<00:06:07.570> it's<00:06:08.570> too<00:06:08.780> early<00:06:08.810> to<00:06:09.110> really<00:06:09.500> put

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
lace because levels of any kind levels

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.310 
lace because levels of any kind levels
are<00:06:13.580> going<00:06:13.760> to<00:06:13.820> get<00:06:13.940> at<00:06:14.120> it<00:06:14.300> but<00:06:14.419> for<00:06:15.080> the<00:06:15.169> most

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
are going to get at it but for the most

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.409 
are going to get at it but for the most
part<00:06:15.470> levels<00:06:15.950> are<00:06:16.190> generally<00:06:16.790> end<00:06:17.030> up<00:06:17.180> being

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
part levels are generally end up being

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.810 
part levels are generally end up being
longer<00:06:17.660> because<00:06:17.990> we<00:06:18.139> have<00:06:18.290> new<00:06:18.580> tech<00:06:19.580> that

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
longer because we have new tech that

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.670 
longer because we have new tech that
allows<00:06:20.090> us<00:06:20.300> to<00:06:20.450> do<00:06:20.570> much<00:06:20.750> bigger<00:06:20.990> world<00:06:21.320> so<00:06:21.650> we

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
allows us to do much bigger world so we

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.379 
allows us to do much bigger world so we
do<00:06:21.889> streaming<00:06:22.160> textures<00:06:22.610> in<00:06:22.820> our<00:06:22.910> engine<00:06:23.240> now

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:23.389 
do streaming textures in our engine now

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:24.909 
do streaming textures in our engine now
and<00:06:23.990> what<00:06:24.080> that<00:06:24.110> allows<00:06:24.320> us<00:06:24.470> to<00:06:24.740> do<00:06:24.889> is

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
and what that allows us to do is

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.310 
and what that allows us to do is
streaming<00:06:25.820> low<00:06:25.970> res<00:06:26.210> textures<00:06:26.510> and<00:06:26.750> load<00:06:27.169> out

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
streaming low res textures and load out

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.110 
streaming low res textures and load out
the<00:06:27.440> big<00:06:27.590> level<00:06:27.919> but<00:06:28.100> have<00:06:28.310> very<00:06:28.610> detailed

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
the big level but have very detailed

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.820 
the big level but have very detailed
high-res<00:06:29.780> environments<00:06:30.410> whenever<00:06:30.680> you're

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
high-res environments whenever you're

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.500 
high-res environments whenever you're
there<00:06:30.979> so<00:06:31.340> that<00:06:31.370> lets<00:06:31.639> us<00:06:31.760> build<00:06:32.000> out<00:06:32.210> bigger

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
there so that lets us build out bigger

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.879 
there so that lets us build out bigger
environments<00:06:33.050> if<00:06:33.139> we're<00:06:33.290> cliffhanger<00:06:33.740> for

environments if we're cliffhanger for

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:35.590 
environments if we're cliffhanger for
example<00:06:34.280> there's<00:06:34.700> bigger<00:06:34.910> environments<00:06:35.479> let

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 
example there's bigger environments let
