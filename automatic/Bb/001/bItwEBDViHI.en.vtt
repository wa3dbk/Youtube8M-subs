just taking quite a bit of classes and a
lot<00:01:32.570> of<00:01:32.600> them<00:01:32.869> required<00:01:33.289> a<00:01:33.560> more<00:01:33.829> attention

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
lot of them required a more attention

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
than in previous quarters and so it

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.319

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
game as much so I can spend all this

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.899 
game as much so I can spend all this
time<00:01:47.539> writing<00:01:48.020> papers<00:01:48.439> and<00:01:48.859> studying<00:01:49.249> it<00:01:49.609> was

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
time writing papers and studying it was

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.209 
time writing papers and studying it was
just<00:01:50.179> kind<00:01:50.390> of<00:01:50.450> a<00:01:50.810> gradual<00:01:51.469> process<00:01:51.710> and<00:01:51.979> it

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
just kind of a gradual process and it

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.370 
just kind of a gradual process and it
just<00:01:52.460> kind<00:01:52.700> of<00:01:52.759> sort<00:01:52.939> of<00:01:53.060> happened<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:53.659> I

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
just kind of sort of happened and I

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.929 
just kind of sort of happened and I
didn't<00:01:54.649> even<00:01:54.829> you<00:01:55.130> know<00:01:55.219> realize<00:01:55.609> this<00:01:55.789> so

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
didn't even you know realize this so

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.489 
didn't even you know realize this so
much<00:01:56.090> at<00:01:56.240> first<00:01:56.420> that<00:01:56.780> you<00:01:57.109> know<00:01:57.229> I<00:01:57.259> wasn't

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:57.499 
much at first that you know I wasn't

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:59.380 
much at first that you know I wasn't
spending<00:01:57.829> as<00:01:58.069> much<00:01:58.100> time<00:01:58.280> with<00:01:58.579> it<00:01:58.759> until<00:01:59.119> I

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
spending as much time with it until I

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.730 
spending as much time with it until I
kind<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.659> looked<00:01:59.899> at<00:01:59.990> my<00:02:00.109> channel<00:02:00.319> noticed

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
kind of looked at my channel noticed

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.139 
kind of looked at my channel noticed
that<00:02:00.859> I<00:02:00.920> wasn't<00:02:01.069> really<00:02:01.310> posting<00:02:01.819> up<00:02:01.969> as

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
that I wasn't really posting up as

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.209 
that I wasn't really posting up as
frequently<00:02:02.569> as<00:02:02.630> I<00:02:02.810> once<00:02:03.020> had<00:02:03.259> but<00:02:03.829> once<00:02:03.979> I<00:02:04.069> came

frequently as I once had but once I came

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:05.770 
frequently as I once had but once I came
to<00:02:04.310> that<00:02:04.429> realization<00:02:04.609> I<00:02:05.149> knew<00:02:05.329> that<00:02:05.539> at<00:02:05.749> some

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.660 
to that realization I knew that at some
point<00:02:06.020> most<00:02:07.009> likely<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.399> know<00:02:07.520> when<00:02:07.639> I

and brain freeze laser has been kind of
a<00:02:29.810> little<00:02:29.959> fed<00:02:30.140> up<00:02:30.170> with<00:02:30.349> the<00:02:30.980> meta<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:31.370> he

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
a little fed up with the meta so he

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.400 
a little fed up with the meta so he
hasn't<00:02:31.790> been<00:02:31.910> as<00:02:32.150> enthralled<00:02:32.660> into<00:02:32.989> yu-gi-oh

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
and he's kind of looking forward to the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.729 
and he's kind of looking forward to the
next<00:02:35.450> change<00:02:35.780> that's<00:02:36.019> gonna<00:02:36.110> happen<00:02:36.380> and

about<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.370> game<00:02:40.450> personally<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.480> think<00:02:41.599> it's

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
about the game personally I think it's

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.180 
about the game personally I think it's
healthy<00:02:42.170> for<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.380> person<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.769> go<00:02:42.890> ahead<00:02:43.040> and

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
healthy for a person to go ahead and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.100 
healthy for a person to go ahead and
step<00:02:43.400> away<00:02:43.550> from<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:44.030> game<00:02:44.209> especially<00:02:44.720> when

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
step away from the game especially when

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.870 
step away from the game especially when
they<00:02:45.230> have<00:02:45.380> real<00:02:45.709> life<00:02:45.890> stuff<00:02:46.190> going<00:02:46.489> on<00:02:46.610> that

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
they have real life stuff going on that

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.820 
they have real life stuff going on that
requires<00:02:47.690> their<00:02:47.930> attention<00:02:48.410> they<00:02:48.650> need<00:02:48.680> to

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
requires their attention they need to

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.320 
requires their attention they need to
get<00:02:49.010> away<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.400> handle<00:02:49.730> those<00:02:49.819> things<00:02:49.879> and

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
get away and handle those things and

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.270 
get away and handle those things and
yugioh<00:02:50.720> is<00:02:50.840> just<00:02:51.049> taking<00:02:51.620> up<00:02:51.739> too<00:02:51.920> much<00:02:51.950> other

game in general and they get discouraged

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.539 
game in general and they get discouraged
with<00:02:59.720> how<00:02:59.900> things<00:03:00.110> are<00:03:00.319> going<00:03:00.380> I<00:03:00.799> also<00:03:01.220> think

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
with how things are going I also think

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.370 
with how things are going I also think
it's<00:03:01.700> good<00:03:01.849> to<00:03:02.000> get<00:03:02.090> away<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.690> just<00:03:03.230> take<00:03:03.349> a

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
it's good to get away and just take a

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.229 
it's good to get away and just take a
step<00:03:03.620> back<00:03:03.680> so<00:03:04.099> that<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.819> know<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.000> don't

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
step back so that you know you don't

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.699 
step back so that you know you don't
alternately<00:03:05.720> quit<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.170> game<00:03:06.349> because<00:03:06.590> I've
