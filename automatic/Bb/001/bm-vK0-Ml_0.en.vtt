00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 hello to all that so welcome a 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.130
 new video but I hope you are very 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.290
 Well and well, they see me with a washed face 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.480
 because I'm about to meet a challenge from 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.910
 which nominated me in law and I'm going to leave you 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.250
 your video in the information box for 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.710
 who see this challenge is called mixed 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.380
 makeup challenge and in spanish is 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.910
 hodgepodge makeup is a challenge 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.340
 totally different that I have not seen 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.380
 but I started to check videos and the truth 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.170
 is that they are very funny very very father 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.900
 interesting is not glamorous this is 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.059
 on the contrary it is quite the opposite is the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.460
 glamor they always see in the videos in 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.290
 the tutorials and well I did a lot 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.600
 illusion to do it because the first one because 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.160
 they nominated me and in second because I think 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.469
 that this is a super father video and 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.890
 funny that explained what it consists of 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.480
 this challenge in a box I have the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.190
 products apply and in the other I have the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.620
 parts where I'm going to apply them then 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.690
 that's what you're going to mix 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.390
 and then it will come out totally different 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.820
 from a normal makeup application 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.010
 so good without seeing I'm taking out here 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.010
 the first one is going to be contour 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.360
 the outline is going to be on the lips god 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.700
 I do not know how I 'm going to do this for 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.400
 the outline I'm going to use this the 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.160
 palette of citi color and on the lips 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.260
 God can I use the most 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.390
 dark because I'm actually using 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.900
 the most drastic colors that can 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.900
 find there 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.280
 I can grow around what else 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.979
 oh my god 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.650
 although sexy 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.210
 How are you 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.050
 very beautiful because first now it continues 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.200
 with 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.060
 which is the correct 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.060
 and the correct one we are going to apply 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.880
 in the face is going to be the whole face like that 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.290
 that I had put this concealer on 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.479
 here but it makes me that it's going to be a 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.479
 battle around the face 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.060
 and once I apply it I'm going to 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.050
 blur another bag that is more 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.700
 synthetic 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.700
 This is not so serious, I think 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.610
 this is as if it were a base 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.560
 and then I put on a shirt color 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.239
 super father to make it look good and 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.930
 by the way I had the hook this to 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.930
 grab my hair 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.750
 much better I'm much prettier 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.680
 for scola sprint to little not the following 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.680
 it's going to be shadow 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.230
 in the eyelashes 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:03.390
 of shade I chose to be here this abode 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.250
 super intense and I'm going to use it with a 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.020
 brush from here 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.930
 and I'm going to apply it on the tabs as 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.409
 If i were 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.440
 mascara later you notice because you do not know 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:19.450
 nothing nothing 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.450
 This touched me something simple 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.610
 do not 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.000
 but I know he does not do this type of challenge 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.940
 someone I want to see does not want to see us 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.460
 suffer or that got tired that it was always 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.410
 like pure glamor or something like that and 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.360
 I look like a zombie and I can of 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.600
 interpret a series of the walking 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.830
 dead or something 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.210
 or that the following is illuminating 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.420
 and 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.430
 the eyes something very simple also and of 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.810
 Illuminator like I'll grab the palette 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.810
 silicone 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.880
 and applied it in the eyes 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.880
 all the eye 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.170
 and if you want to do it, they are very 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.930
 invited to do them, anyone can 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.180
 do and then leave me your photo of 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.690
 result in my social networks are left 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.910
 the information box ok and in the shade is 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.510
 committing is the eye the following are 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.510
 lips 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.820
 in cheeks I'm going to put the color that 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.070
 I chose to see what horrible 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.160
 this is put on the colored cheeks 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.460
 orange and whole is good at blurring 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.199
 with the state 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.199
 it's going to be like blush 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.700
 as michael 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.300
 yes yes I look like 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.300
 crazy ghosts 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.700
 it's like the nacaranda 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.030
 cheeks are already there and we go with him 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.110
 with base 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:21.449
 and the next one is in eyebrows 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:25.969
 the signs that are very easy do 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.969
 eyebrows go to camouflage 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:36.090
 they will look like darker corrector 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.240
 clear of the face and then the base in the 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.240
 eyebrows 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.449
 and finally girls who gives mascara on 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.759
 eye bags 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:50.659
 this really is going to be fatal this is what 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:55.610
 will complement the look completely 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:55.610
 spooky and halloween 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.250
 I will even blur it as if it were 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.250
 corrector 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.990
 it may be that I got a spider's web and 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.389
 I want to see how I'm going to remove this this 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.600
 mascara here from this area ok that 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:23.840
 afterwards what is happening to me in this 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.280
 moment like that to a super elegant dance 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.820
 because I think it's the best in 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:32.000
 trend and the truth is that yes I would get 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.680
 all the looks on my face because it's 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.280
 a super makeup stop them 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.770
 forgetting this is ridiculously 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.680
 bad what horror I do not know how it will remove 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:47.759
 this but good as that would be the 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:52.889
 Challenge challenge met so well I do not

 information did not come to jennifer to erika and 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.080
 Emeralds always do not think I do not

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.030

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.250
