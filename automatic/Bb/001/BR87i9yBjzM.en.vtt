 the characters who have made the history of sport now with - federico bonfanti 

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:12.889
 when instead of a sport 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.040
 it becomes problematic to accept 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.140
 to lose in that sport 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.670
 it happened to the English who invented the football between receipts 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.060

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.580
 time 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.150
 which is happening to the Americans who have not won any more in recent years 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.010
 international - work photo or basketball 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.280
 however, they maintain a high level in the sense that American basketball stories 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.290
 they can be different from all of them 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.800
 as you already know at the university level in the united states it is played 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.370

 nancy that the body that super sees all this with free chests of 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.820
 competition for the type of scholarships they see students being given 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.650
 athletes 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.880
 however, that overall number of points is not assigned 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.220
 you start then it doesn't matter if you won a school of boys without me bag of 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.810

 against such a mary or admits coming down with 6 players though if you can help me 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.979

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.060
 believe it 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.150
 to me they are ven. line three points for 69 points 24 minutes 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.920

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.130
