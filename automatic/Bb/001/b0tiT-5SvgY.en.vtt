00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.090
 dry shampoo and get a lot of mega 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.410

 leaders also want to be incredibly fast 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:49.009
 for guess that is the majority 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.600
 that it's just in your genes I have 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.009
 two very close to parents both 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.119

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.259
 snake 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.149
 so then i just left home 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:03.050
 must be included and the last question 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:08.740
 exit or ultimate tip for novice 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:11.569
 entrepreneur yes that is a very nice one 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.500
 don't underestimate it is whole 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.270
 important 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.680
 if it had been easy to get the 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.569
 run a business 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.490
 had done irene and it certainly is 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.080
 not it is very hard work 100 hours 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.920
 seemed to be working and I had to 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.930
 to have 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.310
 so prepare yourself well for preparation 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.010
 half the battle 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.810
 and 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.610
 if you stay positive you don't attract anything 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.680
 from what other people say 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.640
 because positivity is the key only 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.640
 Thinking that area
