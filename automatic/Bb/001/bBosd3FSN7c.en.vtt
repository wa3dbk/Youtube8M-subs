hi my name is George Mackenzie I'm not a
doctor<00:00:02.909> but<00:00:03.270> I<00:00:03.419> have<00:00:03.659> had<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:03.899> lot<00:00:04.140> of<00:00:04.200> kidney

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
doctor but I have had a lot of kidney

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.900 
doctor but I have had a lot of kidney
problems<00:00:04.589> through<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.250> years<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:05.759> I've

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
problems through the years and I've

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.369 
problems through the years and I've
learned<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.330> lot<00:00:06.450> about<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.870> different<00:00:07.170> types

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
learned a lot about the different types

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.589 
learned a lot about the different types
of<00:00:07.560> kidney<00:00:07.799> disorders<00:00:08.340> so<00:00:09.059> I've<00:00:09.150> created<00:00:09.330> this

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
of kidney disorders so I've created this

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.810 
of kidney disorders so I've created this
video<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:10.139> help<00:00:10.290> anyone<00:00:10.860> who<00:00:11.040> may<00:00:11.250> suspect

video to help anyone who may suspect
they're<00:00:12.030> developing<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.570> kidney<00:00:12.840> problem<00:00:13.259> and

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
they're developing a kidney problem and

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.990 
they're developing a kidney problem and
would<00:00:13.830> like<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.070> learn<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> little<00:00:14.580> bit<00:00:14.700> more

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000
