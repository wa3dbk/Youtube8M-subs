00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.009
 yes now that we know how to matrices 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.170
 of course, the question adds 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.480
 on whether you paint does not scratch too 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.360
 maybe in some way 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.759
 can multiply and the simplest 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.619
 form the simplest way how 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.189
 you can multiply a matrix 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.080
 is called scalar multiplication and 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.039
 the beautiful that scalar multiplication 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.599
 is that we already know them in principle 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.330
 We can see that at once 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:36.020
 let's assume 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:39.450
 we would have been here in a matrix 1234 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.700
 and we can do that now 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.530
 act on other matrix and we take 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.129
 Just give us the same matrix 12 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.129
 4 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.460
 what's coming out now 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.780
 how was that that was just components 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:02.000
 that means 24 68 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.070
 and if we look closely now then 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.440
 It's easy for us to realize that 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.509
 every entry just taken two times or 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.060
 if not just one of these 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.009
 View the matrices and the result 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.820
 that could be because that 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:23.290
 maybe two times my exit 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:25.990
 matrix took 12 34 x 2 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.020
 and this one 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.720
 Zahlmann matrix ansgar multiplication 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.310
 and to make sure it's not 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.380
 random was 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.620
 let's just take this matrix now 3 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:43.430
 x 3x12 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.430
 34 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:57.150
 that would be the matrix 134 now 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:02:03.230
 + the whole 1234 again 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:07.369
 just the whole again in 1234 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.020
 and now this is elemental wise again 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.840
 so on the top left I have the three times 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:17.400
 the 1 write it like that 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.980
 on the right I have the two and three times 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.410
 left once the 3 and here I have 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.410
 three times the company so 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.670
 we can see that if you can add 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.159
 then you know the same as the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.900
 scalaria multiplication works 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.900
 three when she stands in front of her 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.079
 so the 3 front will be easy in each one 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.079
 entry once reingeschoben 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.900
 that's just what you see 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.600
 would have looked like that would have done 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.890
 you cheat and just 33 more here 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.230
 write what you actually have 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.050
 but if you think about it that way 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.620
 three times a matrix the matrix plus the 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:07.880
 matrix plus the matrix is ​​then yields 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.370
 the whole course for so if 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.320
 I'm up here but something like 15 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.480
 it would not have been written down 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.880
 been so easy here one and a half times 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.820
 the matrix to write him 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:24.100
 but just because that with the 3 and with the 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.100
 2 works this way 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:31.180
 you generally define that one there 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.180
 a matrix 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.810
 make it four entries it could 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.980
 of course also be much more abcd 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:46.560
 that would be exactly how it works 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:49.170
 land is the matrix la mala 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.319
 lambda is it any number level 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.260
 entry here several countries xb here 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:58.250
 it would be a slow c 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.250
 It would be slow 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.670
 so 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.750
 nothing new but we can 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.750
 but again something more
