quick but it's not the most refined unit
they<00:01:06.320> doesn't<00:01:06.650> spin<00:01:06.950> quite<00:01:07.550> as<00:01:07.730> freely<00:01:07.940> as<00:01:08.030> I'd

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
they doesn't spin quite as freely as I'd

they doesn't spin quite as freely as I'd
like<00:01:08.510> it<00:01:09.200> more<00:01:09.260> kind<00:01:09.710> of<00:01:09.770> growls<00:01:10.760> its<00:01:11.150> way<00:01:11.360> to

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
like it more kind of growls its way to

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.140 
like it more kind of growls its way to
the<00:01:12.050> red<00:01:12.320> line<00:01:15.100> it<00:01:16.100> is<00:01:16.250> very<00:01:16.430> torquey<00:01:16.820> though

the red line it is very torquey though

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.790 
the red line it is very torquey though
which<00:01:17.360> means<00:01:17.600> it<00:01:17.720> doesn't<00:01:17.870> really<00:01:18.229> matter<00:01:18.620> if

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
which means it doesn't really matter if

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.110 
which means it doesn't really matter if
you<00:01:19.010> end<00:01:19.190> up<00:01:19.280> in<00:01:19.370> the<00:01:19.460> wrong<00:01:19.640> gear<00:01:19.880> while

blips the throttle when you're changing
down<00:01:36.619> again<00:01:37.009> so<00:01:37.040> you<00:01:37.220> don't<00:01:37.250> have<00:01:37.400> to<00:01:37.520> worry

about learning how to heel toe and it's

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.700 
about learning how to heel toe and it's
just<00:01:40.280> a<00:01:40.340> simple<00:01:40.790> idea<00:01:40.940> but<00:01:41.540> then<00:01:42.080> all<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:42.530> best

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
just a simple idea but then all the best

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.670 
just a simple idea but then all the best
inventions<00:01:43.340> are<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:44.810> 3-series<00:01:45.200> it<00:01:45.500> is

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
inventions are the 3-series it is

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.499 
inventions are the 3-series it is
shorter<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.280> wider<00:01:46.520> than<00:01:46.729> its<00:01:46.940> predecessor

shorter and wider than its predecessor

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.150 
shorter and wider than its predecessor
and<00:01:47.690> it<00:01:47.840> has<00:01:47.930> a<00:01:47.960> more<00:01:48.229> aggressive<00:01:48.290> steering

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
and it has a more aggressive steering

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.310 
and it has a more aggressive steering
setup<00:01:49.490> as<00:01:49.610> well<00:01:49.640> all<00:01:50.360> of<00:01:50.420> this<00:01:50.600> is<00:01:50.900> designed<00:01:51.200> to

setup as well all of this is designed to

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.060 
setup as well all of this is designed to
make<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.470> car

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
make the car

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.540 

this<00:01:56.610> car<00:01:56.910> feels<00:01:57.630> noticeably<00:01:58.500> sharper<00:01:58.770> than

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
this car feels noticeably sharper than

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.540 
this car feels noticeably sharper than
the<00:01:59.820> 350z

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
the 350z

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.120 
the 350z
and<00:02:02.550> it's<00:02:02.850> got<00:02:03.060> more<00:02:03.780> grip<00:02:04.290> which<00:02:04.770> means<00:02:05.010> that

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
and it's got more grip which means that

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.370 
and it's got more grip which means that
you<00:02:05.220> can<00:02:05.370> just<00:02:05.520> attack<00:02:05.790> turns<00:02:06.120> a<00:02:06.510> little<00:02:07.200> bit

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
you can just attack turns a little bit

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.830 
you can just attack turns a little bit
harder<00:02:08.000> but<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.150> have<00:02:09.240> to<00:02:09.360> be<00:02:09.450> careful

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
harder but you have to be careful

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.670 
harder but you have to be careful
because<00:02:10.130> there's<00:02:11.130> no<00:02:11.310> disguising<00:02:12.200> where<00:02:13.200> the

understeer also the rear seems a little

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260

bit soft which means that in fast turns
it<00:02:25.500> can<00:02:25.740> get<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.980> bit<00:02:26.190> vague<00:02:26.460> but<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:27.210> should<00:02:27.330> be

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
it can get a bit vague but it should be

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.330 
it can get a bit vague but it should be

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
little bit unfair because the Cayman

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.179 
little bit unfair because the Cayman
