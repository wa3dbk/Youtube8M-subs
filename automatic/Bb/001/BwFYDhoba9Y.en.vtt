00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.540 
considered like one of the fusion foods
not<00:05:26.820> because<00:05:27.120> it's<00:05:27.300> combined<00:05:27.659> with<00:05:27.750> other

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
not because it's combined with other

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.550 
not because it's combined with other
cuisine<00:05:29.550> but<00:05:30.180> because<00:05:30.630> of<00:05:30.659> the<00:05:30.990> combination

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560
