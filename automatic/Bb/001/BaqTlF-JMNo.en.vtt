00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
the DX is one of my favourite series of

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.470 
the DX is one of my favourite series of
Ninjago<00:00:37.079> because<00:00:38.069> I<00:00:38.100> really<00:00:38.579> like<00:00:38.760> their<00:00:39.089> suit

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
Ninjago because I really like their suit

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.799 
Ninjago because I really like their suit
and<00:00:39.659> how<00:00:39.780> they<00:00:39.929> look<00:00:40.170> like<00:00:40.409> with<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.890> dragon

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
and how they look like with the dragon

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.860 
and how they look like with the dragon
so<00:00:43.760> this<00:00:44.760> how<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.089> looks<00:00:45.300> like<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.989> his<00:00:46.920> mask

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
so this how it looks like with his mask

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:56.899 
so this how it looks like with his mask
and<00:00:50.389> without<00:00:51.389> his<00:00:51.569> mask<00:00:51.780> well<00:00:52.229> here<00:00:52.589> it<00:00:52.679> is

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.689 

so<00:00:57.420> here<00:00:57.749> he<00:00:57.839> is<00:00:57.929> without<00:00:58.109> him<00:00:58.559> regular<00:00:59.339> Zane

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
so here he is without him regular Zane

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.649 
so here he is without him regular Zane
face<00:01:00.089> and<00:01:01.670> what<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.699> really<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.149> about<00:01:03.179> their

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
face and what I really like about their

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.960 
face and what I really like about their
suits<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.470> dragon<00:01:05.040> design<00:01:05.220> at<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> front

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.670 
is and this one so next will go with the
weapons<00:02:25.159> this<00:02:25.430> is<00:02:25.489> his<00:02:25.819> golden<00:02:26.299> weapon<00:02:26.810> it's
