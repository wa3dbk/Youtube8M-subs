00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
set up a bolt here on my vise to show

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.619 
set up a bolt here on my vise to show
you<00:00:44.100> how<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.430> torque<00:00:44.760> wrench<00:00:45.000> works<00:00:45.300> I'm

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
you how the torque wrench works I'm

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.000 
you how the torque wrench works I'm
going<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.809> show<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.930> how<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.140> operate<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.890> how

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
going to show you how to operate it how

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.279 
going to show you how to operate it how
to<00:00:47.070> adjust<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:49.340> here<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.690> so<00:00:51.690> torque

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
to adjust it and here it is so torque

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.939 
to adjust it and here it is so torque
wrench<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.520> just<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.760> normal<00:00:54.059> socket<00:00:54.949> you

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
wrench this is just a normal socket you

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.380 
wrench this is just a normal socket you
put<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:57.350> snaps<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.460> if<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.149> torque

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
put it on snaps in so if the torque

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.200 
put it on snaps in so if the torque
wrench<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.719> very<00:01:01.410> much<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.800> normal

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
wrench is very much like a normal

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.649 
wrench is very much like a normal
ratchet<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.390> got<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.170> off<00:01:04.760> on<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.450> end

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
ratchet it's got on and off on the end

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.289 
ratchet it's got on and off on the end
here<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.220> can<00:01:08.220> see<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.030> where<00:01:09.180> your

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
here you can see this is where your

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.570 
here you can see this is where your
torque<00:01:09.600> comes<00:01:09.840> from<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:11.040> probably<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.460> don't

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
torque comes from you probably I don't

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.070 
torque comes from you probably I don't
know<00:01:11.700> if<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.850> could<00:01:12.000> see<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.450> numbers<00:01:13.049> here

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
know if you could see the numbers here
