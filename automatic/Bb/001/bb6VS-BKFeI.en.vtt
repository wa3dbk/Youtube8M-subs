00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 this is it is very egg été 2000 and 4 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.189
 stand together with it's over 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.440
 and the headset the 120 headset 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.630
 well it is a relatively compact tripod 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.250
 you can fold it well and compact 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.900
 you can of course just use the legs 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.850
 simply fold down 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.650
 but you can also fold the legs upwards 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.000
 the go through this button if you 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.609
 it presses its different positions 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.109
 where you can put in but you can 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.740
 so they also fold up completely and 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.869
 if you do that 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.359
 then I still take a total of course 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.740
 a lot less space in than you do 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.940
 just down wrong 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.800
 so it's a it's a compact 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.719
 tripod which consists of three 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.070
 so different parts can be on three 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.870
 extend parts 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.969
 you take it out and of course you come 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.559
 just yes the rest of the foot 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.180
 turn off automatically 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.129
 because it is so compact it is easy 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.719
 to take it good to him 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.890
 there is also a carrying bag 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.800
 included that I have here 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.360
 well that carrying bag is not just one 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.250
 useless bag that comes with it 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.649
 they fine the bag, it is also very good 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.449
 each other and what's nice is that 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.120
 is padded so he will make it thicker 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.979
 that yes any bumps or so performance 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.450
 be well taken care of 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.400
 in addition you will find a few small boxes 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.380
 the inside and outside here 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.119
 also at the back and you will find two 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.010
 shoulder straps included which also has 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.290
 one tom builders both strives to become one 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.850
 kind of backpack for your tripod 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.409
 well in those little boxes you can 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.420
 possibly yes the supplied 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.159
 drop the tool so that your tripod 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.930
 can easily remodel on 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.460
 different ways of wire can still be found 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.530
 more has a small wears if you go for it 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.150
 the smaller middle column and there we go 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.009
 a little further on to 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.750
 we are now looking at another guy 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.840
 tripods so an aluminum tripod he 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.549
 is 1.6 kilos of light so yes easy with it 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.960
 to take your foot is also comfortable with you 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.240
 course again at the feet 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.920
 rubber feet but you can turn and 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.619
 if you run then one automatically comes 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.960
 metal pin out so if you yes on on 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.490
 want to take a picture of the surface of the earth 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.770
 that is still great and that too 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.720
 stays firmly behind the top 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.420
 we think about the steering head with ball 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.680
 there is included as standard in this set we 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.240
 find a degree scale that makes you 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.159
 can easily create a panorama you can 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.659
 of course also fix everything and it 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.950
 is a ballhead is he can really all 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.759
 turn around 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.890
 and we see that we are at the top here 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.960
 embedded in other words have a water pass 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.580
 Causing 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.990
 you do not always perfectly straighten your tripod 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.240
 need to stand but you can always do the 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.220
 Cameras also police positionable 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.420
 that always stands up perfectly and 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.550
 naturally also finds a picture with it 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.080
 Supplied with an extra fuse where you 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.930
 of course your camera just easy 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.430
 can attach to that turn then again 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.990
 just stuck 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.430
 yes for the rest you can of course in 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.770
 so adjust the height to the long one 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.260
 middle column that I have here turn it yes 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.690
 firmly and put your paws all over 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.790
 it comes to about a meter 45 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.660
 so that's a fair amount for such 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.730
 compact tripod 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.370
 yes through the leg all the way into the 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.480
 horizontal position and therefore actually 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.120
 completely flat so to speak 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.430
 and then use the smaller ones 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.080
 yes from smaller center piece 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.150
 then you come to a minimum height of 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.760
 13 and a half centimeters is ideal 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.780
 for example for macro photography 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.880
 In addition , you will also find two of the 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.860
 we find legwarmers on three legs 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.690
 because of this year those never cold hands like 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.040
 you grab it and it's cold outside and you 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.290
 naturally also have a lot of grip as 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.090
 you asked that lift it 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.800
 well for the rest what is interesting 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.690
 that with this tripod 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.550
 yes actually the middle column can be removed 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.140
 can pick up can not only pure too 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.170
 bash you can also turn it real 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.020
 and actually the minimum length is that 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.880
 you then have is actually a piece 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.710
 lower than 13 centimeters 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.660
 because if you do well when you say 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.550
 but turn around and you can do that with this one 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.150
 long variant but you can do it too 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.380
 with the shorter version then even then 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.670
 retighten 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.960
 you can of course use the shorter version 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.970
 we don't use it that far 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.320
 protruding and if you extend the legs a little 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.620
 doing so your principle can heal you 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.510
 camera equipment hang below and yes 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.320
 to shoot to the ground 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.090
 so to speak 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.230
 so you can do it then 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.459
 in all directions again 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.840
 move and that is of course super 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:56.150
 interesting and and then you can do nice shots 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.190
 create a very layer from a whole 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.560
 low point for the rest, of course 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.569
 also a hook like a net saw on 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.980
 the middle column and then the hook 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.870
 could you possibly add some extra weight 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.459
 to be more stable with yellow 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.780
 leave 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.260
 total weight you can put on it 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.360
 putting it on equipment is 12 kilos 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.699
 so he can also have quite a bit of weight 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.859
 on you can also with what a hefty lens 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.930
 will also be able to handle it without problems 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.090
 now you want more information about this TT 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.229
 2011 illustrative in combination with it 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.700
 120 ball head 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.100
 or you might go right 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.350
 order then go to joop.nl tripod 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.830
