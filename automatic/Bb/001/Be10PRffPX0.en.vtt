00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
noticed I'm not using the iPad case that

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.740 
noticed I'm not using the iPad case that
I<00:04:09.680> was<00:04:09.890> showing<00:04:10.250> in<00:04:10.370> my<00:04:10.400> Michael<00:04:11.180> Kors<00:04:11.540> on

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
I was showing in my Michael Kors on

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.330 
I was showing in my Michael Kors on
coach<00:04:11.959> haul<00:04:12.230> video<00:04:12.530> which<00:04:12.739> I'll<00:04:12.890> put<00:04:13.040> a<00:04:13.100> link

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
coach haul video which I'll put a link

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.880 
coach haul video which I'll put a link
like<00:04:13.519> right<00:04:13.790> here<00:04:14.180> but<00:04:14.989> I<00:04:15.170> changed<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.709> case

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
like right here but I changed the case

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.430 
like right here but I changed the case
because<00:04:16.250> that<00:04:16.280> case<00:04:16.700> the<00:04:17.329> keyboard<00:04:17.780> was<00:04:18.079> it

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
because that case the keyboard was it

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.610 
because that case the keyboard was it
worked<00:04:18.650> fine<00:04:18.919> but<00:04:19.280> it<00:04:20.060> was<00:04:20.299> kind<00:04:20.630> of<00:04:20.750> bulky<00:04:21.380> a

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
worked fine but it was kind of bulky a

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.529 
worked fine but it was kind of bulky a
lot<00:04:22.400> of<00:04:22.460> people<00:04:22.610> ask<00:04:22.700> me<00:04:22.820> where<00:04:22.970> I<00:04:23.030> got<00:04:23.240> it<00:04:23.419> and

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
lot of people ask me where I got it and

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.150 
lot of people ask me where I got it and
I<00:04:23.630> actually<00:04:23.780> got<00:04:24.020> it<00:04:24.140> on<00:04:24.200> eBay<00:04:24.500> all<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:24.860> typed

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
I actually got it on eBay all I typed

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.780 
I actually got it on eBay all I typed
was<00:04:25.370> white<00:04:26.060> iPad

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
was white iPad

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.340 
was white iPad
Cubert<00:04:27.000> case<00:04:27.180> or<00:04:27.360> something<00:04:27.630> like<00:04:27.720> that<00:04:28.140> and

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
Cubert case or something like that and

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.680 
Cubert case or something like that and
it<00:04:28.680> was<00:04:28.800> about<00:04:29.010> thirty<00:04:29.580> dollars<00:04:29.730> that<00:04:30.180> one<00:04:30.420> all

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
it was about thirty dollars that one all

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.690 
it was about thirty dollars that one all
right<00:04:31.200> no<00:04:31.380> I<00:04:31.410> think<00:04:31.500> it<00:04:31.740> was<00:04:31.800> twenty<00:04:32.220> actually

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
right no I think it was twenty actually

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.570 
right no I think it was twenty actually
I<00:04:32.730> was<00:04:33.150> twenty<00:04:33.450> and<00:04:33.630> it<00:04:34.320> worked<00:04:34.830> okay<00:04:35.280> for<00:04:35.550> a

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
I was twenty and it worked okay for a

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.550 
I was twenty and it worked okay for a
while<00:04:35.730> but<00:04:35.910> then<00:04:36.120> it<00:04:36.570> was<00:04:36.780> kind<00:04:37.020> of<00:04:37.170> annoying

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
while but then it was kind of annoying

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.710 
while but then it was kind of annoying
because<00:04:37.830> when<00:04:38.010> you<00:04:38.340> open<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:39.000> case

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
because when you open the case

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.790 
because when you open the case
it<00:04:40.230> had<00:04:40.500> like<00:04:40.710> all<00:04:40.920> this<00:04:41.070> extra<00:04:41.430> uhm<00:04:42.560> like<00:04:43.560> this

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
it had like all this extra uhm like this

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.710 
it had like all this extra uhm like this
extra<00:04:44.130> material<00:04:44.250> kind<00:04:44.970> of<00:04:45.120> in<00:04:45.240> your<00:04:45.330> way<00:04:45.540> we

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
extra material kind of in your way we

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.900 
extra material kind of in your way we
were<00:04:45.810> typing<00:04:46.260> and<00:04:46.560> yeah<00:04:47.220> so<00:04:47.520> I'm<00:04:47.760> actually

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
were typing and yeah so I'm actually

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.910 
were typing and yeah so I'm actually
going<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.300> invest<00:04:48.780> in<00:04:48.960> a<00:04:49.050> clam<00:04:49.320> case<00:04:49.620> pretty

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
going to invest in a clam case pretty

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.980 
going to invest in a clam case pretty
soon<00:04:50.250> if<00:04:50.910> you<00:04:51.090> guys<00:04:51.240> don't<00:04:51.510> know<00:04:51.570> what<00:04:51.690> that<00:04:51.840> is

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
soon if you guys don't know what that is

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.350 
soon if you guys don't know what that is
it's<00:04:52.200> like<00:04:52.380> this<00:04:52.620> case<00:04:53.100> that<00:04:53.460> it<00:04:54.060> kind<00:04:54.330> of

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
it's like this case that it kind of

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.120 
it's like this case that it kind of
turns<00:04:54.630> your<00:04:54.810> iPad<00:04:54.990> into<00:04:55.350> a<00:04:55.380> laptop<00:04:55.890> so

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
turns your iPad into a laptop so

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.390 
turns your iPad into a laptop so
basically<00:04:57.030> like<00:04:57.300> if<00:04:57.480> you<00:04:57.570> open<00:04:57.870> it<00:04:57.960> like<00:04:58.110> this

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
basically like if you open it like this

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.650 
basically like if you open it like this
the<00:04:59.400> screen<00:04:59.730> will<00:04:59.910> be<00:05:00.030> here<00:05:00.360> and<00:05:00.450> then<00:05:00.540> the

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
the screen will be here and then the

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.790 
the screen will be here and then the
keyboard<00:05:01.050> would<00:05:01.110> just<00:05:01.260> be<00:05:01.380> here<00:05:01.620> and<00:05:01.710> you<00:05:01.770> just

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
keyboard would just be here and you just

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.740 
keyboard would just be here and you just
close<00:05:02.220> it<00:05:02.430> and<00:05:02.520> then<00:05:02.670> you<00:05:02.730> can<00:05:02.940> also<00:05:03.060> make<00:05:03.210> into

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
close it and then you can also make into

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.230 
close it and then you can also make into
like<00:05:03.900> a<00:05:03.930> tablet<00:05:04.470> form<00:05:04.740> and<00:05:04.980> it's<00:05:05.790> a<00:05:05.880> lot<00:05:06.030> more

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
like a tablet form and it's a lot more

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.600 
like a tablet form and it's a lot more
slimmer<00:05:06.810> than<00:05:07.050> the<00:05:07.110> iPad<00:05:07.860> keyboard<00:05:08.070> case<00:05:08.400> I

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
slimmer than the iPad keyboard case I

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.120 
slimmer than the iPad keyboard case I
was<00:05:08.760> using<00:05:09.030> so<00:05:09.390> yeah<00:05:10.170> once<00:05:10.530> I<00:05:10.680> get<00:05:10.860> that<00:05:11.070> I'll

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
was using so yeah once I get that I'll

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.880 
was using so yeah once I get that I'll
probably<00:05:11.640> do<00:05:12.000> a<00:05:12.030> review<00:05:12.390> video<00:05:12.600> on<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.650> clown

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
probably do a review video on the clown

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.680 
probably do a review video on the clown
case<00:05:14.100> so<00:05:14.250> I<00:05:14.310> actually<00:05:14.490> get<00:05:14.730> it<00:05:14.850> cuz<00:05:15.060> I'm<00:05:15.270> really

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
case so I actually get it cuz I'm really

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.960 
case so I actually get it cuz I'm really
thinking<00:05:15.900> about<00:05:16.080> investing<00:05:16.590> in<00:05:16.650> one<00:05:16.800> so<00:05:17.040> right

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
thinking about investing in one so right

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.470 
thinking about investing in one so right
now<00:05:18.120> I'm<00:05:18.270> just<00:05:18.450> using<00:05:18.630> this<00:05:18.840> plain<00:05:19.230> leather

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480
