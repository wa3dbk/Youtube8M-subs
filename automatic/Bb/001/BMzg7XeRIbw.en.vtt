00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:11.729 
is so pretty and goes with our whole
winery<00:04:01.510> theme<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.900> originally<00:04:11.560> we<00:04:11.709> thought

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
winery theme and originally we thought

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.530 
winery theme and originally we thought
we<00:04:12.040> were<00:04:12.130> gonna<00:04:12.310> paint<00:04:12.700> these<00:04:12.970> with<00:04:13.359> the

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
we were gonna paint these with the

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.539 
we were gonna paint these with the
silver<00:04:13.930> but<00:04:14.140> then<00:04:14.290> when<00:04:14.470> we<00:04:14.620> set<00:04:14.890> it<00:04:14.920> up<00:04:15.190> at<00:04:15.400> the

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
silver but then when we set it up at the

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.150 
silver but then when we set it up at the
winery<00:04:15.760> we<00:04:16.299> actually<00:04:16.720> liked<00:04:17.049> how<00:04:17.890> it<00:04:17.950> was

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
winery we actually liked how it was

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.699 
winery we actually liked how it was
adding<00:04:18.940> like<00:04:19.090> another<00:04:19.329> texture<00:04:20.019> to<00:04:20.620> the

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
adding like another texture to the

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.080 
adding like another texture to the
centerpieces<00:04:21.160> so<00:04:21.400> I<00:04:21.430> think<00:04:21.729> we're<00:04:21.850> just<00:04:21.880> gonna

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
centerpieces so I think we're just gonna

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.969 
centerpieces so I think we're just gonna
keep<00:04:22.330> it<00:04:22.479> glass<00:04:22.690> and<00:04:23.560> it<00:04:23.650> looked<00:04:23.830> really

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
keep it glass and it looked really

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.950 
keep it glass and it looked really
elegant<00:04:24.520> and<00:04:24.610> pretty<00:04:24.820> if<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:25.330> haven't<00:04:25.780> seen

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
elegant and pretty if you haven't seen

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.430 
elegant and pretty if you haven't seen
