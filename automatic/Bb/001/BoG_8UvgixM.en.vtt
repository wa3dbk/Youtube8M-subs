00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319 
chips and sauce all the time I think

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:03.110 
chips and sauce all the time I think
what<00:05:01.440> really<00:05:01.590> makes<00:05:01.740> it<00:05:02.099> good<00:05:02.250> is<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.639> fact

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
what really makes it good is the fact

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.149 
what really makes it good is the fact
that<00:05:03.210> we<00:05:03.509> combine<00:05:04.289> only<00:05:04.650> fresh<00:05:04.949> ingredients

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:05.159 
that we combine only fresh ingredients

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:07.490 
that we combine only fresh ingredients
so<00:05:05.759> I<00:05:05.789> think<00:05:05.940> it's<00:05:06.210> a<00:05:06.360> good<00:05:06.780> combination<00:05:07.110> of

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
so I think it's a good combination of

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.409 
so I think it's a good combination of
using<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:08.219> right<00:05:08.400> spices<00:05:08.639> and<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.240> right

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419
