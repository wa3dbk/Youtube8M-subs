to do with that they didn't say but that

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.129 
to do with that they didn't say but that
could<00:03:36.880> mean<00:03:36.910> that<00:03:37.269> it<00:03:37.420> could<00:03:37.569> be<00:03:37.599> on<00:03:37.810> multiple

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
could mean that it could be on multiple

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.240 
could mean that it could be on multiple
carriers<00:03:38.319> at<00:03:38.500> one<00:03:38.650> time<00:03:38.769> which<00:03:38.950> is<00:03:38.980> really

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
carriers at one time which is really

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.550 
carriers at one time which is really
cool<00:03:39.690> 4.3<00:03:40.690> inch<00:03:41.040> WVGA<00:03:42.040> display<00:03:42.989> dual<00:03:43.989> cameras

on<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.829> back<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:45.160> you'll<00:03:45.280> see<00:03:45.370> when<00:03:45.489> it<00:03:45.579> flips

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
on the back and you'll see when it flips

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.159 
on the back and you'll see when it flips
around<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.090> that's<00:03:46.209> how<00:03:46.389> they<00:03:46.510> shoot<00:03:46.720> in<00:03:46.810> 3d

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
around and that's how they shoot in 3d

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.020 
around and that's how they shoot in 3d
so<00:03:47.709> it<00:03:47.799> looks<00:03:47.980> really<00:03:48.310> interesting<00:03:48.340> no

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
so it looks really interesting no

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.270 
so it looks really interesting no
pricing<00:03:49.510> no<00:03:49.690> availability<00:03:50.319> yet<00:03:50.560> looks<00:03:51.069> really

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
pricing no availability yet looks really

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.250 
pricing no availability yet looks really
interesting<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:52.180> optimist<00:03:52.599> pattern<00:03:52.870> 3g

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
interesting the optimist pattern 3g

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.659 
interesting the optimist pattern 3g

up to a 3d TV through the hdmi port

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.310 
up to a 3d TV through the hdmi port
or<00:04:23.220> send<00:04:23.910> it<00:04:24.030> out<00:04:24.150> through<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.390> web<00:04:24.570> web<00:04:24.990> to

or send it out through the web web to

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.830 
or send it out through the web web to
your<00:04:25.560> unit<00:04:26.250> it<00:04:26.490> will<00:04:26.940> then<00:04:27.120> broadcast<00:04:27.360> in<00:04:27.810> 3d

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
your unit it will then broadcast in 3d

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.290 
your unit it will then broadcast in 3d
so<00:04:28.380> can<00:04:28.560> we<00:04:28.680> shoot<00:04:28.950> in<00:04:29.100> 3d<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:29.640> then<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:30.120> can

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
so can we shoot in 3d and then you can

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.670 
so can we shoot in 3d and then you can
send<00:04:30.540> it<00:04:30.630> or<00:04:30.720> set<00:04:30.870> it<00:04:30.960> up<00:04:31.050> in<00:04:31.170> 3d<00:04:31.440> but<00:04:31.560> the

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
actual display is not in 3d so it looks

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.860
