00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
okay so one of the vulnerability is kind

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.260 
okay so one of the vulnerability is kind
of<00:00:03.570> built<00:00:03.780> into<00:00:04.140> WordPress<00:00:04.620> is<00:00:04.920> that<00:00:05.790> if<00:00:06.060> I

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
of built into WordPress is that if I

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.799 
of built into WordPress is that if I
were<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:07.309> let's<00:00:08.309> just<00:00:08.550> say<00:00:08.870> type<00:00:09.870> in<00:00:10.280> my<00:00:11.280> domain

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
were to let's just say type in my domain

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:23.660 
were to let's just say type in my domain
which<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:13.019> AG<00:00:13.650> be<00:00:14.389> online<00:00:18.770> CA<00:00:19.910> com<00:00:22.369> ok<00:00:23.369> that's

me to this wordpress login now if I was

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.650 
me to this wordpress login now if I was
savvy<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.190> really<00:00:56.460> wanted<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.760> guinea<00:00:57.059> get

savvy and I really wanted to guinea get

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.810 
savvy and I really wanted to guinea get
in<00:00:57.809> here<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.170> do<00:00:58.260> some<00:00:58.440> damage<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:59.100> could<00:00:59.609> sit

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
in here and do some damage I could sit

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.639 
in here and do some damage I could sit
here<00:00:59.850> all<00:01:00.000> day<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.719> start<00:01:01.140> guessing<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
here all day and start guessing the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.780 
here all day and start guessing the
password<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:03.619> if<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.860> person<00:01:05.250> knew<00:01:05.460> me<00:01:05.670> and

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
password and if the person knew me and

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.000 
password and if the person knew me and
they<00:01:05.909> knew<00:01:06.030> my<00:01:06.150> tendencies<00:01:06.689> or<00:01:06.770> whatever<00:01:07.770> they

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
they knew my tendencies or whatever they

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.350 
they knew my tendencies or whatever they
might<00:01:08.130> guess<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.640> correctly<00:01:08.900> so<00:01:10.460> what<00:01:11.460> they're

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
might guess it correctly so what they're

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.149 
might guess it correctly so what they're
you<00:01:12.810> know<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.110> kind<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.590> security<00:01:13.979> flaw

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
you know this is kind of a security flaw

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.130 
you know this is kind of a security flaw
so<00:01:14.460> there<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> plug-in<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.960> can

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
so there is a plug-in that you can

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.460 
so there is a plug-in that you can
actually<00:01:16.320> add<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:17.490> called<00:01:17.700> lockout<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:19.320> what

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
actually add it's called lockout so what

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.640 
actually add it's called lockout so what
you<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.890> click<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.310> plugins<00:01:21.650> then

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
you do is you click on plugins then

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.730 
you do is you click on plugins then
you're<00:01:22.890> going<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> click<00:01:23.130> add<00:01:23.580> new<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.740> then

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
you're going to click add new and then

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.649 
you're going to click add new and then
under<00:01:26.220> add<00:01:26.430> new<00:01:26.670> you're<00:01:26.850> going<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> write<00:01:27.150> lock

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
under add new you're going to write lock

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.940 
under add new you're going to write lock
out<00:01:30.049> and<00:01:31.049> search<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.770> plugins<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:34.530> it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
out and search for the plugins and it

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.350 
out and search for the plugins and it
should<00:01:35.100> be<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.310> first<00:01:35.520> one<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.479> shows<00:01:36.840> up

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
should be the first one that shows up

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.499 
should be the first one that shows up
click<00:01:39.360> install<00:01:39.840> now<00:01:43.909> and<00:01:44.909> then<00:01:45.299> we're<00:01:45.420> going

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
click install now and then we're going

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:54.380 
click install now and then we're going
to<00:01:45.570> activate<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:51.409> that's<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.700> so<00:01:53.700> now<00:01:53.909> if

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
to activate it and that's it so now if

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.560 
to activate it and that's it so now if
someone<00:01:54.479> were<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.610> try<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:57.710> get<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:59.390> to<00:02:00.390> this

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
someone were to try to get in to this

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.920 
someone were to try to get in to this
website<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.799> they<00:02:02.490> guess<00:02:02.729> incorrectly<00:02:03.299> five

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
website and they guess incorrectly five

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.600 
website and they guess incorrectly five
times<00:02:04.320> it's<00:02:05.310> going<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.640> lock<00:02:05.850> out<00:02:06.149> their

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
times it's going to lock out their

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.360 
times it's going to lock out their
access<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:08.879> page<00:02:09.289> so<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.739> don't<00:02:11.160> want<00:02:11.280> to

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
access to this page so I don't want to

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.500 
access to this page so I don't want to
demonstrate<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.940> because<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.180> don't<00:02:12.330> want<00:02:12.360> to

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
demonstrate it because I don't want to

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.140 
demonstrate it because I don't want to
lock<00:02:12.660> myself

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
lock myself

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.690 
lock myself
but<00:02:13.829> it's<00:02:14.829> going<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.040> make<00:02:15.129> it<00:02:15.280> that<00:02:15.459> much<00:02:15.489> more

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
but it's going to make it that much more

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.780 
but it's going to make it that much more
difficult<00:02:15.909> for<00:02:16.750> someone<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.409> hack<00:02:17.620> in<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.099> so

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
difficult for someone to hack in and so

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.159 
difficult for someone to hack in and so
that's<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.150> really<00:02:19.180> good<00:02:19.659> security<00:02:20.379> plugin
