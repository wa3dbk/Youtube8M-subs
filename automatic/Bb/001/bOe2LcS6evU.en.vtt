the<00:01:33.880> mythic<00:01:34.210> beta<00:01:34.420> system<00:01:34.780> is<00:01:34.870> basically<00:01:35.200> a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
the mythic beta system is basically a

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.100 
the mythic beta system is basically a
comprehensive<00:01:36.010> system<00:01:36.370> you<00:01:36.520> know<00:01:36.670> it's<00:01:37.110> what

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
comprehensive system you know it's what

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.440 
comprehensive system you know it's what
I<00:01:38.140> like<00:01:38.470> is<00:01:38.710> that<00:01:38.740> it<00:01:39.010> only<00:01:39.670> has<00:01:39.940> bailiffs<00:01:40.420> and

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
I like is that it only has bailiffs and

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.500 
I like is that it only has bailiffs and
as

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
as

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.679 
as
other<00:01:41.810> ways<00:01:42.050> compactors<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:42.920> compliment

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
other ways compactors that compliment

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.200 
other ways compactors that compliment
and<00:01:44.049> basically<00:01:44.289> cover<00:01:44.740> every<00:01:45.070> face<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:45.579> waste

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
and basically cover every face of waste

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.750 
and basically cover every face of waste
productions

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760

-<00:01:47.850> waste-disposal<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.910> they're<00:01:50.910> very

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
- waste-disposal so they're very

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.219 
- waste-disposal so they're very
maintenance-free

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
maintenance-free

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.250 
maintenance-free

so<00:02:04.340> we<00:02:04.610> we<00:02:05.450> decided<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.080> go<00:02:06.170> that<00:02:06.380> way<00:02:06.560> from<00:02:06.920> her

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
so we we decided to go that way from her
