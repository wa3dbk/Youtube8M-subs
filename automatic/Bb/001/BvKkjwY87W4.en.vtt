through this emergency driving course
every<00:00:34.250> two<00:00:34.399> years<00:00:35.590> we<00:00:36.590> do<00:00:36.739> all<00:00:36.920> of<00:00:36.950> our<00:00:37.130> driver

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
every two years we do all of our driver

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.270 
every two years we do all of our driver
training<00:00:37.700> out<00:00:37.880> here<00:00:38.090> at<00:00:38.180> Pacific<00:00:38.600> raceways

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
training out here at Pacific raceways

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.010 
training out here at Pacific raceways
because<00:00:40.280> it<00:00:40.489> offers<00:00:40.850> us<00:00:41.059> the<00:00:41.300> ability<00:00:41.480> to<00:00:41.719> do

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
because it offers us the ability to do

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.740 
because it offers us the ability to do
some<00:00:42.290> high-speed<00:00:42.969> pursuit<00:00:43.969> training<00:00:44.480> and

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
some high-speed pursuit training and

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
time to brake all you have time is to

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.070 
time to brake all you have time is to
recognize<00:02:04.550> it<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:05.000> do<00:02:05.180> a<00:02:05.210> quick<00:02:05.480> lane<00:02:05.780> change

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
I don't care which way you decide to go

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.450 
I don't care which way you decide to go
you'll<00:02:08.690> mix<00:02:08.869> it<00:02:09.020> up<00:02:09.170> go<00:02:09.590> right<00:02:09.800> one<00:02:10.010> time<00:02:10.220> then

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
you'll mix it up go right one time then

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.280 
you'll mix it up go right one time then
go<00:02:10.490> left<00:02:10.820> sometimes<00:02:11.270> don't<00:02:11.600> keep<00:02:11.840> going<00:02:12.140> right

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
go left sometimes don't keep going right

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.640 
go left sometimes don't keep going right
or<00:02:12.440> left<00:02:12.620> okay

the track the east side of the track
called<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:22.550> serpentine<00:02:23.150> which<00:02:23.990> really

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
called the serpentine which really

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.840 
called the serpentine which really
teaches<00:02:25.209> hand<00:02:26.209> movement<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.400> smoothness<00:02:28.400> of

for<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.700> next<00:02:43.940> gap<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.510> makes<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:44.870> look

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
for the next gap so it makes you look

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.690 
for the next gap so it makes you look
ahead<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.680> be<00:02:45.770> prepared<00:02:46.160> for<00:02:46.340> what's<00:02:46.489> down

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
ahead and be prepared for what's down

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.199 

we<00:02:54.599> are<00:02:54.750> going<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.049> do<00:02:55.349> some<00:02:55.650> mock<00:02:56.000> code<00:02:57.000> run

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
we are going to do some mock code run

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.330 
we are going to do some mock code run
scenarios<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:58.049> some<00:02:58.680> mock<00:02:58.860> pursuit

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
scenarios and some mock pursuit

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.870 

we're<00:03:43.830> out<00:03:43.920> driving<00:03:44.100> in<00:03:44.340> with<00:03:44.459> straight<00:03:44.670> eight

possibly with lights and siren possibly

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.140 
possibly with lights and siren possibly
pursuits<00:03:49.319> but<00:03:49.620> we're<00:03:49.800> still<00:03:50.010> out<00:03:50.190> there<00:03:50.220> lots

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
pursuits but we're still out there lots

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.640 
pursuits but we're still out there lots
of<00:03:51.270> cars<00:03:51.480> lots<00:03:51.600> of<00:03:51.840> vehicles<00:03:51.990> lots<00:03:52.319> of<00:03:52.410> traffic

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
of cars lots of vehicles lots of traffic

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.410 
of cars lots of vehicles lots of traffic
and<00:03:52.950> we<00:03:53.069> have<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.400> not<00:03:53.520> only<00:03:53.580> prepared<00:03:54.180> for<00:03:54.390> our

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
and we have to not only prepared for our

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.270 
and we have to not only prepared for our
high<00:03:54.630> speed<00:03:54.690> driving<00:03:55.230> but<00:03:55.560> we<00:03:55.650> also<00:03:55.800> have<00:03:56.130> to

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
high speed driving but we also have to

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.160 
high speed driving but we also have to
be<00:03:56.400> prepared<00:03:56.760> for<00:03:56.880> defensive<00:03:57.600> driving<00:03:57.840> for

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
be prepared for defensive driving for

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.559 
be prepared for defensive driving for
other<00:03:58.260> vehicles<00:03:58.770> and<00:03:59.010> be<00:03:59.489> prepared<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.150> avoid

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
other vehicles and be prepared to avoid

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.960 
other vehicles and be prepared to avoid
those<00:04:00.810> situations<00:04:01.319> also<00:04:02.010> in<00:04:02.130> this<00:04:02.280> driving<00:04:02.760> I

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
those situations also in this driving I

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.790 
those situations also in this driving I
think<00:04:03.510> prepares<00:04:03.870> them<00:04:03.989> for<00:04:04.170> all<00:04:04.260> of<00:04:04.290> that<00:04:04.560> not

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
think prepares them for all of that not

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.290 
think prepares them for all of that not
just<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:05.100> high<00:04:05.280> speed<00:04:05.580> but<00:04:05.819> the<00:04:05.910> regular

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
just the high speed but the regular

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.680 
just the high speed but the regular
ordinary<00:04:06.540> States<00:04:06.959> driving<00:04:07.350> every<00:04:07.530> day
