up and goes really really easily now the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.430 
up and goes really really easily now the
48<00:00:31.699> itself<00:00:32.059> is<00:00:32.239> modeled<00:00:32.689> after<00:00:32.809> this<00:00:33.110> tank

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
48 itself is modeled after this tank

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.350 
48 itself is modeled after this tank
right<00:00:33.680> here<00:00:33.710> which<00:00:34.400> they<00:00:34.580> came<00:00:34.760> out<00:00:34.940> with<00:00:35.000> in

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
right here which they came out with in

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.530 
right here which they came out with in
1948<00:00:36.290> which<00:00:36.559> is<00:00:36.710> actually<00:00:36.890> a<00:00:37.070> peanut<00:00:37.579> gas<00:00:38.210> tank

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
1948 which is actually a peanut gas tank

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.319 
1948 which is actually a peanut gas tank
it<00:00:38.690> holds<00:00:38.989> 2.1<00:00:39.680> gallons<00:00:40.190> now<00:00:40.820> it's<00:00:41.000> really

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
it holds 2.1 gallons now it's really

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.240 
it holds 2.1 gallons now it's really
unique<00:00:41.510> and<00:00:41.899> it's<00:00:42.170> really<00:00:42.559> different<00:00:42.800> looking

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
unique and it's really different looking

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.860 
unique and it's really different looking
than<00:00:43.399> any<00:00:43.579> of<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:43.820> other<00:00:43.969> sportsters<00:00:44.600> in<00:00:44.750> its

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
family so that's what kind of makes the

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.709 
family so that's what kind of makes the
48<00:00:47.329> unique<00:00:48.100> to<00:00:49.100> its<00:00:49.250> other<00:00:49.489> types<00:00:50.239> of<00:00:50.390> its<00:00:50.570> guy

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
48 unique to its other types of its guy

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.450 
48 unique to its other types of its guy
now<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.410> other<00:00:51.590> thing<00:00:51.710> that's<00:00:52.039> unique<00:00:52.129> about

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460
