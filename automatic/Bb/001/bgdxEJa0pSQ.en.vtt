 I was charged by connecting cable it from all the way yesterday mail to c 50 minutes 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:23.100
 You know, it's definitely because it 's been done since yesterday evening 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.030
 sky it's unplugged Te because c escape 50 minutes 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.290
 Soon it in the hollowed it 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.909
 I already know that the consumption of the cover is intense 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.530
 that 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:40.609
 It was in the airplane mode, which say that it is not at all Hey communication Tteyuu deal of'm over de 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:46.909
 And let's make the screen brightness the darkest 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:51.319
 The sweep mode has just been licensed and brought to school once 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.900
 You do not even wearing a screen much once from or until the end of school 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:57.560
 Even once 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:02:00.530
 It's over at around 4 o'clock in the maintenance zone at all. 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.330
 I put on the screen once at about 4 o'clock 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.159
 Hey even this And then'm And then a little but I'd like to see this 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.900
 I took a screenshot 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.230
 It was about 30 and a half that was not 4 o'clock It was about a half punch but this looks 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.470
 From here 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.470
 This battery remaining amount 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:24.960
 I have not put on the scene once, I'm sorry I have put it down so much 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.410
 Of course it is not possible to use 3g line or mountain because it is an airplane mode 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.750
 Valley too 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:34.470
 It's the darkest , but I'm not familiar with the screen family , and the game has nothing to do with it 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.090
 Also I do it by app not 7 people 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:43.810
 When the rabbi battery is in now 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.680
 So I took a shot instinctively , and then I left it again and I hoped to be at about 4 o'clock 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.840
 You 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.840

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:54.849
 That's right yeah- I'm a little zoomed zoom rental house 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.920
 Ai or sink if this look is sure 4 o'clock 17 minutes 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:02.980
 Have you already been opened 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.220
 Because the other battery 17% it is good to say sound plaque when you see that street site blog 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.489

 And it comes to the cash register Uber any good standing p I'm no longer the other power supply is tired 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:18.750
 It's funny and eventually I play games with me 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.980
 It is full of mornings and there is no other game for one minute at school . 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.850
 72 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.390

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.970
 Hey I say hip 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.650
 But I know this 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:35.600
 Probably just because it is the initial failure I think I Hey sweep state 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:40.820
 Department of town is I do not separate from such early of such each 9 that local year 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:45.230
 According to a certain blog Well here is the same 3g wi-fi model as me 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.960
 It seems to have conducted training using a beater to see how much the battery is 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.310
 Right 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.650
 Hmm 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:54.069
 I turned off all radio waves in the same way as I did 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:58.030
 The display bar looks brighter than I am 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.130
 Because in volume is my time always zero you have half 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.600

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:06.840
 I've just launched the game for 5 days and we will not give it 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:11.010
 It has not been launched, but this person has been launched 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:16.130
 I left for five days in sleep and this person is 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:21.549
 Then it decreased by 15% to 85% 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:25.180
 I'd have praised if there is an excellent sleep function in this person feather 's this blog
