00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.820
 do you talk about the youtube that accompanies the 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.989
 video channel the king of cars show 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.980
 here you have already imagined an arrangement 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.559
 any other engine and with the engine 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:37.410
 large and tumbled out 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:41.079
 Americans like it basic it's there 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.870
 starts the engine of their engines with 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.769
 the six-cylinder platform onwards 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:54.629
 nor six cylinders eight cylinders and 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:58.830
 so it goes and has big engines right there 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:03.100
 the intake manifold bocudo come out right 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:05.890
 and here in brazil fuel being 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.500
 sold out cheaper manufactured 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.060
 here goes out cheaper and we 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.549
 more expensive here because here is the 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:19.810
 Brazil right that the Brazil country you 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:23.619
 vote one at a time is a thief or a drug dealer 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.899
 The other one is crazy. 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.509
 to come back have to change have to 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.509
 enter new people and think of doing 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.130
 New things do not vote for us 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.759
 It has nothing to do with the car but the 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:40.390
 people are putting on is son and grandson is 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:44.020
 nephew of the corrupt people he once had 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.210
 power there and put the members in addition to the 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.159
 your family to continue the whaling 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.999
 these people that we end up putting 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.520
 there ne 

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:54.310
 but it did not have to change only that it is not that 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.670
 change now back here for the video of 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.039
 car is imagined only fuel and 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.649
 had a value of approximately $ 2 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.959
 more or less one liter of gasoline 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.759
 How much rangers would I have to leave? 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:09.600
 running around 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.980
 have many have more would have more 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.700
 turned almost as an item of 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.590
 expensive collector buys a car from this 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.300
 Restore and leave it top but 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.000
 we went on a weekend in a 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.920
 walk there for you to work with the car 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.709
 and among other things it became difficult 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.989
 some get out even does this kind of thing 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.340
 work with that committee's car 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.940
 impracticable 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.980
 I consisting had there 3 and Cacetada and liter 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.400
 and if this woman goes on and on 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:43.810
 us 4 soon to many places until 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.680
 arrived right then show you the 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.629
 Following 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.620
 in this type of car here we have a 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:54.099
 diagnosis that the Ford has not 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.440
 I talked in other videos there 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:00.190
 and you can not have it on the 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.940
 Continuous mode scanner parameter is 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.200
 So you know how each one is. 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.750
 each component the electronic injection 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.489
 working it in the form of who is 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.750
 working and such 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.709
 so we have to pack 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.420
 alternatives tool for 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:21.250
 diagnosis 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:24.040
 reason is the best tool because the 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.769
 scanner has things that it will not 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.140
 able to do reading and sometimes even 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.610
 may have a defect there than the 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.709
 central is passing 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.540
 the scania and oton sensor moving to 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.299
 enter and carry other things then the 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:48.010
 tite team and the proof 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:52.510
 simulator to have sensors with 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:55.180
 the last digital flat ta do not like 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.500
 advertise to plan because the post 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.440
 selling them is horrible 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.019
 the brand has one and if one has to just get the 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.329
 good apparatus but actually in most 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:08.910
 of the times and got the bad device you 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:10.780
 It's complicated because after their sale, it's 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.359
 it sucks 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:19.359
 so here's how we make a 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:20.950
 that the device is connected to the 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.090
 line stuck there you have to 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.669
 to find which of 13 in reading booth 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.130
 reading you can put in any 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:35.470
 the wires back there and you go 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:40.690
 making the bring closer 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:43.210
 the second fall followed very close here 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.950
 for me to accelerate and film the same time 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.810
 In what I 'm going to accelerate will open the 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:52.240
 butterfly inside 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:54.220
 then you will read slowly accelerating 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.740
 to see how they are potentiometer of this 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.610
 sensor gps position sensor 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:03.460
 butterfly 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:05.920
 I slowly coming back doing text in the 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.210
 more sudden acceleration as that 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.210
 sock when he brand 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.800
 I'll do the tests as soon as I go 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.110
 discover how each sensor each 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.790
 component of the electronic injection each 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.770
 donor of the electronic injection is 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:26.500
 working as the scanner never has 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.190
 accessibility to leader to enter the mode 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.169
 and the state of the 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.230
 electronic injection as found in the 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.540
 We have this resource here for every 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.910
 component we are testing to 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.650
 simulation do that since we will 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.700
 if you do the simulation 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:49.900
 You'll put it in simulator. 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:53.740
 understood and you change here as 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:56.320
 by the test here I have already tested and 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.770
 track pot book sensors babies 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.950
 If you find yourself being responsive and 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:05.169
 voltage that must correspond to the 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.500
 selection plus a minimum acceleration then 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:11.560
 I do not need to make you test of 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.360
 simulate his work if he 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.640
 I had not properly working the 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.950
 operate this engine and simulate the 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.979
 his work to see his retirement from 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:23.320
 done here from the car the car with that 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:25.690
 starter you accelerate it does not 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.490
 acceleration without understanding 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.890
 here is being the hose that 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.600
 It will here that the sensor has the March eff 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.640
 people retired to see how 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37.120
 We're going to continue the tests. 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:39.430
 people put it back because in this type 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.890
 engine that the air mass sensor or the 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:45.160
 maf it is a practically one of the 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:48.249
 main sensors around the engine system 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.709
 both running are working 

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:53.499
 the air mass sensor it goes 

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:55.689
 do it there he will do a reading and 

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:57.609
 center will make the corrections it of 

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:59.799
 fuel injection 

00:06:57.609 --> 00:07:01.839
 It's a big, strong hug from you guys. 

00:06:59.799 --> 00:07:06.999
 subscribe to the channel share in your 

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:10.509
 social networks and in the corner there's still the 

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:14.439
 channel and from the main page on you 

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:16.419
 You will find my facebook of mine. 

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:18.699
 facebook is cristiano Copinha it 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:20.289
 You can go in there and add the people there. 

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:23.589
 I 'm going to add you, huh? 

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:25.239
 and you follow along and by your 

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:27.039
 facebook also sometimes you will not 

00:07:25.239 --> 00:07:29.829
 nor have you accessed on YouTube how are you 

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:32.079
 hang in there on facebook stay up one 

00:07:29.829 --> 00:07:37.089
 little but with d'ale of you watched 

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:40.089
 our videos and make your comments on 

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:42.009
 your questions and regardless of what 

00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:43.599
 it's happening in the video you can do 

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:45.219
 a question related to your car 

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:47.079
 as soon as we have the chance to 

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:48.909
 answer people will be responding 

00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:50.889
 There's a lot that we do not respond to. 

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:53.349
 because there is something so clear in the 

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:56.589
 video and the person asks the question again 

00:07:53.349 --> 00:07:59.229
 It's easier for you to review the video, I do not 

00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:59.829
 I'll earn more or less for you to review. 

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:02.019
 the video 

00:07:59.829 --> 00:08:04.929
 even because the ipp of your 

00:08:02.019 --> 00:08:06.789
 computer if you ten people watched 

00:08:04.929 --> 00:08:08.049
 Well, there's going to be one for me. 

00:08:06.789 --> 00:08:10.209
 It will not change much I just want you 

00:08:08.049 --> 00:08:12.269
 understand what I spend on each video 

00:08:10.209 --> 00:08:14.739
 It was a big hug to everyone. 

00:08:12.269 --> 00:08:16.239
 subscribe to the channel a &amp; e of that 

00:08:14.739 --> 00:08:19.649
 quinzinho and paraná 

00:08:16.239 --> 00:08:19.649
 help on the channel thanks
