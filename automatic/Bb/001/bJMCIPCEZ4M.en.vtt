00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
him in this formation in the 451 you

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.940 
him in this formation in the 451 you
guys<00:02:20.880> might<00:02:21.120> be<00:02:21.270> different<00:02:21.510> but<00:02:22.050> one<00:02:22.530> thing<00:02:22.770> I

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
guys might be different but one thing I

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.380 
guys might be different but one thing I
felt<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.370> was<00:02:23.490> happening<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:24.060> he<00:02:24.240> was

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
felt that was happening is he was

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.910 
felt that was happening is he was
getting<00:02:24.630> involved<00:02:24.900> in<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.170> attack<00:02:25.530> which<00:02:25.740> was

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
getting involved in the attack which was

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.620 
getting involved in the attack which was
great<00:02:26.160> but<00:02:26.610> when<00:02:26.760> he<00:02:26.850> was<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.090> front<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.420> goal

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
great but when he was in front of goal

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.780 
great but when he was in front of goal
he<00:02:27.930> was<00:02:28.080> slightly<00:02:28.680> inconsistent<00:02:29.400> with<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.520> shot

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
he was slightly inconsistent with a shot

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.850 
he was slightly inconsistent with a shot
so<00:02:30.060> I'd<00:02:30.270> bring<00:02:30.540> him<00:02:30.750> back<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:31.230> think<00:02:31.709> the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
so I'd bring him back I think the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.470 
so I'd bring him back I think the
formation<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.459> would<00:02:32.580> suit<00:02:32.790> him<00:02:32.970> best<00:02:33.209> is

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
formation that would suit him best is

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.080 
formation that would suit him best is
maybe<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.860> 4411<00:02:34.860> where<00:02:35.340> he's<00:02:35.459> playing<00:02:35.610> as<00:02:35.910> one

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
maybe a 4411 where he's playing as one

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.880 
maybe a 4411 where he's playing as one
of<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.239> sentiments<00:02:36.870> because<00:02:37.319> he's<00:02:37.440> great<00:02:37.620> on

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
of the sentiments because he's great on

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.460 
of the sentiments because he's great on
the<00:02:38.010> ball<00:02:38.250> he<00:02:38.610> feels<00:02:38.880> insanely<00:02:39.840> quick<00:02:40.290> to

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
the ball he feels insanely quick to

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.900 
the ball he feels insanely quick to
accelerate<00:02:40.980> that's<00:02:41.190> one<00:02:41.340> thing<00:02:41.489> I<00:02:41.610> noticed

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
accelerate that's one thing I noticed

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.790 
accelerate that's one thing I noticed
about<00:02:42.000> him<00:02:42.180> sort<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.780> burst<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.230> way<00:02:43.350> the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
about him sort of burst the way the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.410 
about him sort of burst the way the
initial<00:02:44.250> burst<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.730> then<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.000> sort<00:02:45.209> of<00:02:45.300> her

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
initial burst and then to sort of her

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.180 
initial burst and then to sort of her
feed<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.750> wing<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.080> definitely<00:02:46.709> go<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.010> try

coutinho<00:02:47.730> eighty<00:02:48.239> thousand<00:02:48.930> coins<00:02:49.080> is<00:02:49.320> a

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
coutinho eighty thousand coins is a

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.530 
coutinho eighty thousand coins is a
little<00:02:49.650> bit<00:02:49.739> expensive<00:02:50.070> but<00:02:50.489> it's<00:02:51.239> just<00:02:51.420> a

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
little bit expensive but it's just a

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.630 
little bit expensive but it's just a
very<00:02:51.870> very<00:02:52.019> good<00:02:52.410> sort<00:02:52.769> of<00:02:52.890> build<00:02:53.160> up<00:02:53.280> player<00:02:53.550> I

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
very very good sort of build up player I

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.130 
very very good sort of build up player I
guess<00:02:53.970> that's<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.390> best<00:02:54.480> way<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.810> describe

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
guess that's the best way to describe

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.720 
guess that's the best way to describe
him<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.530> build-up<00:02:55.890> player<00:02:56.130> he<00:02:56.340> just<00:02:56.370> can't

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
him a build-up player he just can't

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.340 
him a build-up player he just can't
finish<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.269> well<00:02:57.510> even<00:02:57.810> though<00:02:57.870> he<00:02:57.959> did<00:02:58.110> kill

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
finish that well even though he did kill

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.650 
finish that well even though he did kill
a<00:02:58.560> couple<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:59.130> goals<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.819> a<00:02:59.940> second<00:03:00.360> man<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.600> the

a couple of goals of a second man of the

a couple of goals of a second man of the
match<00:03:00.750> delft<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.319> letdown<00:03:01.769> what<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.610> poor<00:03:02.910> player

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.600 
match delft a letdown what a poor player
in<00:03:03.480> this<00:03:04.019> formation<00:03:04.440> he<00:03:05.040> would<00:03:05.280> even<00:03:05.430> though

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
in this formation he would even though

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.920 
in this formation he would even though
he's<00:03:05.730> got<00:03:05.760> hot<00:03:05.970> up<00:03:06.060> in<00:03:06.120> some<00:03:06.300> work<00:03:06.330> great<00:03:06.660> he

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
he's got hot up in some work great he

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.090 
he's got hot up in some work great he
was<00:03:07.050> pushing<00:03:07.290> up<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.620> little<00:03:07.800> bit<00:03:07.920> getting

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
was pushing up a little bit getting

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.740 
was pushing up a little bit getting
involved<00:03:08.310> in<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.580> attack<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.480> he<00:03:09.569> just

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
involved in the attack and he just

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.300 
involved in the attack and he just
doesn't<00:03:10.019> have<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.170> answer<00:03:10.590> in<00:03:10.680> front<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:11.069> gold

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
doesn't have the answer in front of gold

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.340 
doesn't have the answer in front of gold
so<00:03:11.610> it's<00:03:11.760> just<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.180> just<00:03:12.330> doesn't<00:03:12.690> work<00:03:12.810> really

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
so it's just it just doesn't work really

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.380 
so it's just it just doesn't work really
