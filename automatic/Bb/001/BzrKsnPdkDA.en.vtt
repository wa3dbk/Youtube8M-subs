single<00:00:08.670> speed<00:00:08.910> configuration<00:00:09.780> as<00:00:10.440> you've

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
single speed configuration as you've

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.039 
single speed configuration as you've
already<00:00:10.800> seen<00:00:11.130> on<00:00:11.309> my<00:00:11.460> frame<00:00:11.790> here<00:00:12.330> I've

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
already seen on my frame here I've

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.499 
already seen on my frame here I've
removed<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:14.610> drivetrain

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
removed the drivetrain

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.420 
removed the drivetrain
I<00:00:15.540> removed<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.080> crank<00:00:16.379> arms<00:00:16.770> rear<00:00:17.070> derailleur

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
I removed the crank arms rear derailleur

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.349 
I removed the crank arms rear derailleur
or<00:00:17.760> front<00:00:18.029> derailleur<00:00:18.539> all<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.529> shifters<00:00:20.359> etc

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
or front derailleur all the shifters etc

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.710 
or front derailleur all the shifters etc
so<00:00:22.199> we're<00:00:22.680> gonna<00:00:22.800> go<00:00:23.010> through<00:00:23.400> what<00:00:24.029> each<00:00:24.240> part

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
so we're gonna go through what each part

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.720 
so we're gonna go through what each part
is<00:00:24.869> what<00:00:25.140> part<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.529> think<00:00:25.590> you'll<00:00:25.920> need<00:00:26.220> to

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
is what part I think you'll need to

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.150 
is what part I think you'll need to
upgrade<00:00:27.590> or<00:00:28.590> replace<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.730> should<00:00:29.880> say<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:31.160> how

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
upgrade or replace I should say and how

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.299 
upgrade or replace I should say and how
to<00:00:32.189> do<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:33.320> so<00:00:34.320> here<00:00:34.500> are<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.680> parts<00:00:35.040> that

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
to do that so here are the parts that

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.660 
to do that so here are the parts that
you're<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.270> need<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:37.500> get<00:00:37.649> your<00:00:37.890> single

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
you're going to need to get your single

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.240 
you're going to need to get your single
speed<00:00:38.850> configuration<00:00:39.570> set<00:00:39.930> up<00:00:40.250> converting

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
speed configuration set up converting

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.729 
speed configuration set up converting
your<00:00:41.340> gear<00:00:41.640> bike<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.120> single<00:00:42.450> speed<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:43.590> is

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
your gear bike to single speed this is

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.549 
your gear bike to single speed this is
going<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.070> assume<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:45.210> have<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.899> vertical

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
going to assume that you have a vertical

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.930 
going to assume that you have a vertical
dropout<00:00:47.340> frame<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.690> not<00:00:48.899> seamless<00:00:49.440> being

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
dropout frame that is not seamless being

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.639 
dropout frame that is not seamless being
specific<00:00:51.079> but<00:00:52.079> if<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.289> have<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> seamless

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
specific but if you have a seamless

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.100 
specific but if you have a seamless
speed<00:00:53.100> specific<00:00:53.789> frame<00:00:54.120> they're<00:00:54.449> more<00:00:54.930> or

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
speed specific frame they're more or

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.490 
speed specific frame they're more or
less<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.590> same<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.699> exception<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.660> your

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
less the same with the exception of your

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.950 
less the same with the exception of your
chain<00:00:58.800> tensioner<00:00:59.399> so<00:01:00.149> what<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.539> here<00:01:00.570> is

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
chain tensioner so what we have here is

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.299 
chain tensioner so what we have here is
you're<00:01:01.109> going<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.289> be<00:01:01.410> replacing<00:01:02.160> your

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
you're going to be replacing your

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.070 
you're going to be replacing your
cassette<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:03.750> sets<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.379> spacers<00:01:05.240> and<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.960> new

cassette with sets of spacers and a new
cog<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:08.280> then<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> lock<00:01:08.970> ring<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.390> you

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
cog and then I have a lock ring that you

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.130 
cog and then I have a lock ring that you
can<00:01:09.530> just<00:01:10.530> use<00:01:10.830> from<00:01:11.159> your<00:01:11.220> old<00:01:11.850> cassette<00:01:12.299> on

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
can just use from your old cassette on

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.170 
can just use from your old cassette on
your<00:01:13.290> cog<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:13.920> different<00:01:14.250> choices<00:01:14.490> you

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
your cog you have different choices you

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.090 
your cog you have different choices you
can<00:01:15.330> decide<00:01:15.689> whether<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.380> know<00:01:16.710> what<00:01:16.890> gear

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
can decide whether you know what gear

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.039 
can decide whether you know what gear
ratio<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.610> want<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.030> run<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.570> rear<00:01:18.780> cog

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
ratio you want to run and the rear cog

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.890 
ratio you want to run and the rear cog
is<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.530> easiest<00:01:19.860> one<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.159> change<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.970> sometimes

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
is the easiest one to change I sometimes

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.539 
is the easiest one to change I sometimes
I<00:01:22.020> run<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.200> 16<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.070> 3<00:01:23.369> have<00:01:23.520> an<00:01:23.610> 18<00:01:24.060> tooth<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:25.549> 20

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.940 
I run a 16 to 3 have an 18 tooth and 20
to<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.960> depends<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.470> what<00:01:28.680> kind<00:01:28.920> of

to it just depends on what kind of

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.069 
to it just depends on what kind of
terrain<00:01:29.250> or<00:01:29.700> how<00:01:29.880> strong<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.479> am<00:01:30.509> during<00:01:30.960> the

speed you do not want these because all

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.810 
speed you do not want these because all
its<00:02:24.360> gonna<00:02:24.540> do<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:24.990> try<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.010> throw<00:02:26.310> your<00:02:26.490> chain

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
its gonna do is try to throw your chain

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.030 
its gonna do is try to throw your chain
off<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.970> order<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.330> do<00:02:30.600> just<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.770> middle

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
off so in order to do just the middle

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.060 
off so in order to do just the middle
ring<00:02:32.250> without<00:02:32.670> running<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.420> Bosch<00:02:33.840> guard<00:02:34.380> this

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
ring without running a Bosch guard this

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.710 
ring without running a Bosch guard this
is<00:02:35.130> another<00:02:35.400> option<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.090> can<00:02:36.210> do<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.450> Bosch

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
is another option is you can do a Bosch

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.380 
is another option is you can do a Bosch
guard<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.410> combination<00:02:38.250> with<00:02:38.940> just<00:02:39.270> your

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
guard in combination with just your

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.770 
guard in combination with just your
middle<00:02:39.570> ring<00:02:39.660> up<00:02:39.990> front<00:02:41.000> but<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.180> difference

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
middle ring up front but the difference

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.750 
middle ring up front but the difference
is<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.410> reason<00:02:43.710> why<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:43.890> do<00:02:44.130> this<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.610> use

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
is and the reason why I do this I use

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.330 
is and the reason why I do this I use
these<00:02:44.940> short<00:02:45.330> chain<00:02:45.780> ring<00:02:46.020> bolts<00:02:46.500> they're

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
these short chain ring bolts they're

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.520 
these short chain ring bolts they're
shorter<00:02:48.000> because<00:02:48.180> then<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.570> can<00:02:48.810> run<00:02:49.020> just<00:02:49.410> the

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
shorter because then I can run just the

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.770 
shorter because then I can run just the
middle<00:02:49.890> ring<00:02:50.100> without<00:02:50.850> having<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.600> Bosch

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
middle ring without having the Bosch

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.350

guard or big ring on there that's
traditionally<00:02:55.080> on<00:02:55.260> there<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.250> can<00:02:56.370> buy

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
traditionally on there so you can buy

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.370 
traditionally on there so you can buy
these<00:02:56.610> short<00:02:56.940> chain<00:02:57.210> ring<00:02:57.390> bolts<00:02:57.720> at<00:02:57.870> pretty

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
these short chain ring bolts at pretty

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.890 
these short chain ring bolts at pretty

much any bike shop as well and they're

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.800 
much any bike shop as well and they're
also<00:03:01.020> fairly<00:03:01.320> cheap<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:03.150> now<00:03:03.240> we<00:03:03.300> have<00:03:03.540> here

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
also fairly cheap and now we have here

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.920 
also fairly cheap and now we have here
is<00:03:04.020> your<00:03:04.290> chain<00:03:04.980> tensioner<00:03:05.720> because<00:03:06.720> you're

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
is your chain tensioner because you're

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.420 
is your chain tensioner because you're
gonna<00:03:07.020> be<00:03:07.170> converting<00:03:07.560> your<00:03:07.650> gear<00:03:07.980> bike<00:03:08.190> to

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
gonna be converting your gear bike to

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.760 
gonna be converting your gear bike to
single<00:03:08.790> speed<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.990> probably<00:03:10.350> don't<00:03:10.650> have

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
single speed you probably don't have

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.310 
single speed you probably don't have
horizontal<00:03:11.430> dropout<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.480> want<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.720> send<00:03:12.960> or

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
horizontal dropout so I want to send or

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.710 
horizontal dropout so I want to send or
an<00:03:13.500> eccentric<00:03:13.770> bottom<00:03:14.310> bracket<00:03:14.850> so<00:03:15.360> we<00:03:15.390> use<00:03:15.690> a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
an eccentric bottom bracket so we use a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.870 
an eccentric bottom bracket so we use a
chain<00:03:16.170> tensioner<00:03:16.770> I<00:03:16.980> had<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.610> give<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:17.820> a

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
chain tensioner I had to give you a

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.850 
chain tensioner I had to give you a
proper<00:03:18.090> chain<00:03:18.420> tension<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.050> you<00:03:19.080> chain<00:03:19.380> fall

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
proper chain tension so you chain fall

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.250 
proper chain tension so you chain fall
off<00:03:20.100> as<00:03:20.400> it's<00:03:20.580> bouncing<00:03:21.000> around<00:03:23.930> so<00:03:24.930> as<00:03:25.080> you

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
off as it's bouncing around so as you

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.130 
off as it's bouncing around so as you
can<00:03:25.410> see<00:03:25.470> I've<00:03:26.070> installed<00:03:26.520> my<00:03:26.900> single<00:03:27.900> speed

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
can see I've installed my single speed

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.310 
can see I've installed my single speed

store so what you do is we're just going

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.130 
store so what you do is we're just going
to<00:04:12.680> kind<00:04:13.680> of<00:04:13.800> temporarily<00:04:14.489> set<00:04:14.910> it<00:04:15.030> up<00:04:15.209> here<00:04:15.540> so

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
to kind of temporarily set it up here so

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.330 
to kind of temporarily set it up here so
we<00:04:16.230> can<00:04:16.350> get<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.560> lined<00:04:16.739> up<00:04:16.890> and<00:04:17.040> I'll<00:04:17.100> show<00:04:17.250> you

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
we can get it lined up and I'll show you

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.610 
we can get it lined up and I'll show you
what<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.519> next<00:04:17.820> step<00:04:18.000> on<00:04:18.150> how<00:04:18.269> to<00:04:18.330> do<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:18.720> but

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
what the next step on how to do that but

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.250 
what the next step on how to do that but
we're<00:04:19.770> gonna<00:04:19.890> put<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.520> cog<00:04:21.270> with<00:04:21.720> some<00:04:21.960> space

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
we're gonna put a cog with some space

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.110 
we're gonna put a cog with some space
from<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.590> inside

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
from the inside

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.240 
from the inside
and<00:04:23.900> then<00:04:24.560> our<00:04:24.650> outside<00:04:25.100> spacers<00:04:25.669> on<00:04:27.010> and<00:04:28.010> then

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
and then our outside spacers on and then

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.420 
and then our outside spacers on and then
use<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.880> lock<00:04:29.060> ring<00:04:29.360> from<00:04:30.320> your<00:04:30.620> cassette

because in order to know how many

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.879 
because in order to know how many
spacers<00:04:47.150> to<00:04:47.300> put<00:04:47.450> on<00:04:47.540> the<00:04:47.630> inside<00:04:47.840> first<00:04:48.650> the

spacers to put on the inside first the
outside<00:04:49.460> is<00:04:50.020> where<00:04:51.020> chain<00:04:51.380> the<00:04:51.530> lineman<00:04:51.889> comes

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
outside is where chain the lineman comes

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.960 
outside is where chain the lineman comes
in<00:04:52.460> and<00:04:52.880> we'll<00:04:53.000> show<00:04:53.150> you<00:04:53.180> that<00:04:53.300> next<00:04:54.820> so<00:04:55.820> we're

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
in and we'll show you that next so we're

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.370 
in and we'll show you that next so we're
going<00:04:56.060> to<00:04:56.120> do<00:04:56.300> here<00:04:56.570> they're<00:04:57.080> just<00:04:57.229> getting

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
going to do here they're just getting

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.830 
going to do here they're just getting
the<00:04:57.560> chain<00:04:57.770> on<00:04:57.919> and<00:04:58.880> we<00:04:59.270> don't<00:04:59.419> have<00:04:59.540> a<00:04:59.570> chain

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
the chain on and we don't have a chain

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.350 
the chain on and we don't have a chain
tensioner<00:05:00.350> on<00:05:01.450> right<00:05:02.450> now<00:05:02.660> and<00:05:03.440> so<00:05:04.430> you're<00:05:05.240> not

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
tensioner on right now and so you're not

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.420 
tensioner on right now and so you're not
gonna<00:05:05.510> have<00:05:05.840> proper<00:05:06.530> chain<00:05:06.800> tension<00:05:07.220> you<00:05:07.310> can

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
gonna have proper chain tension you can

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.790 
gonna have proper chain tension you can
see<00:05:07.580> how<00:05:07.760> it<00:05:07.880> sags<00:05:08.210> right<00:05:08.570> here<00:05:08.930> so<00:05:09.560> what<00:05:09.680> you

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
see how it sags right here so what you

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.460 
see how it sags right here so what you
want<00:05:09.950> to<00:05:10.040> do<00:05:10.250> is<00:05:10.580> you<00:05:11.180> want<00:05:11.360> to<00:05:11.450> get<00:05:11.960> your<00:05:12.110> chain

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
want to do is you want to get your chain

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.159 
want to do is you want to get your chain
sized<00:05:13.040> to<00:05:13.910> as<00:05:14.000> close<00:05:14.240> as<00:05:14.570> you<00:05:14.720> can<00:05:17.020> you<00:05:18.020> know<00:05:18.110> to

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
sized to as close as you can you know to

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.800 
sized to as close as you can you know to
to<00:05:18.680> not<00:05:18.830> having<00:05:19.220> our<00:05:19.790> having<00:05:20.090> as<00:05:20.210> little<00:05:20.240> sag

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
to not having our having as little sag

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.700 
to not having our having as little sag
as<00:05:21.139> you<00:05:21.320> as<00:05:21.560> you<00:05:21.650> possibly<00:05:22.130> can<00:05:22.520> because<00:05:23.710> you

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
as you as you possibly can because you

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.800 
as you as you possibly can because you
know<00:05:24.830> all<00:05:24.950> frame<00:05:25.310> sizes<00:05:25.669> are<00:05:26.030> different<00:05:26.540> in

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
know all frame sizes are different in

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.390 
know all frame sizes are different in
your<00:05:26.930> chain<00:05:27.260> stage<00:05:27.650> are<00:05:27.860> different<00:05:28.190> lengths

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
your chain stage are different lengths

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.340 
your chain stage are different lengths
you<00:05:29.210> know<00:05:29.330> you're<00:05:29.539> just<00:05:29.600> gonna<00:05:29.750> have<00:05:30.020> to<00:05:30.050> just

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
you know you're just gonna have to just

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.710 
you know you're just gonna have to just
as<00:05:30.530> close<00:05:30.710> as<00:05:30.860> you<00:05:30.950> can<00:05:31.130> this<00:05:31.340> first<00:05:31.610> time<00:05:31.910> so

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
as close as you can this first time so

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.250 
as close as you can this first time so
as<00:05:32.840> you<00:05:32.930> can<00:05:33.050> see<00:05:33.110> a<00:05:33.289> I<00:05:33.919> have<00:05:34.430> my<00:05:34.580> chain<00:05:34.880> cut<00:05:35.270> as

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
as you can see a I have my chain cut as

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.900 
as you can see a I have my chain cut as
far<00:05:36.590> as<00:05:36.770> I<00:05:36.890> can<00:05:36.950> go<00:05:37.479> with<00:05:38.479> this<00:05:38.720> but<00:05:39.729> we<00:05:40.729> still

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
far as I can go with this but we still

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.969 
far as I can go with this but we still
have<00:05:41.090> sag<00:05:41.390> and<00:05:41.720> we'll<00:05:41.870> take<00:05:42.110> care<00:05:42.289> of<00:05:42.350> that<00:05:42.590> sag

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
have sag and we'll take care of that sag

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.310 
have sag and we'll take care of that sag
a<00:05:43.460> little<00:05:44.120> bit<00:05:44.510> later<00:05:44.690> on<00:05:44.780> here<00:05:45.110> with<00:05:45.229> the

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
a little bit later on here with the

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.050 
a little bit later on here with the
chain<00:05:45.500> tensioner<00:05:48.220> earlier<00:05:49.220> when<00:05:49.520> we<00:05:49.550> put<00:05:49.910> our

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
chain tensioner earlier when we put our

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.909 
chain tensioner earlier when we put our
cog<00:05:50.419> on<00:05:50.720> with<00:05:50.990> the<00:05:51.140> spacers

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
cog on with the spacers

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.120 
cog on with the spacers
I<00:05:51.950> only<00:05:52.729> hand<00:05:53.120> tighten<00:05:53.600> it<00:05:53.810> because<00:05:54.530> you

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
I only hand tighten it because you

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.060 
I only hand tighten it because you
sometimes<00:05:55.430> have<00:05:55.910> to<00:05:55.970> move<00:05:56.360> spacers<00:05:56.930> from<00:05:57.770> the

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
sometimes have to move spacers from the

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.670 
sometimes have to move spacers from the
inside<00:05:58.550> or<00:05:59.060> the<00:05:59.360> outside<00:05:59.510> you<00:06:00.200> know<00:06:00.289> back<00:06:00.500> and

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
inside or the outside you know back and

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.180 
inside or the outside you know back and
forth<00:06:01.010> to<00:06:01.550> get<00:06:01.700> proper<00:06:02.180> chain<00:06:02.930> alignment<00:06:03.470> and

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
forth to get proper chain alignment and

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.010 
forth to get proper chain alignment and
you<00:06:04.280> can<00:06:04.430> see<00:06:04.639> you<00:06:04.760> want<00:06:04.850> the<00:06:05.030> chain<00:06:05.330> perfectly

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
you can see you want the chain perfectly

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.550 
you can see you want the chain perfectly
aligned<00:06:06.410> from<00:06:07.340> your<00:06:07.490> rear<00:06:07.669> cog<00:06:08.380> straight<00:06:09.380> to

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
aligned from your rear cog straight to

aligned from your rear cog straight to
the<00:06:09.650> front<00:06:09.830> ring<00:06:10.210> if<00:06:11.210> you<00:06:11.270> have<00:06:11.419> too<00:06:11.600> many

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
the front ring if you have too many

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.110 
the front ring if you have too many
spacers<00:06:12.169> on<00:06:12.260> one<00:06:12.470> side<00:06:12.800> your<00:06:13.580> chain<00:06:13.820> is<00:06:13.940> gonna

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
spacers on one side your chain is gonna

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.750 
spacers on one side your chain is gonna
be<00:06:14.330> slightly<00:06:14.720> crooked<00:06:15.229> and<00:06:15.830> it

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
be slightly crooked and it

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.940 
be slightly crooked and it
you<00:06:17.630> run<00:06:17.780> the<00:06:17.870> higher<00:06:18.020> risk<00:06:18.320> of<00:06:18.530> it<00:06:18.650> falling

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:18.950 
you run the higher risk of it falling

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.340 
you run the higher risk of it falling
off<00:06:19.220> or<00:06:19.490> having<00:06:19.639> other<00:06:19.820> problems<00:06:20.090> with<00:06:20.630> it<00:06:20.840> so

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
off or having other problems with it so

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.810 
off or having other problems with it so
you<00:06:21.410> want<00:06:21.560> proper<00:06:21.919> chain<00:06:22.160> alignment<00:06:22.610> to<00:06:22.669> make

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
you want proper chain alignment to make

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.940 
you want proper chain alignment to make
sure<00:06:23.000> it's<00:06:23.120> nice<00:06:23.270> and<00:06:23.330> straight<00:06:23.889> adjust<00:06:24.889> the

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
sure it's nice and straight adjust the

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.100 
sure it's nice and straight adjust the
spacers<00:06:25.340> as<00:06:25.460> necessary<00:06:26.000> and<00:06:26.570> then<00:06:26.750> tighten

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
spacers as necessary and then tighten

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.610 
spacers as necessary and then tighten
your<00:06:27.200> lock<00:06:27.380> ring<00:06:30.520> all<00:06:31.520> I've<00:06:31.729> done

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
your lock ring all I've done

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.760 
your lock ring all I've done
is<00:06:33.419> roughly<00:06:34.419> set<00:06:34.720> the<00:06:34.870> bolt<00:06:35.110> in<00:06:35.350> here<00:06:35.590> it's

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
is roughly set the bolt in here it's

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.830 
is roughly set the bolt in here it's
loose<00:06:36.040> right<00:06:36.310> now<00:06:36.370> so<00:06:36.850> I<00:06:36.910> can<00:06:37.090> show<00:06:37.330> you<00:06:37.389> how<00:06:37.780> to

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
loose right now so I can show you how to

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.689 
loose right now so I can show you how to
set<00:06:38.260> up<00:06:38.290> the<00:06:38.530> chain<00:06:38.770> tension<00:06:39.190> on<00:06:39.250> a<00:06:39.340> system

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:39.699 
set up the chain tension on a system

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:42.300 
set up the chain tension on a system
like<00:06:39.850> this<00:06:40.229> if<00:06:41.229> you<00:06:41.440> had<00:06:41.590> a<00:06:41.620> spring-loaded

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
like this if you had a spring-loaded

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.180 
like this if you had a spring-loaded
chain<00:06:42.580> tensioner<00:06:43.090> you're<00:06:43.660> probably<00:06:44.380> done<00:06:44.740> at

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 
chain tensioner you're probably done at

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.200 
chain tensioner you're probably done at
this<00:06:45.460> point<00:06:45.850> because<00:06:46.150> the<00:06:46.600> tensioner<00:06:47.350> would

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210 
this point because the tensioner would

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.310 
this point because the tensioner would
already<00:06:49.210> be<00:06:49.479> putting<00:06:49.810> tension<00:06:49.990> on<00:06:50.199> the<00:06:50.290> chain

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320 
already be putting tension on the chain

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.740 
already be putting tension on the chain
on<00:06:51.130> this<00:06:51.400> system<00:06:51.639> it<00:06:51.940> doesn't<00:06:52.240> so<00:06:52.570> it's<00:06:52.690> a

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
on this system it doesn't so it's a

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:53.850 
on this system it doesn't so it's a
little<00:06:52.900> bit<00:06:53.110> different<00:06:53.410> to<00:06:53.470> set<00:06:53.620> up<00:06:53.710> but<00:06:53.800> I

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:53.860 
little bit different to set up but I

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.640 
little bit different to set up but I
want<00:06:54.040> to<00:06:54.100> show<00:06:54.280> you<00:06:54.340> here<00:06:54.930> so<00:06:55.930> all<00:06:56.320> you<00:06:56.440> do<00:06:56.620> is

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
want to show you here so all you do is

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.469 
want to show you here so all you do is
basically<00:06:56.949> put<00:06:57.370> pressure<00:06:57.880> on<00:06:58.090> the<00:06:58.210> chain<00:06:58.449> and

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 
basically put pressure on the chain and

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:00.990 
basically put pressure on the chain and
-<00:06:58.810> you<00:06:58.930> can<00:06:59.080> see<00:06:59.260> it<00:06:59.350> going<00:06:59.530> tight<00:06:59.979> and<00:07:00.880> what<00:07:00.970> I

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
- you can see it going tight and what I

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.790 
- you can see it going tight and what I
like<00:07:01.240> to<00:07:01.389> do<00:07:01.540> is<00:07:01.690> have<00:07:01.900> roughly<00:07:02.320> a<00:07:02.440> quarter

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
like to do is have roughly a quarter

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.060 
like to do is have roughly a quarter
inch<00:07:03.190> you<00:07:03.910> know<00:07:03.940> up<00:07:04.300> and<00:07:04.419> down<00:07:04.570> slack<00:07:05.320> in<00:07:05.650> the

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070 
inch you know up and down slack in the

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:11.939 
inch you know up and down slack in the
chain<00:07:08.340> if<00:07:09.340> the<00:07:09.520> chain<00:07:09.729> is<00:07:09.760> too<00:07:10.630> tight<00:07:10.960> you<00:07:11.830> know

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:11.949 
chain if the chain is too tight you know

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:13.830 
chain if the chain is too tight you know
puts<00:07:12.220> too<00:07:12.460> much<00:07:12.490> stress<00:07:13.000> on<00:07:13.240> the<00:07:13.330> drivetrain

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 
puts too much stress on the drivetrain

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.800 
puts too much stress on the drivetrain
and<00:07:14.229> a<00:07:14.289> charter<00:07:14.620> to<00:07:14.650> pedal<00:07:15.100> etc<00:07:15.729> if<00:07:16.330> it's<00:07:16.570> too

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.810 
and a charter to pedal etc if it's too

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.510 
and a charter to pedal etc if it's too
loose<00:07:17.139> you're<00:07:17.500> in<00:07:17.620> the<00:07:17.710> higher<00:07:17.889> risk<00:07:18.220> of<00:07:18.400> the

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520 
loose you're in the higher risk of the

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.700 
loose you're in the higher risk of the
chain<00:07:18.760> falling<00:07:19.300> off<00:07:19.510> while<00:07:19.870> you're<00:07:20.050> riding<00:07:20.260> so

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:20.710 
chain falling off while you're riding so

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.680 
chain falling off while you're riding so
it's<00:07:21.460> kind<00:07:21.820> of<00:07:21.850> important<00:07:22.330> to<00:07:22.419> get<00:07:22.510> that

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:22.690 
it's kind of important to get that

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.960 
it's kind of important to get that
proper<00:07:23.110> chain<00:07:23.350> tension<00:07:23.800> here<00:07:24.100> so<00:07:24.669> I'm<00:07:24.789> gonna

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:24.970 
proper chain tension here so I'm gonna

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.290 
proper chain tension here so I'm gonna
do<00:07:25.240> it<00:07:25.870> set<00:07:26.199> it<00:07:26.289> to<00:07:26.440> get<00:07:26.710> roughly<00:07:27.070> my<00:07:27.340> quarter

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:28.300 
do it set it to get roughly my quarter

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.070 
do it set it to get roughly my quarter
inch<00:07:28.479> of<00:07:28.690> up<00:07:28.840> and<00:07:29.020> down<00:07:30.539> as<00:07:31.539> you<00:07:31.660> can<00:07:31.780> see<00:07:31.960> the

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 
inch of up and down as you can see the

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.200 
inch of up and down as you can see the
chain<00:07:32.289> is<00:07:32.380> looking<00:07:32.650> even<00:07:33.610> kind<00:07:33.760> of<00:07:33.820> straight

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:34.210 
chain is looking even kind of straight

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.290 
chain is looking even kind of straight
here<00:07:34.630> and<00:07:34.810> then<00:07:34.930> once<00:07:35.110> it's<00:07:35.289> set<00:07:35.590> I<00:07:36.180> tighten<00:07:37.180> it

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:37.300 
here and then once it's set I tighten it

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:45.450 
here and then once it's set I tighten it
down<00:07:42.180> so<00:07:43.180> out<00:07:43.270> this<00:07:43.770> there<00:07:44.770> you<00:07:44.860> have<00:07:45.010> it<00:07:45.160> your

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:45.460 
down so out this there you have it your

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.210 
down so out this there you have it your
single<00:07:46.090> speed<00:07:46.270> setup<00:07:46.660> nice<00:07:47.620> clean-looking

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:48.220 
single speed setup nice clean-looking

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.870 
single speed setup nice clean-looking
handlebars<00:07:49.120> with<00:07:49.450> no<00:07:49.960> derailers<00:07:50.560> lot<00:07:51.460> fewer

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:51.880 
handlebars with no derailers lot fewer

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.080 
handlebars with no derailers lot fewer
cables<00:07:52.599> to<00:07:52.870> have<00:07:53.020> to<00:07:53.229> adjust<00:07:53.880> then<00:07:54.880> you<00:07:54.940> get<00:07:55.060> a

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.090 
cables to have to adjust then you get a

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.550 
cables to have to adjust then you get a
nice<00:07:55.330> clean<00:07:55.919> drivetrain<00:07:56.919> simple<00:07:57.610> to<00:07:57.700> maintain

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 
nice clean drivetrain simple to maintain

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.080 
nice clean drivetrain simple to maintain
and<00:07:59.560> did<00:07:59.710> I<00:07:59.800> say<00:07:59.830> it<00:08:00.099> was<00:08:00.130> a<00:08:00.280> challenge<00:08:00.729> to<00:08:00.760> ride

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:01.090 
and did I say it was a challenge to ride

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.589 
and did I say it was a challenge to ride
as<00:08:01.960> it<00:08:01.990> is<00:08:02.280> but<00:08:03.280> for<00:08:03.849> some<00:08:03.970> of<00:08:04.060> us<00:08:04.180> that's<00:08:04.419> what

00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:04.599 
as it is but for some of us that's what

00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:07.350 
as it is but for some of us that's what
makes<00:08:04.750> it<00:08:04.900> a<00:08:04.960> lot<00:08:05.080> of<00:08:05.199> fun<00:08:05.760> enjoy<00:08:06.760> it<00:08:06.880> give<00:08:07.240> it<00:08:07.270> a

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 
makes it a lot of fun enjoy it give it a

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.680 
makes it a lot of fun enjoy it give it a
try<00:08:07.949> and<00:08:08.949> hopefully<00:08:09.880> it<00:08:10.090> works<00:08:10.150> out<00:08:10.360> well<00:08:10.539> for

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:10.690 
try and hopefully it works out well for

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.810 
try and hopefully it works out well for
you
