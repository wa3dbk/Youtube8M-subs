simple<00:00:08.299> diffusion<00:00:08.900> is<00:00:09.049> defined<00:00:09.559> as<00:00:09.830> molecules

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
simple diffusion is defined as molecules

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.890 
simple diffusion is defined as molecules
moving<00:00:10.760> from<00:00:11.059> a<00:00:11.150> region<00:00:11.480> of<00:00:11.599> high

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
moving from a region of high

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.869 
moving from a region of high
concentration<00:00:12.769> to<00:00:12.799> a<00:00:13.039> region<00:00:13.099> of<00:00:13.610> low

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:13.879 
concentration to a region of low

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.769 
concentration to a region of low
concentration<00:00:14.559> in<00:00:16.029> the<00:00:17.029> example<00:00:17.480> shown<00:00:17.750> here

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
concentration in the example shown here

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.689 
concentration in the example shown here
we<00:00:18.260> have<00:00:18.380> a<00:00:18.410> high<00:00:18.710> concentration<00:00:19.490> of<00:00:19.580> oxygen

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
we have a high concentration of oxygen

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.330 
we have a high concentration of oxygen
in<00:00:20.180> the<00:00:20.300> extracellular<00:00:20.689> fluid<00:00:21.109> and<00:00:21.560> a<00:00:22.070> lower

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
in the extracellular fluid and a lower

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.700 
in the extracellular fluid and a lower
concentration<00:00:22.699> of<00:00:23.420> oxygen<00:00:23.750> in<00:00:24.020> the<00:00:24.170> cytoplasm

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
concentration of oxygen in the cytoplasm

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.460 
concentration of oxygen in the cytoplasm
and<00:00:25.010> so<00:00:25.610> oxygen<00:00:25.940> is<00:00:26.150> moving<00:00:26.600> from<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:27.230> higher

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
and so oxygen is moving from the higher

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.410 
and so oxygen is moving from the higher
concentration<00:00:27.800> in<00:00:28.490> the<00:00:28.640> extracellular<00:00:29.000> fluid

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420

to the lower concentration in the

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.889 
to the lower concentration in the
cytoplasm<00:00:33.399> this<00:00:34.399> is<00:00:34.579> known<00:00:34.789> as<00:00:34.820> moving<00:00:35.570> down

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
cytoplasm this is known as moving down

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.229 
cytoplasm this is known as moving down
or<00:00:36.260> with<00:00:36.559> the<00:00:36.829> concentration<00:00:37.640> gradient<00:00:38.059> and

or with the concentration gradient and

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.630 
or with the concentration gradient and
it<00:00:38.329> continues<00:00:38.899> until<00:00:39.140> equal<00:00:39.800> concentrations

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
it continues until equal concentrations

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.040 
it continues until equal concentrations
are<00:00:40.819> reached

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.390 
water moving from the extracellular
fluid<00:01:04.300> where<00:01:05.050> there<00:01:05.229> is<00:01:05.350> a<00:01:05.380> relatively<00:01:05.979> low

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400

glucose<00:01:11.260> concentration

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.300 

facilitated<00:01:18.080> diffusion<00:01:18.260> molecules<00:01:19.130> are

facilitated diffusion molecules are

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.710 
facilitated diffusion molecules are
still<00:01:19.490> moving<00:01:19.970> down<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.360> concentration

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
still moving down the concentration

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.200 
still moving down the concentration

low<00:01:23.300> concentration<00:01:24.160> however<00:01:25.160> they<00:01:25.460> require

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
low concentration however they require

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.970 
low concentration however they require
the<00:01:26.150> aid<00:01:26.270> of<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.630> carrier<00:01:26.990> protein<00:01:27.200> in<00:01:27.620> order<00:01:27.890> to

the aid of a carrier protein in order to

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.140 
the aid of a carrier protein in order to
do<00:01:28.100> so<00:01:28.370> in<00:01:29.710> this<00:01:30.710> example<00:01:30.920> we<00:01:31.490> see<00:01:31.700> glucose

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
do so in this example we see glucose

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.820 
do so in this example we see glucose
moving<00:01:32.660> from<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.930> extracellular<00:01:33.380> fluid

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
cytoplasm where it has a lower

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.990 
cytoplasm where it has a lower
concentration<00:01:38.890> notice<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.130> conformational

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
concentration notice the conformational

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.270 
concentration notice the conformational
shaped<00:01:41.390> change<00:01:41.840> in<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.229> carrier<00:01:42.620> protein<00:01:43.070> as

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
shaped change in the carrier protein as

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.360 
shaped change in the carrier protein as
the<00:01:43.460> glucose<00:01:43.850> moves<00:01:44.240> through<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.690> membrane

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
the glucose moves through the membrane

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.460 
the glucose moves through the membrane
so<00:01:46.370> in<00:01:46.520> summary<00:01:46.760> passive<00:01:47.479> transport<00:01:47.870> involves

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
so in summary passive transport involves

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.080 
so in summary passive transport involves
the<00:01:48.590> movement<00:01:48.740> of<00:01:49.100> molecules<00:01:49.250> with<00:01:49.910> the
