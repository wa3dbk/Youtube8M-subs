hi Tyler dinner fidelity here today
we're<00:00:07.430> going<00:00:07.520> to<00:00:07.610> talk<00:00:07.850> about<00:00:08.029> the

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.440 
we're going to talk about the

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:15.669 
we're going to talk about the
beyerdynamic<00:00:09.440> DT<00:00:10.040> 48<00:00:10.969> e<00:00:13.059> this<00:00:14.059> headphone<00:00:14.679> or

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679 
beyerdynamic DT 48 e this headphone or

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.130 
beyerdynamic DT 48 e this headphone or
the<00:00:16.270> original<00:00:17.270> version<00:00:17.720> of<00:00:17.779> this<00:00:17.930> headphone

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
the original version of this headphone

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.529 
the original version of this headphone
was<00:00:18.500> first<00:00:18.740> manufactured<00:00:19.250> in<00:00:20.440> 1937<00:00:22.539> at

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
was first manufactured in 1937 at

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.269 
was first manufactured in 1937 at
beyerdynamic<00:00:24.670> so<00:00:25.670> this<00:00:26.090> is<00:00:26.890> possibly<00:00:27.890> the

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
beyerdynamic so this is possibly the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.429 
beyerdynamic so this is possibly the

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.310 

really<00:01:25.880> like<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:26.390> look<00:01:26.630> of<00:01:26.659> these<00:01:27.049> headphones

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
really like the look of these headphones

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.940 
really like the look of these headphones
I<00:01:27.890> really<00:01:28.960> enjoyed<00:01:29.960> having<00:01:30.380> them<00:01:30.560> around<00:01:30.680> the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
I really enjoyed having them around the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.819 
I really enjoyed having them around the
lab<00:01:31.159> here<00:01:31.490> but<00:01:31.850> I<00:01:31.880> thought<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:32.689> sound<00:01:32.960> was<00:01:33.229> a

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
lab here but I thought the sound was a

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.200 
lab here but I thought the sound was a
little<00:01:34.670> not<00:01:35.450> up<00:01:35.689> to<00:01:35.900> snuff<00:01:36.579> the<00:01:37.579> bass<00:01:37.790> wasn't

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
little not up to snuff the bass wasn't

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.850 
little not up to snuff the bass wasn't
very<00:01:38.329> good<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:40.310> treble<00:01:41.210> was<00:01:41.540> missing<00:01:42.290> some<00:01:42.710> of

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
very good the treble was missing some of

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.520 
very good the treble was missing some of
the<00:01:43.100> information<00:01:43.640> in<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:46.119> kind<00:01:47.119> of<00:01:47.530> 3000

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
the information in the kind of 3000

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.780 
the information in the kind of 3000
Hertz<00:01:48.649> range<00:01:48.979> I'd<00:01:49.250> have<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.460> look<00:01:49.579> at<00:01:49.670> the

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
Hertz range I'd have to look at the

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.690 
Hertz range I'd have to look at the
graph<00:01:50.000> but<00:01:50.470> it<00:01:51.470> seemed<00:01:51.770> like<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.009> civil

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
graph but it seemed like the civil

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.030 
graph but it seemed like the civil
answers<00:01:53.030> weren't<00:01:53.240> quite<00:01:53.659> natural<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:54.560> lower

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
answers weren't quite natural the lower

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.830 
answers weren't quite natural the lower
frequencies<00:01:55.729> of<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.030> sibilance<00:01:56.509> --is<00:01:56.659> we're

frequencies of the sibilance --is we're

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.770 
frequencies of the sibilance --is we're
kind<00:01:57.020> of<00:01:57.049> missing<00:01:57.439> causing<00:01:57.890> them<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.250> be<00:01:58.430> a<00:01:58.460> bit

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
kind of missing causing them to be a bit

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.480 
kind of missing causing them to be a bit
freaky<00:01:59.780> or<00:02:00.350> a<00:02:00.409> bit<00:02:00.710> bright

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
freaky or a bit bright

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.620 
freaky or a bit bright
I<00:02:01.520> shouldn't<00:02:01.850> say<00:02:01.969> streaky<00:02:02.240> because<00:02:02.509> they're

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
I shouldn't say streaky because they're

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.690 
I shouldn't say streaky because they're
not<00:02:02.750> over<00:02:03.110> accentuate<00:02:03.680> they're<00:02:03.920> just<00:02:04.100> missing

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
not over accentuate they're just missing

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.030 
not over accentuate they're just missing
the<00:02:04.939> lower<00:02:05.479> half<00:02:05.840> of<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.170> civil<00:02:06.500> lenses<00:02:06.829> I

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
the lower half of the civil lenses I

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.820 
the lower half of the civil lenses I
felt<00:02:09.790> if<00:02:10.790> you're<00:02:11.269> a<00:02:11.299> recording<00:02:12.110> engineer<00:02:12.260> and

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
felt if you're a recording engineer and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.720 
felt if you're a recording engineer and
you<00:02:13.220> need<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.520> pair<00:02:13.849> of<00:02:13.879> location<00:02:14.629> recording

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
you need a pair of location recording

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.600 
you need a pair of location recording
headphones<00:02:16.989> I<00:02:17.040> wouldn't<00:02:18.040> recommend<00:02:18.190> these

I'd recommend having a look at the Denon

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:28.280 
I'd recommend having a look at the Denon
