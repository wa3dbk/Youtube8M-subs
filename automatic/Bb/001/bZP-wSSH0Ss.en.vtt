the best way to prevent chain problems

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.020 
the best way to prevent chain problems
is<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.500> make<00:01:10.650> sure<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.100> chain<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.520> properly

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
is to make sure the chain is properly

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.870 
is to make sure the chain is properly
tensioned<00:01:12.320> well<00:01:13.320> lubricated<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.729> good
