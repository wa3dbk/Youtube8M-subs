00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.150
 the maids to do everything is the nickname 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.860
 that the railwaymen had given to the 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.809
 8100 babies these small discrete machines 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.579
 Robustness has come 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.559
 for more than half a century the lines 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.850
 of the network 1500 volts of the sncf 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.610
 medium power mixed locomotive 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.859
 limited in speed it was not 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.289
 prestigious machines such as DC 7100 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.180
 released at the same time and it takes 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.739
 thank here the amateurs who had the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.469
 clairvoyance to film them in the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.979
 years 60 to 80 and who entrusted us 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.049
 their movie the history of these machines 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:03.120
 start in the late 30s when 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.280
 electrification in 1500 volts 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.990
 continuum begins to expand and that the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.479
 need of new locomotives is done 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.159
 feel for fast trains from 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.009
 travelers the choices of the time had been 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.210
 focused on the 2 d2 but for the traffic 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.280
 merchandise 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.840
 the engineers of the brand new sncf 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.710
 turned to the guy who had 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.119
 proven 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.130
 the midday babies from 1922 the company of the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.880
 noon to commissioning the first series 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.869
 of these machines 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.390
 the 4000 and 4500 the po closely followed 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.090
 with the commissioning in 1924 of 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.590
 babies 1 to 80 and that of the series without 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.590
 we see here at the montrouge depot 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.119
 but it was the midday babies who were 

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:50.369
 truly the ancestors of this 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:55.619
 long line that ends 25 years more 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.750
 late for babies 8100 the company of the noon 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.060
 needed locomotives almost 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.700
 universal to ensure on the one hand 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.649
 express services at the speed of 90 km 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.020
 time limited speed by rail is 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.789
 double mushrooms and secondly the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.009
 freight service on the lines of 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.730
 plain and on the Pyrenean lines to 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.730
 difficult profiles 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.120
 after some modifications these 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.980
 machines gave such good results 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.220
 that both transpyrénéen completed in 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.110
 1928 and 1929 were built with 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.270
 rents of 40 and even forty three for 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.980
 a thousand on the line of the somport of pau to 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.980
 canfranc that we see here in winter 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.170
 it's on another famous line of the 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.670
 company that noon babies did 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.070
 still proof of their qualities 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.980
 this is the artery of the causes of 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.320
 Béziers neussargues 270 km long 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.350
 with 2 long ramp 30 and 33 for 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.350
 thousand 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.930
 given their modest power of 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.340
 1000 to 1500 horsepower the machines had 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.989
 been provided from the origin of 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.780
 equipment for circulation in 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:17.250
 ulm in multiple units what was the 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.250
 general rule on the line of causses 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.459
 their particular design and is 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.900
 completely new for the time 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.900
 two candles were fitted with motors
