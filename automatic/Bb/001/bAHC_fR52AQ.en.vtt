computer all of these videos right here

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.220 
computer all of these videos right here
that's<00:00:33.149> me<00:00:33.380> la<00:00:35.059> these<00:00:36.059> are<00:00:36.239> for<00:00:36.390> my<00:00:36.420> flip<00:00:36.840> by

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
that's me la these are for my flip by

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.470 
that's me la these are for my flip by
the<00:00:37.290> way<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.710> if<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> flip<00:00:38.969> camera<00:00:39.239> if

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
the way is if you have a flip camera if

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.860 
the way is if you have a flip camera if
you<00:00:39.600> don't<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.620> asked<00:00:41.040> out<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.510> don't<00:00:42.510> know<00:00:42.600> but

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
you don't you asked out I don't know but

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.049 
you don't you asked out I don't know but
I<00:00:43.559> think<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.920> main<00:00:44.070> reason<00:00:44.129> these<00:00:44.700> videos

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
I think the main reason these videos

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.410 
I think the main reason these videos
just<00:00:45.180> became<00:00:45.570> compatible<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.289> because<00:00:47.420> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
just became compatible is because the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.250 
just became compatible is because the
video<00:00:48.750> file<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.320> was<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.940> mp4<00:00:50.940> file<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:52.230> you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
video file it was is a mp4 file so you

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.200 
video file it was is a mp4 file so you
have<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.680> flip<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.250> want<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.489> edit<00:00:53.579> videos

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
have a flip and you want to edit videos

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.410 
have a flip and you want to edit videos
