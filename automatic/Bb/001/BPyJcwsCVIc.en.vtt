00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
sticking it on a phone case so it

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.010 
sticking it on a phone case so it
basically<00:01:36.299> comes<00:01:36.479> with<00:01:36.630> everything<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.960> need

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
and it's pretty simple to install that's

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.630 
and it's pretty simple to install that's
it<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:40.170> know<00:01:40.259> shouldn't<00:01:40.979> come<00:01:41.100> off<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.490> then

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
it you know shouldn't come off and then

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.609 
it you know shouldn't come off and then
how<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.150> basically<00:01:42.509> works<00:01:42.780> again<00:01:43.409> it's

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
how it basically works again it's

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.330 
how it basically works again it's
