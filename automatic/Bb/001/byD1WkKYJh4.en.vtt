00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.929
 Look at the summary so you can see who takes the 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.929
 car 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:18.880
 depends on you finish the program today 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:25.860
 or we'll continue you sit in the 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.860
 car today already takes away to china 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.110
 was a technical interpretation 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.260
 perfect not but is had a delivery of it 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.519
 an organic thing that made the 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.210
 interpretation of him 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.210
 valued 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.500
 the sebrae 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.760
 I think she does not combine this song 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.200
 much with her voice so do not be 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.460
 I think it was not one of the best days of 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.460
 sipat unfortunately 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.980
 lucas and victor I am 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.000
 by touch 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:43.550
 it was more hoarse management i liked this 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:47.440
 third age of your kiss 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.440
 I know 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.920
 she knows the dynamic music is still going 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.570
 improve in this sense that the refrain 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.710
 a little shouted and but you can 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.569
 realize that it is a girl who has a 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.740
 great future and seek ahead 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.000
 the soul 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.270
 ae 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.270
 alexandrine, right 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.680
 and it's the only one here that I turn my hand to 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.930
 fire and I'm sure that this boy will 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.040
 It will give a lot to talk about in the musical field. 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.400
 Brazilian 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.350
 I'm like this 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.660

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.660
 and mine but quoted 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.970
 luiza of strength 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.689
 went very well both in the most 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.549
 the lower parts and 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.549
