00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.280
 all and welcome to the love tablet 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.320
 points like today new test 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.269
 of a tablet with the asus live at 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.269
 smart tobacco only have one tablet under 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.720
 windows 8 which was actually made official 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.789
 at the cs 2013 de las vegas and we got it 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.189
 in our premises so a quick little 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.810
 packaging tour so always a 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.910
 reinforced cardboard from now it gets 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.340
 a little standard for tablets 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.560
 tactile so on the sides we have little 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.940
 information except for the fact that 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.570
 can we can have the choice between 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.460
 two colors 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.250
 so either white or black we have 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.680
 took the black here on the sides 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.190
 and there's nothing behind except for such 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.059
 references and now we will open to 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.700
 inside so hop 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:54.449
 so we have the famous tablet with his 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.600
 protective film as if we already have 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.520
 open here so it's a tablet of 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.750
 10.1 inches 16 9th format so that's it 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.820
 will go around the features 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.909
 comprehensive techniques just now in 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.420
 following the test up 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:16.350
 then we have the mains charger of which 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.320
 classic here with the cable that one 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.750
 found in the background to recharge the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.590
 tablet like these in usb 2 and a 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.840
 micro usb output complete directly 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.909
 on the tablet and indoors so 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.240
 always the little documentation and 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.770
 guarantees as well as an explanation of 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.229
 windows 8 which does not hurt because 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.329
 that it's really a new a new 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.890
 operating system 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:46.110
 so here is this the usual see 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:52.320
 not had this windows 8 guide for tablets 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.939
 tactile some explanations like 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.530
 this is pretty summary 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.420
 resumes a bit like we zoom in and 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.520
 to zoom out etc 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.259
 and then we like it at home 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.409

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.060
