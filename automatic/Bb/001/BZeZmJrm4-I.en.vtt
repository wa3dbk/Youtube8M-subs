00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.220
 Good morning White is good today 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:13.210
 I wonder if I'm sure 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:17.420
 A newspaper shop a little while ago would come home and enter the newspaper 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:24.140
 It is coming end to the story of that domino pizza at that time 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:26.539
 I always thought that I had to get a discount ticket and use it, but now it is on the net 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.090
 If you look at domino pizza 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.610
 Because there was such a thing a little 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.940
 I want to introduce 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.940
 Here 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:41.780
 Do you have a movie of tiger &amp; bunny ? 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:46.000
 It's like doing something or doing something 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.810
 Now stop pizza is collaboration in its campaign 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.670
 Well I'm eh 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.199
 And 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.640
 For those who do not know tiger &amp; bunny briefly explain 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.579
 It's another anime 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:02.070
 People with special abilities 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:08.729
 Wear a costume and become a hero 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.700
 Animate to help everyone in town from various things in the play 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.030
 Hmm 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.490
 1 on TV 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:18.470
 It seems not Rutteyuu surrounds 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:24.230
 What's changing for each hero is that everyone has costumes 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:30.590
 The name of the sponsor's maker is written in English. 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:32.409
 For example, I 2 person protagonist is Tteyuu Nagasone Kotetsu and Barnaby is I'm protagonist 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.649
 If it was a small iron 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.560
 and was written in large chest Fu say softbank 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:43.590
 If it was barnaby 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:48.600
 It is written in the style of the stand, and there are also sense of smell and writing and characters here 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:55.799
 Or have a character that is written like a Pepsi Nex to the arm 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:58.840
 This movie is probably the second time so maybe it's a pretty popular anime 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.920
 Say whether the campaign 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.720
 Feeling 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:09.640
 I There is the Tteyuu tiger &amp; bunny special theft 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:13.780
 In 350 yen more than 2,000 of the favorite pizza plus 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:17.170
 Is this original drama cd? 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:22.030
 Or clear file 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.260
 Is a campaign that can be set together at 350 yen What kind of 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:30.280
 Speaking of 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:36.069
 Domino Pizza special radio style program original drama c Barnaby version and Toru Toru 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.190
 It seems that there is a version it after limited Teacher of the clear file two countries 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.520
 Of these three and 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.840
 You want to choose me or 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:48.470
 It looks like this Burnaby drama c has been added recently 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:52.100
 I would like to put on a pana fire 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.990
 By the way, the box of pizza looks like this 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.819
 It has become tiger &amp; bunny version 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:02.799
 This is what I was a little bit worried about 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.969
 I also saw a pizza in collaboration with the voice actors of tiger &amp; bunny . 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:09.159
 I have to think 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:16.810
 It seems that there is a pizza that images each character I tried 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:18.620
 For example, if it is Toru Toru's pizza, it's Avocado sauce and mayonnaise 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.769
 It's pizza 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.370
 Pizza inspired by the following Furana b 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.569
 Tomato Sauce Roasted Chicken Fresh Mushroom 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:32.720
 Mozzarella cheese 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:36.450
 It feels like a chicken pizza, I 'll hit and actually order 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.630
 Well then this one also pizza this movement seat 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:45.780

 Press here in come out in it I feel in there or not to half &amp; half 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.390
 As you come up with which half and half to come out 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.980
 Choose a pizza with a burner p 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.280

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:04.780

 After this choose the size etc. and choose the post payment method etc. 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.840
 Ask you 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.790
 By the way 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:15.349
 Drink Pepsi 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:18.850
 I wanted to see Pepsi because it was Pepsi, but I wanted to see it 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:21.889
 It looks like Domino Pizza Coca Cola 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.350
 I would like to go buy later at 100 yen Lawson 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:28.110
 A little 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.110
