00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello how are you today I love you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.649
 share a review from my very 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.719
 humble opinion about two products 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.780
 that I have loved 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.450
 the first is this brand shampoo 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.119
 bio expert that is a brand that I think 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.109
 does not have much that came to mexico and not 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.670
 It has a lot that came here to where I live 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:27.210
 previously to this shampoo I am 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.640
 using pantene but the accounts that 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.880
 here at the root I left it as very 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.890
 fatty with an unpleasant texture it 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.440
 I looked like dirty and the truth is that I did not 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.750
 liked but for nothing I have the hair 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.320
 straight so occupy part n for 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.809
 straight hair I did not like for anything like that 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.800
 that I decided to change it to this must expert 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.879
 and the truth is that I liked it 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.770
 very much is the line restoration and 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.469
 that good nothing else there was restoration 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.149
 control fall and shine so of those 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.699
 three that were available in the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.180
 supermarket because I said which one has me 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.650
 serve better so I decided to restore 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.080
 since as I am adapting my baby 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.020
 because the hair has to become dry 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.030
 a lot to fall down but good is 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.520
 inevitable even shampoo has helped me 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.619
 quite unlike bread has 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.979
 notice that this leaves my hair well 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.340
 clean and with a delicious aroma that lasts 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.350
 well enough time it's good to wash the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.760
 hair every day but then the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.400
 truth is that I do wash all 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.800
 because I do not like to bring the dirty things of a 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.900
 day for another and as an exercise because neither 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.700
 so I stayed with the sweat there are two 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.370
 days it would be like that nasty in my 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.820
 opinion but why I say this as I 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.250
 personally if I wash it that 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.500
 shampoo I liked enough I tell you 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.330
 It makes my hair clean 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.460
 back says it's made with walnut 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.560
 macadamia who knows that tsonga is not 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.490
 a face of mine because I never heard of her 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.710
 but I can tell you that it smells very rich 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.790
 and it smells very rich natural well seriously 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.979
 they have said a lot that it does not contain salt 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.960
 and neither ingredients do we follow the 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.729
 oil, that will be what makes it 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.360
 so special because the truth is that yes 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.550
 I like and quite here behind that of 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.710
 mocha in blond expert has his 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.690
 exclusive formula biobalas that with the 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.280
 most advanced extra technology of best 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.910
 from nature to give you a hair 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.959
 manageable soft and with brightness insists on 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:32.080
 that has no salt I love what I can 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.210
 recommend 100% but good we already know 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.100
 what 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.540
 every person is a world so he can 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.370
 that works for me 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.760
 but hopefully and also 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.810
 it smells delicious to the girl 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:50.709
 and families of 650 milliliters is more 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.930
 big but well then there's the 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.480
 second product is the comb cream 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.569
 of the same brand 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.159
 this is for straight hair like 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.069
 smooth hair restoration a scalp 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:08.260
 is straight as I say I tried brands like 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:10.540
 xavi gives him the keep l'orÃ©al and all 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.470
 also to record them before and all in one 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.970
 same feature are of a texture 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.420
 thick and when placed in the 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.210
 hair like it was stiff as 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.070
 with a 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:28.150
 feeling that it was very greasy 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:30.400
 I do not know I did not like at all any 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.060
 nothing finished because I did not like to 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.440
 nothing 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.030
 this was totally different because 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.700
 comparison of them this has a 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.880
 very light texture the hair like that 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.100
 it absorbs it and it does not feel that way and that to me 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:51.370
 I like that he has a movement that 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:54.190
 Well yes it looks natural not so so 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.290
 loaded with product and the truth is that 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.380
 with those creams it did not work for me and 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.110
 this has been a big difference c'mon no 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.630
 contains salt and no ingredients 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.950
 petroleum derivatives maybe that's it 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.940
 the difference here and back says 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.800
 complement to the care of your hair with 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.450
 the line of creams for combing bio 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.850
 expert and the same 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.470
 and with the most advanced technology this is 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.209
 the best of nature to give you a 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.660
 soft, manageable hair with shine 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:27.530
 Keep your hairstyle all day I like it 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.060
 I can recommend it enough if doing 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.760
 a conditioner and treatment cream 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.280
 but do not buy because I have yet 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.750
 more than natura that I have not finished like this 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.970
 that I said first you 'll love it out and then 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.979
 I try them but I loved what 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.600
 is the shampoo and the comb cream 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.330
 that in the end I think I'm going to try 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.150
 the complete line I have learned that you have already 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.160
 served in truth is a very good one the 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.320
 opinion but remember that not all 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.810
 they work the same but hopefully you too 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.430
 work to you and good in the box 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.380
 training I'll leave the link to the 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.990

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.210
