no<00:04:44.660> one<00:04:44.810> I<00:04:44.870> think<00:04:45.050> she'll<00:04:45.380> be<00:04:45.500> in<00:04:45.530> the

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
kindergarten that's that's the most

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.510 
kindergarten that's that's the most
likely<00:04:48.260> place<00:04:48.650> she'll<00:04:48.830> go<00:04:48.980> because<00:04:49.340> that's

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
likely place she'll go because that's

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.330 
likely place she'll go because that's

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
the only technology that is from the gym

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.250 
the only technology that is from the gym
world<00:04:52.610> that<00:04:52.970> she<00:04:53.120> can<00:04:53.300> use<00:04:53.510> to<00:04:53.540> contact<00:04:54.140> people

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260

that's<00:04:55.040> probably<00:04:55.130> only<00:04:55.550> one<00:04:55.850> so<00:04:56.390> she'll<00:04:56.600> be<00:04:56.630> at

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
that's probably only one so she'll be at

comes out of that comes out of the I

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.370 
comes out of that comes out of the I
guess<00:05:17.540> the<00:05:17.750> UM<00:05:19.000> the<00:05:20.000> parts<00:05:20.479> of<00:05:20.690> the<00:05:20.810> ship<00:05:20.870> is

guess the UM the parts of the ship is

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.250 
guess the UM the parts of the ship is
like<00:05:21.590> screaming<00:05:22.460> like<00:05:22.760> this<00:05:23.419> is<00:05:23.600> not<00:05:23.810> over
