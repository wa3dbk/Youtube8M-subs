different spots will give you one

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.200 
different spots will give you one
hundred<00:01:10.049> percent<00:01:10.229> vehicle<00:01:10.890> disabled<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.549> it

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
hundred percent vehicle disabled and it

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.750 
hundred percent vehicle disabled and it
would<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:12.600> bled<00:01:12.750> out<00:01:13.100> but<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.130> decided<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.640> go

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
would have bled out but I decided to go

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.300 
would have bled out but I decided to go
for<00:01:15.000> round<00:01:15.210> two<00:01:15.509> shot<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.920> hit<00:01:17.070> him<00:01:17.159> pretty

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
for round two shot and I hit him pretty

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.429 
for round two shot and I hit him pretty
much<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.729> same<00:01:17.909> spot<00:01:18.299> I'm<00:01:18.509> thinking<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> back

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
much the same spot I'm thinking the back

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.289 
much the same spot I'm thinking the back
vents<00:01:19.740> are<00:01:19.979> going<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.159> be<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> best<00:01:20.580> bet<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:21.060> I

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
vents are going to be the best bet but I

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.630 
vents are going to be the best bet but I
didn't<00:01:21.689> have<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.990> access<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:23.310> get<00:01:23.520> to

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
didn't have that access and I get to

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.149 
didn't have that access and I get to
kill<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.030> him<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.439> don't<00:01:25.650> know<00:01:25.740> if<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.950> guys

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
kill on him and I don't know if you guys

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.590 
kill on him and I don't know if you guys
have<00:01:26.369> got<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.670> chance<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.000> play<00:01:27.030> with<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.420> TV

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
to pause it hits the ground right before

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.899 
to pause it hits the ground right before
the<00:01:34.049> guy<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.710> sort<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.189> glides<00:01:35.549> against

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
the guy and it sort of glides against

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.249 
the guy and it sort of glides against
the<00:01:36.000> ground<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.420> then<00:01:36.570> hits<00:01:36.780> them<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.110> blows

the ground and then hits them and blows

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.700 
the ground and then hits them and blows
up<00:01:37.820> it's<00:01:38.820> hard<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.090> see<00:01:39.299> because<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.900> blurs<00:01:40.500> out

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
up it's hard to see because it blurs out

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.899 
up it's hard to see because it blurs out
right<00:01:40.920> there<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:41.280> that's<00:01:41.340> pretty<00:01:41.549> much<00:01:41.670> what

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
right there but that's pretty much what

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.569 
right there but that's pretty much what
it<00:01:42.000> does<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.390> feel<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.840> when<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.049> happens

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
it does you can feel it when it happens

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.280 
it does you can feel it when it happens
so<00:01:44.579> those<00:01:44.729> were<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> couple<00:01:45.149> infantry<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.049> tank

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
so those were a couple infantry and tank

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.770 
so those were a couple infantry and tank
shots<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.890> here<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:48.030> helicopter<00:01:48.570> shot

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
shots and here is the helicopter shot

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.950 
shots and here is the helicopter shot
and<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.530> one<00:01:49.939> it<00:01:50.939> goes<00:01:51.240> right<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.630> his<00:01:51.750> nose

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
and this one it goes right on his nose

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.440 
and this one it goes right on his nose
and<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.649> think<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.979> would<00:01:53.100> hit<00:01:53.220> but<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.329> does

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
and you think it would hit but it does

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.020 
and you think it would hit but it does
it<00:01:54.770> that's<00:01:55.770> what<00:01:56.040> usually<00:01:56.159> happens<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.700> people

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
it that's what usually happens to people

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.149 
it that's what usually happens to people
but<00:01:57.240> I'm<00:01:57.479> guessing<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:58.140> few<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.409> us<00:01:58.530> get<00:01:58.740> lucky

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
but I'm guessing a few of us get lucky

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.819 
but I'm guessing a few of us get lucky
and<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.430> got<00:01:59.610> lucky<00:01:59.759> enough<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.149> record<00:02:00.509> it

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
and I got lucky enough to record it

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.010 
and I got lucky enough to record it
where<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:01.860> shot<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.340> missile<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.840> hits

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
where I shot this missile and it hits

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.260 
where I shot this missile and it hits
about<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.680> same<00:02:04.860> spot<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.189> my<00:02:05.490> theory<00:02:05.759> was<00:02:05.880> if

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
about the same spot but my theory was if

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.240 
about the same spot but my theory was if
you<00:02:06.329> hit<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.869> guy<00:02:07.079> where<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.920> guy<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.069> going

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
you hit the guy where the guy is going

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.580 
you hit the guy where the guy is going
to<00:02:08.310> be<00:02:08.489> then<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.179> will<00:02:09.300> blow<00:02:09.509> them<00:02:09.569> up<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.959> it

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
to be then it will blow them up and it

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.730 
to be then it will blow them up and it
works<00:02:10.770> out<00:02:10.950> for<00:02:11.160> me

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
works out for me

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.880 
works out for me
and<00:02:12.550> I<00:02:13.450> hope<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:13.810> guys<00:02:13.960> enjoyed<00:02:14.350> this<00:02:14.530> let<00:02:14.800> me

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
and I hope you guys enjoyed this let me

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.350 
and I hope you guys enjoyed this let me
know<00:02:15.040> if<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.340> guys<00:02:15.460> have<00:02:15.730> killed<00:02:15.970> people<00:02:16.120> in

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
know if you guys have killed people in

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.480 
know if you guys have killed people in
helicopters<00:02:16.930> or<00:02:17.170> jets<00:02:17.440> jets<00:02:18.010> would<00:02:18.160> be<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.310> lot

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
helicopters or jets jets would be a lot

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.630 
helicopters or jets jets would be a lot
harder<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:19.410> there's<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.500> slow<00:02:20.680> motion<00:02:21.070> peace

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
harder and there's a slow motion peace

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:37.000 
harder and there's a slow motion peace
out

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.069
