00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
and wearing ESS goggles it tends to

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.819 
and wearing ESS goggles it tends to
actually<00:03:03.540> dig<00:03:03.750> up<00:03:03.900> against<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.290> regionals

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.250 
actually dig up against the regionals
but<00:03:05.370> if<00:03:05.459> you<00:03:05.579> can<00:03:05.849> you<00:03:06.299> can<00:03:06.510> just<00:03:06.690> stick<00:03:06.989> a

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
but if you can you can just stick a

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.349 
but if you can you can just stick a
small<00:03:07.769> but<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.310> sort<00:03:08.519> of<00:03:08.579> small<00:03:08.849> bit<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.150> foam

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
small but and sort of small bit of foam

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:10.759 
small but and sort of small bit of foam
here<00:03:09.659> and<00:03:09.840> that<00:03:09.959> will<00:03:10.079> sort<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.440> problem

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
here and that will sort of the problem

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.839 
here and that will sort of the problem
of<00:03:10.950> also<00:03:11.940> is<00:03:12.120> what<00:03:12.450> I'd<00:03:12.599> be<00:03:12.750> careful<00:03:13.170> about<00:03:13.379> is

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
of also is what I'd be careful about is

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.479 
of also is what I'd be careful about is
with<00:03:14.849> gloves<00:03:15.209> on<00:03:15.450> when<00:03:15.980> you<00:03:16.980> get<00:03:17.159> the<00:03:17.340> mask

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
you'll actually have to feed this velcro

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.189 
you'll actually have to feed this velcro
shop<00:03:19.590> through<00:03:19.949> this<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.660> this<00:03:21.660> seems<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:21.989> be<00:03:22.079> a
