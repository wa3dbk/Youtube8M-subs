these concrete slabs I dug these up in
the<00:01:32.159> garden<00:01:32.610> they<00:01:32.759> were<00:01:32.820> all<00:01:33.000> buried<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.479> the

muck and it's just an asshole to get rid
of<00:01:36.030> them<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.390> far<00:01:36.659> better<00:01:36.960> build<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.320> little

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
of them so far better build a little

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.490 
of them so far better build a little
patio<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.509> use<00:01:39.509> them<00:01:39.720> up<00:01:39.869> get<00:01:40.229> them<00:01:40.290> out<00:01:40.470> of

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
patio and use them up get them out of

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.700 
patio and use them up get them out of
the<00:01:40.710> way<00:01:43.909> you<00:01:44.909> can<00:01:45.090> see<00:01:45.329> some<00:01:45.570> old<00:01:45.899> tiles<00:01:46.409> we've

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
the way you can see some old tiles we've

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.120 
the way you can see some old tiles we've
got<00:01:46.860> leftover<00:01:47.689> from<00:01:48.689> when<00:01:49.049> we<00:01:49.770> built<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
got leftover from when we built the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.590 
got leftover from when we built the
house

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
house

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.980 
house
got<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.530> use<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> more<00:01:52.950> Perella<00:01:53.810> otherwise<00:01:54.810> they

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
got to use a more Perella otherwise they

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.220 
got to use a more Perella otherwise they
just<00:01:55.220> cluttering<00:01:56.220> up<00:01:56.370> the<00:01:56.550> garden<00:01:56.970> so<00:01:57.660> to<00:01:58.080> get

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
just cluttering up the garden so to get

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.510 
just cluttering up the garden so to get
rid<00:01:58.410> of<00:01:58.500> them<00:01:58.620> I'm<00:01:58.770> going<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.010> build<00:01:59.190> a<00:01:59.310> true

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
rid of them I'm going to build a true

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.500 
rid of them I'm going to build a true
fear<00:01:59.960> never<00:02:00.960> built<00:02:01.230> a<00:02:01.350> tile<00:02:01.590> roof<00:02:01.890> before<00:02:02.510> but

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
fear never built a tile roof before but

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.359 
fear never built a tile roof before but
let's<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.350> see<00:02:04.470> what<00:02:04.620> happens

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.460 

so<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.550> trick<00:02:08.790> is<00:02:08.970> you've<00:02:09.179> got<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.479> put<00:02:10.320> these

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
so the trick is you've got to put these

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.910 
so the trick is you've got to put these
laps<00:02:10.860> on<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:12.090> five<00:02:12.420> point<00:02:12.750> five<00:02:13.170> centimeters

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
laps on that five point five centimeters

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.340 
laps on that five point five centimeters
apart<00:02:14.190> from<00:02:14.460> there<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.910> there<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.330> just<00:02:16.230> lay

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
apart from there to there and just lay

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.890 
apart from there to there and just lay
the<00:02:16.410> tiles<00:02:16.770> on<00:02:17.040> top<00:02:17.210> so<00:02:18.210> now<00:02:18.360> I've<00:02:18.450> just<00:02:18.480> got<00:02:18.780> to

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
the tiles on top so now I've just got to

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:36.170 
the tiles on top so now I've just got to
do<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.170> work<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.650> screw<00:02:20.220> them<00:02:20.280> all<00:02:20.460> down<00:02:35.180> like

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
do the work and screw them all down like

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.140 
do the work and screw them all down like
and<00:02:36.390> decade<00:02:36.690> earlier<00:02:36.870> from<00:02:37.260> 1958<00:02:38.150> and

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
and decade earlier from 1958 and

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.550 
and decade earlier from 1958 and
interstellar<00:02:39.660> in<00:02:39.959> London<00:02:41.450> probably<00:02:42.560> health

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
interstellar in London probably health

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.160 
interstellar in London probably health
and<00:02:43.770> safety<00:02:44.160> wouldn't<00:02:44.430> like<00:02:44.580> this<00:02:44.760> one<00:02:45.170> made

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
out of metal so sometimes you get a bit

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.600 
out of metal so sometimes you get a bit
worried<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.150> may<00:02:48.300> get<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.540> shock<00:02:49.370> it<00:02:50.370> works

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
good now we just have a quick checks if

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.550 
good now we just have a quick checks if
the<00:03:01.950> tiles<00:03:02.340> fit<00:03:02.790> best<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.959> check<00:03:04.200> first<00:03:04.440> before

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
the tiles fit best to check first before

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:24.450 
the tiles fit best to check first before
I<00:03:04.800> screw<00:03:05.070> all<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.370> lattice<00:03:05.670> on

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:35.200 

that<00:03:25.460> works<00:03:25.640> out<00:03:25.820> all<00:03:26.060> right<00:03:27.430> okay<00:03:34.090> so<00:03:35.090> we're

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
that works out all right okay so we're

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.000 
that works out all right okay so we're
going<00:03:35.330> to<00:03:35.420> try<00:03:35.630> putting<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:36.050> camera<00:03:37.180> on<00:03:38.180> a

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
going to try putting the camera on a

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.320 
going to try putting the camera on a
30-foot<00:03:40.010> pole<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:40.700> you<00:03:40.730> can<00:03:40.910> see<00:03:41.090> better

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
30-foot pole so you can see better

00:03:41.330 --> 00:04:04.899 
30-foot pole so you can see better
what's<00:03:41.540> happening

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.190 

and<00:04:05.909> we're<00:04:06.120> going<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.269> lay<00:04:06.420> some<00:04:06.450> tiles<00:04:06.900> on

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
and we're going to lay some tiles on

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.850 
and we're going to lay some tiles on
there<00:04:07.409> and<00:04:08.599> just<00:04:09.599> a<00:04:09.750> quick<00:04:10.019> little<00:04:10.230> bit<00:04:10.530> to

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
there and just a quick little bit to

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:28.670 
there and just a quick little bit to
give<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.099> an<00:04:11.220> idea<00:04:11.370> of<00:04:11.610> how<00:04:11.849> it<00:04:12.000> works

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:50.420 

you

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.580 

so<00:04:51.430> now<00:04:51.610> we<00:04:51.670> need<00:04:51.850> a<00:04:51.910> big<00:04:52.150> storm<00:04:52.570> to<00:04:53.080> test<00:04:53.350> if

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
so now we need a big storm to test if

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:00.180 
so now we need a big storm to test if
it's<00:04:53.850> waterproof<00:04:54.850> and<00:04:58.710> couple<00:04:59.710> of<00:04:59.740> more<00:04:59.890> tiles

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
it's waterproof and couple of more tiles

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:13.000 
it's waterproof and couple of more tiles
