00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Huh, it starts? 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.500
 Okay - hey comes into my world - yes! 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 What happens here in summer? 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.900
 The Berlin Juggling Convention! 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.700
 I feel like it's the same here as on the BJC! 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.000
 BJC ?! 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.500
 What's that? 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.000
 Oh, you do not know that? 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.300
 This is the Berlin Juggling Convention. 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.500
 Everywhere from Germany people come 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.000
 to juggle together, to spit fire, hula hoop 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.400
 circling, practicing acrobatics, together 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.100
 play and have fun. This is really nice! 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.100
 Are there any shows? 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.700
 Yes, there are even 2 shows and there are also interpreters. 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.800
 Oh, right! 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.000
 But I am a juggling novice - I have 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200
 no idea, can I come too? 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.800
 That's not a problem, there are also workshops 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.800
 where you can learn as a beginner. 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.800
 But there are also offers for professionals. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.700
 Everyone can join! 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.000
 Mh, that's really interesting! 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.200
 I think I want to come. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Where is it? 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 In the leisure and recreation center Wuhlheide, in the southeast of Berlin. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.300
 Where is slept? 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 You can bring a tent, then you can sleep in it. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Oh or I lie down at night on the beach 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.600
 and look at the stars falling asleep .. 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.200
 I'll do something in the morning? 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.700
 Jump in the lake and swim! 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800
 Yes you can! 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.000
 When? 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.500
 From the 12th to the 15th of June. 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.700
 Bring everything yourself! 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.300
 Bring everything for you? Nope! Himself! 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.700
 For info, register better soon, otherwise you will not get a seat at the gala show, 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.200
 you have to see them! 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.800
 If you are too late and miss it, there is still an emergency solution .. 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.500
 How was that again ...? 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Oh right! 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 In the sports hall, the show will also be broadcast via beamer, 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.200
 then you get private interpreter, 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.600
 do not worry, but sign up quickly, yes?
