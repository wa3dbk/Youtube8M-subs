00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.319
 I was here reading many thanks to 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.089
 all those who begin to write us and 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.210
 write and write and keep writing 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.059
 one out of joke and out of everything 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.009
 time to gobble up because there are many 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.870
 that in this you put in an apple whistle 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.289
 real what I'm going to say but the day 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.150
 today when hearing the news of the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.310
 hiring Javier Hernández to the Real 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.199
 Madrid has given me great pleasure and I 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.210
 It's very nice because I go to a 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.400
 Mexican soccer player to the best team in 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.419
 planet and I that you have to applaud him and 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.490
 you have to applaud it you have to say it in 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.980
 serious and study it totally seriously 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.800
 do not see the Catalan detractors who 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.750
 feel of catalonia and that they are more than 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.580
 cuautla and have not done more than sell 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.810
 he bends his beggar life and we have 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.250
 have given television after 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.260
 sell encyclopedias are going to see and to 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.020
 mock the chicharito not if they do that 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.650
 that they go away complexed tipejos of the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.650
 journalism 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.130
 I am happy commenting on the 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.930
 arrival of Javier Hernández and hopefully 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.970
 become what we want the 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.650
 Mexicans not that one more man triumphs 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.690
 in Real Madrid, no doubt 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.520
 extraordinary for Mexican soccer and 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.560
 for which we will be rafa the field 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.119
 is doing canchitas other side and 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.460
 now what to see as marca.com already what 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.610
 gives madrid from bad to worse 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.880
 not good if the farmhouse stand second 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.880
 note 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.509
 a shame 56 I do not see that is the 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.030
 chicharito but that you mark the spokesman of 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.670
 the line the newspaper double as well I do not see 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.369
 The first thing has sounded like a rumor 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.780
 I think that it is well founded because 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.000
 normally who has commented it is 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.580
 because so much information said that 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.289
 they were negotiating well like that now because 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.649
 now in spain and in europe are 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.890
 sleeping still not generalization 4 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.890
 there will be 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.780
 but we are not doing the office 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.260
 and we will have to wait a few hours not 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.570
 you heard the press conference of 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.040
 Carlo Ancelotti says something is going to change and 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.040
 have to change it to change 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.780
 in everything that is great news if 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.170
 It is concrete that Javier Hernández arrives 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:27.000
 to this team if bluffing and half 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:34.350
 with the best team on the planet if you 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.030
 fifa that because that is equal 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.500
 a technical team 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.320
 the possibility that 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.010
 go to guadalajara go tips and they're going to 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.010
 run to rafa 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.520
 surely I do not think that a rug 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.570
 conditions you have a project that you 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.570
 have rejected on another team 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.790
 shady business 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.980
 I like it but it makes me 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.989
 incredible that the real madrid go in 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.040
 looking for a man because he could never 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.190
 be a starter on your team 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.650
 the real madrid is for hiring 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.880
 players 20 the pea with all the 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.880
 respect is not elite but 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.880
 Thank you 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.200
 good good 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.670
 putting it in place 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.840
 12 34 not if you're here if you come with this 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.190
 plan to revile what we do in this 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.880
 humble editorial house 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:11.470
 we are in brand not here 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:14.070
 activates the way of madrid 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:21.010
 tomorrow they will all go out on the great road 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:24.060
 of chicha truth what happens if it is not like that 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.060
 if you do not like it
