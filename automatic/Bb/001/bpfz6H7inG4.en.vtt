00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.660
 another change in the room 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:36.629
 I do not know what it looks like because it does not focus 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.690
 Well, the result of that piece 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.880
 of room 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.870
 and now not 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.870
 my mother 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:54.110
 this is a gray color and it goes from a 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.110
 unstoppable 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.469
 I like it is horrible 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.280
 mother of love and more 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.090
 it is known that with the whys 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.090
 what color 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:20.290
 this seems better I do not say 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.290
 for a little corner of glitter 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:32.659
 when it's dry we'll see the result 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.659
 evils 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.969
 Well, well, how many hours is it? 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.470
 Apparent it's already rather dry but 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:45.799
 we also go upstairs to bed 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.909
 because it is not that the finger is stained nor 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.340
 that 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.659
 the box if we have placed it 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.329
 the truth is that it stands out much more 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.460
 and will clarify all that does not want all 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.960
 those boxes you do not want hannah montanna anymore 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.280
 or anything like that 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.909
 and that does not want anything from there 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.990
 so I do not know and the walls you saw 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.930
 that they also painted it in dark but 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.020
 in dark mother of mine that was shabby 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.760
 I do not like it that much they are dark loves 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.840
 this room is not very big and 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.629
 you need a lot of light 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.510
 and apart from the patio the awning is always 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:29.110
 state is not for the sun is for other 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.470
 things that I do not want to say but well 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.080
 that to see what we found to put 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.500
 or of desk of pens and things of 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.900
 those 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.240
 and nothing all that he wants to remove and now 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.160
 we will see and the laws that laws from 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.630
 then foolish the laws more than 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.030
 to catch dust and gossip because not 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.570
 Can you save anything boxes boxes box already 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.570
 like the boxes 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.680
 Well nothing girls so you could see that at 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:59.609
 final they appear we leave it in rosita very 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.150
 very clear and the background if we leave it 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:05.099
 A) Yes 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.099
 we have put glitter 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.810
 no, I will not see it for the best 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:19.100
 but it's already happened that with the 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.560
 if it were the sun it would look more 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.470
 because it flashes more the more light more 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.650
 flashes good- natured then so that 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.850
 You saw how it was worth, come on 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.700
 we see goodbye 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:38.100
 Hi girls, well, I wanted to teach 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:42.080
 and what is completely finished 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.080
 good finished more or less not 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.390
 you remember that it was painted it appears 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:52.120
 we removed and I took the modules that 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.430
 as you see 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.970
 it's the same as the room from the 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.980
 same color 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.110
 we have removed all the gossip all 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.590
 the boxes are camouflaged in the 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.590
 wardrove 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.170
 and good desktop because I have not yet 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.200
 found nothing so how did he have this 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:15.930
 little box that she has with things 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.500
 in fact it is at the moment until not 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:23.310
 find nothing but this is just the 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:26.430
 We have lined with adhesive paper in 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.370
 make in bright aluminum the same as 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.240
 we made this one here and we put it 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:36.740
 a ribbon in fuchsia and lilac as his 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:40.160
 room has fuchsia and lilac 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.050
 and so it is left 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.729
 and the closet the truth is that great 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.580
 Like very much 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:50.210
 she also takes away the gossip of 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.920
 the distance and dust and is good then the 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.580
 wall 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:58.560
 from here you see more light stays 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:02.280
 very well the truth the wall 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.600
 and good just so I could see there and how 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.600
 is finished 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.139
 Come on, we look good bye bye
