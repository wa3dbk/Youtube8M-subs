00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.330 

those<00:00:35.110> two<00:00:35.410> things<00:00:35.770> in<00:00:36.040> there<00:00:36.130> you're<00:00:36.250> gonna

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.700 

a<00:00:45.370> little<00:00:45.730> add-on<00:00:45.940> tricks<00:00:46.450> in<00:00:46.630> there<00:00:46.750> so<00:00:47.620> to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
a little add-on tricks in there so to

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.040 
a little add-on tricks in there so to
get<00:00:47.860> to<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.100> C<00:00:48.280> I<00:00:48.310> hit<00:00:48.550> this<00:00:48.700> B<00:00:49.030> note<00:00:49.270> and

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
get to the C I hit this B note and

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.110 
get to the C I hit this B note and
Hammer<00:00:50.500> it<00:00:50.590> on

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
Hammer it on

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.240 
Hammer it on
and<00:00:52.330> then<00:00:52.480> did<00:00:52.720> a<00:00:52.830> handle<00:00:53.830> there<00:00:54.010> on<00:00:54.160> the

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
and then did a handle there on the

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.940 
and then did a handle there on the
fourth<00:00:54.460> string<00:00:54.610> open

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
fourth string open

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.550 
fourth string open
that<00:00:56.700> get<00:00:56.970> to<00:00:57.180> see<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.570> like<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.020> forecasting

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
that get to see is like so forecasting

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:09.940 
that get to see is like so forecasting
moody<00:00:58.950> with<00:00:59.310> Iman

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.149 

it's<00:01:10.310> going<00:01:10.550> to<00:01:10.610> be<00:01:10.760> pretty<00:01:11.030> much<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:12.159> chords

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
it's going to be pretty much the chords

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.149 
it's going to be pretty much the chords
for<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.460> verse<00:01:14.200> so<00:01:15.200> it's<00:01:15.440> a<00:01:15.530> handling<00:01:15.950> the

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
for the verse so it's a handling the

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.580 
for the verse so it's a handling the
third<00:01:16.370> thing

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
third thing

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.890 
third thing
and<00:01:17.830> then<00:01:17.950> fall<00:01:18.159> into<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.490> sea

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.989 

G<00:01:21.900> chord<00:01:22.260> and<00:01:22.470> usable<00:01:23.070> hammer<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.580> there

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:25.999 

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:29.530 

okay<00:01:26.509> now<00:01:26.719> the<00:01:26.780> next<00:01:27.649> part<00:01:27.799> would<00:01:27.920> be<00:01:27.979> a

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
okay now the next part would be a

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.300 
okay now the next part would be a

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.490 

see

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.810 

now<00:01:40.400> this<00:01:40.610> Court

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
now this Court

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.910 
now this Court
this<00:01:43.600> is<00:01:43.720> an<00:01:43.870> F<00:01:44.080> chord<00:01:44.110> with<00:01:44.560> your<00:01:44.710> thumb

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
this is an F chord with your thumb

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.880 
this is an F chord with your thumb
wrapped<00:01:45.160> around<00:01:45.400> on<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:45.670> bass<00:01:46.560> now<00:01:47.560> major

wrapped around on the bass now major

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.980 
wrapped around on the bass now major
seven<00:01:48.400> so<00:01:49.030> it's<00:01:49.150> like<00:01:49.270> a<00:01:49.300> barre<00:01:49.540> chord<00:01:49.570> but

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
seven so it's like a barre chord but

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.010 
seven so it's like a barre chord but
you're<00:01:50.140> leaving<00:01:50.410> the<00:01:50.500> first<00:01:50.830> string<00:01:51.130> open

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
if you can't wrap your thumb around the

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.770 
if you can't wrap your thumb around the
alternate<00:01:54.790> version<00:01:54.820> wouldn't<00:01:55.180> be<00:01:55.240> just<00:01:55.450> to<00:01:55.630> do

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
alternate version wouldn't be just to do

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.680 
alternate version wouldn't be just to do
it<00:01:55.900> through<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.710> same<00:01:57.130> chord<00:01:57.430> three<00:01:57.760> there
