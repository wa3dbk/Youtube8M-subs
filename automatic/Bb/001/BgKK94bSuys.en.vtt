00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.870
 good today I bring you to establish this 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.690
 crisis where his voice and that in this case 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.420
 she hit me muffin boy because he's 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.789
 based on that on this side of carte d'or 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.220
 to discover it's terrible that it's called 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.200
 well crashed chip muffin and knows how to 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.540
 cupcake with chocolate pancakes 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.070
 that comes is the trade then only 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.010
 lessons I leave you with the recipe 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.900
 party lesson of choco chip muffin and 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.669
 nothing that is very easy and I hope that you 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.380
 like then I'm saying the ingredients 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.570
 over the sea 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.070
 and I'm going to use this mixer that 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.480
 congregate in the field but download 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.020
 football and all these sites at a level 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.750
 of this type and let's start I'm going to 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.850
 use chocolate shake first 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.280
 anyone I found is called soler and 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.120
 say ok they hear but the brand that 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.610
 you want and I'll take about 150 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.980
 milliliters also depend for when 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.110
 you want to do but good for me in 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.110
 this case with 150 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.390
 What is it 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.570
 to advertise as it is very 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.250
 good and it's called 'choco' chic 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.650
 and know if like a little more end of 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.130
 support and that's why it's called assists 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.620
 this is very useful so back as 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.410
 three well- venerable balls of 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.040
 expected as you can see bits of a lot and 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.040
 above 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.110
 like 3 balls 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.920
 I doubt these things that we do 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.409
 brightness 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.090
 and such 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.330
 aside now what is only one 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.970
 legend of these cookie type of chips 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.659
 now or the brand who you want so 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.659
 parties 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.259
 and a trickle of the question because it 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.900
 will give as more thickness of shakes if 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.349
 you want it longer but if you want a 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.349
 a little more 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.830
 you go and get there 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.750
 Well, we have it already, we are not going 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.750
 to put now in the glass I have 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.280
 and let's have our shake there 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.870
 there for example and now you can get there 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:52.969
 the most if you want but I prefer now 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.969
 put a little cream on top 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:02.459
 a cookie from there 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:05.340
 be attentive to the subject you put it like this and a 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.950
 page with would already be if it presented a 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.599
 have to be beaten cream shake the 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.670
 cookie that gives the touch and knows 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.590
 very rich so I do not expect anything 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.940
 like you to do and theme what you put 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.940
 here under a little kiss
