00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
at vertical motion yeah this is

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.060 
at vertical motion yeah this is
potentially<00:00:40.710> 20<00:00:41.250> attic<00:00:41.460> here<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.750> great

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
potentially 20 attic here this is great

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.040 
potentially 20 attic here this is great
okay<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.219> are<00:00:44.250> parked<00:00:44.700> what<00:00:45.059> are<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.180> at<00:00:45.390> we're

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
okay we are parked what are we at we're

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.430 
okay we are parked what are we at we're
just<00:00:46.680> we're<00:00:47.190> about<00:00:47.340> six<00:00:47.670> miles<00:00:47.879> south<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
just we're about six miles south of the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.340 
just we're about six miles south of the
kansas-nebraska<00:00:49.860> border<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.850> 25<00:00:51.480> there's<00:00:52.289> a

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
kansas-nebraska border on 25 there's a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.020 
kansas-nebraska border on 25 there's a
gravel<00:00:52.770> road<00:00:52.800> just<00:00:53.190> behind<00:00:53.489> us<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:53.940> can

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
gravel road just behind us so we can

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.970 
gravel road just behind us so we can
escape<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> east<00:00:54.750> wrong<00:00:55.140> England<00:00:55.590> motion

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
escape to the east wrong England motion

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.889 
escape to the east wrong England motion
there<00:00:56.190> yeah<00:00:56.579> back<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.210> flank<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.629> think

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
there yeah back on the flank I think

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.630 
there yeah back on the flank I think
these<00:00:58.140> downward<00:00:58.649> motion<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.430> tornado

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
these downward motion with the tornado

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.549 
these downward motion with the tornado
would<00:00:59.910> be<00:01:00.030> over<00:01:00.210> here<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.629> east<00:01:00.870> ok<00:01:01.379> here

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
would be over here to the east ok here

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.709 
would be over here to the east ok here
we<00:01:01.590> go<00:01:01.680> for<00:01:02.039> another<00:01:02.100> gust<00:01:02.550> forgetting<00:01:03.359> really

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
we go for another gust forgetting really

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.770 
we go for another gust forgetting really
really

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.390
