00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:10.179 
I'm going to repeat this process two

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:13.529 
I'm going to repeat this process two
more<00:01:10.210> times<00:01:10.829> between<00:01:11.829> the<00:01:12.159> ring<00:01:12.520> and<00:01:12.640> middle

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719 
finger and then of course ending with

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.770 
finger and then of course ending with
the<00:01:16.810> index<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.490> index<00:01:18.880> finger<00:01:18.969> side<00:01:19.420> I

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
the index on the index finger side I

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.690 
the index on the index finger side I
don't<00:01:20.350> need<00:01:20.469> to<00:01:20.560> wrap<00:01:20.740> around<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.340> finger

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
don't need to wrap around the finger

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.039 
don't need to wrap around the finger
this<00:01:21.819> way<00:01:21.880> I<00:01:22.179> find<00:01:22.539> that<00:01:22.600> it<00:01:22.689> comes<00:01:22.869> unraveled

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
this way I find that it comes unraveled

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.260 
this way I find that it comes unraveled
so<00:01:23.859> what<00:01:23.979> I<00:01:24.009> do<00:01:24.100> is<00:01:24.280> I<00:01:24.369> go<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.609> far<00:01:24.909> pinky

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
so what I do is I go to the far pinky

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.440 
so what I do is I go to the far pinky
side<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:25.749> then<00:01:26.259> wrap<00:01:26.439> around<00:01:26.710> it<00:01:26.859> that<00:01:26.889> way

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
side and then wrap around it that way

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.580 
side and then wrap around it that way
now<00:01:28.450> that<00:01:28.600> I've<00:01:28.689> gone<00:01:28.810> through<00:01:28.899> each<00:01:29.170> finger

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
now that I've gone through each finger

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.109 
now that I've gone through each finger
and<00:01:29.740> I<00:01:29.889> pull<00:01:30.100> my<00:01:30.249> hand<00:01:30.460> one<00:01:30.579> more<00:01:30.639> time<00:01:30.759> to<00:01:30.999> make

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
and I pull my hand one more time to make

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.109 
and I pull my hand one more time to make
sure<00:01:31.270> it's<00:01:31.420> not<00:01:31.569> too<00:01:31.749> tight<00:01:32.159> from<00:01:33.159> here<00:01:33.429> I<00:01:33.639> come

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119

especially on my jabbing hands like this

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.849 
especially on my jabbing hands like this
extra<00:01:43.209> support<00:01:43.329> the<00:01:43.659> risk<00:01:43.840> is<00:01:44.020> that<00:01:44.229> hand<00:01:44.709> gets

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:44.859 
extra support the risk is that hand gets

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:47.969 
extra support the risk is that hand gets
hit<00:01:45.609> a<00:01:45.639> lot<00:01:45.700> more<00:01:46.029> than<00:01:46.179> the<00:01:46.270> other<00:01:46.299> hand<00:01:46.979> and
