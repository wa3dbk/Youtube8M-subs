you'd<00:02:00.569> know<00:02:00.749> how<00:02:00.899> difficult<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.679> can<00:02:01.799> be<00:02:01.979> to

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
you'd know how difficult that can be to

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.870 
you'd know how difficult that can be to
get<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.399> some<00:02:02.669> really<00:02:02.880> precise<00:02:03.239> accuracy

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
get a some really precise accuracy

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.309 
get a some really precise accuracy
speaking<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.969> accuracy<00:02:06.359> some<00:02:06.869> little<00:02:07.169> hooks

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
speaking of accuracy some little hooks

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.249 
speaking of accuracy some little hooks
at<00:02:07.559> all<00:02:07.709> I<00:02:08.269> made<00:02:09.269> some<00:02:09.569> people<00:02:09.719> may<00:02:09.899> not<00:02:09.959> like

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
at all I made some people may not like

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.080 
at all I made some people may not like
as<00:02:10.439> the<00:02:10.590> sides<00:02:10.829> it's<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.129> ramp<00:02:11.400> steel<00:02:11.760> front

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
so not much in the way of sights but

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.580 
so not much in the way of sights but

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
so that you can swing the cylinder out

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.130 
so that you can swing the cylinder out
you<00:03:16.849> push<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.239> in<00:03:17.360> just<00:03:17.599> like<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:17.750> would<00:03:17.989> any

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
you push it in just like you would any

other revolver push it forward and it's

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.720 
other revolver push it forward and it's
a<00:03:20.480> little<00:03:20.900> bit<00:03:21.170> stiff<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:22.070> get<00:03:22.220> that<00:03:22.370> to<00:03:22.489> swing

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
a little bit stiff to get that to swing

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.870 
a little bit stiff to get that to swing
out<00:03:22.910> but<00:03:23.230> once<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.380> gets<00:03:24.470> past<00:03:24.620> that<00:03:25.010> point<00:03:25.190> it

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880

if<00:04:03.950> you<00:04:04.159> do<00:04:04.340> have<00:04:04.579> fragile<00:04:05.329> hands<00:04:05.900> it<00:04:06.109> absorb

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
if you do have fragile hands it absorb

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.080 
if you do have fragile hands it absorb
some<00:04:06.739> of<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:06.890> shock<00:04:06.920> they<00:04:07.340> do<00:04:07.400> make<00:04:07.639> the<00:04:07.790> wood

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090

revolver and you want to conceal carry

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.909 
revolver and you want to conceal carry
definitely<00:04:53.720> going<00:04:53.960> with<00:04:54.139> something<00:04:54.440> like<00:04:54.620> a<00:04:54.650> J

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
definitely going with something like a J

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.350 
definitely going with something like a J
frame<00:04:55.190> you<00:04:55.370> might<00:04:55.550> want<00:04:55.760> to<00:04:55.789> step<00:04:56.030> up<00:04:56.150> and<00:04:56.270> get

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
frame you might want to step up and get

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.920 
frame you might want to step up and get
a<00:04:56.419> 357<00:04:57.199> but<00:04:57.830> when<00:04:58.010> you're<00:04:58.130> getting<00:04:58.370> a<00:04:58.430> snubnose

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
a 357 but when you're getting a snubnose

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.870 
a 357 but when you're getting a snubnose
you're<00:04:59.930> really<00:05:00.260> sacrificing<00:05:01.130> a<00:05:01.250> lot<00:05:01.520> of<00:05:01.699> power

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
you're really sacrificing a lot of power

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.290 
you're really sacrificing a lot of power
out<00:05:02.180> of<00:05:02.210> a<00:05:02.330> 357<00:05:03.729> so<00:05:04.729> basically<00:05:05.090> you're

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
out of a 357 so basically you're

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.180 
out of a 357 so basically you're
mitigating<00:05:05.810> that<00:05:05.870> 357<00:05:06.650> to<00:05:06.710> nothing<00:05:06.979> more<00:05:07.130> than

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
mitigating that 357 to nothing more than

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.980 
mitigating that 357 to nothing more than
a<00:05:07.400> 38<00:05:07.789> special<00:05:08.240> +<00:05:09.229> PG<00:05:09.590> round<00:05:10.630> you<00:05:11.630> had<00:05:11.750> a<00:05:11.780> few

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
a 38 special + PG round you had a few

a 38 special + PG round you had a few
more<00:05:12.139> inches<00:05:12.289> onto<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:12.650> barrel<00:05:12.949> you<00:05:13.010> can

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
more inches onto the barrel you can

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.040 
more inches onto the barrel you can
really<00:05:13.490> get<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.240> power<00:05:14.449> out<00:05:14.990> of<00:05:15.050> a<00:05:15.229> 357<00:05:17.050> magnum

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
before the bullet leaves the barrel but

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:21.670 
before the bullet leaves the barrel but
on<00:05:20.659> something<00:05:20.990> like<00:05:21.080> this

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
on something like this

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.189

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 
titanium built into the frame then I

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.700 
titanium built into the frame then I
think<00:06:34.550> they<00:06:34.639> also<00:06:34.790> got<00:06:35.090> one<00:06:35.360> that's<00:06:35.540> got<00:06:36.530> the

think they also got one that's got the

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.129 
think they also got one that's got the
