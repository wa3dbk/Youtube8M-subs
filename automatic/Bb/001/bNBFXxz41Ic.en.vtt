space<00:01:04.900> combat

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
space combat

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.300 
space combat
it's<00:01:06.390> balancing<00:01:07.200> power<00:01:07.680> between<00:01:08.040> your

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
it's balancing power between your

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.789 
it's balancing power between your
subsystems<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.390> balancing<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.229> shields

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
subsystems it's balancing of shields

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.050 
subsystems it's balancing of shields
it's<00:01:11.400> getting<00:01:12.000> talks<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.720> your<00:01:13.080> condition

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.499 

and<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:19.020> think<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.649> it<00:01:20.460> works<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:21.000> lot<00:01:21.149> BAM

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
and so I think that it works a lot BAM

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.200 
and so I think that it works a lot BAM
and<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.530> feels<00:01:23.040> right<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.430> do<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> primary

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
and it just feels right to do a primary

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.970 
and it just feels right to do a primary
the<00:01:24.329> strategic<00:01:24.930> person

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
the strategic person

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.720 
the strategic person
give<00:01:27.220> away<00:01:27.400> in<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.790> battle<00:01:28.150> take<00:01:28.450> your

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
give away in the battle take your

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:37.150 
give away in the battle take your
on<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.150> side<00:01:30.450> under<00:01:30.900> the
