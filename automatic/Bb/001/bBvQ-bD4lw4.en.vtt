00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.130
 the sewer of the neighborhood 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.199
 contrary to what many think the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.430
 large dubai buildings do not have 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.010
 Sewerage 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.590
 burj khalifa one of the largest buildings in 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.109
 city ​​and the world has precarious method 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.680
 to bring the project to be difficult until 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.680
 treatment plants 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.610
 when we look at the great images of 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.990
 dubai city Burj khalifa the 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.390
 The printing that's left is from a city 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.730
 extremely logical ones a policy 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.890
 however the municipality located in 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.989
 United Arab Emirates faces a 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.879
 major infrastructure problem to 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.410
 lack of a sewage system to 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.410
 surprises great buildings 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.070
 the solution, not all of it is to use 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.620
 trucks to remove the almost 15 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.300
 tons of sewage produced 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.640
 Days in Vatican 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.440
 dozens of vehicles of the type are 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.240
 loaded with the waste that follows 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.670
 for the sewage treatment plant 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.690
 where they wait in lines to deliver their 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.690
 smelly every 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.190
 the same goes for all the others 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.960
 city ​​buildings 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.870
 the sewage trucks came to stay 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.150
 more than 2014 come back to download 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.790
 most of the time they need to return 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.750
 directly the buildings to cut 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.750
 more mouth 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.159
 about 4000 trucks of conduct 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.110
 mirrors in hole in the sea desert 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.180
 there is also the problem of 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.060
 water distribution levels 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.909
 salinity increased from 32 thousand 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.549
 to 47 thousand parts per million 30 years 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.369
 this number is enough to threaten 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.350
 islam the fauna and f of the local navy 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.240
 it takes an engineering effort 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.520
 environment to solve not only a 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.739
 sewer problem but solve or 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.019
 as water and food 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.150
 It could be made to collect waste 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.670
 by means of piping as is done in the 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.290
 civilized world by pumping into an area 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.290
 of the desert where there would be 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.450
 treatment and composting this process 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.700
 would be made from waste with 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.680
 import any way which is not 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.760
 problem for such a rich and 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.760
 millionaire like dubai 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:43.319
 the sewage system in the paris 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.840
 water treatment in the cities of paris 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.269
 is a sewage system combined with a 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.519
 ducted pipeline system through the 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:03:01.680
 gravity as a place where 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:03:03.569
 people can visit your sewer 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.879
 combined with rainwater and 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.430
 residuals are trained outside 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.340
 through the same pipeline 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.650
 wastewater conveyor 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.060
 to a sewage treatment plant 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.060
 simply by the force of gravity 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.189
 every day a 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.180
 million cubic meters of water 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.909
 served 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.819
 this volume is equivalent to 35 thousand 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:38.400
 trucks and 35 tons of all water 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:42.170
 which supplies the city comes from the Seine and 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.170
 after treated back to win 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.420
 concern about the good quality of 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.250
 water only appeared from the 19th century 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.430
 with the construction of the current 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:06.120
 distribution was projected at 850 by the 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.220
 engineer eugenio grande has 2,400 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.889
 kilometers of tunnels that 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.859
 several interconnected galleries in a museum 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:16.169
 where you visit the sewers of Paris where 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:18.269
 can see the sewage drainage in the 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.199
 avenue bousquet and a manhole in the presence 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.199
 remaining 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.939
 countries availability and 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:38.530
 visits to its sewerage network as a 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:41.849
 tourist attraction that is open to 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.849
 public all year round 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.590
 I do not
