00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
this that you can look at yourself and

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.139 
this that you can look at yourself and
decide<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.430> know<00:00:32.520> if<00:00:32.669> you're<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.850> sort<00:00:33.030> of

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
so the nanosecond after I heard that I

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.260 
so the nanosecond after I heard that I
thought<00:00:58.350> no<00:00:58.829> no<00:00:59.160> that's<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.730> all<00:00:59.789> you're<00:01:00.120> all

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870
