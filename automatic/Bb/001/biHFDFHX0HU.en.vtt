00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.049

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.310
 so many emotions sometimes looks like 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:18.530
 think here I am young came at such a price 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.030
 in this charter and the teacher puts the composition and 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.920
 gives out any gonna get 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.930
 they seem to have invested my whole soul and 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:32.330
 gave all their strength to something like that 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.220
 thank him for all that he 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.030
 invests our profession for what he 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.030
 invests me 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:52.790
 I will say that I really miss this is true 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.650
 I miss because so here 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.819
 tenderly as he treats me and as 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.550
 he came to the comments no one 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:02.270
 But we are all treated like 2 Paul 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.670
 the theater they he always pushes off 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.200
 of what the dancer feel therefore 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.860
 very easy you feel you he 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.750
 adjust 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.370
 but he said that I will not break you 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.220
 because you have your field 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.140
 duality you already have your face and we 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.239
 we will only develop it all he 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.170
 pushes the artist himself 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:24.080
 found in himself those movements that image 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.800
 which is close even sometimes said that 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.630
 can fall 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.019
 but if you fall in the image then no one 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.019
 noticed 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:39.939
 at the premiere of the play The Legend of Love I 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.569
 I thought that and I think that for this 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:43.030
 spectacle 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:46.019
 must meet exactly the same fight vdr 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:52.150
 because it is in his blood pledged 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:55.680
 with some kind of immense desire each 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.840
 day at rehearsals he knocked out he molded and 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.930
 in the end I am so grateful to him because 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.939
 that if it were not for him, I think that in general 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.489
 performance would not work out personally for 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:09.489
 me that the same square stayed here 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.049

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.690

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.459

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.360
