00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
I took this off the brake reservoir for

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:17.200 
I took this off the brake reservoir for
the<00:01:11.359> brake<00:01:11.630> fluid<00:01:13.719> fuse<00:01:14.719> box<00:01:15.759> to<00:01:16.759> my<00:01:16.969> battery

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
the brake fluid fuse box to my battery

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.510 
the brake fluid fuse box to my battery
off<00:01:17.539> on<00:01:17.899> I<00:01:17.960> got<00:01:18.289> a<00:01:18.320> new<00:01:18.530> battery<00:01:18.770> as<00:01:19.009> well<00:01:19.250> and

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
off on I got a new battery as well and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.380 
off on I got a new battery as well and
my<00:01:21.070> distributor<00:01:22.810> that's<00:01:24.640> think<00:01:25.640> it's<00:01:25.850> one

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
my distributor that's think it's one

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.429 
my distributor that's think it's one
bolt<00:01:26.990> right<00:01:27.200> here<00:01:27.560> and<00:01:28.719> another<00:01:29.719> one<00:01:29.990> on<00:01:30.170> that

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
bolt right here and another one on that

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.289 
bolt right here and another one on that
side<00:01:30.499> I'm<00:01:31.490> over<00:01:32.119> here<00:01:32.359> and<00:01:32.630> one<00:01:33.820> right<00:01:34.820> under

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
side I'm over here and one right under

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.319 
side I'm over here and one right under
it<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:38.390> you<00:01:38.450> have<00:01:39.670> you<00:01:40.670> can<00:01:40.820> take<00:01:40.999> all<00:01:41.179> that

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
it and you have you can take all that

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.739 
it and you have you can take all that
off<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:41.840> then<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.829> and<00:01:43.640> of<00:01:44.179> course<00:01:44.479> the

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:44.749 
off and then the and of course the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:48.690 
off and then the and of course the
vacuums<00:01:45.259> just<00:01:46.270> remember<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.479> mark<00:01:47.689> them<00:01:47.990> so

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
vacuums just remember to mark them so

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.459 
vacuums just remember to mark them so
you<00:01:49.700> can<00:01:49.880> know<00:01:49.999> where<00:01:50.210> they<00:01:50.359> go<00:01:50.569> I<00:01:50.840> think

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
you can know where they go I think

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.709 
you can know where they go I think
there's<00:01:51.740> four<00:01:51.829> of<00:01:52.100> them<00:01:52.280> two<00:01:52.729> big<00:01:53.179> ones<00:01:53.359> and

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
there's four of them two big ones and

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:57.999 
there's four of them two big ones and
two<00:01:53.929> smaller<00:01:54.289> ones<00:01:54.969> in<00:01:55.969> the<00:01:56.630> manifold<00:01:57.229> the

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
two smaller ones in the manifold the

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.160 
two smaller ones in the manifold the
manifold<00:01:58.899> there's<00:01:59.899> I<00:02:01.569> have<00:02:02.569> it<00:02:02.749> with<00:02:02.929> those

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
manifold there's I have it with those

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.059 
manifold there's I have it with those
right<00:02:03.499> there

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
right there

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.530 
right there
it's<00:02:04.969> four<00:02:05.329> of<00:02:05.509> them

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
it's four of them

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.310 
it's four of them
and<00:02:07.440> I<00:02:07.890> basically<00:02:08.640> undo<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.210> disconnect<00:02:10.110> it

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
and I basically undo that disconnect it

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.770 
and I basically undo that disconnect it
and<00:02:10.740> once<00:02:11.070> I<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.400> all<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.790> off<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:13.070> good<00:02:14.070> it

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
and once I have all this off I good it

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.560 
and once I have all this off I good it
so<00:02:15.780> we're<00:02:16.050> somewhere<00:02:16.500> right<00:02:16.680> here<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.850> then

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
so we're somewhere right here and then

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.170 
so we're somewhere right here and then
you<00:02:19.440> should<00:02:19.500> be<00:02:19.830> able<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.190> see<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.730> starter

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
you should be able to see the starter

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.940 
you should be able to see the starter
it's<00:02:21.960> right<00:02:22.230> under<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:24.350> I'll<00:02:25.350> see<00:02:25.530> if<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.740> can

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
it's right under this I'll see if I can

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:34.810 
it's right under this I'll see if I can
get<00:02:26.840> there's<00:02:27.840> just<00:02:28.170> two<00:02:28.410> bolts<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.100> undo

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:54.340 

I'll<00:02:35.820> see<00:02:36.030> if<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.240> can<00:02:36.420> get<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:42.920> alright<00:02:43.920> now

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.690 

here's<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.500> starter<00:02:56.270> here's<00:02:57.270> one<00:02:57.750> bolt<00:02:58.700> and

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
here's the starter here's one bolt and

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.810 
here's the starter here's one bolt and
then<00:02:59.880> there<00:03:00.090> should<00:03:00.300> be<00:03:00.450> another<00:03:00.810> one

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
then there should be another one

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.740 
then there should be another one
somewhere<00:03:04.190> there's<00:03:05.190> one<00:03:05.430> bolt<00:03:05.660> should<00:03:06.660> be

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
somewhere there's one bolt should be

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:21.140 
somewhere there's one bolt should be
another<00:03:07.050> one<00:03:07.230> somewhere<00:03:07.530> up<00:03:07.860> there<00:03:20.150> there's

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
another one somewhere up there there's

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.030 
another one somewhere up there there's
connections<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.870> only<00:03:22.110> house<00:03:22.290> is<00:03:22.440> disconnect

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
connections the only house is disconnect

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.560 
connections the only house is disconnect
two<00:03:23.160> of<00:03:23.340> them<00:03:23.519> there's<00:03:23.910> three<00:03:24.180> but<00:03:24.360> you<00:03:24.450> only

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
two of them there's three but you only

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.660 
two of them there's three but you only
disconnect<00:03:25.200> two<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:28.070> so<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.160> can<00:03:29.340> take<00:03:29.519> it

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
disconnect two and so you can take it

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.360 
disconnect two and so you can take it
off<00:03:29.790> from<00:03:29.970> here<00:03:30.360> if<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.800> can<00:03:32.010> take<00:03:32.190> the

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
off from here if you can take the

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.420 
off from here if you can take the
exhaust<00:03:32.730> off<00:03:33.560> because<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.800> exhaust<00:03:35.100> goes

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
exhaust off because the exhaust goes

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.400 
exhaust off because the exhaust goes
runs<00:03:35.880> through<00:03:36.150> here<00:03:36.360> like<00:03:36.510> this<00:03:36.840> then<00:03:37.200> goes

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
runs through here like this then goes

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.640 
runs through here like this then goes
out<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:38.190> over<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:40.080> it'll<00:03:40.350> be<00:03:40.530> in<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.890> way<00:03:42.650> and

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
out and over and it'll be in the way and

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.740 
out and over and it'll be in the way and
then<00:03:44.160> you<00:03:44.280> can't<00:03:44.610> reach<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:45.120> other<00:03:45.300> Bowl<00:03:45.570> I

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
then you can't reach the other Bowl I

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.400 
then you can't reach the other Bowl I
don't<00:03:45.959> know<00:03:46.050> it<00:03:46.170> might<00:03:46.320> be<00:03:46.440> easier<00:03:46.800> down<00:03:47.040> here

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
don't know it might be easier down here

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.140 
don't know it might be easier down here
but<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:49.440> really<00:03:49.800> don't<00:03:49.980> like<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.340> be<00:03:50.400> under<00:03:50.730> cars

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
but I really don't like to be under cars

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.330 
but I really don't like to be under cars
which<00:03:51.480> I<00:03:51.720> am<00:03:51.900> right<00:03:52.140> now<00:03:52.320> but<00:03:52.560> anyways<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:55.739> see

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
which I am right now but anyways and see

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.520 
which I am right now but anyways and see
there's<00:03:56.610> here's<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.410> intake<00:03:58.410> manifold<00:04:00.530> and

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
there's here's a intake manifold and

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.470 
there's here's a intake manifold and
like<00:04:01.800> I<00:04:01.950> said<00:04:02.250> oh<00:04:02.489> and<00:04:02.550> then<00:04:03.060> there's<00:04:03.269> one

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
like I said oh and then there's one

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.890 
like I said oh and then there's one
right<00:04:03.660> here<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:04.080> leave<00:04:04.500> disconnect<00:04:05.660> you<00:04:06.660> just

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
right here to leave disconnect you just

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.520 
right here to leave disconnect you just
maneuver<00:04:07.350> that<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:07.830> way<00:04:09.080> but<00:04:10.080> it<00:04:10.200> looks<00:04:10.380> like

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
maneuver that that way but it looks like

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.890 
maneuver that that way but it looks like
it<00:04:10.709> might<00:04:10.830> be<00:04:11.010> easier<00:04:11.370> from<00:04:11.670> down<00:04:11.910> here

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.789 

and<00:04:15.590> see<00:04:15.890> there's<00:04:16.100> my<00:04:16.340> anyone<00:04:18.760> costed<00:04:19.760> me<00:04:19.820> a

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
and see there's my anyone costed me a

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.100 
and see there's my anyone costed me a
hundred<00:04:21.799> and<00:04:21.949> sixty<00:04:22.460> at<00:04:22.610> NAPA<00:04:25.479> but<00:04:26.479> however

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
hundred and sixty at NAPA but however

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.540 
hundred and sixty at NAPA but however
you<00:04:27.350> want<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.710> remove<00:04:28.040> it

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
you want to remove it

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.370 
you want to remove it
either<00:04:28.760> way<00:04:29.030> it's<00:04:29.300> about<00:04:29.750> would<00:04:29.930> believe<00:04:30.199> it's

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
either way it's about would believe it's

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.580 
either way it's about would believe it's
a<00:04:30.500> pain<00:04:30.880> and<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.419> bolts<00:04:32.780> were<00:04:32.870> pretty<00:04:33.110> easy<00:04:33.350> to

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
a pain and the bolts were pretty easy to

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.650 
a pain and the bolts were pretty easy to
take<00:04:33.800> off<00:04:34.010> connections<00:04:34.729> and<00:04:35.000> all<00:04:35.120> that<00:04:35.360> is

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
take off connections and all that is

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.400 
take off connections and all that is
just<00:04:35.690> getting<00:04:36.410> it<00:04:36.530> out<00:04:37.720> and<00:04:38.720> like<00:04:38.900> I<00:04:38.930> said<00:04:39.229> it<00:04:39.380> a

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
just getting it out and like I said it a

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:47.020 
just getting it out and like I said it a
part<00:04:39.710> of<00:04:39.740> it<00:04:39.860> easier<00:04:40.280> if<00:04:40.760> you<00:04:40.970> have<00:04:41.210> like<00:04:46.030> Aaron

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
part of it easier if you have like Aaron

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.439 
part of it easier if you have like Aaron
pad<00:04:47.300> gun<00:04:47.979> and<00:04:48.979> you<00:04:49.070> just<00:04:49.280> take<00:04:49.550> these<00:04:50.030> four

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
pad gun and you just take these four

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.840 
pad gun and you just take these four
bolts<00:04:50.720> off<00:04:51.080> and<00:04:51.500> then<00:04:52.070> there<00:04:52.250> should<00:04:52.400> be<00:04:52.430> more

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
bolts off and then there should be more

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.439 
bolts off and then there should be more
up<00:04:53.150> here<00:04:53.479> once<00:04:53.840> you<00:04:53.990> get<00:04:54.289> connected<00:04:54.830> and<00:04:55.449> then

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
up here once you get connected and then

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.840 
up here once you get connected and then
you<00:04:56.570> take<00:04:56.810> this<00:04:57.020> off<00:04:57.289> and<00:04:57.650> so<00:04:58.130> you<00:04:58.160> can<00:04:58.490> work<00:04:58.699> in

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
you take this off and so you can work in

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.840 
you take this off and so you can work in
here<00:04:59.060> nice<00:04:59.419> and<00:04:59.660> comfortably<00:05:00.280> but<00:05:01.280> I<00:05:01.310> didn't<00:05:01.669> I
