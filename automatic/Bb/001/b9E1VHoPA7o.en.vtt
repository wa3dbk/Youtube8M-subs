incidents we're also able to talk to the
flag<00:01:30.750> marshals<00:01:31.229> if<00:01:31.350> we<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.619> any

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
flag marshals if we have any

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.380 
flag marshals if we have any
instructions<00:01:32.189> special<00:01:32.820> instructions<00:01:33.329> for

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
instructions special instructions for

the<00:01:33.570> flag<00:01:33.750> marshals<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.799> then<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.100> have<00:01:35.310> two

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
the flag marshals and then we have two

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.340 
the flag marshals and then we have two
loggers<00:01:35.939> here<00:01:36.180> they<00:01:36.689> record<00:01:37.079> all<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
loggers here they record all the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.899 
loggers here they record all the
communications<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.640> an<00:01:38.759> accurate

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
communications so we have an accurate

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.510 
communications so we have an accurate
log<00:01:39.360> at<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.540> time<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.170> what<00:01:40.619> actions<00:01:41.009> have

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
log at the time and what actions have

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.980 
log at the time and what actions have
been<00:01:41.640> taken<00:01:42.060> during<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.329> race<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.720> if<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:42.869> have

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
been taken during the race so if we have

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.469 
been taken during the race so if we have
a<00:01:43.020> serious<00:01:43.439> incident<00:01:43.619> for<00:01:44.070> example<00:01:44.549> we<00:01:45.329> have

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
a serious incident for example we have

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.719 
a serious incident for example we have
all<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.720> information<00:01:46.189> to<00:01:47.189> hand

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.460 
we tried to do is to always pick up the

for a short period leaders coming at the
appropriate<00:03:58.710> point<00:03:59.010> dispatch<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.030> safety

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
car safety car goes onto the circuit we

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.210 
car safety car goes onto the circuit we
capture<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.510> field<00:04:03.780> we<00:04:04.500> get<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.800> field<00:04:05.040> under

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220

capture the field we get the field under
control<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:06.060> then<00:04:06.630> we<00:04:06.660> have<00:04:06.960> if<00:04:07.110> it's<00:04:07.290> a

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350

would<00:04:11.010> be<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.130> recovery<00:04:11.490> in<00:04:11.910> terms<00:04:11.940> of<00:04:12.420> picking

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
would be a recovery in terms of picking

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.370 
would be a recovery in terms of picking
up<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.380> vehicle<00:04:13.800> and<00:04:13.980> we<00:04:14.430> also<00:04:15.360> be<00:04:15.810> actioning

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
up the vehicle and we also be actioning

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.460 
up the vehicle and we also be actioning
that<00:04:16.640> with<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:17.790> tracking<00:04:18.060> system<00:04:18.420> we're<00:04:19.320> able

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
that with the tracking system we're able

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.770 
that with the tracking system we're able
to<00:04:19.980> see<00:04:20.310> where<00:04:20.520> the<00:04:20.549> cars<00:04:20.880> are<00:04:21.060> on<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.359> circuit

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
to see where the cars are on the circuit

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.170 
to see where the cars are on the circuit
so<00:04:21.960> we<00:04:21.989> can<00:04:22.200> then<00:04:22.350> safely<00:04:22.620> dispatch<00:04:23.280> marshals

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
so we can then safely dispatch marshals

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.120 
so we can then safely dispatch marshals
trackside<00:04:24.600> marshals<00:04:25.140> onto<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.530> circuit

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
trackside marshals onto the circuit

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.450 
trackside marshals onto the circuit
so<00:04:26.610> they're<00:04:26.790> not<00:04:26.940> having<00:04:27.240> to<00:04:27.420> risk<00:04:28.280> going<00:04:29.280> on

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
so they're not having to risk going on

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.670 
so they're not having to risk going on
to<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.670> track<00:04:29.910> with<00:04:30.060> cars<00:04:30.330> approaching<00:04:30.750> okay

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
to the track with cars approaching okay

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.980 
to the track with cars approaching okay
well<00:04:32.280> we've<00:04:32.580> just<00:04:32.610> shown<00:04:33.000> some<00:04:33.360> footage<00:04:33.780> of

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
well we've just shown some footage of

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.230 
well we've just shown some footage of
the<00:04:34.340> TV<00:04:35.340> monitors<00:04:35.820> which<00:04:36.920> is<00:04:37.920> selected<00:04:38.490> for<00:04:39.090> us

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
the TV monitors which is selected for us

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.580 
the TV monitors which is selected for us
that<00:04:39.510> their<00:04:39.660> feeds<00:04:39.930> from<00:04:40.200> the<00:04:40.290> various

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
that their feeds from the various

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.530 
that their feeds from the various
cameras<00:04:40.920> around<00:04:41.160> the<00:04:41.340> circuit<00:04:41.790> so<00:04:42.390> we

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
cameras around the circuit so we

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.880 
cameras around the circuit so we
actually<00:04:42.720> have<00:04:42.990> full<00:04:43.230> coverage<00:04:43.470> of<00:04:43.740> the

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
actually have full coverage of the

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.010 
actually have full coverage of the
circuit<00:04:44.340> here<00:04:45.090> and<00:04:45.240> race<00:04:45.390> control<00:04:45.690> so<00:04:45.930> we

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
circuit here and race control so we

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.990 
circuit here and race control so we
don't<00:04:46.200> and<00:04:46.410> we<00:04:46.740> don't<00:04:47.340> have<00:04:47.460> to<00:04:47.610> look<00:04:47.760> out<00:04:47.880> the

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
don't and we don't have to look out the

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.300 
don't and we don't have to look out the
window<00:04:48.170> so<00:04:49.170> basically<00:04:49.560> what<00:04:49.800> you've<00:04:49.950> got<00:04:50.100> here

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
window so basically what you've got here

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.480 
window so basically what you've got here
is<00:04:50.490> a<00:04:50.520> big<00:04:50.790> team<00:04:51.090> not<00:04:51.960> only<00:04:51.990> out<00:04:52.530> on<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.950> track

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
is a big team not only out on the track

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.390 
is a big team not only out on the track
side<00:04:53.790> but<00:04:54.360> also<00:04:54.510> within<00:04:55.110> race<00:04:55.410> control<00:04:55.950> that
