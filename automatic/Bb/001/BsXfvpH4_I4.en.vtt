about<00:00:18.359> how<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.779> leather<00:00:19.170> was<00:00:19.380> colored<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.830> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
about how the leather was colored in the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.000 
first place while this is an exaggerated
case<00:00:23.550> it's<00:00:23.850> not<00:00:24.029> an<00:00:24.150> unusual<00:00:24.750> situation<00:00:25.010> that

case it's not an unusual situation that

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.220 
case it's not an unusual situation that
we<00:00:26.099> see<00:00:26.279> commonly<00:00:26.730> with<00:00:27.480> leather<00:00:27.750> furniture

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
we see commonly with leather furniture

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.960 
we see commonly with leather furniture
that<00:00:28.380> it's<00:00:28.500> got<00:00:28.650> some<00:00:28.830> age<00:00:29.039> on<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.849> this

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
that it's got some age on it in this

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.790 
that it's got some age on it in this
particular<00:00:30.179> case<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.929> leather<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.289> actually

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
particular case the leather is actually

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.950 
particular case the leather is actually
only<00:00:31.980> about<00:00:32.070> two<00:00:32.430> years<00:00:32.640> old<00:00:32.969> however<00:00:33.690> it's

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
only about two years old however it's

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.260 
only about two years old however it's
heavily<00:00:34.350> heavily<00:00:34.649> used<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.790> we've<00:00:36.000> seen

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
heavily heavily used and so we've seen

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.510 
heavily heavily used and so we've seen
sort<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.660> an<00:00:36.750> accelerated<00:00:37.530> version<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:38.190> print

account<00:00:38.670> failure<00:00:39.120> with<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.420> piece<00:00:39.690> but<00:00:40.530> on

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
account failure with this piece but on

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.830 
account failure with this piece but on
to<00:00:40.890> first<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.820> description<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.420> how<00:00:42.540> leather

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
to first the description of how leather

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.100 
to first the description of how leather
is<00:00:43.020> colored<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:45.149> way<00:00:45.270> leather<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.719> colored

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
is colored so the way leather is colored

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.170 
is colored so the way leather is colored
starts<00:00:46.440> out<00:00:46.590> with<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.770> dying<00:00:47.129> process<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
starts out with a dying process the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.569 
starts out with a dying process the
hides<00:00:48.570> are<00:00:49.020> dipped<00:00:49.500> into<00:00:49.680> vats<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.219> heated

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
hides are dipped into vats of heated

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.639 
hides are dipped into vats of heated
died<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.210> died<00:00:51.480> permeates<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.230> cellular

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
died and that died permeates a cellular

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.680 
died and that died permeates a cellular
structure<00:00:53.100> from<00:00:53.579> front<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.030> back<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.360> and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
structure from front to back and and

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.689 
structure from front to back and and
that<00:00:54.809> becomes<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> color<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> inside<00:00:56.670> of

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
that becomes the color on the inside of

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.729 
that becomes the color on the inside of
the<00:00:57.090> leather<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.899> let<00:00:58.079> me<00:00:58.170> show<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.379> what<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the leather so let me show you what the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.189 
the leather so let me show you what the
color<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.000> piece<00:01:00.270> what<00:01:01.050> we

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
color of that is on this piece what we

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.619 
color of that is on this piece what we
do<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:01.739> simply<00:01:02.070> take<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.309> look<00:01:02.699> at<00:01:03.120> with<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
do is we simply take a look at with the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.299 
do is we simply take a look at with the
color<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.229> inside<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.920> leather<00:01:05.129> is

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
color of the inside of the leather is

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.609 
color of the inside of the leather is
and<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.700> determines<00:01:06.270> or<00:01:06.510> tells<00:01:07.080> us<00:01:07.260> what<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
and that determines or tells us what the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.609 
and that determines or tells us what the
color<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> leather<00:01:08.280> was<00:01:08.549> dyed<00:01:09.140> now<00:01:10.140> in

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
color of the leather was dyed now in

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.370 
color of the leather was dyed now in
this<00:01:11.130> particular<00:01:11.340> piece<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.330> next<00:01:12.720> layer<00:01:13.049> of

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
this particular piece the next layer of

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.740 
this particular piece the next layer of
color<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:14.040> actually<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.610> pigmented<00:01:15.210> coating

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
color is actually a pigmented coating

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.649 
color is actually a pigmented coating
that<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.020> call<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.409> base<00:01:16.740> coat<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.880> base<00:01:18.240> coat

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
that we call the base coat the base coat

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.890 
that we call the base coat the base coat
then<00:01:19.080> creates<00:01:19.830> one<00:01:20.250> uniform<00:01:21.060> monochromatic

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
then creates one uniform monochromatic

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.140 
then creates one uniform monochromatic
look<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.650> all<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.130> other<00:01:23.250> surfaces<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.060> in

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
look of all the other surfaces and in

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.810 
look of all the other surfaces and in
this<00:01:24.240> particular<00:01:24.450> case<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.950> base<00:01:26.250> coat<00:01:26.610> is

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
this particular case the base coat is

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.859 
this particular case the base coat is
what<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.210> see<00:01:27.509> here<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.439> yellowish<00:01:29.070> color

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
what we see here is this yellowish color

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.399 
what we see here is this yellowish color
now<00:01:30.869> over<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.799> top<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:34.110> print

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
now over the top of that is the print

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.310 
now over the top of that is the print
coat<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.549> print<00:01:35.850> coat<00:01:36.060> then<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.840> applied

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
coat so the print coat then is applied

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.950 
coat so the print coat then is applied
in<00:01:37.350> an<00:01:37.740> erratic<00:01:38.189> fashion<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:39.210> creates<00:01:39.750> a

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
in an erratic fashion that creates a

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.980 
in an erratic fashion that creates a
modeled<00:01:40.829> or<00:01:41.040> color<00:01:41.310> variation<00:01:42.030> affect<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
modeled or color variation affect the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.899 
modeled or color variation affect the
whole<00:01:43.200> objective<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.280> give<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.670> leather

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
whole objective is to give the leather

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.899 
whole objective is to give the leather
sort<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.360> an<00:01:45.479> organic<00:01:45.899> look<00:01:46.439> as<00:01:46.710> leather<00:01:47.640> would

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
sort of an organic look as leather would

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.300 
sort of an organic look as leather would
be<00:01:48.090> looking<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.140> way<00:01:49.320> if<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.649> was<00:01:49.829> strictly<00:01:50.130> a

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
be looking that way if it was strictly a

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.460 
be looking that way if it was strictly a
dyed<00:01:50.700> leather<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.290> particular

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
dyed leather and so in this particular

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.649 
dyed leather and so in this particular
case<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.310> create<00:01:53.670> all<00:01:53.880> kinds<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.299> fancy

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
case you can create all kinds of fancy

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.929 
case you can create all kinds of fancy
looks<00:01:55.170> by<00:01:55.439> doing<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.640> sense<00:01:56.880> that

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
looks by doing that in the sense that

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.330 
looks by doing that in the sense that
you<00:01:57.030> can<00:01:57.270> also<00:01:57.360> create<00:01:57.810> antiquing<00:01:58.710> effects<00:01:59.100> in

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
you can also create antiquing effects in

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.090 
you can also create antiquing effects in
this<00:01:59.490> kind

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
this kind

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.429 
this kind
but<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.729> objective<00:02:01.240> is<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.420> color<00:02:01.780> variation

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
but the objective is a color variation

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.320 
but the objective is a color variation
where<00:02:02.619> you<00:02:02.740> have<00:02:02.950> a<00:02:02.979> base<00:02:03.369> color<00:02:03.670> of

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
where you have a base color of

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.300 
where you have a base color of
monochromatic<00:02:04.810> yellow<00:02:05.470> in<00:02:05.680> this<00:02:05.799> case<00:02:06.040> and

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
monochromatic yellow in this case and

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.600 
monochromatic yellow in this case and
then<00:02:06.759> over<00:02:07.000> that<00:02:07.299> a<00:02:07.540> darker<00:02:08.110> color<00:02:08.380> that<00:02:09.160> then

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
then over that a darker color that then

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.400 
then over that a darker color that then
is<00:02:09.819> the<00:02:10.000> interplay<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.660> two<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:11.080> creates

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
is the interplay of the two that creates

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.830 
is the interplay of the two that creates
the<00:02:11.470> color<00:02:11.680> that<00:02:11.860> you<00:02:11.890> see<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:13.150> let's<00:02:13.600> review

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
the color that you see so let's review

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.979 
the color that you see so let's review
first<00:02:14.770> it's<00:02:15.100> died<00:02:15.450> then<00:02:16.450> there's<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.810> base

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
first it's died then there's a base

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.050 
first it's died then there's a base
color<00:02:17.260> applied<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.890> all<00:02:18.010> other<00:02:18.280> surfaces<00:02:18.790> that

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
color applied to all other surfaces that

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.030 
color applied to all other surfaces that
it<00:02:19.300> makes<00:02:19.480> it<00:02:19.630> one<00:02:19.810> monochromatic<00:02:20.410> color<00:02:20.770> and

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
it makes it one monochromatic color and

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.370 
it makes it one monochromatic color and
then<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.700> print<00:02:22.090> color<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.569> an<00:02:22.690> overlay<00:02:23.110> color

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
then a print color is an overlay color

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.680 
then a print color is an overlay color
applied<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.130> creates<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.760> modeling<00:02:25.270> effect

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
applied that creates the modeling effect

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.650 
applied that creates the modeling effect
now<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:27.010> fourth<00:02:27.430> step<00:02:27.550> in<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.150> process<00:02:28.360> is

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
now the fourth step in the process is

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.750 
now the fourth step in the process is
really<00:02:29.080> important<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.890> fourth<00:02:30.220> step<00:02:30.340> in<00:02:30.670> the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
really important the fourth step in the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.850 
really important the fourth step in the
process<00:02:30.970> they<00:02:31.390> is<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:32.050> application<00:02:32.200> of<00:02:32.769> a

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
process they is the application of a

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.920 
process they is the application of a
clear<00:02:33.190> coat<00:02:33.370> it's<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.239> clear<00:02:34.510> coat<00:02:34.720> that's

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
clear coat it's the clear coat that's

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.530 
clear coat it's the clear coat that's
the<00:02:35.140> primary<00:02:35.500> protection<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:37.030> clear<00:02:37.330> coat

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
the primary protection the clear coat

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.600 
the primary protection the clear coat
determines<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.350> wearability<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.430> whole

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
determines the wearability of the whole

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.020 
determines the wearability of the whole
system<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:41.019> so<00:02:41.290> in<00:02:41.920> this<00:02:42.160> particular<00:02:42.370> case

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
system and so in this particular case

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.940 
system and so in this particular case
what's<00:02:43.390> happened<00:02:43.780> is<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:44.140> clear<00:02:44.530> coat<00:02:44.769> has

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
what's happened is that clear coat has

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.920 
what's happened is that clear coat has
been<00:02:45.130> eroded<00:02:45.400> away<00:02:45.670> through<00:02:46.120> use<00:02:46.420> or

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
been eroded away through use or

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.979 
been eroded away through use or
sometimes<00:02:47.530> it's<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:47.890> function<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.340> chemistry

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
sometimes it's a function of chemistry

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.949 
sometimes it's a function of chemistry
and<00:02:50.340> once<00:02:51.340> that's<00:02:51.549> done<00:02:51.910> exposing<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.690> print

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
and once that's done exposing the print

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.570 
and once that's done exposing the print
coat<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.380> print<00:02:53.620> coat<00:02:53.769> then<00:02:54.040> where's<00:02:54.280> away

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
coat the print coat then where's away

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.720 
coat the print coat then where's away
very<00:02:54.790> quickly<00:02:54.880> exposing<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.930> base<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:57.340> in

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
very quickly exposing the base so in

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.210 
very quickly exposing the base so in
this<00:02:58.090> particular<00:02:58.269> case<00:02:58.900> right<00:02:59.260> here<00:02:59.290> you<00:03:00.069> have

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
this particular case right here you have

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.670 
this particular case right here you have
print<00:03:00.580> coat<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.330> print<00:03:01.600> coat<00:03:01.780> is<00:03:02.049> still<00:03:02.380> in

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
print coat the print coat is still in

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.370 
print coat the print coat is still in
existing<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.519> some<00:03:03.790> degree<00:03:04.000> but<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.900> top<00:03:05.110> coat

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
existing to some degree but the top coat

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.259 
existing to some degree but the top coat
is<00:03:05.530> gone<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:06.130> so<00:03:06.190> I'm<00:03:06.850> going<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.090> demonstrate

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
is gone and so I'm going to demonstrate

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.580 
is gone and so I'm going to demonstrate
that<00:03:07.870> in<00:03:08.110> just<00:03:08.290> a<00:03:08.470> second<00:03:08.910> bottle<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:09.970> water

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
that in just a second bottle of water

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.830 
that in just a second bottle of water
straight<00:03:11.590> bottle<00:03:11.890> of<00:03:11.980> water<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:13.450> terry

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
straight bottle of water and a terry

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.500 
straight bottle of water and a terry
cloth<00:03:13.930> towel<00:03:14.850> so<00:03:15.850> I'm<00:03:15.940> going<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.180> get<00:03:16.359> the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
cloth towel so I'm going to get the

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.449 
cloth towel so I'm going to get the
terry<00:03:16.720> cloth<00:03:16.780> towel<00:03:17.200> slightly<00:03:17.799> damp<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.370> the

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
terry cloth towel slightly damp to the

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.020 
terry cloth towel slightly damp to the
touch<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:19.150> objective<00:03:19.630> is<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:20.579> as<00:03:21.579> if<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:21.910> was

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
touch the objective is to as if I was

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.060 
touch the objective is to as if I was
going<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.299> do<00:03:22.540> simply<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:22.959> simple<00:03:23.380> wipe<00:03:23.620> down<00:03:23.890> of

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
going to do simply a simple wipe down of

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.250 
going to do simply a simple wipe down of
this<00:03:24.220> piece<00:03:24.430> so<00:03:25.150> now<00:03:25.299> we<00:03:25.359> have<00:03:25.480> some<00:03:25.930> dampness

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
this piece so now we have some dampness

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.280 
this piece so now we have some dampness
in<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.620> towel<00:03:26.829> and<00:03:27.750> what<00:03:28.750> I'm<00:03:28.870> now<00:03:29.019> going<00:03:29.230> to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
in the towel and what I'm now going to

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.550 
in the towel and what I'm now going to
do<00:03:29.440> is<00:03:29.620> I'm<00:03:29.769> going<00:03:29.799> to<00:03:30.040> wait<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.519> tell<00:03:31.560> across

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
do is I'm going to wait to tell across

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.770 
do is I'm going to wait to tell across
the<00:03:32.709> surface<00:03:35.010> there<00:03:36.010> you<00:03:36.190> see<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:37.420> in<00:03:37.690> this

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
the surface there you see so in this

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.360 
the surface there you see so in this
particular<00:03:37.959> case<00:03:38.530> you<00:03:38.590> can<00:03:38.829> see<00:03:38.980> this

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
particular case you can see this

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.039 
particular case you can see this
purplish<00:03:39.970> color<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.510> it's<00:03:40.660> really<00:03:40.840> the

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
purplish color and it's really the

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.810 
purplish color and it's really the
interplay<00:03:41.470> between<00:03:41.500> this<00:03:42.100> color<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:42.489> the

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
interplay between this color and the

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.370 
interplay between this color and the
yellow<00:03:43.150> that<00:03:43.359> creates<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.750> render<00:03:44.079> that<00:03:44.230> we

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
yellow that creates the render that we

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.039 
yellow that creates the render that we
see<00:03:44.590> here<00:03:44.620> so<00:03:45.609> that's<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.540> print<00:03:46.810> color

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
see here so that's the print color

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.440 
see here so that's the print color
that's<00:03:47.260> coming<00:03:47.590> off<00:03:47.739> of<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.980> piece<00:03:48.250> now<00:03:48.970> if<00:03:49.239> I

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
that's coming off of the piece now if I

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.680 
that's coming off of the piece now if I
go<00:03:49.480> over<00:03:49.660> to<00:03:50.670> Sam<00:03:51.670> let's<00:03:51.880> say<00:03:52.060> that<00:03:52.269> same

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
go over to Sam let's say that same

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.500 
go over to Sam let's say that same
project<00:03:53.230> same<00:03:53.799> process<00:03:54.250> get<00:03:54.910> it<00:03:55.030> a<00:03:55.090> little<00:03:55.239> wet

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
project same process get it a little wet

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.500 
project same process get it a little wet
and<00:03:56.670> then<00:03:57.670> I<00:03:57.730> move<00:03:58.030> over<00:03:58.510> here<00:03:58.540> to<00:04:00.180> an<00:04:01.180> area

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
and then I move over here to an area

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.630 
and then I move over here to an area
that<00:04:01.690> hasn't<00:04:02.079> seen<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.620> same<00:04:02.859> wear<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.459> I<00:04:03.579> do

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
that hasn't seen the same wear and I do

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.890 
that hasn't seen the same wear and I do
the<00:04:03.850> same<00:04:03.880> thing<00:04:06.329> nothing<00:04:07.329> comes<00:04:07.510> up<00:04:07.690> and

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
the same thing nothing comes up and

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.920 
the same thing nothing comes up and
that's<00:04:08.470> because<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:09.370> clear<00:04:10.239> coat<00:04:10.419> is<00:04:10.630> still

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
that's because the clear coat is still

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:11.730 
that's because the clear coat is still
intact

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
intact

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.580 
intact
and<00:04:11.920> so<00:04:12.790> in<00:04:13.060> this<00:04:13.210> particular<00:04:13.420> case<00:04:14.080> what's

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
and so in this particular case what's

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.490 
and so in this particular case what's
happening<00:04:15.070> is<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.460> the<00:04:16.150> clear<00:04:17.020> coat<00:04:17.200> has<00:04:17.350> been

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
happening is the the clear coat has been

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.740 
happening is the the clear coat has been
eroded<00:04:17.709> away<00:04:17.950> exposing<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:19.060> print<00:04:19.330> coat<00:04:19.510> the

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
eroded away exposing the print coat the

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.930 
eroded away exposing the print coat the
print<00:04:20.020> coat<00:04:20.200> easily<00:04:21.040> then<00:04:21.220> wipes<00:04:21.520> off<00:04:21.760> with

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
print coat easily then wipes off with

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.240 
print coat easily then wipes off with
just<00:04:22.090> plain<00:04:22.300> water<00:04:22.660> so<00:04:23.530> you<00:04:23.590> can<00:04:23.770> imagine<00:04:24.010> what

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
just plain water so you can imagine what

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.980 
just plain water so you can imagine what
happens<00:04:24.640> if<00:04:24.760> you<00:04:24.850> use<00:04:25.000> a<00:04:25.030> cleaning<00:04:25.420> chemistry

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
happens if you use a cleaning chemistry

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.780 
happens if you use a cleaning chemistry
or<00:04:26.140> something<00:04:26.470> that<00:04:26.590> was<00:04:26.710> harsher<00:04:27.100> it<00:04:27.640> would

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
or something that was harsher it would

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.700 
or something that was harsher it would
be<00:04:27.910> much<00:04:28.060> more<00:04:28.120> dramatic<00:04:28.810> exposing<00:04:29.620> the

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
be much more dramatic exposing the

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.980 
be much more dramatic exposing the
exposing<00:04:30.490> than<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:30.910> base<00:04:31.120> so<00:04:31.510> what's<00:04:31.810> the

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
exposing than the base so what's the

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.200 
exposing than the base so what's the
solution<00:04:32.190> well<00:04:33.190> frankly<00:04:33.730> there's<00:04:33.940> nothing

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
solution well frankly there's nothing

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.520 
solution well frankly there's nothing
wrong<00:04:34.360> with<00:04:34.420> the<00:04:34.600> leather<00:04:34.780> this<00:04:35.050> is<00:04:35.230> strictly

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
wrong with the leather this is strictly

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.620 
wrong with the leather this is strictly
just<00:04:35.890> color<00:04:36.190> related<00:04:36.610> issues<00:04:36.910> and<00:04:37.090> so<00:04:37.510> the

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
just color related issues and so the

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.620 
just color related issues and so the
solution<00:04:38.260> then<00:04:38.440> is<00:04:38.470> the<00:04:38.740> reapplication<00:04:39.040> of

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
solution then is the reapplication of

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.790 
solution then is the reapplication of
the<00:04:40.630> print<00:04:40.960> coat<00:04:41.200> and<00:04:41.500> then<00:04:41.680> the

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
the print coat and then the

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.770 
the print coat and then the
reapplication<00:04:42.100> of<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:43.060> clear<00:04:43.360> coat<00:04:43.540> and

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
reapplication of the clear coat and

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.330 
reapplication of the clear coat and
brings<00:04:44.230> everything<00:04:44.530> back<00:04:44.680> to<00:04:44.980> the<00:04:45.010> way<00:04:45.100> it's

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
brings everything back to the way it's

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.620 
brings everything back to the way it's
going<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:45.610> be<00:04:45.730> which<00:04:45.940> is<00:04:46.060> what<00:04:46.240> we're<00:04:46.390> going<00:04:46.510> to
