00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.219 

now<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:38.970> guy<00:01:39.210> walking<00:01:39.509> up<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.750> steps<00:01:39.990> has

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
now this guy walking up the steps has

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.620 
now this guy walking up the steps has
shoes<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:43.700> whether<00:01:44.700> they're<00:01:44.939> series<00:01:45.329> about

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
shoes on so whether they're series about

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.090 
shoes on so whether they're series about
there's<00:01:45.810> no<00:01:45.960> shooting<00:01:46.439> or<00:01:46.560> not<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.860> don't<00:01:46.920> know

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
there's no shooting or not I don't know

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.289 
there's no shooting or not I don't know
and<00:01:47.880> nobody<00:01:48.299> took<00:01:48.570> up<00:01:48.750> their<00:01:48.899> shoes<00:01:49.110> here<00:01:50.299> and

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
and nobody took up their shoes here and

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.550 
and nobody took up their shoes here and
I<00:01:51.420> don't<00:01:51.479> know<00:01:51.780> what's<00:01:52.049> going<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:54.560> think

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
I don't know what's going on I think

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.109 
I don't know what's going on I think
they're<00:01:55.890> probably<00:01:56.070> not<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.490> serious<00:01:56.729> about

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
they're probably not that serious about

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:14.770 
they're probably not that serious about
it<00:01:58.369> Wow<00:01:59.369> look<00:01:59.670> at<00:01:59.790> this

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.810 

so<00:02:15.410> some<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:15.980> in<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.130> shades<00:02:16.490> are<00:02:16.670> not

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
so some of it is in the shades are not

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:24.940 
so some of it is in the shades are not
too<00:02:16.970> bad<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:23.300> I<00:02:23.510> talked<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.900> some<00:02:24.230> kids<00:02:24.680> who

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
too bad and I talked to some kids who

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.380 
too bad and I talked to some kids who
told<00:02:25.160> me<00:02:25.280> that<00:02:25.310> my<00:02:25.490> shirts<00:02:25.910> are<00:02:26.120> okay<00:02:28.390> these

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
told me that my shirts are okay these

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.010 
told me that my shirts are okay these
people<00:02:29.720> are<00:02:29.810> all<00:02:29.990> barefoot<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:32.750> I<00:02:32.810> guess

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
people are all barefoot so I guess

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.640 
people are all barefoot so I guess
that's<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:34.480> that's<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.630> rule

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.440 

it's<00:02:39.650> like<00:02:39.800> a<00:02:39.830> goldfish<00:02:40.670> or<00:02:40.940> something<00:02:41.300> in

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
it's like a goldfish or something in

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:59.140 
it's like a goldfish or something in
there<00:02:54.130> on<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.190> way<00:02:55.430> down<00:02:55.610> already<00:02:56.470> so<00:02:57.940> down<00:02:58.940> to

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
there on the way down already so down to

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.580 
there on the way down already so down to
here<00:02:59.330> I<00:02:59.360> counted<00:02:59.690> on<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.990> eye<00:03:00.140> kind<00:03:00.440> of<00:03:00.470> the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
here I counted on the eye kind of the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.680 
here I counted on the eye kind of the
steps<00:03:00.860> on<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.070> way<00:03:01.130> down<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:02.270> I'm<00:03:02.360> at<00:03:02.480> four

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
steps on the way down so I'm at four

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.330 
steps on the way down so I'm at four
hundred<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.050> thirty<00:03:03.910> like<00:03:04.910> this<00:03:05.090> step<00:03:05.330> here

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
hundred and thirty like this step here

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.960 
hundred and thirty like this step here
so<00:03:08.650> all<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.830> steps<00:03:10.100> are<00:03:10.220> just<00:03:10.400> about<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.730> same

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
so all the steps are just about the same

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.990 
so all the steps are just about the same
size<00:03:11.180> maybe<00:03:11.600> eight<00:03:11.840> inches<00:03:12.580> a<00:03:13.580> lot<00:03:13.760> of<00:03:13.880> them

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
size maybe eight inches a lot of them

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.980 
size maybe eight inches a lot of them
are<00:03:14.120> even<00:03:14.300> smaller<00:03:14.650> I'd<00:03:15.650> say<00:03:15.830> no<00:03:16.010> bigger<00:03:16.220> than

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
are even smaller I'd say no bigger than

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.860 
are even smaller I'd say no bigger than
nine<00:03:17.990> inches<00:03:18.350> maybe<00:03:19.180> so<00:03:21.280> definitely<00:03:22.280> doable

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
nine inches maybe so definitely doable

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.030 
nine inches maybe so definitely doable
it<00:03:23.870> just<00:03:24.019> takes<00:03:24.200> a<00:03:24.260> couple<00:03:24.410> minutes<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.890> get<00:03:24.980> up

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
it just takes a couple minutes to get up

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.960 
it just takes a couple minutes to get up
early<00:03:25.400> they're<00:03:26.090> so<00:03:26.269> shallow<00:03:26.540> like<00:03:26.870> this<00:03:27.970> and

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970
