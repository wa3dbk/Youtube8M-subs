00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.390

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.220
 discovered in coconut butter recipe 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.360
 and it's an American site where I saw I did not 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.129
 I found 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.949
 I searched so hard I could not find 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.960
 a lot on Brazilian sites but in the 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.610
 Americans, I found a lot and they talk 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.449
 precisely on women who live 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:03.800
 in tropical climates we are to use in 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.720
 coconut nanterre in the skin the hair is so 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.360
 few things even in very 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.200
 people use it then he decided to sign you 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.090
 Do not make the butter I'm going to use 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.610
 to hydrate the hair and 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.829
 Enjoy bringing lots of vegetables but you can 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.939
 use on your skin can use to make the 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.820
 what you want 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.070
 It's very easy the ingredients are coconut 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.130
 grated you can buy that of 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.180
 same bag in the supermarket or I do not 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.609
 I know if the natural body but it should be 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.979
 even better the natural body clothes I 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:39.109
 I took this from what we buy 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.439
 in supermarket is without addition of 

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:45.439
 sugar and dehydrated is you can put 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.329
 coconut oil is or not you can 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.880
 choose this I chose I chose 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:53.210
 I will not put too much and only 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.609
 a statue my thing just to be 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.789
 How are you going to have to use a 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:02.810
 food processor or blender 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:05.119
 It does not hurt to make that butter. 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.780
 because it's things that we're going to 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.180
 match details 11 is is a coconut 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.250
 and vegetable oil that we use in our 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.750
 kitchen then do not put poorly have 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.470
 been modest 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.310
 then you will get the grated coconut and 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:28.830
 put on 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:30.989
 people and put inside the processor and 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.300
 Will you happen in our lives? 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:51.780
 you add the amount of oil 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:53.370
 Coconut want'll put a myth has not 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.030
 nor a pile of dessert that we 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.030
 There must be some little thing on the floor. 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.130
 and but now you 're going to close the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.980
 processor player 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:12.120
 I have no idea how long it will last 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:15.299
 is I having to cut a little video up 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.370
 comes time to stay but will stay 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.910
 will get a liquid you will stop 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.250
 and even saw a thick liquid and 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.769
 It's the same as coconut. 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.230
 solidifying the room temperature will 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:31.260
 stay the way you know then 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.150
 it's only after you've finished beating and 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.700
 put in a blog I 'll show you how much 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.780
 after and when he waited for them 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.010
 where it stays the same 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.010
 so see you later 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.350
 So many people were super fast should not 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.690
 be afraid not two minutes next time 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.240
 I think I 'll want to do it and I'll 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.410
 try to make it with a blender 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.480
 Why give a little work 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.820
 do with a processor that has to 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.280
 stay pushing the button because a shoe 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:20.060
 brother and why I had to stay 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.430
 opening and stirring to be able to take 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.780
 body that is sheltered below, right? 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:30.020
 oh the texture I think I can hit 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.030
 a little bit more in me but the texture 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.620
 delta pastorzinho I think she has 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:41.890
 been promised more 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.890
 little bit back 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:05:00.210
 I am not therefore also net of a 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:03.270
 A little bit of fat is now 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:13.950
 just put it in a little pot and 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:15.780
 from here we have a very good smell there 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.140
 in the United States many mothers who do not 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.560
 like the children who ordered it 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:26.190
 peanut butter and peanut butter 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.890
 that shit they all make butter 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.320
 coconut and they will place butter of 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.780
 peanut then you can eat butter 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.120
 normal coconut so it is such a thing 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.910
 good for doing meditation 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.310
 you can have nothing but one of a 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.590
 oil that 100% vegetable question for 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.110
 make soul a butter meditation 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:50.160
 vegetable and if from here it is pure coconut pulp 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:53.430
 with 11 coconut oil and how do I 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.080
 preservative of the grated coconut I think 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:59.240
 It should take time to ruin 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.240
 so put it on your pole 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:12.530
 he takes a little less well 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.170
 what's that 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.160
 now if you let it cool you will not 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.500
 scream 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.180
 leaves him if he stays in Chile that 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.550
 had that it will stay at least equal 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.940
 That recipe is super 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:38.490
 the packet of grated coconut arrives 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:41.310
 costing our three reais depending on the 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.010
 brand that you get has even cheaper 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.570
 and what in the story a coconut oil that 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.010
 you can choose not to put do not go 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.320
 Make a difference Keep going 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:52.470
 same way and I hope you like it 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.900

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.020
 championship 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.610

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.920
