00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
this has is squashed peas cereal mixes

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.790 
this has is squashed peas cereal mixes
and<00:01:05.489> these<00:01:06.090> are<00:01:06.240> all<00:01:06.420> really<00:01:06.960> way<00:01:07.260> too<00:01:07.290> soft

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
and these are all really way too soft

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.370 
and these are all really way too soft
for<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.070> rabbit's<00:01:08.400> teeth<00:01:08.670> they<00:01:09.570> basically<00:01:09.810> do

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
for a rabbit's teeth they basically do

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.650 
for a rabbit's teeth they basically do
not<00:01:10.590> wear<00:01:10.800> down<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.070> back<00:01:11.580> teeth<00:01:11.940> of<00:01:12.180> rabbits

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
so the frontier can often look fine but

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.980 
so the frontier can often look fine but
it's<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> back<00:01:15.090> teeth<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.510> can<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.870> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
it's the back teeth that can do the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.990 
it's the back teeth that can do the
damage<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.440> cause<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.860> rabbit<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.340> lot<00:01:17.850> of
