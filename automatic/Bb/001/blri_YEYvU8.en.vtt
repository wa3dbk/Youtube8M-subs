00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.680 
world would like him to do what about
taxes<00:03:17.620> if<00:03:17.980> could<00:03:18.459> he<00:03:18.549> step<00:03:19.269> forward<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.569> say

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
taxes if could he step forward and say

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.180 
taxes if could he step forward and say
you<00:03:19.840> know<00:03:20.049> it's<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.560> bad<00:03:20.680> economic<00:03:21.160> situation

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
you know it's a bad economic situation

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.729 
you know it's a bad economic situation
so<00:03:21.819> I'm<00:03:22.090> kind<00:03:22.930> of<00:03:23.019> leaning<00:03:23.139> toward<00:03:23.530> not

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
so I'm kind of leaning toward not

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.069 
so I'm kind of leaning toward not
raising<00:03:24.280> taxes<00:03:24.730> in<00:03:25.239> my<00:03:25.419> first<00:03:25.629> year<00:03:25.780> in<00:03:25.930> office

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
raising taxes in my first year in office

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.330 
raising taxes in my first year in office
and<00:03:26.410> then<00:03:26.500> of<00:03:26.590> course<00:03:26.620> there's<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.099> auto

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
and then of course there's the auto

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.759 
and then of course there's the auto
industry<00:03:27.910> which<00:03:28.209> maybe<00:03:28.959> I'd<00:03:29.379> like<00:03:29.530> to<00:03:29.650> hear

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
industry which maybe I'd like to hear

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.340 
industry which maybe I'd like to hear
from<00:03:29.859> him<00:03:30.010> on<00:03:30.160> that
