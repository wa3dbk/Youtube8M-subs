of bats have been dying and the only

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.049 
of bats have been dying and the only
symptom<00:00:36.260> we<00:00:36.559> seem<00:00:36.800> to<00:00:36.920> find<00:00:37.160> on<00:00:37.370> these<00:00:37.519> bats<00:00:37.790> is

symptom we seem to find on these bats is

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.570 
symptom we seem to find on these bats is
this<00:00:38.180> little<00:00:38.449> bit<00:00:38.570> of<00:00:38.660> white<00:00:38.839> fungus<00:00:39.580> which

this little bit of white fungus which

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.040 
this little bit of white fungus which
can<00:00:40.760> be<00:00:40.850> seen<00:00:41.120> right<00:00:41.360> on<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:41.570> tip<00:00:41.750> of<00:00:41.809> their

can be seen right on the tip of their

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.240 
can be seen right on the tip of their
nose<00:00:42.110> and<00:00:44.050> other<00:00:45.050> than<00:00:45.260> that<00:00:45.320> that<00:00:45.860> seemed<00:00:46.190> to

nose and other than that that seemed to

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.579 
nose and other than that that seemed to
be<00:00:46.400> rather<00:00:46.580> lethargic<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:47.690> seem<00:00:48.320> to<00:00:48.350> be

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
be rather lethargic and seem to be

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:50.740 
be rather lethargic and seem to be
moving<00:00:48.890> from<00:00:49.339> their<00:00:49.489> typical<00:00:49.970> ruse<00:00:50.210> towards

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
moving from their typical ruse towards

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.170 
moving from their typical ruse towards
the<00:00:50.870> entrance<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:51.769> then<00:00:52.460> about<00:00:52.579> mid<00:00:52.940> winter

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
the entrance and then about mid winter

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.819 
the entrance and then about mid winter
they<00:00:53.449> seem<00:00:53.660> to<00:00:53.690> be<00:00:53.840> flying<00:00:54.199> out<00:00:54.559> of<00:00:54.620> the

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
they seem to be flying out of the

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.680 
they seem to be flying out of the
hibernacula<00:00:55.730> which<00:00:55.969> is<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.270> place<00:00:56.480> where

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
hibernacula which is the place where

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.229 
hibernacula which is the place where
they<00:00:56.780> spend<00:00:57.079> the<00:00:57.199> winter<00:00:57.500> sleeping<00:00:58.430> and<00:00:58.670> they

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
they spend the winter sleeping and they

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.760 
they spend the winter sleeping and they
just<00:00:59.420> fly<00:00:59.690> out<00:00:59.719> into<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.260> middle<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.590> winner

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
just fly out into the middle the winner

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.999 
just fly out into the middle the winner
and<00:01:01.010> die<00:01:01.809> so<00:01:02.809> what<00:01:03.079> we're<00:01:03.230> doing<00:01:03.530> here<00:01:03.739> we're

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
and die so what we're doing here we're

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.249 
and die so what we're doing here we're
trying<00:01:04.160> to<00:01:04.460> figure<00:01:04.670> out<00:01:04.879> what's<00:01:05.720> going<00:01:05.810> on

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
trying to figure out what's going on

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:07.900 
trying to figure out what's going on
with<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.590> best<00:01:06.830> that<00:01:07.100> would<00:01:07.220> cause<00:01:07.520> them<00:01:07.789> to

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
with the best that would cause them to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.330 
with the best that would cause them to
change<00:01:08.240> their<00:01:08.390> behavioral<00:01:09.080> patterns<00:01:09.619> from

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
change their behavioral patterns from

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.790 
change their behavioral patterns from
hibernating<00:01:10.880> deep<00:01:11.270> inside<00:01:11.720> of<00:01:11.899> mine<00:01:12.110> to

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
hibernating deep inside of mine to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.650 
hibernating deep inside of mine to
moving<00:01:13.190> up<00:01:13.340> towards<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:13.759> front<00:01:13.850> end<00:01:14.330> here

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
moving up towards the front end here

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.210 
moving up towards the front end here
into<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.050> daylight<00:01:15.470> its<00:01:15.679> own<00:01:15.830> and<00:01:16.100> then

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
into the daylight its own and then

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.590 
into the daylight its own and then
eventually<00:01:16.369> emerging<00:01:17.360> to<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:18.289> fly<00:01:18.560> out<00:01:19.450> so<00:01:20.450> one

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
eventually emerging to to fly out so one

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.029 
eventually emerging to to fly out so one
of<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.780> things<00:01:20.840> we<00:01:21.140> notice<00:01:21.500> about<00:01:21.710> some<00:01:21.950> of

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
of the things we notice about some of

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.010 
of the things we notice about some of
these<00:01:22.160> bats<00:01:22.429> is<00:01:22.700> that<00:01:22.970> they<00:01:23.450> don't<00:01:23.660> always

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
these bats is that they don't always

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.499 
these bats is that they don't always
have<00:01:24.259> fungus<00:01:24.560> on<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.070> nose<00:01:25.340> if<00:01:26.149> we<00:01:26.270> take<00:01:26.450> a

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
have fungus on the nose if we take a

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.080 
have fungus on the nose if we take a
look<00:01:26.599> at<00:01:26.840> this<00:01:26.990> bet<00:01:27.289> we<00:01:28.039> can<00:01:28.190> see<00:01:28.550> that<00:01:28.849> it

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
look at this bet we can see that it

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.169 
look at this bet we can see that it
doesn't<00:01:29.300> have<00:01:29.569> fungus<00:01:29.899> on<00:01:30.200> its<00:01:30.380> face<00:01:31.060> yet<00:01:32.060> we

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
doesn't have fungus on its face yet we

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:34.960 
doesn't have fungus on its face yet we
can<00:01:32.330> see<00:01:32.569> fungus<00:01:33.050> all<00:01:33.289> over<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:33.800> tail<00:01:34.099> and<00:01:34.369> the

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
can see fungus all over the tail and the

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.600 
can see fungus all over the tail and the
wind<00:01:35.179> membranes<00:01:35.690> here<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:36.590> if<00:01:37.099> we<00:01:37.130> fold<00:01:37.429> this

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
wind membranes here and if we fold this

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.279 
wind membranes here and if we fold this
wing<00:01:37.880> out<00:01:38.030> just<00:01:38.300> slightly<00:01:38.479> you<00:01:38.899> can<00:01:39.050> see<00:01:39.259> a

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
wing out just slightly you can see a

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.169 
wing out just slightly you can see a
little<00:01:39.470> bit<00:01:39.649> of<00:01:39.679> white<00:01:39.920> powdery<00:01:40.369> fungus<00:01:40.910> all

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
little bit of white powdery fungus all

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.620 
little bit of white powdery fungus all
over<00:01:41.569> it<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.470> we<00:01:42.860> don't<00:01:43.009> know<00:01:43.369> if<00:01:43.729> this<00:01:44.119> fungus

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
over it and we don't know if this fungus

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.070 
over it and we don't know if this fungus
is<00:01:44.780> actually<00:01:45.200> causing<00:01:45.580> these<00:01:46.580> bags<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:47.149> die<00:01:47.390> we

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
is actually causing these bags to die we

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.630 
is actually causing these bags to die we
just<00:01:48.289> know<00:01:48.380> that<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.619> fungus<00:01:48.979> is<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.160> visual

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
just know that the fungus is a visual

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.520 
just know that the fungus is a visual
symptom<00:01:50.239> that<00:01:50.450> is<00:01:51.700> seen<00:01:52.700> by<00:01:52.970> us<00:01:53.209> and<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:54.289> bats

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
symptom that is seen by us and the bats

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.770 
symptom that is seen by us and the bats
eventually<00:01:55.310> are<00:01:55.459> staging<00:01:56.090> towards<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.509> front

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
eventually are staging towards the front

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.190 
eventually are staging towards the front
and<00:01:57.020> then<00:01:57.470> flying<00:01:57.890> out<00:01:58.310> of<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.550> site<00:01:58.940> and<00:01:59.200> we

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
and then flying out of the site and we

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:20.040 
and then flying out of the site and we
presume<00:02:00.830> to<00:02:01.039> die<00:02:01.220> at<00:02:01.459> that<00:02:01.640> point
