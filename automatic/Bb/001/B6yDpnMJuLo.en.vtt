course<00:00:20.990> although<00:00:21.320> I<00:00:21.349> strongly<00:00:21.860> strongly

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
course although I strongly strongly

course although I strongly strongly
suggest<00:00:22.820> you<00:00:22.910> pick<00:00:23.060> a<00:00:23.119> DK<00:00:23.509> because<00:00:23.899> he<00:00:24.020> looks

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
suggest you pick a DK because he looks

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.269 
suggest you pick a DK because he looks
like<00:00:24.320> he's<00:00:24.500> throwing<00:00:24.739> it<00:00:24.890> down<00:00:25.009> hard<00:00:27.279> now

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
like he's throwing it down hard now

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.859 
like he's throwing it down hard now
right<00:00:28.489> after<00:00:28.700> you<00:00:28.939> start<00:00:29.239> burning<00:00:29.419> out<00:00:29.689> will

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
right after you start burning out will

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.139 
right after you start burning out will
hold<00:00:30.020> a<00:00:30.290> B<00:00:30.619> in<00:00:30.860> any<00:00:31.040> direction<00:00:31.369> on<00:00:31.669> the<00:00:31.820> d-pad

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
hold a B in any direction on the d-pad

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.660 
hold a B in any direction on the d-pad
and<00:00:32.390> you'll<00:00:32.509> start<00:00:32.750> spinning<00:00:33.110> in<00:00:33.370> 360<00:00:34.370> degrees

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
and you'll start spinning in 360 degrees

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.670 
and you'll start spinning in 360 degrees
which<00:00:35.090> is<00:00:35.120> awesome<00:00:35.630> because<00:00:35.809> it<00:00:36.050> makes<00:00:36.230> DK's

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
which is awesome because it makes DK's

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.320 
which is awesome because it makes DK's
dance<00:00:36.920> look<00:00:37.130> that<00:00:37.309> much<00:00:37.460> more<00:00:37.670> epic<00:00:40.120> now<00:00:41.120> for

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
dance look that much more epic now for

that is closest to the fence and then

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.280 
that is closest to the fence and then
you<00:01:28.310> want<00:01:28.490> to<00:01:28.549> run<00:01:28.700> directly<00:01:28.940> into<00:01:29.330> it<00:01:29.510> path

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290

you want to run directly into it path
right<00:01:30.799> over<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.130> fence<00:01:31.280> you<00:01:31.640> can<00:01:32.180> also<00:01:32.360> do

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
right over the fence you can also do

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.060 
right over the fence you can also do
this<00:01:32.720> driving<00:01:32.930> forward<00:01:33.440> with<00:01:33.590> almost<00:01:33.920> no

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
this driving forward with almost no

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.219 
this driving forward with almost no
effort<00:01:34.190> just<00:01:35.030> drive<00:01:35.299> forward<00:01:35.720> at<00:01:35.840> a<00:01:35.869> normal

the case go ahead and turn around start
driving<00:03:18.500> backward<00:03:18.859> you<00:03:19.670> will<00:03:19.790> notice<00:03:20.120> pretty

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
driving backward you will notice pretty

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.780 
driving backward you will notice pretty
soon<00:03:20.780> that<00:03:21.139> lakitu<00:03:21.560> is<00:03:21.739> not<00:03:21.920> bothering<00:03:22.370> you<00:03:22.459> at

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
soon that lakitu is not bothering you at

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.229 
soon that lakitu is not bothering you at
all

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
all

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.870 
all
drive<00:03:23.900> through<00:03:24.139> Yoshi's<00:03:24.560> nose<00:03:24.889> and<00:03:25.370> then<00:03:25.670> you

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
drive through Yoshi's nose and then you

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.759 
drive through Yoshi's nose and then you
will<00:03:26.000> see<00:03:26.269> that<00:03:26.450> lakitu<00:03:26.930> starts<00:03:27.350> coming<00:03:27.739> back

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
will see that lakitu starts coming back

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.250 
will see that lakitu starts coming back
at<00:03:28.459> that<00:03:28.760> point<00:03:28.790> you<00:03:29.480> can<00:03:29.660> just<00:03:29.870> turn<00:03:30.079> around

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
at that point you can just turn around

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.770 
at that point you can just turn around
and<00:03:30.709> then<00:03:31.340> start<00:03:31.670> driving<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.269> correct<00:03:32.540> way

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
and then start driving the correct way

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.930 
and then start driving the correct way
however<00:03:33.530> when<00:03:33.799> this<00:03:33.950> happens<00:03:34.370> lakitu

however when this happens lakitu

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.220 
however when this happens lakitu
actually<00:03:35.299> comes<00:03:35.540> back<00:03:35.630> and<00:03:35.959> tells<00:03:36.079> you<00:03:36.200> you

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
actually comes back and tells you you

actually comes back and tells you you
are<00:03:36.350> driving<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.010> wrong<00:03:37.100> way<00:03:37.160> literally

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
are driving the wrong way literally

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
right way no matter what lakitu tells

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.589 
right way no matter what lakitu tells
you<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:42.950> if<00:03:43.489> you<00:03:43.609> pass<00:03:43.849> the<00:03:44.060> goal<00:03:44.239> line<00:03:44.389> you'll

drive forward normally until you get to

this boost panel you want to drive on
this<00:05:12.850> boost<00:05:13.150> panel<00:05:13.540> jump<00:05:13.930> at<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.260> corner<00:05:14.680> and

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
this boost panel jump at the corner and

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.350 
this boost panel jump at the corner and
hopefully<00:05:15.340> if<00:05:15.520> you<00:05:15.669> have<00:05:15.700> enough<00:05:16.030> speed

hopefully if you have enough speed

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.030 
hopefully if you have enough speed
you'll<00:05:16.600> land<00:05:16.840> on<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.110> top<00:05:17.350> part<00:05:17.740> of<00:05:17.860> this

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
brake in the plane this is pretty tricky

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.409 
brake in the plane this is pretty tricky
to<00:05:20.169> do<00:05:20.440> and<00:05:20.680> can<00:05:20.800> take<00:05:20.980> a<00:05:21.040> while<00:05:21.310> but<00:05:21.880> if<00:05:22.180> you

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
to do and can take a while but if you

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.360 
to do and can take a while but if you
get<00:05:22.570> that<00:05:22.750> one<00:05:23.050> moment<00:05:23.320> where<00:05:23.710> at<00:05:23.830> least<00:05:24.070> one

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
get that one moment where at least one

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.190 
get that one moment where at least one
tire<00:05:24.669> breaks<00:05:25.060> through<00:05:25.300> that<00:05:25.450> you<00:05:25.780> will<00:05:25.960> fall

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
tire breaks through that you will fall

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.080 
tire breaks through that you will fall
through<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:26.710> world<00:05:26.860> victoriously<00:05:27.640> pretty

through the world victoriously pretty

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.600 
through the world victoriously pretty
cool<00:05:28.270> huh<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:29.500> loops<00:05:29.680> on<00:05:29.860> Rainbow<00:05:30.160> Road<00:05:30.340> are

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
cool huh the loops on Rainbow Road are

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.100 
cool huh the loops on Rainbow Road are
pretty<00:05:30.850> glitchy<00:05:31.120> once<00:05:31.419> you<00:05:31.540> start<00:05:31.810> slowing

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
pretty glitchy once you start slowing

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.870 
pretty glitchy once you start slowing
down<00:05:32.230> in<00:05:32.590> them<00:05:32.740> and<00:05:32.980> start<00:05:33.370> trying<00:05:33.520> to<00:05:33.640> jump

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
down in them and start trying to jump

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.520 
down in them and start trying to jump
off<00:05:34.030> which<00:05:34.300> is<00:05:34.419> kind<00:05:34.600> of<00:05:34.630> fun<00:05:34.840> one<00:05:35.260> thing<00:05:35.440> you

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
off which is kind of fun one thing you

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.020 
off which is kind of fun one thing you
can<00:05:35.680> do<00:05:35.800> with<00:05:35.950> this<00:05:36.100> is<00:05:36.340> while<00:05:36.490> you're<00:05:36.640> upside

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
can do with this is while you're upside

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.150 
can do with this is while you're upside
down<00:05:37.270> aim<00:05:37.630> for<00:05:37.990> the<00:05:38.140> very<00:05:38.350> beginning<00:05:38.860> of<00:05:39.010> the

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
down aim for the very beginning of the

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.010 
down aim for the very beginning of the
loop<00:05:39.340> and<00:05:39.580> you'll<00:05:39.700> actually<00:05:40.060> jump<00:05:40.330> off<00:05:40.570> land

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
loop and you'll actually jump off land

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.230 
loop and you'll actually jump off land
on<00:05:41.260> your<00:05:41.410> face<00:05:41.710> but<00:05:42.070> then<00:05:42.280> back<00:05:42.610> on<00:05:42.790> your<00:05:42.970> feet

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240

on your face but then back on your feet
really<00:05:43.630> this<00:05:43.960> one<00:05:44.140> just<00:05:44.290> kind<00:05:44.530> of<00:05:44.590> looks

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
really this one just kind of looks

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.710 
really this one just kind of looks
painful<00:05:44.919> right<00:05:45.669> before<00:05:46.000> the<00:05:46.090> finish<00:05:46.330> line<00:05:46.540> and

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
painful right before the finish line and

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.659 
painful right before the finish line and
tick<00:05:46.900> tock<00:05:47.140> clock<00:05:47.320> you<00:05:47.740> can<00:05:47.890> actually<00:05:48.100> do<00:05:48.490> some

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
tick tock clock you can actually do some

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.760 
tick tock clock you can actually do some
fun<00:05:48.880> stuff<00:05:48.910> for<00:05:49.270> these<00:05:49.390> cogs<00:05:49.780> if<00:05:50.350> you<00:05:50.560> use<00:05:50.740> a

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
fun stuff for these cogs if you use a

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.530 
fun stuff for these cogs if you use a

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
and into the left cog you can either

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.640 
and into the left cog you can either
write<00:05:54.610> it<00:05:54.640> all<00:05:54.940> the<00:05:55.090> way<00:05:55.180> up<00:05:55.210> or<00:05:55.660> pop<00:05:56.080> off<00:05:56.320> of<00:05:56.530> it

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
write it all the way up or pop off of it

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.350 
write it all the way up or pop off of it
and<00:05:56.830> go<00:05:56.950> through<00:05:57.130> the<00:05:57.250> floor<00:05:57.490> which<00:05:57.910> is<00:05:58.060> really

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
and go through the floor which is really

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.180 
and go through the floor which is really
really<00:05:58.540> cool-looking<00:05:58.900> this<00:05:59.470> is<00:05:59.620> probably<00:06:00.010> my

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
really cool-looking this is probably my

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.980 
really cool-looking this is probably my
