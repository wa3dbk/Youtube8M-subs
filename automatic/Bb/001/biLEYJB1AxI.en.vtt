00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
standard video and what I'm able to do

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.810 
standard video and what I'm able to do
whilst<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.500> video<00:02:56.740> content<00:02:57.190> is<00:02:57.280> running<00:02:57.640> is

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
whilst the video content is running is

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.470 
whilst the video content is running is
zoom<00:02:58.540> in<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:59.470> that<00:02:59.650> moving<00:02:59.890> action<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.760> pan

zoom in to that moving action and pan

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.010 
zoom in to that moving action and pan

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
and zoom around the screen if I come

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.220 
and zoom around the screen if I come

back out and click on the screen what I

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.170 
back out and click on the screen what I
can<00:03:08.440> also<00:03:08.590> do<00:03:08.920> by<00:03:09.130> clicking<00:03:09.400> on<00:03:09.820> this<00:03:10.000> icon

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
can also do by clicking on this icon

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.350 
can also do by clicking on this icon
here<00:03:10.920> very<00:03:11.920> cleverly<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.580> only<00:03:12.940> possible

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
here very cleverly and only possible

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.120 
here very cleverly and only possible
because<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.810> quad<00:03:14.020> core<00:03:14.050> capabilities<00:03:14.920> of

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
because of the quad core capabilities of

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.180 
because of the quad core capabilities of
the<00:03:15.220> device<00:03:17.250> I'll<00:03:18.250> speed<00:03:18.610> it<00:03:18.640> up<00:03:19.980> so<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:21.100> we

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
the device I'll speed it up so that we

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.130 
the device I'll speed it up so that we
see<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.520> action<00:03:21.880> in<00:03:22.060> faster<00:03:22.570> than<00:03:22.720> real<00:03:22.930> life

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
see the action in faster than real life

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.900 
see the action in faster than real life
effect<00:03:24.840> or<00:03:25.840> slow<00:03:26.260> it<00:03:26.290> right<00:03:26.650> down<00:03:26.890> so<00:03:27.730> whether

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
effect or slow it right down so whether

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.210 
effect or slow it right down so whether
it's<00:03:28.150> content<00:03:29.110> that<00:03:29.230> I'm<00:03:29.350> downloading<00:03:30.010> or

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
it's content that I'm downloading or

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.070 
it's content that I'm downloading or
streaming<00:03:30.330> or<00:03:31.330> whether<00:03:31.510> it's<00:03:31.720> user-generated

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
streaming or whether it's user-generated

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.270 
streaming or whether it's user-generated
content<00:03:32.739> I<00:03:33.250> can<00:03:33.790> slow<00:03:34.030> that<00:03:34.239> right<00:03:34.540> down<00:03:35.280> to

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
content I can slow that right down to

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.550 
content I can slow that right down to
really<00:03:36.640> experience<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.630> multimedia<00:03:38.080> effect

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
really experience the multimedia effect

to the fork

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.820 
to the fork
so<00:03:41.640> this<00:03:41.819> and<00:03:42.690> other<00:03:42.870> features<00:03:43.110> like<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:43.680> are

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
so this and other features like it are

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.710 
so this and other features like it are
just<00:03:44.010> some<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.430> ways<00:03:44.640> in<00:03:44.909> which<00:03:44.940> quad-core

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
just some of the ways in which quad-core
