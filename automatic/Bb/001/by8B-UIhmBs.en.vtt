00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 today, I worked correctly 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.609
 Appliances with his father in 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.880
 overlap strikes 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.219
 direct this technique I did not work 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.460
 so I think that this is due to the fact that 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.430
 some of the basics i don't do and in 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.199
 principle plans next time more 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.420
 focus on the basics of correctness 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.350
 run and then build up 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.660
 speed and strength 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.029
 how do you know that you have something 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.619
 I ca n't get in the face 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.990
 ideally if done correctly 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.790
 I shouldn't get the technique in the face 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.890
 i get help i mean wrong 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.079
 I do the technique well maybe the technique 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.920
 just shit is a situation that you 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.020
 perform 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.000
 and not get in the face here is very important 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.469
 moment that you understand the difference 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.180
 that as soon as you do something 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.340
 wrong you start getting by 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.530
 muzzle as you say but if you do 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.920
 correct percentage of receipt in the face 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.590
 your at least going down well yes 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.750
 probably for the time being because only 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.879
 I started doing it all the same I think 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.020
 that while my technique is wrong well 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.240
 thank you 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:10.409
 ask the staff of a combat workshop 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.090
 speakers with great experience as said 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.680
 previous my opponent 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.280
 today in training more put 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.100
 proper execution technique 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.340
 I personally worked on correctness 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.140
 keep the right to stand properly 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.119
 were on fruit directed pavich 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.549
 topical correctly striking and 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.860
 use technique 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.960
 not everything works well over time does not mean 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.840
 it turns out that it was what happens 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.920
 the main thing to work here is blocking what 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.320
 managed to reach 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.170
 what exactly is obtained can be 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.049
 simplify training yeah and what the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.119
 items can be complicated 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.329
 all the problems are easy nothing 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.439
 you don't have to try to forgive 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.119
 do it all that really and clearly 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:07.110
 listen carefully to what tells us 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.629
 our mentor that is, it turns out that you 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.930
 inattentively listening according to your 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.940
 logic listening to the end or moron here two 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.040
 options or listen inattentively 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.720
 buddy bell that is if for 100 or 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.230
 mentor moron yes there is still a third 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.550
 test version explains not that can not 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.140
 to be so why was that if you were one 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.530
 and also do wrong every time 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.720
 there is a feeling that something is not right here 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:44.819
 let's find this need find 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:47.910
 extreme let's give what the problem is all 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.709
 understandable but hope there is hope there is 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.190
 everyone has progress I can say that 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.349
 of course what were disabled now 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.769
 heart after all this is already going 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:01.890
 all pass barrels so next member 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:06.720
 workouts drugs immediately says that 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.480
 my work experience is two years okay not 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.610
 embarrass people but my experience take 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.980
 rounding up is somewhere with two 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.190
 a little month 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.620
 piece by piece workout well for 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.000
 to form your own judgment 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.760
 operability of equipment needed 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.519
 in my deep conviction try 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.930
 technique on yourself that is in contact with 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:37.170
 my partner today was such 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:41.099
 opportunity well what came to be 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.269
 what came to be that is tech 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:49.739
 strike and technically 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:53.760
 Naturally somewhere with digressions 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:58.140
 atsal theory but of satisfaction from 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:02.000
 the fact that the technique works and still 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:06.019
 theory which she was presented 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.819
 has an inability I strongly want to 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.629
 those physical possibilities first of all 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.870
 Height Weight 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.189
 the length of the frame of the hands that you were 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.530
 used to the maximum 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:18.269
 for this you need to attach some 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.989
 your efforts are fine 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.389
 it turns out 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.150
 movement definitely is but strength 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.250
 small experience workshop like 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.810
 the movement is clear that neither be strong 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.380
 heroically tell me please 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.610
 training is quite intense 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:38.070
 difficult you have time to get tired 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.470
 training I don't need to judge my own 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:46.940
 physical data 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:50.160
 new worlds to on exhausting simpler 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.380
 we will read that this will eventually be 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.759
 strengthen endurance and physical strength 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.790
 because many holidays will be 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:05:00.810
 it will be done correctly less expenses 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.400
 on i'm energy on unnecessary actions well and 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.729
 will be sparta in the process of training 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.770
 produce artificiality 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.860
 you want to come every time 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.969
 there is tired, it seems like there is a feeling 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.800
 that but also in the ass 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:14.839
 let us workout now let me 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.300
 painted I will not miss 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:19.400
 as here you feel about it 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.110
 each has his own motivation to go to 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.580
 love training skip if there is 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:28.069
 opportunity I try not to miss 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.960
 the main motivation for me is to survive 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.210
 our aggressive world into this aggressive 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.339
 environment because it is not known what time 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.469
 you will be in real danger 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:38.439
 need to be always ready and and reflect 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:41.899
 like me to protect myself 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:43.370
 or your close people but you are a man 

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:45.800
 good this knowledge will be useful to you 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.789
 you won't do anything wrong 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.789
 this is thanks to the lasso
