00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630 
whether I'm alive just because I like

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.590 
whether I'm alive just because I like
the<00:06:47.750> most<00:06:47.870> situations<00:06:48.170> because<00:06:49.330> depending<00:06:50.330> on

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:50.600 
the most situations because depending on

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.780 
the most situations because depending on

how many people are left it's a

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.360 
how many people are left it's a
different<00:06:53.480> situation<00:06:53.890> say<00:06:54.890> if<00:06:54.920> it<00:06:55.220> was<00:06:55.280> a
