00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.360
 Welcome to the bono mix em 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.160
 22 review powered by radio and herring 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.480
 with friendly support that 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:21.919
 musikhaus kirstein delivered to your home 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.189
 the 10 22 of humor in a very 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:27.890
 beautiful alu suitcase from the outset can 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.169
 it seems very valuable but we do 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.910
 first an unboxing and we open 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.910
 These come in what's in there 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.960
 yes laughs the heart of one 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:44.589
 every musician is so rich 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.789
 equipment and accessories yes than there 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:52.140
 of course the microphone that bono with 10 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:57.339
 22 large diaphragm microphone 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.809
 further comprises a windshield with it 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:05.019
 if the shots in the outdoor area or 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.979
 when are influential prosper then 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.319
 would still be a microphone spider this 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.990
 if possible you the microphone at each 

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:16.050
 Microphone can be attached to winter 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.000
 adapters are also available 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.920
 and even a chic bags with 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.929
 zipper 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.170
 this is still possible 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:28.170
 microphone sometimes without case too 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.170
 transport 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.310
 before we do that right now 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.100
 connect the microphone 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.820
 a few more technical details 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:44.610
 of course his music as well 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:51.010
 polemik the 22 it is a gold steamed 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:55.960
 15 and 20 inch membrane a fdp ago 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:02:01.210
 gain the directional characteristic is 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:06.190
 a kidney frequency range goes from 20 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:11.980
 to 20,000 hertz the sensitivity 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:18.310
 is at minus 34 decibels the signal 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:23.640
 signal to noise ratio 78 decibels the output 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:35.010
 Impedance is 150 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:35.010
 the maximum sound pressure level 132 db spl 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:44.490
 Furthermore, we still have the 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:48.510
 equivalent new 16 decibels and that 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:51.570
 microphone to a very stable 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.260
 Metal basket around the course, too 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.280
 to be able to see 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.300
 a very robust I will 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.570
 metal case what else to mention 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.630
 would be and the connection possibility of the 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.990
 Microphones take place via an XLR 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.870
 connection and what else is needed 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:13.470
 Also absolutely to mention is here 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.170
 need a 48 volt phantom voltage 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.060
 for feeding the microphone that 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:23.940
 weight the net weight of the microphone 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:25.850
 is 3 146 grams so first time too 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.470
 the dry technical data and 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:33.230
 Now I take with me and I the microphone 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.230
 to be the microphone on 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.700
 yes we can now significantly higher 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.040
 we have the bruno up with the 22 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.680
 microphone now connected and that 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.080
 we realized with a small one 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:54.000
 compact mixa of the brand sony km 120 m2 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.680
 also comes from the house of kirstein 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.540
 but it is not mandatory 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.730
 it is necessary also every other ins 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.070
 Any determines because they have one 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.910
 so-called phantom voltage has or 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.770
 also an audio interface the volumes 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.310
 voice playback as well as the sound 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:15.450
 Behavior and dynamics of the 10 22 have 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.860
 So we are really very confident in the process 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.549
 the judge we had the opportunity 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:23.100
 that bruno with 10 22 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:26.130
 also in death bloom to test for the 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.660
 singing and instrument recording and 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.580
 it turned out that that 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.270
 microphone so really a small one 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.270
 is all-rounder 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:38.959
 All in all, we are to the result 

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:43.069
 come that bono with 10 22 

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:45.050
 with a cost of 69 euros so 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:48.129
 really a very good microphone in there 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.689
 this price segment unbeatable low 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:52.119
 and definitely recommend both 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:55.039
 thumbs up 

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:56.479
 we can only pass that on as 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.269
 So we just tested it 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.559
 really made a very good figure 

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:01.759
 Furthermore, you want a special one 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:04.029
 Thanks to pronounce can musikhaus 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:07.189
 kirstein now as have enabled and 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:10.219
 us the 10 22 provided 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:12.139
 have or give special thanks 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:15.069
