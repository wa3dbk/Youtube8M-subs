so I'm just going to take it out and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.369 
so I'm just going to take it out and
it's<00:00:40.410> going<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.649> be<00:00:40.800> safer<00:00:41.610> anyways<00:00:42.290> so<00:00:43.290> I'm

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
it's going to be safer anyways so I'm

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.520 
it's going to be safer anyways so I'm
going<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.620> do<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.100> then<00:00:45.289> I'm<00:00:46.289> gonna<00:00:46.410> have

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
going to do that and then I'm gonna have

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.720 
going to do that and then I'm gonna have
to<00:00:46.620> take<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> whole<00:00:47.010> engine<00:00:47.309> off<00:00:47.430> for<00:00:47.610> that

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
to take the whole engine off for that

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.880 
to take the whole engine off for that
but<00:00:47.969> that's<00:00:48.030> okay<00:00:48.440> I've<00:00:49.440> done<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:49.829> a

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
but that's okay I've done it like a

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.709 
but that's okay I've done it like a
million<00:00:50.129> times<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.969> can<00:00:51.030> probably<00:00:51.300> do<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.629> in

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
million times so I can probably do it in

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.340 
million times so I can probably do it in
my<00:00:51.809> sleep<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.260> wanted<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.649> um<00:00:53.120> I<00:00:54.199> don't<00:00:55.199> know

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
my sleep if I wanted to um I don't know

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.110 
my sleep if I wanted to um I don't know
if<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.649> carburetor<00:00:55.949> issue<00:00:56.280> or<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.699> think

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
if I have a carburetor issue or I think

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.529 
if I have a carburetor issue or I think
I'm<00:00:57.360> mild<00:00:57.539> gas<00:00:57.809> actually<00:00:58.350> there's<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:59.539> filter

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
I'm mild gas actually there's a filter

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.090 
I'm mild gas actually there's a filter
screen<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:00.989> top<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.320> gas<00:01:01.500> tank<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.920> can't

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
screen on top of the gas tank so I can't

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.039 
screen on top of the gas tank so I can't
see<00:01:02.219> how<00:01:02.250> much<00:01:02.430> fuels<00:01:02.730> left<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.149> tank<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:04.019> I

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
see how much fuels left in the tank so I

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.329 
see how much fuels left in the tank so I
might<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.260> just<00:01:04.439> been<00:01:04.559> starving<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:04.979> fuel

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
might have just been starving for fuel

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.420 
might have just been starving for fuel
when<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.820> tried<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.180> run<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.450> other<00:01:06.600> day<00:01:06.780> so

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
when I tried to run it the other day so

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:33.949 
when I tried to run it the other day so
I'm<00:01:08.430> going<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.670> get<00:01:08.760> busy

all right let's see if I can get this
back<00:02:08.229> cover<00:02:08.500> off<00:02:09.030> hopefully<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.209> couple<00:02:10.360> top

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
back cover off hopefully a couple top

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.690 
back cover off hopefully a couple top
taps<00:02:11.080> of<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.319> hammer<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:11.770> this<00:02:11.860> should<00:02:12.010> pop

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
taps of the hammer and this should pop

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:30.449 
taps of the hammer and this should pop
right<00:02:12.850> off<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:22.230> little<00:02:23.230> bit<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:30.010> is<00:02:30.190> going<00:02:30.340> to

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
right off a little bit this is going to

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:51.290 
right off a little bit this is going to
get<00:02:30.550> messy<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.850> see<00:02:31.150> oil<00:02:31.480> leaking<00:02:31.959> everywhere

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.850 

there<00:02:52.300> it<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:55.560> okay

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
there it is okay

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:04.220 
there it is okay
here's<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:58.030> inside<00:02:58.360> of<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.860> GX<00:03:00.420> 340<00:03:01.420> honda

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
here's the inside of the GX 340 honda

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.190 
here's the inside of the GX 340 honda
well<00:03:05.230> isn't<00:03:05.590> looking<00:03:05.830> too<00:03:05.860> bad<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:07.900> can<00:03:08.019> see

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
well isn't looking too bad you can see

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.770 
well isn't looking too bad you can see
that's<00:03:08.380> this<00:03:08.800> is<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.209> low<00:03:10.209> oil<00:03:10.239> sensor

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
that's this is the low oil sensor

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.360 
that's this is the low oil sensor
camshaft<00:03:13.860> crankshaft<00:03:14.920> it's<00:03:15.010> obviously

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
camshaft crankshaft it's obviously

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.430 
camshaft crankshaft it's obviously
piston<00:03:16.299> up<00:03:16.420> there<00:03:16.630> looks<00:03:17.380> like<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.590> um

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
piston up there looks like a um

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.319 
piston up there looks like a um
counterweight<00:03:20.440> thing<00:03:21.220> over<00:03:21.459> here<00:03:21.489> I<00:03:21.880> think

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
counterweight thing over here I think

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.440 
counterweight thing over here I think
that's<00:03:22.510> what<00:03:22.630> that's<00:03:22.780> for<00:03:22.870> not<00:03:23.769> too<00:03:23.920> short<00:03:24.130> oh

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
that's what that's for not too short oh

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.250 
that's what that's for not too short oh
but<00:03:25.450> uh<00:03:25.480> yeah<00:03:26.470> up<00:03:26.829> here<00:03:27.070> this<00:03:27.579> little<00:03:27.790> arm<00:03:28.260> that

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
but uh yeah up here this little arm that

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.380 
but uh yeah up here this little arm that
is<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.980> governor<00:03:30.400> arm<00:03:30.549> as<00:03:30.760> you<00:03:30.820> can<00:03:31.090> see<00:03:31.269> it

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
is the governor arm as you can see it

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.810 
is the governor arm as you can see it
runs<00:03:31.510> up<00:03:31.780> straight<00:03:32.410> through<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:33.459> there's<00:03:33.640> my

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
runs up straight through and there's my

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.509 
runs up straight through and there's my
governor<00:03:34.209> arm<00:03:34.329> up<00:03:34.510> there

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
governor arm up there

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.500 
governor arm up there
so<00:03:36.519> this<00:03:37.090> shafts<00:03:37.390> coming<00:03:37.750> out<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:38.049> as<00:03:38.650> well<00:03:38.860> on

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
so this shafts coming out and as well on

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.300 
so this shafts coming out and as well on
the<00:03:40.510> case<00:03:41.940> here's<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.180> plastic<00:03:44.310> governor

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
the case here's the plastic governor

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.110 
the case here's the plastic governor
gear<00:03:45.930> apparently<00:03:46.930> these<00:03:47.110> um<00:03:47.940> easily<00:03:48.940> go

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
gear apparently these um easily go

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.560 
gear apparently these um easily go
pretty<00:03:49.390> easily<00:03:49.600> at<00:03:49.840> higher<00:03:50.019> rpm<00:03:50.470> so<00:03:51.570> obviously

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
pretty easily at higher rpm so obviously

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.300 
pretty easily at higher rpm so obviously
this<00:03:52.720> is<00:03:52.780> going<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.079> come<00:03:53.230> off<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:54.190> can

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
this is going to come off you can

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.610 
this is going to come off you can
already<00:03:54.489> see<00:03:54.730> it's<00:03:54.880> kind<00:03:55.060> of<00:03:55.560> it's<00:03:56.560> almost

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
already see it's kind of it's almost

this<00:04:58.130> arm<00:04:58.370> and<00:04:59.290> will<00:05:00.430> adjust<00:05:01.430> accordingly<00:05:01.720> to

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
this arm and will adjust accordingly to

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.250 
this arm and will adjust accordingly to
make<00:05:02.750> the<00:05:03.140> engine<00:05:03.380> run<00:05:03.410> run<00:05:04.250> at<00:05:04.490> the<00:05:05.260> factory

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
make the engine run run at the factory

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.460 
make the engine run run at the factory
speeds<00:05:06.670> so<00:05:07.670> but<00:05:08.390> I<00:05:08.450> don't<00:05:08.630> like<00:05:08.750> factory<00:05:09.200> speed

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
speeds so but I don't like factory speed

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.540 
speeds so but I don't like factory speed
and<00:05:10.450> this<00:05:11.450> will<00:05:11.690> also<00:05:11.990> give<00:05:12.140> me<00:05:12.170> a<00:05:12.290> better

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
and this will also give me a better

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.370 
and this will also give me a better
throttle<00:05:13.550> response<00:05:13.810> because<00:05:14.810> the<00:05:15.050> governor

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
throttle response because the governor

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.560 
throttle response because the governor
is<00:05:15.470> not<00:05:15.500> going<00:05:15.800> to<00:05:15.890> fight<00:05:16.040> the<00:05:16.250> gas<00:05:17.120> pedal<00:05:17.480> at

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
is not going to fight the gas pedal at

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.890 
is not going to fight the gas pedal at
