food<00:04:59.819> if<00:05:00.819> they<00:05:01.000> want<00:05:01.180> to<00:05:01.330> eat<00:05:01.479> that<00:05:01.870> except

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
food if they want to eat that except

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.040 
food if they want to eat that except

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
seven are old as their leader how the

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.679 
seven are old as their leader how the
Medici<00:05:08.889> family<00:05:08.919> can<00:05:09.520> still<00:05:09.699> hold<00:05:09.879> any<00:05:10.060> sway<00:05:10.449> in

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:10.689
