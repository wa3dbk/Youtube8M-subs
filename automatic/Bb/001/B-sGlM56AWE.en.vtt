prototype the Apple employee that

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.670 
prototype the Apple employee that
actually<00:00:51.329> lost<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.840> tried<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.230> bribe<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
person to give it back to him so it just

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.479 
person to give it back to him so it just
sounds<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:54.989> another<00:00:55.170> publicity<00:00:55.590> stunt<00:00:56.309> from

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
sounds like another publicity stunt from

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.880 
sounds like another publicity stunt from
apple<00:00:56.940> also<00:00:57.210> along<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.930> same<00:00:58.140> lines<00:00:58.170> Apple

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
apple also along the same lines Apple

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.220 
apple also along the same lines Apple
actually<00:00:59.219> updated<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> icon<00:01:00.390> for<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.629> iphone

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
actually updated the icon for the iphone

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.070 
actually updated the icon for the iphone
in<00:01:01.469> their<00:01:01.680> latest<00:01:01.969> photostream<00:01:02.969> beta<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.539> it

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
in their latest photostream beta and it

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.929 
in their latest photostream beta and it
looks<00:01:04.320> significantly<00:01:04.580> different<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.760> they

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
looks significantly different and they

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.270 
looks significantly different and they
could<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.210> accidentally<00:01:06.810> included<00:01:06.990> an<00:01:07.680> icon

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
could have accidentally included an icon

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.030 
could have accidentally included an icon
intended<00:01:08.970> for<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> iphone<00:01:09.780> 5<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
intended for the iphone 5 in the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.890 
intended for the iphone 5 in the
photostream<00:01:11.670> beta<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.240> these<00:01:12.570> are<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
photostream beta and these are the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.320 
photostream beta and these are the
mock-ups<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.590> were<00:01:13.680> actually<00:01:14.100> created<00:01:14.340> from

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
mock-ups that were actually created from

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.539 
mock-ups that were actually created from
that<00:01:15.600> icon<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.500> could<00:01:16.740> either<00:01:16.860> mean<00:01:17.220> that

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
that icon and it could either mean that

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.060 
that icon and it could either mean that
Apple<00:01:17.880> would<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.479> creating<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.170> smaller<00:01:19.680> iPhone

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
Apple would be creating a smaller iPhone

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.240 
Apple would be creating a smaller iPhone
than<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.180> current<00:01:21.450> iPhone<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.950> screen

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
than the current iPhone but the screen

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.310 
than the current iPhone but the screen
size<00:01:23.520> would<00:01:23.820> still<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:24.330> point<00:01:24.689> 2<00:01:24.960> inches

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
size would still be point 2 inches

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.710 
size would still be point 2 inches
bigger<00:01:25.590> or<00:01:25.860> they<00:01:26.490> could<00:01:26.549> create<00:01:27.030> an<00:01:27.240> iphone

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
bigger or they could create an iphone

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.420 
bigger or they could create an iphone
that's<00:01:27.930> roughly<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.590> same<00:01:28.799> size<00:01:28.860> with<00:01:29.400> a

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
that's roughly the same size with a

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.190 
that's roughly the same size with a
screen<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.150> extremely<00:01:30.869> bigger

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
screen that is extremely bigger

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.050 
screen that is extremely bigger
somewhere<00:01:31.680> around<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.159> ballpark<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.820> four

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
somewhere around the ballpark of four

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.850 
somewhere around the ballpark of four
inches<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.659> since<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.110> lot<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.290> analysts<00:01:34.650> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
inches and since a lot of analysts and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.080 
inches and since a lot of analysts and
rumors<00:01:35.159> have<00:01:35.340> been<00:01:35.430> pointing<00:01:35.790> towards

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
rumors have been pointing towards

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.060 
rumors have been pointing towards
multiple<00:01:36.600> iphone<00:01:37.049> models<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.530> definitely

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
multiple iphone models it's definitely

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.730 
multiple iphone models it's definitely
possible<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.820> icon<00:01:39.329> could<00:01:39.689> serve<00:01:40.049> for

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
possible that this icon could serve for

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.740 
possible that this icon could serve for
more<00:01:40.950> than<00:01:41.100> one<00:01:41.310> device<00:01:41.579> such<00:01:42.180> as<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.540> two

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
more than one device such as the two

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.929 
more than one device such as the two
concepts<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.590> were<00:01:43.770> created<00:01:44.130> from<00:01:44.640> this

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
generation until now there's an italian

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.789 
generation until now there's an italian
blog<00:03:35.849> that<00:03:36.090> actually<00:03:36.569> did<00:03:36.810> this<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.199> if<00:03:37.620> the

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
blog that actually did this and if the

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.589 
blog that actually did this and if the
case<00:03:38.040> is<00:03:38.069> accurate<00:03:38.819> then<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.120> means<00:03:39.239> that<00:03:39.389> the

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
case is accurate then it means that the

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.629 
case is accurate then it means that the
iphone<00:03:39.989> five<00:03:40.319> will<00:03:40.349> be<00:03:40.680> slightly<00:03:41.099> bigger<00:03:41.519> than

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
iphone five will be slightly bigger than

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.759 
iphone five will be slightly bigger than
the<00:03:41.849> iphone<00:03:42.329> 4<00:03:42.659> and<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:43.139> will<00:03:43.290> be<00:03:43.379> extremely

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
the iphone 4 and it will be extremely

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.159 
the iphone 4 and it will be extremely
thinner<00:03:44.519> than<00:03:44.729> the<00:03:44.879> iphone<00:03:45.299> 4<00:03:45.629> however<00:03:46.139> I

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
thinner than the iphone 4 however I

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.319 
thinner than the iphone 4 however I
think<00:03:46.349> that<00:03:46.530> apple<00:03:46.949> try<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.519> keep<00:03:47.699> the<00:03:48.000> same

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
think that apple try and keep the same

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.629 
think that apple try and keep the same
size<00:03:48.629> overall<00:03:49.319> they'll<00:03:49.769> make<00:03:49.949> it<00:03:49.979> thinner<00:03:50.400> and

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
size overall they'll make it thinner and

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.280 
size overall they'll make it thinner and
they<00:03:50.819> will<00:03:50.970> make<00:03:51.090> this<00:03:51.239> screen<00:03:51.659> bigger<00:03:51.900> so

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
they will make this screen bigger so

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.960 
they will make this screen bigger so
probably<00:03:52.769> similar<00:03:53.129> to<00:03:53.400> what<00:03:53.519> I<00:03:53.549> was<00:03:53.699> talking

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
probably similar to what I was talking

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.119 
probably similar to what I was talking
about<00:03:54.180> earlier<00:03:54.510> with<00:03:55.109> the<00:03:55.139> photostream<00:03:55.859> beta
