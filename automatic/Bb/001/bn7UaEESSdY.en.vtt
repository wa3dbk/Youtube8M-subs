00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 moin moin and welcome here 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.660
 a new follow apple I check 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.670
 I am for apple eick tv and today 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:17.070
 I present you the bending role 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:19.410
 the case for the iphone 6 plus so and 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.359
 then we start already in that 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.150
 unpack here once again the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.760
 Packaging reflects the American 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.160
 company a little picture here in 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.669
 High gloss optics role of the case for iphone 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.570
 sex place then we pack the whole thing too 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:41.129
 ever from packing to 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.460
 side and the small plastic bag yes 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.629
 not again and then we have 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:52.500
 here also the case itself 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:54.570
 so superficially it shines like that 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.469
 bit of leather look but it is at all 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.660
 no leather case 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.480
 It's plastic and that's clear too 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.879
 So for people I felt first 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.379
 Also thought it would be a leather so it 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.290
 would definitely be a bit more 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.680
 imitates the leather but it is definitely 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.540
 plastic and everyone notices we have 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.460
 Here are three bags on this page 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.380
 and a big pocket on the inside 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.299
 for credit card identity card 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.560
 driver license whatever on the 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.220
 side is then the mobile here is still 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.100
 such a small protective film in it 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.140
 By the way here is a magnetic lock then 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.930
 you can do it all the way up here too 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.060
 the back that snaps tight 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.100
 not down , you can still the ironing 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.619
 put one on the magnets so here 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.150
 nothing impossible impossible flapping around 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:45.420
 here and then we want to go once too 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.580
 short of the iphone I have to pretend 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.610
 something prepared 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.290
 that's the only one so far 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.990
 only criticism of the test 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.540
 I found that here 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.490
 you want to put it in so you can pretend 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.870
 is still relatively good I have somehow 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.970
 always afraid that I will knobs here 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.310
 broken maybe I do I make 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.149
 me there too but so that 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.830
 it's still going to break that tight 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.780
 that's all super does not fall out and 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.910
 but continue to take out 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.980
 That's really hard 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.680
 but actually you want a case like that 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.030
 Also keep in mind and is well 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.520
 maybe it's only incidental to me 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.010
 something negatively noticed the 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.080
 processing in general I find in 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.090
 order as I said so with the leather 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.950
 maybe not something for everyone 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.890
 I personally do not care that much 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.990
 So I think that's okay , that's it 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.600
 Often, leather also suffers when you are 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.720
 leather cover often used or long me 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.160
 The whole thing has been used every day 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.660
 Traces I think should be here 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.920
 Do not be the case because that's all 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.870
 really a plastic surface is me 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.060
 I've used a whole day 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.250
 so have a lot of bent here 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.239
 as far as this is concerned or here 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.209
 and I have to say so myself 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.100
 extensive use one hardly sees 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.440
 any traces here any 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.070
 crease traces and it is just as tight as 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.470
 before 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.209
 that does not open up too much and before 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.000
 all stop you can the handy in addition 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.280
 So once again set up the iphone like that 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.680
 far too 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.709
 on the price performance ratio remains 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.390
 say that the case is really okay 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:29.550
 from the quality 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:32.760
 It is available in black turquoise white 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.810
 pink white and completely white seal 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:42.110
 there comes $ 29,999 in dollars for $ 29 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:45.420
 and on amazon.de for 24 99 in euros 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.470
 I think the price is okay man 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.720
 have to know for yourself whether you maybe 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.370
 then still ten euros drauflegt or 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.400
 15 euros drauflegt and then 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.170
 Real leather case buys with bags 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.560
 and so with these entry bags 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.720
 here 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.850
 but that's up to everyone 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.920
 there are tastes different from me 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.690
 from a recommendation for people in 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.810
 white case a cheap white case 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.910
 as I said that it is very resistant 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.890
 against devastation here what movement 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.600
 you can click it at all 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.919
 not so i would say one 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:19.829
 successful overall package and that was mine 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.660
 Review here to the well of the case of the 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.580
 company jump i hope you have that 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.410
 video if yes gives one 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.600
 thumb up if no gives a thumb 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.760
 under uncommented but please what 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.260
