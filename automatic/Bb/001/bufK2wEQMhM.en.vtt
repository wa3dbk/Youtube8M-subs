00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.399
 ok friends again javier martÃ­nez de 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.540
 new music art we are going to learn them 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:11.850
 today a pretty simple trick of how 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.120
 separate the notes to make a 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.220
 effective classical guitar score and 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.390
 that a musician can read it without any 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:25.110
 problem very well we open our logic 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:29.039
 which we already have prepared with our 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:33.410
 24 sampler with a pretty sound 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.410
 approximate to the sound of the guitar 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.230
 very well something that we have to have in 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.809
 account is the transposition of the sampler 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.610
 must be at -12 so that all six 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.610
 guitar notes is to say me 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.809
 I agree with the notes we're going 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.030
 to play in the score very well 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.699
 let's then play a sequence 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.699
 simple for a guitar 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.170
 very well we approximate this then to 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.040
 first compass and then quant 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.920
 we hoisted 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.750
 in the upper left quant 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.920
 hoist we do it on eighth notes ok when 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.940
 we open the score window 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.250
 we found that effectively what 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:49.520
 we have played but the notes are 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.130
 stuck and in some cases you can 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.690
 appear to you that appears as a 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.510
 piano score which is logical 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.940
 because it has been touched from a 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.509
 midi driver in the form of piano very 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.720
 well the style is key style of sun 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:09.100
 which is how I would not tell a guitarist 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.100
 and what we do is simply 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.439
 locate all the notes that we want that 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.439
 be the notes that touch the thumb 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.390
 i 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.680
 very good the last note all are in 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:36.079
 green ready to edit then in 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.810
 attributes found in the submenu of 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:41.940
 attributes we found another menu where 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.290
 says independent very well 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.350
 we oppress independent and the notes 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.700
 are automatically separated from 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.920
 down 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.879
 with the ones above simply what 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.780
 I do is in the same window where it says 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.030
 attributes 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.810
 and ask him to put the escrows for me 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:10.510
 down that is how a guitarist reads them 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:13.240
 correctly and the notes that in 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.690
 theory are going to touch the other fingers 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:22.120
 should go with the esclicas up 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:25.590
 the same thing I do in the bottom part of the 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.590
 system in the second system 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.060
 very well here I have then a 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.370
 music sheet 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.450
 with the notes already separated so that the 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:43.530
 can read a guitarist 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.530
 in a clear and logical and simple way
