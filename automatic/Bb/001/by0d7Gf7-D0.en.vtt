creating Super Smash Brothers you know
you<00:02:28.660> go<00:02:29.080> further<00:02:29.290> back<00:02:29.410> he<00:02:29.920> he<00:02:30.340> was<00:02:30.459> involved

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
you go further back he he was involved

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.470

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
in those the mother games or earthbound

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.729 
in those the mother games or earthbound
and<00:02:34.480> I<00:02:34.510> mean<00:02:34.840> he<00:02:35.200> had<00:02:35.290> all<00:02:35.319> sorts<00:02:35.709> of

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.050 
and I mean he had all sorts of
influences<00:02:35.950> The<00:02:36.310> Dude's<00:02:36.489> been<00:02:36.640> around<00:02:36.849> for<00:02:37.030> a

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
long time and so this man had a very

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.199 
long time and so this man had a very
direct<00:02:43.840> impact<00:02:44.049> on<00:02:44.739> all<00:02:45.670> of<00:02:45.700> our<00:02:45.940> gaming
