00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.030
 may christoph I have three 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.830
 investigative questions for you should 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.820
 you do not respond to a then can 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.170
 you also like something about your family 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.799
 tell that I think quite synonymous 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.690
 Interesting 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.369
 in an interview with the porters you 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.350
 said that on youtube channels in 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.060
 future rather independent formats 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.070
 so personalities are going to run that way 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.289
 youtube he becomes a format collection 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.140
 on the then persons from thum 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.869
 media force also describes itself as 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.980
 internet tv sometimes only 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.110
 TV channel 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.450
 my first question where exactly is now 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.670
 again the exact difference from that 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.070
 youtube that you imagine perfect 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.840
 to watch TV yes that he is watching TV 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.100
 because if it would not be watching TV 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.690
 you sit right here in front of me and me 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.730
 the question ask an assist television 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.649
 the only difference that exists in the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.059
 You can only watch it on conventional television 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.949
 to determine everything in succession 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.379
 see times on youtube is the video 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.120
 on demand and I can see it when I am 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.870
 want that great but that youtube 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.449
 anyone can make videos there so it can 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.979
 Democratic and offers completely new 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.570
 possibilities and that's the big one 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.220
 difference and therefore it will be there 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.619
 change a lot but watch TV 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.420
 is both a second question you are 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.850
 certainly one of the faces of 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.280
 youtube and almost the face of media 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.270
 force therefore for the change of youtube in 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.369
 significant recent years 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.619
 responsible do you see yourself rather than 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.720
 a kind of prometheus from youtube or 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.630
 rather than a kind of chic true of 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.939
 youtube so enlighten or revoluzzer 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.060
 you're right there is one of them 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.100
 responsible for that is youtube 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.040
 has changed in recent years 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.590
 and that is the spectator a single one 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.540
 person can not do that 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.890
 spectators in recent years 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.979
 he just wants to change things 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.530
 be entertained and me and also 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.409
 Networks can not do anything else than 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.600
 the spectator wishes to fulfill 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.350
 and there youtube has much more 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.790
 possibilities because 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.580
 the audience an incredible 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.619
 bandwidth has to be selected but he chooses 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.140
 and he determines what will be successful 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.310
 third question why has media power 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.080
 actually still such a strong one 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.940
 image problem and why is the only one 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.920
 what is being done about it 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.750
 occasionally write from facebook 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.540
 posts or youtube comments 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.190
 yes I do not know why you and yourself 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.440
 magst is because of that to another 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.600
 There are a few people on the network 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.750
 youtube the sentences still on 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.220
 confrontations I think it's great 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.040
 if we all go in the direction of that 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.569
 we would work together too 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.459
 across the network boundaries 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.459
 We make it happen 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.690
 intensive cooperations with people who 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.670
 not at media power 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.620
 and then I think we would 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.989
 do community in huge favor and me 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.260
 am happy about every one who is going 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.790
 Demand he is jan ammann end purpose 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.739
 It would basically be a possibility 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.000
 that he says I would like to 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.019
 a cooperation with floyd macher and such 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.610
 seen we are in different 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.019
 networks it would work yes 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.329
 Absolutely there is something about yourself 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.500
 sick and burki have been making everlasting 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.600
 time cooperation 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.180
 that's no problem at all because of me 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.700
 I am convinced that cooperation 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.510
 bring something to everyone as said youtube 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.190
 is starting again 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.930
 there is no competition at all because 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.690
 the area we are fighting over 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.200
 infinitely big that means everyone can only 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.609
 to grow 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.920
 so there is no such thing 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:23.109
 problem I was yesterday at the outsider 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.370
 to the outdoors which I supported 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.690
 we all think we are a giant 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.609
 We like it when we work together 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.070
 down and felix one more thing 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.900
 between colleagues, the answers should 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.549
 not quite as bad as I think so 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.170
 desired and you should with the 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.609
 format may still be watching TV 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.290
 we have to go again 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.600
 entertained because I can actually 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.250
 not that my face is in 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.720
 television is shown and that also from 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.730
 lovingly produced clips in me 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.170
 be shown because that's what you do 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.540
 Otherwise I do not and there is too 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.739
 somewhere a limit for me not 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.540
 that you are in the wrong picture of me 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:57.880
 arises or so yes my dear friends 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.799
 if you liked this user question 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.900
 We are happy if you are positive 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.670
 rated with a thumbs up 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.620
 and if you want to know what christoph 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.140
 crashed to this question since when is coming 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.000
 Just get sick on the moving picture 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.860
 Click and look at the answer 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.760
 and until then I wish one more 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.760
 nice day up here
