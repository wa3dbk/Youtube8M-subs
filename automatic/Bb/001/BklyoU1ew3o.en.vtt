prompt<00:00:52.230> there<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.680> way<00:00:52.890> around<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:53.670> if

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
prompt there is a way around that so if

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.369 
prompt there is a way around that so if
you're<00:00:53.940> connecting<00:00:54.360> remotely<00:00:54.449> for<00:00:54.960> example

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
you're connecting remotely for example

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.119 
you're connecting remotely for example
with<00:00:56.070> remote<00:00:56.399> desktop<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:57.800> believe<00:00:58.800> for<00:00:58.949> most

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
with remote desktop I believe for most

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.060 
with remote desktop I believe for most
of<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> versions<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.180> grayed<00:01:00.480> out<00:01:00.559> so<00:01:01.559> what

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
of the versions it is grayed out so what

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.910 
of the versions it is grayed out so what
you<00:01:02.190> would<00:01:02.280> do<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:03.170> first<00:01:04.170> open<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.680> command

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
you would do is first open the command

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.609 
you would do is first open the command
prompt<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.060> either<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.630> by<00:01:06.810> finding

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
prompt you can either do that by finding

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.920 
prompt you can either do that by finding
in<00:01:07.799> your<00:01:07.920> Program<00:01:08.250> Files<00:01:08.280> or<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:09.750> go<00:01:09.869> to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
in your Program Files or you can go to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.380
