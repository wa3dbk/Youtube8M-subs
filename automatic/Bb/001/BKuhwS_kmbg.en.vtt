00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.500
 had it 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.470
 you put it incredibly strong 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.000
 wholemeal received the vacation 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.740
 they just don't make the second half 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.760
 must last hours to where it 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.920
 became messy with you 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.770
 because it had multiple causes that we 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.660
 played an excellent game and there 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.010
 has been a lot of struggle in the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.809
 final stages and that is part of a 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.030
 derby so there I always trade there 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.410
 a bit of aggression and like some things 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.400
 happen on the field 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.170
 so nice now 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.540
 was closing a bit out of slippers 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.450
 a card during the match 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.070
 I had to take the role for it 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.650
 for my team I thought there was one 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.880
 decisions were again those 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.800
 other side blown all must 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.600
 we got and give first eleven 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.150
 two kings against that total of 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.070
 kings and certainly the 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.360
 with last week in the back of my mind as 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.830
 I do have an advertisement 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.540
 they swing boys i don't like my team 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.780
 be disadvantaged and I got that feeling 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.780
 well 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.830
 what was it like to score and put in it 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.479
 yes that is always nice that there is some more 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.740
 can make today but good it is 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.330
 remain your own 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.080
 training dogs is a very good thing 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.510
 took notice of operations behind you 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.310
 you wind at your old level or 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.490
 yes it is all well went well, the 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.170
 operation and evaluated properly 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.690
 which does not bother anything so I come now 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.990
 I can I have everything more everything again 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.990

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.530
 Well there are guys happy about that 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.360
 who were in the game were substitutes 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.040

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.840
