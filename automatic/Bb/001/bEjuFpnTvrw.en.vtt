 we are a video of gta 5 I am in a 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.660
 video where I wanted to talk about several 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.150
 little things on the dbc and 7-5 online and 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.330
 some curiosities are worth it then it has 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.730
 been there has been talking during this 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.520
 day and yesterday when you read the tlc vale 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.490
 as you already know yesterday the lcd came out 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.439
 I'm not a hipster and well that tlc does not 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.789
 Ads will not be above and 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.810
 we knew there was going to be a 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.880
 update and there will be 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.490
 updates in spring before 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.499
 prime spring and also in that 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.089
 news that gave rockstar not that in 

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:38.899
 spring was showing of lecer ha 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:41.659
 there have been two or three there and it says 6 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.420
 they will also be in spring 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:46.459
 spring is worth a spring is a 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.729
 season of the year obviously but when 

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:54.079
 it was spring in 2014 because the 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:57.940
 spring in 2014 ends on June 21 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:01.390
 and rockstar promised bank robberies 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.250
 spring so yes it is true that 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.159
 comes or is it true that it reaches 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.690
 be finishing in spring to face him 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:12.610
 there are three days left today 18 19 20 21 en 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.920
 an assumption because maybe roses 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.549
 well he has gone a little bit the 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.080
 time and has not been able to prepare it as 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.060
 would have liked those robberies to banks 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.210
 but it is true that they promised to 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.729
 spring and spring because it is already 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.039
 end do not know what you think and 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.800
 bank robberies will not be like this 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.270
 that is something that is there that carries 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.460
 They had been promising since he left 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.990
 is online on October 1 had already been 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.360
 promising that robberies would come 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.009
 fact banks in the trailer I went to the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.440
 bank robbery missions and in the end 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.899
 because nothing promised for spring 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.850
 Spring ended but we do not know 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.030
 there will be a new a new update 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.340
 the 1.15 in these three days we do not know 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.399
 so well that's a part of what 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.590
 I wanted to talk in the video apart from the tlc 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.060
 which is a pass already I know that in the saw 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.040
 yesterday where Analyze 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.329
 there were many things that he did not put because 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.740
 try to record fast to have it 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.140
 fast I was not going to have a little the afternoon 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.750
 so I recorded it that fast and it 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.770
 there were several things left for dissolved 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.270
 but well you said about the 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.670
 comments I put in the description 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.680
 some things and good everything solved 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.150
 so do not see the first issue that 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.980
 wants to play and now the second one is 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.769
 also very very important and good the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.280
 second topic that I wanted to touch has to 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:30.130
 see about the jetpack if the jetpack as 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.319
 you already know in update 1.13 and in 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.390
 the 1.12 in the game files has 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.780
 appeared a keyword not that it was 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.940
 true, well, that's the word jet 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.920
 for he found it because the typical about 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.830
 I found everything I said the color 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.140
 Gold sees it from the tinting of the 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.080
 crystals I also said what about the cars 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.430
 that could enter 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.440
 in the hipster update the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.450
 mystery update that I already uploaded 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.160
 a week before the dlc came out 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.260
 did not filter this same hacker 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.630
 which is trustworthy for good this 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.240
 hacker as soon as you leave at 1.14 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.210
 it goes to your game file and looks 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.200
 jetpack and that is then that this 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.060
 image this image is found 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.850
 literally camps 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.090
 finn jr cpa so you can not find the 10 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:19.170
 bat in the game files as in the 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.660
 1.13 and a to 1.12 if it came out 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.320
 and what does jetpack mean? 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.860
 will be the jetpack will not be or will be 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.640
 hidden and rockstar does not want that is not 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.490
 wants what 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.010
 that word appears in your game and what 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.080
 I want to keep hidden in private and 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.380
 that no one has access to those 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.370
 files we do not know what we do know 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.959
 is that the word 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.510
 does not appear in the game files to 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.459
 the best they have camouflaged with another 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.930
 word is also said to be 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.610
 preparing something big 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.800
 rockstar some fat update 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.930
 where include this with some mission 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.300
 something that includes the jetpack because he 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.090
 1.12 1.13 yes that word appeared and 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.800
 well a loophole was mounted and it is confirmed 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.080
 I do not know what the archives of the 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.000
 game and well then good to face 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.519
 he noticed and has eliminated the word 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.830
 jetpack and in fact instead of the word 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:16.489
 jetpack now leaves a word non Ã¨ that 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.680
 it's nothing not then I do not know if it's 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.690
 hesitating or not worth it because before where 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.880
 put the jetpack will do anything nothing 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.950
 nothing there is nothing there is nothing that you 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.470
 you want, that is, there is nothing that you 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.730
 hacker amount is worth the one that gets 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.250
 here in the game files there is no 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.020
 nothing that you care about or we do not know 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.480
 very well what will you mean by this the 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.530
 Comment that you 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.060

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.370
 give me your opinion so much of the tlc 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.400
 new like these files that no longer 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.500
 appear in gta 5 and I do not know if it will be 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.720
 for a future update and that 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.090
 nobody knows anything before time like we 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.200
 he's used to the hackers so 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.640
 Well I hope you liked a 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.050
