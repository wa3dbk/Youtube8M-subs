00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.770 
plane got a testimony on straight floats
and<00:02:15.140> it's<00:02:15.680> a<00:02:15.830> simple<00:02:16.160> plane<00:02:16.400> but<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:17.569> me<00:02:17.750> I

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
and it's a simple plane but to me I

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.720 
and it's a simple plane but to me I
think<00:02:18.319> it<00:02:18.410> really<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:19.040> mean<00:02:19.160> that's<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.459> plane

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
think it really I mean that's the plane

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.110 
think it really I mean that's the plane
I<00:02:19.970> basically<00:02:20.209> learned<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.810> fly<00:02:20.989> it<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:22.120> it

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
I basically learned to fly it and it

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.080 
I basically learned to fly it and it
just<00:02:23.180> represents<00:02:24.040> such<00:02:25.040> freedom<00:02:25.489> of<00:02:25.640> kind<00:02:25.970> of

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
just represents such freedom of kind of

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.420 
just represents such freedom of kind of
getting<00:02:26.599> up<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.170> hopping<00:02:27.890> around<00:02:28.010> on<00:02:28.310> the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
getting up and hopping around on the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.940 
getting up and hopping around on the
different<00:02:28.760> lakes<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.420> just<00:02:30.319> true<00:02:30.530> sneaking

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
different lakes and just true sneaking

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.610
