00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
station front end and well it's pretty

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.139 
station front end and well it's pretty
slow<00:00:38.489> going<00:00:38.520> i've<00:00:39.030> got<00:00:39.239> about<00:00:40.460> about<00:00:41.460> 4,000

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
slow going i've got about about 4,000

realms<00:00:42.480> i<00:00:43.399> expected<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.520> not<00:00:44.700> find<00:00:45.800> um

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
realms i expected to not find um

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.420 
realms i expected to not find um
probably<00:00:47.730> about<00:00:50.149> fifteen<00:00:51.149> hundred<00:00:51.180> ohms

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
probably about fifteen hundred ohms

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.100 
probably about fifteen hundred ohms
because<00:00:53.430> they're<00:00:53.610> not<00:00:53.789> named<00:00:54.030> correctly<00:00:54.390> they

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
because they're not named correctly they

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.099 
because they're not named correctly they
have<00:00:55.789> this<00:00:56.789> depends<00:00:57.210> heavily<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.719> file

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
have this depends heavily on the file

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.939 
have this depends heavily on the file
name<00:00:58.879> right<00:00:59.879> now<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.170> i<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.469> wanted<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.739> show

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
name right now but i just wanted to show

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.320 
name right now but i just wanted to show
you<00:01:01.980> how<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.280> slow<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:04.309> so<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.729> sometimes

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
you how to slow it as so and sometimes

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.750 
you how to slow it as so and sometimes
these<00:01:06.810> lists<00:01:07.260> are<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.560> large<00:01:07.770> they<00:01:08.250> go<00:01:08.430> off<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
these lists are so large they go off the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.929 
these lists are so large they go off the
screen<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.780> resolution<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.860> i<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.580> to

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
screen in this resolution so i have to

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.940 
screen in this resolution so i have to
just<00:01:12.150> skip<00:01:12.450> them<00:01:12.920> so<00:01:15.290> basically<00:01:16.290> i'm<00:01:16.890> running

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
just skip them so basically i'm running

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.719 
just skip them so basically i'm running
in<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.420> new<00:01:18.570> mode<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.990> he<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.320> added

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
in the new mode that he just added

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.810 
in the new mode that he just added
allows<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:22.009> interactively<00:01:23.009> pick<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
allows you to interactively pick the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.399 
allows you to interactively pick the
wrong<00:01:25.159> information<00:01:26.840> because<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.619> would<00:01:29.119> often

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
wrong information because it would often

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.760 
wrong information because it would often
use<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.439> wrong<00:01:31.799> information<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:33.030> as<00:01:33.840> you

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
use the wrong information like as you

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.149 
use the wrong information like as you
can<00:01:34.860> see<00:01:35.130> here<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.780> game<00:01:37.560> Solomon's

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
can see here this is the game Solomon's

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.660 
can see here this is the game Solomon's
key<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:40.170> top<00:01:40.409> pick<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.860> Solomon's<00:01:41.310> key<00:01:41.520> to

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
key and the top pick is Solomon's key to

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.399 
key and the top pick is Solomon's key to
so<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:45.060> actually<00:01:45.390> have<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.750> pick<00:01:45.899> number<00:01:46.229> one

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
so I actually have to pick number one

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.399 
so I actually have to pick number one
which<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.680> not<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.220> default<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.290> why

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
which is not the default so this is why

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.010 
which is not the default so this is why
it's<00:01:49.470> going<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.770> take<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.159> long<00:01:50.570> but<00:01:51.570> basically

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
it's going to take so long but basically

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.080 
it's going to take so long but basically
I<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.290> wanted<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.619> show<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.829> how<00:01:53.310> flow<00:01:53.790> going

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
I just wanted to show you how flow going

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.750 
I just wanted to show you how flow going
it<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:56.240> won't<00:01:57.240> there<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.570> go
