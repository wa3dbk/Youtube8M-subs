00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.890
 tell us king and I'm doing this video 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:09.950
 in order to make an analysis about 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.120
 two well-known minecraft games and 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.299
 terrarium 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.820
 minecraft this game was created in java 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.460
 by markus persson which is the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.400
 founder of moyano the first version of 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.880
 minecraft was released on May 17, 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.070
 2009 called minecraft classic the date 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.470
 of official launch was on 19 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.230
 November 2011 although they had 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.050
 planned to release it on the 11th of month 11 of 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.719
 year 2011 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.559
 then I will say some points that 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.640
 minecraft has in its favor number 1 the 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.680
 freedom of construction 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.600
 minecraft is a game based on the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.910
 construction of structures with all the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.530
 freedom that the player wishes through 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.000
 the use of blocks that the player can 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.730
 get no survival mode 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.040
 through that effort or the creative way 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.080
 in which the player can get 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.940
 all the blocks you want in the 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.970
 amount you want to facilitate your 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.200
 I work considerably number 2 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.600
 the multiplayer mode 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.090
 another of the great things that this has 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.039
 game is the multiplayer mode in which 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.170
 two or more people can try to 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:19.899
 survive in survival mode or 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.780
 extreme to build great things or 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.850
 destroy the mods one of the big 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.549
 things that Maika has is her immense 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.649
 number of modes the mods are the ones 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.780
 create alterations in the game that are 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.490
 for the player's convenience or for 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.310
 Enjoy the same 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.340
 bad things that looked bad in casting to 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.360
 its really number one does not have many 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.980
 things to do 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.200
 that climate in which it offers a great 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.510
 freedom to build as already 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.880
 previously I mentioned but at the time of 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.220
 the truth I as a common player of 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.470
 minecraft then usually after 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.190
 build my house I do not see him much 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.380
 sense of the game 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.680
 they burn gas has bosses like the inter 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.140
 dragon or the winter but still with the 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.400
 I spend the time do not see much sense 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.640
 keep playing 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.070
 Radio is a game inspired by Manca 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.080
 although then but just as it rages 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.670
 was inspired by minecraft minecraft 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.770
 he also copied some ideas from 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.290
 terrarium because when terrarium was created 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.940
 minecraft lost some pressures already 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.690
 they wanted to see what it was 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.270
 terrarium some did not like others 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.420
 and the good things that I consider of 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.760
 centenary number one the amount of 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.920
 objects the difference of minecraft from 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.170
 rare already has more objects at the time of 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.690
 create owns more materials for 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.760
 build and apart has the magic 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.220
 which is more advanced to try since 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.290
 in combat mode here is another point to 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.930
 favor of this rally would also close 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.790
 has a more entertaining combat mode 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.050
 while minecraft has a mode of 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.050
 combat perhaps something more 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.010
 bad things of pepper stripe 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.940
 number one may result after 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.069
 some time somewhat tedious of rage like this 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.100
 as have many objects do 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:17.530
 it can be annoying for everything 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.709
 what you must do to obtain them 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.110
 the final analysis according to me both are 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.390
 great games but choosing what is the 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.190
 better depends on your kind of tastes 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.110
 Stripe on the other hand is a good game for 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.660
 fight and have a good time with the 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.310
 friends killing big bosses although if 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.890
 I like to build and assumed the 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.420
 Mayan friends in your fire plus that 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.790
 minecraft brings a great 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.650
 mobile community what can get 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.080
 to be from minecraft in a game much more 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.569
 entertaining if you agree with me 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.610
 or disagree expressly continue down 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:52.590
 in the comments if you like the video 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.590
 can you thank him for watching
