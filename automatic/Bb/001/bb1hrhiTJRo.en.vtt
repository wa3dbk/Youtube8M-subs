George M from performance catapults and
this<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.540> SPS<00:00:16.490> it's<00:00:17.490> Matt<00:00:17.670> off<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.000> think<00:00:18.210> red

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
this is SPS it's Matt off I think red

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.150 
this is SPS it's Matt off I think red
would<00:00:18.480> red<00:00:19.320> oak<00:00:19.470> or<00:00:19.770> something<00:00:20.300> with<00:00:21.300> g10

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
would red oak or something with g10

spacers<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:24.140> metalcore<00:00:26.810> set<00:00:27.810> up<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.199> could

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
spacers in metalcore set up so you could

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.970 
spacers in metalcore set up so you could
do<00:00:28.470> loops<00:00:29.359> ball<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.599> tube<00:00:30.810> flat<00:00:31.470> band

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
do loops ball and tube flat band

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.569 
do loops ball and tube flat band
it's<00:00:32.550> best<00:00:32.850> with<00:00:33.420> loops<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.840> my<00:00:33.960> opinion

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
it's best with loops in my opinion

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:42.400 
it's best with loops in my opinion
excellent<00:00:35.899> feel<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:39.690> SPS<00:00:40.079> normally<00:00:40.469> has<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
excellent feel the SPS normally has a

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.150 
excellent feel the SPS normally has a
two<00:00:43.789> pins<00:00:44.809> but<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.840> hadn't<00:00:46.260> pin<00:00:46.500> an<00:00:46.649> extra<00:00:46.980> one

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
two pins but I hadn't pin an extra one

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.549 
two pins but I hadn't pin an extra one
just<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:48.180> as<00:00:48.329> an<00:00:48.480> identify<00:00:48.989> it's<00:00:49.200> not<00:00:49.320> really

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
just just as an identify it's not really

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.069 
just just as an identify it's not really
necessary<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.360> really<00:00:51.600> great<00:00:51.809> feel

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
necessary but it's a really great feel

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:24.290 
necessary but it's a really great feel
I'm<00:00:52.410> gonna<00:00:52.559> do<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> few<00:00:53.039> shots<00:00:53.070> ten<00:00:53.610> meters

professional<00:01:30.100> slingshot<00:01:30.549> I<00:01:30.579> guess<00:01:30.850> if<00:01:31.060> you

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
professional slingshot I guess if you

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.330 
professional slingshot I guess if you
would<00:01:31.359> say<00:01:31.509> this<00:01:32.499> is<00:01:32.679> definitely<00:01:32.890> one<00:01:33.189> of<00:01:33.219> the

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
would say this is definitely one of the

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.090 
would say this is definitely one of the
top<00:01:33.490> of<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.729> lines<00:01:33.939> we<00:01:34.810> all<00:01:35.020> sling<00:01:35.319> shots<00:01:35.590> as

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
top of the lines we all sling shots as

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.679 
top of the lines we all sling shots as
long<00:01:36.280> as<00:01:36.369> it<00:01:36.490> attaches<00:01:36.700> rubber<00:01:37.060> it's<00:01:37.240> good<00:01:37.450> but

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
long as it attaches rubber it's good but

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.149 
long as it attaches rubber it's good but
feel<00:01:38.380> this<00:01:38.619> it's<00:01:38.859> really<00:01:39.130> sturdy<00:01:39.399> and<00:01:41.159> it

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
feel this it's really sturdy and it

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.130 
feel this it's really sturdy and it
really<00:01:42.429> sets<00:01:42.700> right<00:01:42.969> with<00:01:43.450> your<00:01:43.600> when<00:01:44.020> you're

loop<00:01:49.450> it's<00:01:50.259> kind<00:01:50.439> of<00:01:50.530> hard<00:01:51.009> for<00:01:51.099> me<00:01:51.219> but<00:01:51.459> this

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
loop it's kind of hard for me but this

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.660 
loop it's kind of hard for me but this
sort<00:01:51.969> of<00:01:52.560> forces<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.590> loops<00:01:53.920> in<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.490> right

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
sort of forces the loops in the right

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.419 
sort of forces the loops in the right
position<00:01:55.119> some<00:01:55.899> good<00:01:56.109> shooting<00:01:56.319> and<00:01:59.429> that's

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
position some good shooting and that's

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:01.559 
position some good shooting and that's
it<00:02:00.670> all<00:02:01.329> right

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
it all right
