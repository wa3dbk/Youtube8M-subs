00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
series and I able to continue doing

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.290 
series and I able to continue doing
stuff<00:00:24.029> because<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:25.460> lot<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.490> time<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:27.180> make

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
stuff because a lot of time to make

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.859 
stuff because a lot of time to make
stuff<00:00:27.539> for<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.380> guys<00:00:28.410> but<00:00:29.539> either<00:00:30.539> way<00:00:30.750> this

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
stuff for you guys but either way this

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.790 
stuff for you guys but either way this
is<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.050> good<00:00:31.140> exploit<00:00:32.809> an<00:00:33.809> office<00:00:34.140> exploit<00:00:34.620> or

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
is a good exploit an office exploit or

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.350 
is a good exploit an office exploit or
how<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.430> would<00:00:35.610> work<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.969> don't<00:00:36.090> even<00:00:36.180> know<00:00:36.300> if

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
how it would work I don't even know if

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.319 
how it would work I don't even know if
they<00:00:36.450> can<00:00:36.570> fix<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.899> as<00:00:37.050> probably<00:00:37.290> we'll<00:00:37.500> try

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
they can fix this as probably we'll try

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.970 
they can fix this as probably we'll try
if<00:00:39.329> you're<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.660> person<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.620> know<00:00:40.739> really

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
if you're a person that you know really

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.190 
if you're a person that you know really
wants<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.399> get<00:00:41.579> motives<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.780> don't<00:00:42.989> want

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
wants to get motives and you don't want

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.130 
wants to get motives and you don't want
to<00:00:43.290> wait<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.649> find<00:00:44.399> them<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.629> respectful

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
to wait and find them in a respectful

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.590 
to wait and find them in a respectful
regular<00:00:46.860> way<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:48.000> something<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.420> you

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
regular way this is something that you

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.869 
regular way this is something that you
can<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.559> know<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.770> method<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.280> probably

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
can do you know the method is probably

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.209 
can do you know the method is probably

building then all you have to do is

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.469 
building then all you have to do is
relog<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.250> come<00:01:05.489> back<00:01:05.640> into<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.000> game<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.390> all

relog a come back into the game and all
the<00:01:06.630> chests<00:01:06.840> will<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.080> reset<00:01:07.470> with<00:01:07.619> loot<00:01:08.000> and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
the chests will be reset with loot and

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.880 
the chests will be reset with loot and
it<00:01:09.689> might<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:09.960> different<00:01:10.170> chests<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:10.740> some

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
it might be different chests like some

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.990 
it might be different chests like some
of<00:01:10.979> them<00:01:11.100> might<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.670> where<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
of them might be like this where the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.880 
of them might be like this where the
that<00:01:12.390> has<00:01:12.570> nothing<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:12.990> first<00:01:13.110> place<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
that has nothing in the first place the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.340 
that has nothing in the first place the
bookshelves<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.430> do<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.640> think<00:01:14.880> reset<00:01:15.450> books

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
bookshelves I do not think reset books

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.929 
bookshelves I do not think reset books
so<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.890> don't<00:01:17.250> think<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.700> like

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
so I don't think you can get like

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.749 
so I don't think you can get like
different<00:01:18.420> skill<00:01:18.630> points<00:01:18.960> from<00:01:19.020> home<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.470> I

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
different skill points from home but I

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.980 
different skill points from home but I
haven't<00:01:20.759> really<00:01:20.909> tried<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.210> much<00:01:21.330> now<00:01:21.630> I'll

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
haven't really tried that much now I'll

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
know the other places they should have

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.340 
know the other places they should have
the<00:01:32.220> major<00:01:32.400> fighter<00:01:33.000> guilt<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.479> their<00:01:33.689> town

the major fighter guilt in their town

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.710 
the major fighter guilt in their town
and<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.710> should<00:01:34.890> be<00:01:35.040> very<00:01:35.369> similar<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.180> so

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
and it should be very similar to this so

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.060 
and it should be very similar to this so
it's<00:01:36.869> not<00:01:36.990> necessarily<00:01:37.590> gonna<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.920> same

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
it's not necessarily gonna be the same

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.560 
it's not necessarily gonna be the same
but<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.490> gonna<00:01:38.640> have<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> lot<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.090> chests<00:01:39.390> most

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
but it's gonna have a lot of chests most

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.999 
but it's gonna have a lot of chests most
likely<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:40.020> find<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.590> building<00:01:40.799> with<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> lot

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
likely just find a building with a lot

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.030 
likely just find a building with a lot

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
little way to go around this one and

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.060 
little way to go around this one and

video<00:02:39.620> is<00:02:39.800> I<00:02:39.980> literally<00:02:40.430> just<00:02:40.700> found<00:02:40.910> like<00:02:41.480> I

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
video is I literally just found like I

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.090 
video is I literally just found like I
don't<00:02:43.250> know<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:43.580> was<00:02:43.730> like<00:02:43.760> 4<00:02:44.510> in<00:02:44.930> like<00:02:45.200> two<00:02:45.920> of

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
don't know it was like 4 in like two of

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.670 
don't know it was like 4 in like two of
these<00:02:46.250> runs<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.900> was<00:02:48.550> absolutely<00:02:49.550> ridiculous

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680

and in all honesty I think it should be

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.590 
and in all honesty I think it should be
fixed<00:02:54.680> all<00:02:55.520> right<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:55.880> we're<00:02:56.030> already<00:02:56.180> done
