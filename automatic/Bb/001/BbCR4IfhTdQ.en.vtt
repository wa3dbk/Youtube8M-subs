00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
behind a certain theory and then we go

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.290 
behind a certain theory and then we go
ahead<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.230> move<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.710> into<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.340> lab<00:00:59.699> setting<00:01:00.000> or

ahead and move on into a lab setting or
a<00:01:00.329> clinical<00:01:00.780> setting<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.230> that's<00:01:01.710> where<00:01:01.890> they

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
a clinical setting and that's where they

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.470 
a clinical setting and that's where they
take<00:01:02.190> what<00:01:02.399> they've<00:01:02.579> learned<00:01:02.609> didactically

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.530 
take what they've learned didactically
and<00:01:03.870> apply<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:05.189> real<00:01:05.220> life<00:01:05.760> situations

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
and apply it to real life situations

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.920 
and apply it to real life situations
it's<00:01:07.260> been<00:01:07.590> tough<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.689> making<00:01:09.689> an

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
it's been tough just making an

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.990 
it's been tough just making an
adaptation<00:01:10.189> to<00:01:11.450> getting<00:01:12.450> all<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> work<00:01:12.810> done

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
adaptation to getting all the work done

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.450 
adaptation to getting all the work done
but<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.390> what<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.659> love<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.470> do<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.860> I

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
but it's what I love to do and I

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.850 
but it's what I love to do and I
realized<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.420> program<00:01:18.840> even<00:01:19.259> more<00:01:19.470> that

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
realized in this program even more that

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.469 
realized in this program even more that
it's<00:01:20.009> what<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.220> wanted<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.670> do<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.299> very

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
it's what I wanted to do it's a very

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.490 
it's what I wanted to do it's a very
diverse<00:01:21.689> group<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.729> I<00:01:23.729> feel<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.270> our

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
diverse group and I feel like our

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.570 
diverse group and I feel like our
instructors<00:01:25.500> make<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> lot<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.070> fun

they're very motivating and caring by
starting<00:01:29.700> out<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.270> simulation<00:01:30.780> lab

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
starting out in a simulation lab

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.080 
starting out in a simulation lab
students<00:01:32.070> are<00:01:32.159> prepared<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.759> handle

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
students are prepared to handle

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.330 
students are prepared to handle
real-life<00:01:33.659> situations<00:01:34.470> we<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.280> a

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
real-life situations we have a

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.069 
real-life situations we have a
simulation<00:01:35.820> unit<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.509> they<00:01:36.659> start<00:01:36.930> out<00:01:37.020> small

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
simulation unit so they start out small

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.010 
simulation unit so they start out small
they<00:01:38.040> work<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.790> simulation<00:01:39.509> mannequins

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
they work on the simulation mannequins

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.800 
they work on the simulation mannequins
and<00:01:40.350> then<00:01:40.890> once<00:01:41.310> they<00:01:41.549> show<00:01:41.880> competency<00:01:42.540> from

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
and then once they show competency from

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.899 
and then once they show competency from
that<00:01:43.049> then<00:01:43.409> they<00:01:43.530> move<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> student

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
that then they move on to a student

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.760 
that then they move on to a student
partnership<00:01:45.570> work<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> student<00:01:46.350> partner

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
partnership work with a student partner

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.429 
partnership work with a student partner
show<00:01:47.729> competency<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.630> area<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.229> then

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
show competency in that area and then

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.649 
show competency in that area and then
move<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.189> life<00:01:50.490> patient<00:01:50.970> volunteers<00:01:51.450> from

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
move on to life patient volunteers from

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.710 
move on to life patient volunteers from
the<00:01:51.720> community<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.530> that's<00:01:53.490> really<00:01:54.119> later<00:01:54.450> on

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
the community and that's really later on

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.170 
the community and that's really later on
third<00:01:55.500> fourth<00:01:55.829> semester<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.670> they've<00:01:57.000> really

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
third fourth semester and they've really

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.420 
third fourth semester and they've really
used<00:01:58.020> those<00:01:58.229> dental<00:01:58.500> hygiene<00:01:58.799> skills<00:01:59.130> learned

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
used those dental hygiene skills learned
