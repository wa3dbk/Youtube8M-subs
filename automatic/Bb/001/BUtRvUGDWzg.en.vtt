00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
 the first a summer day today they can enjoy one for weeks 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.380
 beautiful spring they are no more exceptions than the average 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.760
 temperature in the netherlands it is now the same as in the south 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.239
 French lyon thirty years ago 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:14.979
 wonderful all that sunshine 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:17.329
 but nature seems to have difficulty with it 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.989
 because tropical animals and plants ruth buy the north 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.179
 we have been because of a large migration going on in the dutch 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.479
 nature was actually a good thing if I had said it ten years ago 

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:32.160
 a few six with fc uden to case can also piece of meat total 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.400
 but if you put this you may 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.130
 it does not consist of 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.370
 4 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.820
 keep looking for the oak processionary caterpillar in drente it is new 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.770
 this year the alien bit can also be seen in the northern netherlands 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.630
 the fire brigade is deployed to stop the advance because the hair of it 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.570
 can cause many talents 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.610
 i don't know can buy 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.960
 we will get it in a more balanced way 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.810
 at the parade 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.290
 if you only get on your skin 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.710
 rkc 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.030
 go more out very much more i talk the more 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.760
 is released is not going to talk well 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.470
 so within 8 hours you are completely bold and blue 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.900
 to reverse the alternative route it is 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.430
 shafts as the game gets settled on your throat it is in each 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.340
 case 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.740
 and you do not have to climb into tops of trees in foreign ones 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.450
 destination 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.450
 in the roadside 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.730
 you should take a good look below, actually a nest 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.730
 looking for the perfect one 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.460
 he has been rescheduled for weeks 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.640
 this is coming to you this summer 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.570
 because the temperature rise caused a plane to fall in our direction 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.280
 society can count because here too 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.880
 for the other sports providers it is therefore larger it seems to me it is one 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.090
 horrible 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.090
 no I think it's an honor 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.090
 about 5 in the end 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.579
 it is nice to see this yes all those new species 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.479
 the that has risen and wits 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:15.279
 the framework in which that takes place 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:16.859
 9 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.649
 you have to take care of the biologist but why he didn't make it shocking 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:21.199
 is doing 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:24.649
 we should not be happy with kecks otys and surprises 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:27.789
 I find it very worrying mvl 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:31.899
 Because it is an indication of both those changes going it goes much faster 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:32.299
 then 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.389
 if that says ten fifteen years ago would have thought possible, that's bad 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:37.609
 that speed 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.290
 yes, because that is certainly in view of what is expected to be a teammate 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:42.079
 change 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.409
 how could plants and animals go quickly 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.559
 most important thing is that we have plants and animal species that are of the speed of 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:50.009
 can't keep up with orange 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:52.249
 can write five or six tips 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:53.209
 a whole people 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.209
 five days later 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:00.879
 it was not the first time that it was one 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.590
 been a whole netherlands for a few years but I also prevented that 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.189
 communicated 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.529
 and if that's not the beasts you see, don't just walk on a little plus 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:12.489
 mixed up and I also work deceased 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.580
 problem is we are just at the beginning of rising temperatures 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.670
 if that would have been so but that is really just a start with what is there 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.709
 being told 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.829
 we have no idea if it has indeed been reported 2 3 4 about 5 6 degrees 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.109
 gets warmer on average 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.499
 how green should this look like spanish this is probably the 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:34.889
 temperature in any case still need some rain to wait 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.550
 the fact is that 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.360
 under those circumstances will of course always be completely different 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.679
 go find out 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.929
 the Dutch landscape seems to have had its day 

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:47.240
 due to rising temperatures and the arrival of 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.329
 this her own babies 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.349
 dangerous during the first season 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:53.749
 and the fact that from 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:55.839
 also has help me 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:04:00.900
 and hereby in a week tell the suspect that it has ended 

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:01.779
 year 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:03.749
 and then the hot spots come 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:06.749
 and then you are inconvenienced by geert timmer 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:11.029
 And if the participant does not have open space then you can go in even in the winter 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:14.029
 Spring can also be bothered by it 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.060
 Florian is also a game breaker, however, it is bad for us 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.620
 It is natural why I am asking people to think about that 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.400
 that means 7 3 4 degrees warmer 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.790
 and then to think of the must that would stand themselves but also their children 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.659
 and grandchildren and what world of a legend 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.629
 we are only in the Netherlands 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:38.129
 with defective games on a global scale and that is not nice
