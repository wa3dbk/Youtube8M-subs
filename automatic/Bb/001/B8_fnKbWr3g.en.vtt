00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
you can use this let's say for example

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.040 
you can use this let's say for example
you<00:00:31.109> want<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.650> demonstrate<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.880> new<00:00:33.270> app<00:00:33.570> to

it<00:00:51.870> into<00:00:52.010> text<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.190> gives<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> answer

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
it into text and it gives you the answer

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.240 
it into text and it gives you the answer
really<00:00:54.960> cool<00:00:55.170> app<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.800> could<00:00:56.010> easily

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
I use a lot is whiteboard apps these are

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.560 
I use a lot is whiteboard apps these are
basically<00:01:04.070> electronic<00:01:05.070> whiteboards<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.450> I'm

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
basically electronic whiteboards so I'm

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.030 
basically electronic whiteboards so I'm
going<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.720> open<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:07.080> one<00:01:07.140> up<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.770> think<00:01:07.890> show

going to open this one up I think show

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.870 
going to open this one up I think show
me<00:01:08.159> use<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> different<00:01:08.549> one

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
me use a different one

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.740 
me use a different one
oh<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.810> show<00:01:10.380> me<00:01:10.680> there's<00:01:11.369> 50<00:01:12.299> whiteboard

oh you show me there's 50 whiteboard

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.380 
oh you show me there's 50 whiteboard
apps<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.140> haven't<00:01:13.409> found<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:14.040> is

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
apps I haven't found one that is

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.370 
apps I haven't found one that is
demonstrably<00:01:15.390> better<00:01:15.509> than<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> others<00:01:16.350> so

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
demonstrably better than the others so

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.100 
demonstrably better than the others so
we'll<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.009> use<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.340> one<00:01:17.659> so<00:01:18.659> let's<00:01:18.840> say

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
we'll just use this one so let's say

we'll just use this one so let's say
we're<00:01:19.799> doing<00:01:19.920> some<00:01:20.280> math<00:01:21.080> and<00:01:22.080> I'm<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.350> doing

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590

pretty much instantaneous it if you have
a<00:02:08.970> slower<00:02:09.390> Wi-Fi<00:02:09.959> network<00:02:10.379> there<00:02:10.679> might<00:02:10.830> be<00:02:10.860> a

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
a slower Wi-Fi network there might be a

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.850 
a slower Wi-Fi network there might be a
little<00:02:11.190> bit<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.520> lag<00:02:11.959> so<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.050> really<00:02:13.260> can't

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
little bit of a lag so you really can't

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
little bit of a lag so you really can't
a<00:02:14.220> video<00:02:14.730> from<00:02:15.150> an<00:02:15.300> iPad<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:16.260> your<00:02:16.290> computer

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
a video from an iPad to your computer

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.370 
a video from an iPad to your computer
but<00:02:17.880> for<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.090> most<00:02:18.240> part<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.900> really<00:02:18.930> works

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
but for the most part it really works

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.690 
but for the most part it really works
well<00:02:19.710> for<00:02:19.980> our<00:02:20.610> purposes<00:02:21.240> in<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.480> classroom

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
well for our purposes in the classroom

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.600 
well for our purposes in the classroom
let's<00:02:23.700> see<00:02:23.970> I've<00:02:24.780> had<00:02:25.170> up<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.740> I<00:02:25.770> think<00:02:25.950> nine

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
let's see I've had up to I think nine

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.370 
let's see I've had up to I think nine
iPads<00:02:27.950> streaming<00:02:28.950> up<00:02:29.100> at<00:02:29.250> once<00:02:30.200> what<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.230> was

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
iPads streaming up at once what I was

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.170 
iPads streaming up at once what I was
doing<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.740> I<00:02:31.830> was<00:02:31.920> having<00:02:32.070> students<00:02:32.580> work<00:02:32.820> in

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
doing is I was having students work in

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.570 
doing is I was having students work in
groups<00:02:33.450> doing<00:02:34.260> some<00:02:34.470> math<00:02:34.650> problems<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.550> I

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
groups doing some math problems and I

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.300 
groups doing some math problems and I
could<00:02:35.760> see<00:02:36.120> all<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.630> their<00:02:36.840> work<00:02:37.170> another<00:02:38.070> nice

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
could see all of their work another nice

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.040 
could see all of their work another nice
thing<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.610> can<00:02:38.760> do<00:02:38.880> with<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.240> is<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.870> can

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
thing you can do with this is you can

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.860 
thing you can do with this is you can
turn<00:02:40.440> off<00:02:40.650> your<00:02:40.680> projector<00:02:41.580> but<00:02:42.390> leave<00:02:42.630> this

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
turn off your projector but leave this

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.680 
turn off your projector but leave this
open<00:02:43.200> on<00:02:43.590> your<00:02:43.980> screen<00:02:44.330> so<00:02:45.330> let's<00:02:45.540> say

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
open on your screen so let's say

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.720 
open on your screen so let's say
students<00:02:46.110> are<00:02:46.200> independently<00:02:46.890> working<00:02:47.190> on

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
students are independently working on

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.080 
students are independently working on
iPads<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.990> you<00:02:49.740> want<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.130> make<00:02:50.310> sure<00:02:50.340> that

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
iPads and you want to make sure that

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.630 
iPads and you want to make sure that
they're<00:02:51.330> not<00:02:51.480> going<00:02:51.840> on<00:02:51.990> to<00:02:52.170> YouTube<00:02:52.680> or<00:02:53.160> maybe

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
they're not going on to YouTube or maybe

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.310 
they're not going on to YouTube or maybe
accessing<00:02:54.240> games<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.780> they<00:02:54.870> shouldn't<00:02:55.170> be

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
accessing games that they shouldn't be

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.150 
accessing games that they shouldn't be
playing<00:02:55.620> if<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.820> leave<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.330> app<00:02:57.810> open<00:02:58.440> you

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
playing if you leave this app open you

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.020 
playing if you leave this app open you
can<00:02:59.400> see<00:02:59.850> what<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:00.600> on<00:03:00.780> their<00:03:01.140> screen<00:03:01.650> and

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
can see what is on their screen and

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.949 
can see what is on their screen and
verify<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.330> they're<00:03:03.450> doing<00:03:03.600> what<00:03:03.810> they're

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
verify that they're doing what they're

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.130 
verify that they're doing what they're
supposed<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.350> be<00:03:04.500> doing<00:03:05.030> I've<00:03:06.030> also<00:03:06.240> found<00:03:06.660> and

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
supposed to be doing I've also found and

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.699 
supposed to be doing I've also found and
maybe<00:03:07.410> this<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.740> a<00:03:07.770> little<00:03:07.830> dishonest<00:03:08.390> as<00:03:09.390> if<00:03:09.570> I

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
maybe this is a little dishonest as if I

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.440 
maybe this is a little dishonest as if I
do<00:03:10.709> this<00:03:10.890> once<00:03:11.190> or<00:03:11.310> twice<00:03:11.340> with<00:03:11.790> students<00:03:12.300> and

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
do this once or twice with students and

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.840 
do this once or twice with students and
the<00:03:13.290> next<00:03:13.560> time<00:03:13.740> they're<00:03:13.950> on<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.130> iPad<00:03:14.490> I<00:03:14.520> let

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
the next time they're on the iPad I let

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.880 
the next time they're on the iPad I let
them<00:03:15.030> know<00:03:15.240> hey<00:03:15.570> remember<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.140> can<00:03:16.470> see<00:03:16.680> your

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
screens that they are there they usually

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.820 
screens that they are there they usually
behave<00:03:21.019> so<00:03:22.019> that's<00:03:22.200> just<00:03:22.380> something<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.739> keep

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
behave so that's just something to keep

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.570 
behave so that's just something to keep

mirroring on then this won't work
I<00:04:28.020> found<00:04:28.650> that<00:04:29.030> students<00:04:30.030> picked<00:04:30.270> this<00:04:30.420> up

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
I found that students picked this up

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.320 
I found that students picked this up
pretty<00:04:30.810> pretty<00:04:31.350> quickly<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:32.880> that<00:04:33.000> once<00:04:33.240> I

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
pretty pretty quickly and that once I

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.330 
pretty pretty quickly and that once I
taught<00:04:33.540> my<00:04:33.660> class<00:04:33.720> how<00:04:34.110> to<00:04:34.170> do<00:04:34.380> it<00:04:34.590> that<00:04:34.980> they

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
taught my class how to do it that they

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.410 
taught my class how to do it that they
were<00:04:35.400> able<00:04:35.550> to<00:04:35.760> do<00:04:35.910> this<00:04:36.060> independently

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
were able to do this independently

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.680 
were able to do this independently
within<00:04:37.380> 30<00:04:37.890> seconds<00:04:38.370> so<00:04:38.610> it's<00:04:39.150> not<00:04:39.360> too<00:04:39.570> much

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
within 30 seconds so it's not too much

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.470 
within 30 seconds so it's not too much
of<00:04:39.750> a<00:04:39.930> time<00:04:40.170> drain<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.770> get<00:04:40.950> to<00:04:41.760> get<00:04:41.910> students<00:04:42.360> a

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
of a time drain to get to get students a

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.250 
of a time drain to get to get students a
rolling<00:04:43.320> and<00:04:43.530> airserver<00:04:44.690> I've<00:04:45.690> also<00:04:45.930> found

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
rolling and airserver I've also found

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.530 
rolling and airserver I've also found
this<00:04:46.530> is<00:04:46.710> very<00:04:46.920> useful<00:04:47.760> as<00:04:47.850> a<00:04:47.910> presentation

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
this is very useful as a presentation

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.130 
this is very useful as a presentation

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
to do this now or why don't you practice

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.430 
to do this now or why don't you practice
and<00:05:11.160> let<00:05:11.520> everyone<00:05:11.700> see<00:05:12.000> your<00:05:12.210> work

and let everyone see your work

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.130 
and let everyone see your work
so<00:05:13.830> airserver<00:05:14.280> is<00:05:14.580> a<00:05:14.610> is<00:05:15.210> a<00:05:15.270> really<00:05:15.870> really

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
so airserver is a is a really really

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.720 
so airserver is a is a really really
cool<00:05:16.290> tool

airserver<00:05:18.510> is<00:05:18.720> not<00:05:18.870> free<00:05:19.230> but<00:05:19.770> it<00:05:19.890> does<00:05:19.920> have<00:05:20.100> a

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
airserver is not free but it does have a

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.900 
airserver is not free but it does have a
7-day<00:05:20.670> free<00:05:21.060> trial<00:05:21.450> so<00:05:21.810> you<00:05:21.840> can<00:05:22.230> try<00:05:22.350> it<00:05:22.560> out

7-day free trial so you can try it out

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.280 
7-day free trial so you can try it out
it<00:05:24.900> is<00:05:25.170> fifteen<00:05:25.950> dollars<00:05:25.980> for<00:05:26.870> five<00:05:27.870> licenses

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
it is fifteen dollars for five licenses

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.900 
it is fifteen dollars for five licenses
so<00:05:29.130> if<00:05:29.460> you<00:05:29.940> have<00:05:30.290> five<00:05:31.290> teachers<00:05:31.760> go<00:05:32.760> in

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
so if you have five teachers go in

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.240 
so if you have five teachers go in
together<00:05:33.090> on<00:05:33.570> one<00:05:34.110> license<00:05:34.590> then<00:05:34.980> you'd<00:05:35.160> be

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
together on one license then you'd be
