00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
but you probably wouldn't think of

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.080 
but you probably wouldn't think of
putting<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.529> your<00:00:31.710> hair<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.160> mayonnaise<00:00:32.579> and

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
putting in your hair is mayonnaise and

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.600 
putting in your hair is mayonnaise and
the<00:00:33.180> next<00:00:33.450> thing<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.809> need<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.290> one<00:00:34.890> egg<00:00:35.190> and

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
the next thing you need is one egg and

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.569 
the next thing you need is one egg and
this<00:00:36.300> actually<00:00:36.930> helps<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.739> protein<00:00:38.309> in

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
this actually helps with the protein in

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.869 
this actually helps with the protein in
the<00:00:38.879> egg<00:00:39.210> yolk<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.530> mix<00:00:40.860> all<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.730> a

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
the egg yolk so it mix all of this in a

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.020 
the egg yolk so it mix all of this in a
bowl<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:42.840> are<00:00:43.440> going<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.040> apply<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.520> all

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
bowl and we are going to apply this all

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.740 
bowl and we are going to apply this all
to<00:00:45.570> our<00:00:45.629> hair<00:00:46.850> so<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> first<00:00:48.210> thing<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.539> want

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
to our hair so the first thing you want

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.110 
to our hair so the first thing you want
to<00:00:48.809> do<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.170> take<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> couple<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.980> tablespoons<00:00:50.280> of

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
to do is take a couple of tablespoons of

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.590 
to do is take a couple of tablespoons of
coconut<00:00:51.690> oil<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.550> solid<00:00:54.420> at<00:00:54.570> room

coconut oil and this is solid at room

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.139 
coconut oil and this is solid at room
temperature<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.160> could<00:00:56.489> either<00:00:56.699> melt

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
temperature so you could either melt

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.990 
temperature so you could either melt
this<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.870> your<00:00:58.079> blow<00:00:58.350> dryer<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.980> low<00:00:59.070> or<00:00:59.520> high

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
into my bowl and I find the easiest way

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.600 
into my bowl and I find the easiest way
to<00:02:25.060> do<00:02:25.450> this<00:02:25.510> it's<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.650> section<00:02:27.190> off<00:02:27.370> your<00:02:27.400> hair

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
to do this it's to section off your hair

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.270
