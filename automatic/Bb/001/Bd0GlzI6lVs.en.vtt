00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.619
 Hello everyone, today we show you 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:19.340
 how to replace an old socket of a 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:22.700
 charger with a usb plug that 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.269
 we got it from a charger 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.269
 Broken 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.980
 here we see that the positive pole 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.590
 highlighted by red thread 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.280
 while the negative pole is represented 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.560
 from the wire of white color in some cases 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.260
 it may happen that the children are of the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.150
 same color and to distinguish the two 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.510
 poles should be used now 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.180
 an important thing is to identify the 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.850
 positive pole inside the taken sb 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.310
 to do this you need to take the grip 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.850
 and place them exactly in this 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.950
 way with the white part facing towards 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.700
 up 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:03.190
 then turn the usb socket e 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.780
 to your left the outermost pole 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:10.090
 represents the positive pole while 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.120
 at the other end is the negative pole 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.790
 now after finding the pores 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.050
 within the alleged b they are welded 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.050
 the respective children 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:03.590
 after having paid the children you must nast 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.590
 remove the socket and wires to isolate them 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.970
 now the new charger is ready 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.970
 let's see how it goes 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.500
 as you can see it is loading a 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.500
 greetings to all and to the next video
