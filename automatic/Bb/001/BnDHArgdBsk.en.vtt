00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:10.230
 If you want to know like me this 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.889

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.710
 Then stay tuned because I'll show you that 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:20.130
 secret of voluminous hair for 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.250
 Extra fine hair or first step is 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.760
 Wash hair by a lot of volume too 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.380
 are getting freshly washed hair 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.599
 appropriated and the ambri that is not 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.279
 Hombre what I do with intention so 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.710
 the people the videos regularly 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.570
 they know that I mean 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.579
 Hair does not connect anymore that just 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.530
 still out max I just want to 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.360
 have a natural hair color because of me 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.010
 I now find the natural hair color 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.300
 do not know that stands most people 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.940
 best of all and mine keeps that and that 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.760
 is now here this is that 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.739
 just has to go away but it is also 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.420
 So no matter and I use shampoo moderately 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.489
 once had been for my head 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.519
 approach and for the lengths I use 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.670
 of karas tase resistance volume 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.000
 shampoo and that is a gel 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.680
 like one can say I do not know if 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.470
 It can be said that it is like that 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.880
 a conditioner is so similar but it 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.770
 can never from condition but you have to 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.020
 then wash it out that way 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.909
 Incidentally , you get products from mr 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.340
 center 24 point de 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.200
 that was sent to me many thanks 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.759
 So I made it first 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.070
 main or with and you will see 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.850
 how crudely soups compare to mine 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.759
 last video 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.170
 I still have the products of 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.280
 diesel oil sharp of our used I think 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.710
 not so good anymore because of it 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.899
 in this weather is not as good as 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.320
 a lot of summer this engagement is great 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.390
 but for the absolute winter mist and 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.299
 Now what I am doing now is too 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.990
 from the character both that is from the 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.990
 politics 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.910
 and that's that's extra 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.020
 special line for fine hair and 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.930
 my hair structure has really changed 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.020
 very much changed 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:17.400
 over the last few years and there 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:18.600
 do you speak with your approach so I 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.060
 I did not want to believe it at first 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.890
 you will see what a blatant 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.760
 difference that makes you if you have this 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.390
 Products 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.760
 you can equal your hair before the 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.220
 I do not have the manufacturer but 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.950
 I bought from my hairdresser 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.870
 because I had to have a cut 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.150
 I also have carsten product 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.040
 overuse that's funny right then 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.790
 The same series is mine too 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.550
 It is such a product 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.190
 I'm really only a little bit in me 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:55.560
 my hands and then that really only 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.180
 in the points because we do not want 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.920
 So it is we do not want that 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.800
 our hair hurt me with it 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.630
 heat treated 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.459
 is very important if you have volume 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:17.510
 want is head over the hair too 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:17.510
 Blow dry fast 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:35.140
 then you have such hair first 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.030
 So I usually tell you if 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.430
 I do not use these products and users 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.620
 that this ancestral used 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.900
 I see definitely have a head over 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.019
 Do not overfill out I would at 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.190
 bubbly doing a really 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.140
 huge difference at the sorry my 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.810
 after so long who does not like that when the 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.910
 hair because the nature of hair structure 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.560
 so I'm not with mine now either 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:01.390
 so boring and that is cool 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.400
 Really tell you that if you have your hair 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.260
 the night partly have the next day 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.750
 volume actually stops me 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.519
 I swear and that's why I want to 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.079
 also necessarily these products 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.420
 recommend it because I would not have 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.829
 thought that it is so blatantly good me 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.000
 still had this shingles shampoo from 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.199
 so character with me at all 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.320
 not satisfied that's why I was too 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:22.600
 already seen that help but this 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.979
 really was and now you need one 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.849
 round brush yes so I 'll stop it 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.270
 this way 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:32.440
 I do not know how you do it 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.870
 then sometimes share my hair 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.169
 I do not split that off now and 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.639
 make extra every vote because 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.729
 I think that time just like that 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.729
 little 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.130
 to restrict 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.990
 So as always seen then on the 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.560
 not enough volume is me 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:00.639
 Show yourself now like my hair 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:02.289
 look like I think that's so blatant 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.300
 I think it's my backbone 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.990
 just lately, just not anymore 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:13.210
 have done what you want now 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:17.139
 but I will be so violent now 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.520
 again a set of hair extensions 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.150
 thus make three 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:28.569
 for those who just mega volume 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:29.250
 want to have and those are the best 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:33.460
 cause 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:36.400
 that's 100 grams of ball wave so you 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.050
 are actually a bit if i am 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.909
 just like my normal hair structure 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:44.589
 and I'll show you so I'll give you 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:47.129
 but times take all information 

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:47.129
 the infobox 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.759
 I already have a video for you 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.289
 leads to this hair extensions shown 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.800
 I can do that again 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.800
 to link 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:59.979
 I still have such problems 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:02.949
 I'm not that professional if it is 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.210
 more extensions is unfortunately shows you 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:06.849
 I do not like how I do it but me 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.439
 I think totally wrong then 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:10.060
 really horny sound despite 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:16.240
 Mitstreiter with halt the length 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:17.770
 a little bit longer so you can 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.439
 ever look everything makes it 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.439
 difference in length in any case 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.680
 so 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:35.240
 until then somehow improved from behind 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:40.190
 but you did right in the back 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:41.660
 look like blatant that is now but 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.890
 I just think cool from the length ago 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.050
 I can clean a few more 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:49.840
 make easy to demonstrate 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:52.940
 jena sid I have nothing now 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.250
 smoothed because I washed now 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:59.630
 So I'm the extensions mostly 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:02.990
 go really celebrate for me because I 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:05.350
 That may be that you have it right then 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.910
 looks voluminous 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:11.870
 yes that would have to then one more 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:18.010
 bit blind but are at the end 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:18.010
 the hair really like that and totally from monaco
