00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.610
 we are on the map of the giant nexus on the 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.780
 map of the giant nexus and on a map or 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.880
 from memory he had made a ninja 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.660
 expansion the regza I believe it is 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.700
 quite the opposite 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.230
 yeah So is he going to do it and 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.870
 well that's what we'll see dragon 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.640
 against forget if you join us on 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.950
 is on the exhibition match heart of 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.379
 the swarm and the hen will start all 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.670
 immediately after yeah after this bo3 with 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.700
 nok the ngos gossip that c is ayem mvp 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.440
 no no no I'm falling apart nickname bibi 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.870
 I think it's gandhi from harry's on 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.880
 skews myself I'm wrong I think 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.000
 these gloves says no thank you guys I 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.680
 very very bad sleep even on twitter 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.750
 I have everything is bad game 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.119
 behind the students who is going right away 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.860
 retweet standard is that you're wrong so 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.149
 managed everything and his thing to say to everything 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.920
 the sorry world I was wrong 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.960
 so I issued stefano instead of 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.450
 many abuses have already done so it was 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.869
 it was not bad so it's 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.300
 we have the gas that is taken from 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.250
 Nazi ideas actually we got the gas at 13 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.979
 to forge legarda gorins for dragon 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.130
 ok so dragon goes skillet to go on 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.290
 one rac non logic - one rakic sponsors 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.420
 and behind the factory very fast yeah 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.210
 exact of France I think 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.400
 the strength of the gas at fifteen is that you 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.510
 or second castrati I have my guy pretty 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.549
 Funny because it makes us prime 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.440
 gas 15 it's weird yeah but that's 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.330
 not that then crazy about it 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.460
 the rippers galore but this time 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.840
 feel the double reaper yeah yeah yeah 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.580
 ben look there is a second 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.619
 barracks so if that's what I'm going 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.640
 tell you excuse me about kazakh 1 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.320
 it's very interesting when 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.270
 even that allows to have an exhibition more 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.159
 fast with the gas at xiii and having 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.229
 for as much your units annoy not so late 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.060
 it compared to if you were a one 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.990
 expo racks let's say it's a small 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.330
 just had but god who is still 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.890
 interesting is clear and then we have 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.390
 a ripper in construction for dragon 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.259
 attention but we vision of the vcs of 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.150
 forge drawn 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.530
 alalalala scout is here and it's a shame 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.340
 because he had made navy force for 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.079
 prevent the scout 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.019
 yeah but here it's a big info that 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:19.850
 just revealed since forget has seen 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.230
 that there was the technical center and he 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.090
 saw that the technical center does 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.590
 was not looking for anything else this center 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.420
 technique was done only for 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.530
 to make either a ripper or a marauder 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.209
 what good 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.770
 the logic wants it to be a ripper 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.330
 that's it no it could be a 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.080
 Marauder also defensive 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:40.130
 true and and new attacks 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:44.930
 as agreed and so it will be double 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.390
 reaper and behind a factory jar there 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.300
 I do not know at all who will do it 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.500
 it's a push reaper and lyon we'll see 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.160
 one maybe it's just for 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.050
 the ubs grade 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.640
 we promise god crimes little attention 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.870
 to his we are a small attack a 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.430
 look at the dragons that starts to us 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.780
 debut the cost of the cliff the 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.550
 last and enron he should not have the 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.780
 to do he could have left as he 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.550
 that he could not leave it 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.610
 for it's careful when you're 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.709
 beside dice cliff beats do not be 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.270
 too much credit yeah attention is going 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.760
 bo does not have in brad will we go by 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.500
 to provide opposite opposite we have the same bo 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.630
 exactly from forget a save 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.580
 that makes him a sea push olala that 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.730
 that's it's very very strong 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:29.060
 marine / hellions medivacs that I push that 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.890
 is very very very powerful tvt it's 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.209
 really very very strong the advantage that 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.820
 dragon enough that I think he'll the 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.100
 see coming and he will not be taken by 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.730
 surprise in my opinion with series scared he 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.070
 will see him coming 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.269
 I think attention everything will be played 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.800
 now but we in the middle there is a 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.510
 confrontation in the middle there that what 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.130
 will happen who will your mentor your 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.480
 borders there attention look fucking 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.430
 point to complete there right now and 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.900
 reaper who shoots faster than lucky luke 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.459
 watch out for dragon since now 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.050
 there is the cliff so he has a little 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.310
 disadvantage we throw it that comes from 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.209
 give it a go for the moment there is that the 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.739
 tormentor must do what 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.870
 stmicro well on both sides dragon 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.610
 attention dragons he went online he 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.440
 is time to 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.630
 he lost two will take dear the 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.700
 dragon is here and maybe it's 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.920
 the lag is not a microphone ever this 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.920
 kind of stuff and suddenly bam the reaper 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.440
 mediterranean olalala does it's the 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.970
 spanking attention using her sheets 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.980
 are going to look at ya not even the banshee who 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.600
 is sent when he has the money it's 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.770
 to say that mentally he has a little disappointed 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.780
 he knows it's lost 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.000
 he knows it's really crap in 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.960
 more with medivac really it is null 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.330
 hi-fi a little I want to do a 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.650
 reaper attack what yeah if you can 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.520
 put the production back on what I 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.400
 behind me 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.260
 king vikings olala it's going to be great 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.030
 hot so maybe he can 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.830
 push that back if we're going to have to micro 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.630
 handle the rippers aipac lifeless and 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.340
 he manages to push back anyway 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.050
 capri dragons very very dear yeah that's 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.000
 clear it's clear he took very very 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.350
 dear viking and co who will be costing that 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.060
 it's not bad huh because if forget 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.070
 expects a banshee opened that 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.690
 continue on the viking he will disappoint 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.110
 a baston vikings against vikings if he 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.430
 do not like dragons so maybe 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.390
 that they repair yeah it's him who has 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.630
 given the first shot that's fine 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.910
 yeah and he's coming out and suddenly the 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.570
 forget's adverse reaper will not see the 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.100
 switch of buildings between the factory and 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.900
 the spaceport and suddenly he could 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.880
 expect a banshee and father 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.770
 forget when in fact its part 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.080
 directly b2 and probably tanks 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.640
 in seat mode 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.979
 yeah time as seat still remains 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.300
 fashion seat on the side of ford gg it's 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.490
 interesting as he very much on the 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.680
 tormentor tension may not be at 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.900
 go on the met cap to forge one goes 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.979
 see on TV this well t t on at the 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.050
 dragon he must react there 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:46.780
 normally he sees it what he does ok 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.900
 they do not give these donations the 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:54.460
 dragon dragons that gives way too much 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.750
 you're too generous dragon and here it is 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.090
 it's going to be complicated he's not even 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.479
 argues he has nothing at all the dragon notice 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:03.790
 it smacks of the fooled unfortunately 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.990
 dragons trying here from 200 out his 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.300
 time that will take us out that was done 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.200
 immediately one shot olalalala is 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.390
 wrought as soon as he arrived 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.590
 quietly jakuta cramer all the 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.319
 torment ground my opinion before the 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.849
 agitated dragon tormentor crash 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:17.840
 she is to rent nice it was 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:19.939
 long we did not have a match 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.560
 tweet and there he has not judged no but me 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:23.860
 I have wide time sheets in 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.860
 time
