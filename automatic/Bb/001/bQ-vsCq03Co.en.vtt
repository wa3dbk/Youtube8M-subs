laguna seca which i guess he will
hopefully<00:01:38.640> you'll<00:01:38.939> be<00:01:38.970> able<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.240> return<00:01:39.360> but

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.380 
hopefully you'll be able to return but
it<00:01:40.409> looks<00:01:40.560> not<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.040> likely<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.790> Lorenzo<00:01:42.240> will

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
it looks not so likely the Lorenzo will

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.510 
it looks not so likely the Lorenzo will
come<00:01:42.570> back<00:01:42.780> which<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> bit<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> shame<00:01:44.250> so

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
come back which is a bit of a shame so

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.000 
doesn't like it's going to be in the
race<00:03:27.569> but<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:28.199> looks<00:03:28.349> like<00:03:28.530> this<00:03:28.620> race<00:03:28.799> will<00:03:28.919> be

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
race but it looks like this race will be

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.430 
race but it looks like this race will be
down<00:03:29.159> between<00:03:29.340> Marquez<00:03:30.180> pedroso<00:03:30.900> Crutchlow

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
down between Marquez pedroso Crutchlow

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.559
