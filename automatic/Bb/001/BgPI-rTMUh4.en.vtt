wall<00:01:27.759> right<00:01:28.060> here<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:29.350> future<00:01:29.740> expansion<00:01:30.070> so

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
wall right here for future expansion so

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.700 
wall right here for future expansion so
when<00:01:30.759> we<00:01:30.880> dug<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.210> dirt<00:01:31.390> away<00:01:31.539> this<00:01:32.320> knockout

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
when we dug the dirt away this knockout

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.620 
when we dug the dirt away this knockout
panel<00:01:33.130> came<00:01:33.340> out<00:01:33.549> pretty<00:01:33.729> easily<00:01:34.060> so<00:01:34.299> it's

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
panel came out pretty easily so it's

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.450 
panel came out pretty easily so it's
safe<00:01:34.840> cutting<00:01:35.229> a<00:01:35.319> hole<00:01:35.439> in<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:35.740> concrete<00:01:36.100> wall

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.359 
shot of the Attila Tea Room here it
shows<00:01:46.149> the<00:01:46.469> ventilation<00:01:47.469> system<00:01:47.500> that<00:01:48.069> we<00:01:48.159> put

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
shows the ventilation system that we put

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:49.830
