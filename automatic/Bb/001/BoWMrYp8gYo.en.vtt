Dolphins you guys are gonna see me look
at<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.930> Jets<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.229> little<00:01:04.439> bit<00:01:04.559> though<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:05.519> yeah

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
at the Jets a little bit though but yeah

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.640 
at the Jets a little bit though but yeah
I<00:01:05.760> did<00:01:06.060> go<00:01:06.240> with<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> Dolphins<00:01:06.869> just<00:01:07.260> because

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
I did go with the Dolphins just because

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.410 
I did go with the Dolphins just because
I<00:01:07.920> feel<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.670> would<00:01:08.850> be<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> little<00:01:09.330> bit

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
I feel like it would be a little bit

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.060 
I feel like it would be a little bit
easier<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.810> turn<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.200> Dolphins<00:01:10.590> around<00:01:10.890> than

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
easier to turn the Dolphins around than

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.469 
easier to turn the Dolphins around than
it<00:01:11.159> would<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.490> go<00:01:11.760> into<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.060> terrible

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
it would be to go into a terrible

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.620 
it would be to go into a terrible
situation<00:01:13.430> like<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.580> New<00:01:14.700> York<00:01:14.729> Jets<00:01:15.090> are<00:01:15.360> in

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
situation like the New York Jets are in

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.990 
situation like the New York Jets are in

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.560 
have a rocket arm and I could run so
that<00:01:41.100> kind<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.340> spreads<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.820> field<00:01:42.030> out<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> lot

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
that kind of spreads the field out a lot

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.510 
that kind of spreads the field out a lot
it<00:01:42.810> makes<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.200> corners<00:01:43.560> keep<00:01:43.829> guessing<00:01:44.399> on

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
it makes the corners keep guessing on

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.060 
it makes the corners keep guessing on
what<00:01:44.729> I'm<00:01:44.820> gonna<00:01:45.000> do<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:46.530> opens<00:01:46.680> up

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
what I'm gonna do and that just opens up

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.060 
what I'm gonna do and that just opens up
