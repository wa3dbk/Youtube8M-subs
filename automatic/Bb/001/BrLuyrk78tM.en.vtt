00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
pathfinder PA g 4 TB - 2 v so basically

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.199 
pathfinder PA g 4 TB - 2 v so basically
a<00:00:11.230> casio<00:00:12.040> pathfinder<00:00:13.049> series<00:00:14.049> 40<00:00:14.410> watch<00:00:15.209> first

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
a casio pathfinder series 40 watch first

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.820 
a casio pathfinder series 40 watch first
thing<00:00:16.360> you'll<00:00:16.480> notice<00:00:16.689> is<00:00:16.930> it's<00:00:17.410> a<00:00:17.560> pretty

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
thing you'll notice is it's a pretty

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.380 
thing you'll notice is it's a pretty
large<00:00:18.070> watch<00:00:19.560> there's<00:00:20.560> my<00:00:20.859> hand<00:00:21.279> in<00:00:21.550> the<00:00:22.240> watch

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
large watch there's my hand in the watch

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.890 
large watch there's my hand in the watch
on<00:00:22.720> it<00:00:22.900> on<00:00:23.320> my<00:00:23.470> wrist<00:00:23.680> a<00:00:23.980> pretty<00:00:24.430> good<00:00:24.609> size<00:00:24.900> but

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
on it on my wrist a pretty good size but

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.160 
on it on my wrist a pretty good size but
that<00:00:26.970> makes<00:00:27.970> it<00:00:28.090> look<00:00:28.330> really<00:00:28.660> easy<00:00:28.689> to<00:00:29.019> see

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
that makes it look really easy to see

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.540 
that makes it look really easy to see
the<00:00:29.260> numbers<00:00:29.560> and<00:00:29.710> what<00:00:29.830> time<00:00:30.039> it<00:00:30.160> is<00:00:30.189> and

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
the numbers and what time it is and

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.270 
the numbers and what time it is and
different<00:00:30.760> readings<00:00:31.390> on<00:00:31.539> the<00:00:31.660> display<00:00:32.280> so

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
different readings on the display so

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.650 
different readings on the display so
I'll<00:00:33.400> take<00:00:33.550> this<00:00:33.699> watch<00:00:33.879> off<00:00:34.090> and<00:00:34.330> we'll<00:00:34.420> start

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
I'll take this watch off and we'll start

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:45.119 
I'll take this watch off and we'll start
stepping<00:00:34.989> through<00:00:35.140> some<00:00:35.350> of<00:00:35.410> the<00:00:35.500> features<00:00:44.129> so

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
stepping through some of the features so

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.100 
stepping through some of the features so
one<00:00:45.850> of<00:00:45.879> the<00:00:46.000> first<00:00:46.150> things<00:00:46.449> here<00:00:46.659> again<00:00:46.960> is

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
one of the first things here again is

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.869 
one of the first things here again is
it's<00:00:47.620> a<00:00:47.799> fairly<00:00:48.040> large<00:00:48.280> watch<00:00:49.199> it<00:00:50.199> does<00:00:50.409> have<00:00:50.619> a

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
it's a fairly large watch it does have a

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.719 
it's a fairly large watch it does have a
button<00:00:51.879> right<00:00:51.909> here<00:00:52.180> says<00:00:52.659> light<00:00:52.900> I<00:00:53.549> can<00:00:54.549> push

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:54.729 
button right here says light I can push

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:56.729 
button right here says light I can push
that<00:00:54.940> button<00:00:55.180> and<00:00:55.449> it<00:00:55.780> will<00:00:55.930> give<00:00:56.290> you<00:00:56.440> the

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
that button and it will give you the

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.740 
that button and it will give you the
backlight<00:00:57.100> display<00:00:57.269> just<00:00:58.269> for<00:00:58.360> a<00:00:58.420> few<00:00:58.540> moments

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
backlight display just for a few moments

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.920 
backlight display just for a few moments
long<00:00:59.110> enough<00:00:59.320> to<00:00:59.470> see<00:00:59.710> what<00:00:59.739> time<00:01:00.010> it<00:01:00.159> is

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
long enough to see what time it is

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.340 
long enough to see what time it is
there<00:01:02.260> is<00:01:02.379> an<00:01:02.500> altimeter<00:01:02.830> button<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
there is an altimeter button the

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.980 
there is an altimeter button the
altimeter<00:01:05.680> you<00:01:05.979> push<00:01:06.189> it<00:01:06.430> it<00:01:07.390> will<00:01:07.600> give<00:01:07.840> you

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
altimeter you push it it will give you

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.320 
altimeter you push it it will give you
the<00:01:08.230> time<00:01:08.800> in<00:01:09.100> this<00:01:09.250> lower<00:01:09.490> part<00:01:09.940> of<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.210> watch

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
the time in this lower part of the watch

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.900 
the time in this lower part of the watch
and<00:01:10.660> then<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.560> reading<00:01:12.070> in<00:01:12.280> feet<00:01:12.610> or<00:01:12.760> meters

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
and then the reading in feet or meters

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.910 
and then the reading in feet or meters
I've<00:01:13.240> got<00:01:13.450> mine<00:01:13.600> set<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:13.870> feet<00:01:15.270> 2,780<00:01:16.270> feet

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
I've got mine set to feet 2,780 feet

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.190 
I've got mine set to feet 2,780 feet
let's<00:01:17.920> check<00:01:18.130> this<00:01:18.310> against<00:01:18.700> a<00:01:18.790> Garmin<00:01:19.210> 60<00:01:19.630> CSX

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
let's check this against a Garmin 60 CSX

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.260 
let's check this against a Garmin 60 CSX
GPS<00:01:20.800> and<00:01:21.070> see<00:01:21.250> how<00:01:21.400> accurate<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:21.970> readings

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
GPS and see how accurate the readings

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:31.070 
GPS and see how accurate the readings
are

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:40.160 

so<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.200> Garmon<00:01:34.350> 2740<00:01:35.350> feet<00:01:35.620> basically<00:01:36.570> again

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.890 

2,780<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:42.520> not<00:01:42.700> too<00:01:42.880> bad<00:01:43.090> considering<00:01:43.630> this

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
2,780 it's not too bad considering this

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.870 
2,780 it's not too bad considering this
is<00:01:44.080> just<00:01:44.320> a<00:01:44.500> device<00:01:44.980> on<00:01:45.160> your<00:01:45.340> wrist<00:01:45.580> that's

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
is just a device on your wrist that's

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.470 
is just a device on your wrist that's
mainly<00:01:46.180> a<00:01:46.500> timekeeping<00:01:47.500> device<00:01:48.330> let's<00:01:49.330> look

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
mainly a timekeeping device let's look

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.910 
mainly a timekeeping device let's look
at<00:01:49.600> one<00:01:49.720> of<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.870> other<00:01:49.960> features<00:01:50.230> here<00:01:50.710> which

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
at one of the other features here which

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.670 
at one of the other features here which
would<00:01:51.100> be<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:52.570> barometer<00:01:56.490> now<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.550> barometer

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
would be the barometer now the barometer

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.530 
would be the barometer now the barometer
will<00:01:59.680> show<00:01:59.890> you<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.130> temperature<00:02:00.640> right<00:02:01.420> now

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
will show you the temperature right now

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.610 
will show you the temperature right now
it<00:02:01.630> shows<00:02:01.750> 84<00:02:02.290> degrees<00:02:04.230> barometric<00:02:05.230> pressure

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
it shows 84 degrees barometric pressure

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.820 
it shows 84 degrees barometric pressure
of<00:02:06.060> 29.7<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.810> other<00:02:07.930> thing<00:02:08.170> you'll<00:02:08.320> notice<00:02:08.380> is

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
of 29.7 the other thing you'll notice is

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.170 
of 29.7 the other thing you'll notice is
this<00:02:09.040> downward<00:02:09.430> trend<00:02:09.670> in<00:02:10.360> this<00:02:10.750> graph<00:02:11.110> here

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
this downward trend in this graph here

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.790 
this downward trend in this graph here
that's<00:02:13.180> showing<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.110> low<00:02:14.260> pressure<00:02:14.500> system

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
that's showing a low pressure system

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.740 
that's showing a low pressure system
moving<00:02:15.160> in<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.700> which<00:02:15.850> is<00:02:16.060> true<00:02:16.240> we<00:02:16.420> do<00:02:16.570> have

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
moving in and which is true we do have

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.500 
moving in and which is true we do have
some<00:02:16.930> weather<00:02:17.110> moving<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.860> in<00:02:18.040> our<00:02:18.160> area<00:02:18.510> so

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
some weather moving in in our area so

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.960 
some weather moving in in our area so
that's<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.960> pretty<00:02:20.260> good<00:02:20.380> indicator<00:02:20.800> along<00:02:21.790> on

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
that's a pretty good indicator along on

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.390 
that's a pretty good indicator along on
the<00:02:22.060> watch<00:02:22.240> there<00:02:22.510> on<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.720> display<00:02:23.100> now<00:02:24.100> let's

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
the watch there on the display now let's

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.760 
the watch there on the display now let's
check<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.640> Garmin<00:02:25.090> GPS<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.350> see<00:02:26.530> what<00:02:26.650> it's

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
check the Garmin GPS and see what it's

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.150 
check the Garmin GPS and see what it's
barometric<00:02:27.040> pressure<00:02:27.400> reading<00:02:27.730> says<00:02:28.980> 29.7<00:02:29.980> on

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
barometric pressure reading says 29.7 on

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:39.090 
barometric pressure reading says 29.7 on
the<00:02:30.280> Casio

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.500 

the<00:02:40.100> Garmin<00:02:40.580> shows<00:02:41.530> 29.7<00:02:42.530> 9<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:44.120> all<00:02:44.270> in<00:02:44.420> all

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
the Garmin shows 29.7 9 so all in all

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.100 
the Garmin shows 29.7 9 so all in all
fairly<00:02:44.960> accurate<00:02:49.810> one<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:50.990> other

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
begin to change based on the position of

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.290 
begin to change based on the position of
the<00:03:22.130> watch<00:03:23.020> it<00:03:24.020> is<00:03:24.230> fairly<00:03:24.650> accurate<00:03:25.000> it's<00:03:26.000> not

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
the watch it is fairly accurate it's not

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.110 
the watch it is fairly accurate it's not
a<00:03:27.100> kind<00:03:28.100> of<00:03:28.160> full-blown<00:03:28.550> compass<00:03:28.970> and

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
a kind of full-blown compass and

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.360 
a kind of full-blown compass and
definitely<00:03:29.360> not<00:03:29.480> a<00:03:29.510> full-blown<00:03:29.870> GPS<00:03:30.380> but<00:03:31.280> it

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
definitely not a full-blown GPS but it

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.890 
definitely not a full-blown GPS but it
does<00:03:31.520> give<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:31.820> fairly<00:03:32.060> good<00:03:32.270> indication

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
does give you a fairly good indication

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.800 
does give you a fairly good indication
to<00:03:33.020> travel<00:03:33.550> the<00:03:34.550> bezel<00:03:34.910> here<00:03:35.060> does<00:03:35.330> rotate

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
to travel the bezel here does rotate

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.290 
to travel the bezel here does rotate
also<00:03:36.080> so<00:03:36.530> that<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:36.800> can<00:03:36.980> change<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.370> the

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
also so that you can change the the

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.180 
also so that you can change the the
readings<00:03:38.630> of<00:03:38.810> north<00:03:39.140> to<00:03:39.410> true<00:03:39.620> north<00:03:39.890> or

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
readings of north to true north or

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.509 
readings of north to true north or
however<00:03:40.489> you'd<00:03:40.730> like<00:03:40.760> to<00:03:40.910> set<00:03:41.300> those<00:03:41.510> up<00:03:42.519> one

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
however you'd like to set those up one

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.220 
however you'd like to set those up one
thing<00:03:43.700> that<00:03:43.820> I<00:03:43.880> have<00:03:44.120> noticed<00:03:44.660> is<00:03:44.870> the

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
thing that I have noticed is the

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.620 
thing that I have noticed is the
temperature<00:03:45.709> reading<00:03:48.459> it<00:03:49.459> really<00:03:49.850> fluctuates

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
temperature reading it really fluctuates

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.840 
temperature reading it really fluctuates
you<00:03:51.470> can<00:03:51.620> have<00:03:51.830> it<00:03:51.950> on<00:03:52.040> your<00:03:52.100> wrist<00:03:52.459> and<00:03:52.700> it's

far<00:05:02.819> it's<00:05:03.180> been<00:05:03.240> waterproof<00:05:03.870> it's<00:05:04.139> not<00:05:04.319> got

00:05:04.549 --> 00:05:04.559 
far it's been waterproof it's not got

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:05.869 
far it's been waterproof it's not got
any<00:05:04.800> water<00:05:05.069> in<00:05:05.189> it<00:05:05.400> while<00:05:05.610> it's<00:05:05.759> been

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:05.879 
any water in it while it's been

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:10.219 
any water in it while it's been
submerged<00:05:06.330> I<00:05:07.009> a<00:05:08.009> little<00:05:08.669> thick<00:05:09.020> so<00:05:10.020> there's

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
submerged I a little thick so there's

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.559 
submerged I a little thick so there's
the<00:05:10.409> thickness<00:05:10.800> of<00:05:10.919> the<00:05:11.039> watch<00:05:11.330> let<00:05:12.330> me<00:05:12.419> get<00:05:12.539> a

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
the thickness of the watch let me get a

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.230 
the thickness of the watch let me get a
Timex<00:05:12.870> watch<00:05:13.319> that<00:05:13.499> I<00:05:13.559> normally<00:05:14.009> wear<00:05:14.240> for

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
Timex watch that I normally wear for

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.309 
Timex watch that I normally wear for
daily<00:05:15.569> use<00:05:15.779> and<00:05:15.960> I'll<00:05:16.020> show<00:05:16.169> you<00:05:16.229> the

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
daily use and I'll show you the

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:23.059 
daily use and I'll show you the
difference<00:05:16.620> in<00:05:16.710> thickness<00:05:16.919> here<00:05:21.770> so<00:05:22.770> here's

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:23.069 
difference in thickness here so here's

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:25.519 
difference in thickness here so here's
the<00:05:23.219> two<00:05:23.399> watches<00:05:23.909> that<00:05:23.999> I<00:05:24.089> normally<00:05:24.509> am<00:05:24.599> using

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:25.529 
the two watches that I normally am using

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.339 
the two watches that I normally am using
out<00:05:25.740> in<00:05:25.800> the<00:05:25.860> field<00:05:26.099> a<00:05:26.879> Timex<00:05:27.389> expedition<00:05:28.169> and

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
out in the field a Timex expedition and

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:30.170 
out in the field a Timex expedition and
this<00:05:28.740> casio<00:05:29.129> pathfinder<00:05:29.729> that<00:05:29.879> i'm<00:05:29.969> showing

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
this casio pathfinder that i'm showing

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.010 
this casio pathfinder that i'm showing
you<00:05:31.370> there's<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:32.669> thickness<00:05:33.089> of<00:05:33.300> the<00:05:33.539> Casio

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
you there's the thickness of the Casio

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.179 
you there's the thickness of the Casio
thickness<00:05:37.020> of<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:39.259> expedition<00:05:40.259> so<00:05:40.949> there<00:05:41.069> is

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:41.189 
thickness of the expedition so there is

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:44.239 
thickness of the expedition so there is
a<00:05:41.219> big<00:05:41.580> difference<00:05:42.059> there<00:05:42.589> that's<00:05:43.589> a<00:05:43.800> quite<00:05:44.189> a

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:44.249 
a big difference there that's a quite a

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:46.969 
a big difference there that's a quite a
bit<00:05:44.430> difference<00:05:44.879> in<00:05:45.059> thickness<00:05:45.270> but<00:05:46.110> there's

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
bit difference in thickness but there's

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.709 
bit difference in thickness but there's
a<00:05:47.069> lot<00:05:47.219> more<00:05:47.399> functionality<00:05:47.849> in<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:48.300> Casio

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:48.719 
a lot more functionality in the Casio

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:55.219 
a lot more functionality in the Casio
then<00:05:49.080> in<00:05:49.199> the<00:05:49.319> Timex<00:05:52.699> the<00:05:53.699> watch<00:05:53.909> band<00:05:54.240> it's

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
then in the Timex the watch band it's

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:00.129 
then in the Timex the watch band it's
kind<00:05:55.560> of<00:05:55.620> a<00:05:56.029> Cordura<00:05:57.029> type<00:05:57.689> leather<00:05:58.459> material

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
kind of a Cordura type leather material

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.459 
kind of a Cordura type leather material
does<00:06:01.139> have<00:06:01.349> a<00:06:01.379> pretty<00:06:02.009> heavy-duty<00:06:03.229> band<00:06:04.229> and

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:04.469 
does have a pretty heavy-duty band and

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:08.570 
does have a pretty heavy-duty band and
latch<00:06:04.680> that's<00:06:05.310> worked<00:06:05.610> well<00:06:06.229> one<00:06:07.229> catch<00:06:08.219> here

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
latch that's worked well one catch here

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.119 
latch that's worked well one catch here
for<00:06:08.879> the<00:06:09.029> strap<00:06:09.959> to<00:06:09.990> go<00:06:10.259> in<00:06:10.439> and<00:06:10.680> that's<00:06:10.889> held

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:11.129 
for the strap to go in and that's held

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:12.829 
for the strap to go in and that's held
up<00:06:11.249> well<00:06:11.490> hopefully<00:06:12.029> that<00:06:12.149> will<00:06:12.240> continue<00:06:12.389> to

00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:12.839 
up well hopefully that will continue to

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:17.420 
up well hopefully that will continue to
hold<00:06:13.169> up<00:06:14.180> again<00:06:15.180> you<00:06:15.449> have<00:06:15.659> your<00:06:15.990> sensor<00:06:16.830> here

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
hold up again you have your sensor here

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.949 
hold up again you have your sensor here
that<00:06:17.789> reads<00:06:18.149> your<00:06:18.330> temperature<00:06:18.839> and

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:18.959 
that reads your temperature and

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:22.670 
that reads your temperature and
barometric<00:06:19.080> pressure<00:06:19.680> and<00:06:20.520> that's<00:06:21.649> got<00:06:22.649> to

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
barometric pressure and that's got to

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.350 
barometric pressure and that's got to
stay<00:06:22.889> clear<00:06:23.249> and<00:06:23.459> so<00:06:23.789> far<00:06:23.999> I've<00:06:24.059> had<00:06:24.089> it<00:06:24.300> in

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
stay clear and so far I've had it in

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.749 
stay clear and so far I've had it in
water<00:06:24.629> have<00:06:24.990> taken<00:06:25.289> it<00:06:25.379> out<00:06:25.469> and<00:06:25.740> the<00:06:26.550> pressure

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 
water have taken it out and the pressure

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:28.339 
water have taken it out and the pressure
readings<00:06:27.209> and<00:06:27.509> temperature<00:06:27.870> readings<00:06:28.169> have

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349 
readings and temperature readings have

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:32.420 
readings and temperature readings have
still<00:06:28.620> been<00:06:28.819> pretty<00:06:29.819> accurate<00:06:31.069> on<00:06:32.069> the<00:06:32.249> back

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
still been pretty accurate on the back

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.040 
still been pretty accurate on the back
side<00:06:32.729> you<00:06:33.029> can<00:06:33.240> see<00:06:33.389> it's<00:06:33.509> got<00:06:33.659> the<00:06:33.809> hard

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
side you can see it's got the hard

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.909 
side you can see it's got the hard
plastic<00:06:34.499> case<00:06:34.639> that<00:06:35.639> just<00:06:35.819> encloses<00:06:36.449> it<00:06:36.800> it<00:06:37.800> is

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
plastic case that just encloses it it is
