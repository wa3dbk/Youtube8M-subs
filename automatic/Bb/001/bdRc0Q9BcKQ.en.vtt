quickly lock the screen orientation the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.220 
quickly lock the screen orientation the
way<00:00:12.000> this<00:00:12.210> works<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.719> say<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:13.080> we're<00:00:13.200> in

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
way this works to say that we're in

Safari<00:00:13.799> or<00:00:13.920> another<00:00:14.460> application<00:00:14.880> will<00:00:15.150> allow

Safari or another application will allow
landscape<00:00:15.900> mode<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.320> if<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:16.980> turn<00:00:17.220> my<00:00:17.400> device

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
landscape mode and if I turn my device

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.300 
landscape mode and if I turn my device
sideways<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.600> see<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.020> actual<00:00:19.590> orientation

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
sideways you see the actual orientation

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.250 
sideways you see the actual orientation
of<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.460> application<00:00:21.029> puts<00:00:21.720> itself<00:00:21.990> into

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
of the application puts itself into

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.560 
of the application puts itself into
landscape<00:00:22.740> mode<00:00:22.789> now<00:00:23.789> sometimes<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:24.420> can

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
landscape mode now sometimes this can

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.439 
landscape mode now sometimes this can
happen<00:00:24.779> by<00:00:24.960> accident<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:26.220> most<00:00:26.400> common<00:00:26.820> use

around a little bit it might go ahead

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.780 
around a little bit it might go ahead
and<00:00:34.290> switch<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.680> orientation<00:00:34.800> for<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.579> or

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.200 
I take a photo and try and view it it's
going<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.740> only<00:01:37.979> view<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.490> here<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.790> portrait

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
going to only view it here in portrait

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.700 
going to only view it here in portrait
mode<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.630> me<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.259> there<00:01:40.409> are<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> couple

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
mode for me so there are a couple

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.520 
mode for me so there are a couple
exceptions<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.939> orientation<00:01:42.450> lock<00:01:42.869> but

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
exceptions to the orientation lock but

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.230 
exceptions to the orientation lock but
for<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> most<00:01:44.130> part<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.640> will<00:01:44.850> keep<00:01:45.060> your

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
for the most part this will keep your

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.120 
for the most part this will keep your
device<00:01:45.509> from<00:01:45.689> accidentally<00:01:46.170> rotating<00:01:46.770> itself

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
device from accidentally rotating itself

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.969 
device from accidentally rotating itself
if<00:01:47.430> you're<00:01:47.970> trying<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.720> not<00:01:48.899> get<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.890> go

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
if you're trying to not get it to go

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.469 
if you're trying to not get it to go
into<00:01:50.130> landscape<00:01:50.700> mode<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.149> there<00:01:51.299> are<00:01:51.450> a

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
into landscape mode so there are a

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.359 
into landscape mode so there are a
couple<00:01:51.600> exceptions<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:53.159> for<00:01:53.250> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
couple exceptions to that but for the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.190 
couple exceptions to that but for the
most<00:01:53.520> part<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:53.970> orientation<00:01:54.600> lock<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.960> going

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
most part this orientation lock is going

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.590 
most part this orientation lock is going
to<00:01:55.290> keep<00:01:55.470> your<00:01:55.710> device<00:01:55.860> from<00:01:56.610> rotating<00:01:57.210> itself

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
to keep your device from rotating itself

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.690 
to keep your device from rotating itself
accidentally<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.590> that's<00:01:59.130> how<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.340> lock<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
accidentally and that's how you lock the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.310 
accidentally and that's how you lock the
screen<00:01:59.820> orientation<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.869> iPhone<00:02:01.680> 5c
