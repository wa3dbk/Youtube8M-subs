we're<00:00:34.890> just<00:00:35.040> going<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.220> hike<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.640> throw<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.970> to

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
we're just going to hike and throw it to

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.119 
we're just going to hike and throw it to
him<00:00:36.090> because<00:00:36.449> these<00:00:36.540> are<00:00:36.720> first<00:00:36.989> read<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.650> as

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
him because these are first read and as

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.650 
him because these are first read and as
you<00:00:38.250> see<00:00:38.430> there<00:00:38.610> we<00:00:38.760> get<00:00:38.879> about<00:00:38.970> seven<00:00:39.480> yards

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
you see there we get about seven yards

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.600 
you see there we get about seven yards
so<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.290> nice<00:00:40.440> little<00:00:40.650> two-point

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
so it's a nice little two-point

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.090 
so it's a nice little two-point
conversion<00:00:42.120> dot<00:00:42.330> as<00:00:42.570> well<00:00:42.840> he's<00:00:43.769> going<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.949> be

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
conversion dot as well he's going to be

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.310 
conversion dot as well he's going to be
open<00:00:44.400> just<00:00:44.430> about<00:00:44.760> every<00:00:45.120> time<00:00:45.360> as<00:00:46.110> long<00:00:46.260> as

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
open just about every time as long as

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.380 
open just about every time as long as
he's<00:00:46.500> not<00:00:46.650> manned<00:00:46.979> up<00:00:47.159> and<00:00:47.400> he's<00:00:47.850> not<00:00:48.089> user

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
he's not manned up and he's not user

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.360 
he's not manned up and he's not user
lurked<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.680> we're<00:00:49.860> going<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.040> go<00:00:50.100> ahead<00:00:50.190> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
lurked so we're going to go ahead and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.360 
lurked so we're going to go ahead and
move<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.970> the<00:00:51.059> next<00:00:51.089> progressions<00:00:51.930> here

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
move on to the next progressions here

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.560 
move on to the next progressions here
you're<00:00:53.370> drags<00:00:53.670> almost<00:00:54.030> always<00:00:54.300> going<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> be

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
you're drags almost always going to be

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.039 
you're drags almost always going to be
open<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.500> nice<00:00:55.650> little<00:00:55.890> safety<00:00:56.280> valve

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:57.049 
open it's a nice little safety valve

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:00.079 
open it's a nice little safety valve
drags<00:00:58.049> get<00:00:58.500> open<00:00:58.830> underneath<00:00:59.100> every<00:00:59.519> zone<00:00:59.760> for

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
drags get open underneath every zone for

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.090 
drags get open underneath every zone for
your<00:01:00.210> 223<00:01:00.839> yards<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.559> if<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.710> need<00:01:01.830> a<00:01:01.860> first

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
your 223 yards so if you need a first

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.260 
your 223 yards so if you need a first
down<00:01:02.449> drag<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.570> definitely<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.019> way<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.260> go

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
down drag is definitely a way to go

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.289 
down drag is definitely a way to go
right<00:01:06.270> bumper<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.260> hitch<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.580> slot<00:01:08.909> there

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
right bumper in a hitch in a slot there

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.960 
right bumper in a hitch in a slot there
he's<00:01:09.750> not<00:01:09.930> always<00:01:10.170> going<00:01:10.440> to<00:01:10.500> be<00:01:10.590> open<00:01:11.130> it's

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
he's not always going to be open it's

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.670 
he's not always going to be open it's
always<00:01:12.119> going<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.390> be<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.510> tight<00:01:12.810> throw<00:01:13.229> unless

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
always going to be a tight throw unless

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.220 
always going to be a tight throw unless
they<00:01:13.920> don't<00:01:14.190> have<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> flat<00:01:14.850> there<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.990> we'll

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
they don't have a flat there so we'll

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.830 
they don't have a flat there so we'll
say<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.980> they<00:01:17.190> take<00:01:17.820> their<00:01:18.180> flat<00:01:18.480> and<00:01:18.690> put

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
say that they take their flat and put

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.150 
say that they take their flat and put
them<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.050> a<00:01:19.110> purple<00:01:19.560> because<00:01:19.860> they<00:01:20.070> think

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
them in a purple because they think

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.110 
them in a purple because they think
we're<00:01:20.490> going<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.700> run<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.880> corner<00:01:21.300> route<00:01:23.120> so

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
we're going to run a corner route so

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.700 
we're going to run a corner route so
then<00:01:24.300> what<00:01:24.480> we'll<00:01:24.630> do<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.080> we'll<00:01:25.260> have<00:01:25.470> our

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
then what we'll do is we'll have our

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.220 
then what we'll do is we'll have our
typical<00:01:25.920> adjustments<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.060> he'll<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:28.050> in<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
typical adjustments and he'll be in a

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.530 
typical adjustments and he'll be in a
purple<00:01:28.620> over<00:01:28.890> there<00:01:29.100> instead<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.910> flat<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
purple over there instead of a flat and

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.020 
purple over there instead of a flat and
then<00:01:30.810> he'll<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.170> wide<00:01:31.440> open<00:01:31.520> it's<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.790> read

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
then he'll be wide open it's just a read

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.520 
then he'll be wide open it's just a read
that<00:01:33.270> you're<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:33.510> to<00:01:33.570> have<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.900> make<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that you're going to have to make and

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.940 
that you're going to have to make and
then<00:01:35.130> obviously<00:01:35.480> the<00:01:36.480> best<00:01:36.720> route<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.650> is

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
then obviously the best route in this is

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.550 
then obviously the best route in this is
going<00:01:38.160> to<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.430> our<00:01:38.850> crossing<00:01:39.450> route<00:01:39.690> and

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
going to be our crossing route and

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.650 
going to be our crossing route and
against<00:01:41.190> this<00:01:41.400> zone<00:01:41.730> I<00:01:41.970> doubt<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.570> to

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
against this zone I doubt it's going to

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.160 
against this zone I doubt it's going to
get<00:01:42.780> open<00:01:43.230> okay<00:01:44.720> typically<00:01:45.720> you're<00:01:45.930> going<00:01:45.990> to

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
get open okay typically you're going to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.900 
get open okay typically you're going to
see<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.380> get<00:01:46.710> open<00:01:46.950> against<00:01:47.220> man<00:01:47.550> so<00:01:47.790> we're

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
see that get open against man so we're

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.400 
see that get open against man so we're

wide<00:02:12.060> open<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:13.019> man<00:02:13.200> coverage<00:02:13.560> isn't<00:02:13.709> going

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
wide open the man coverage isn't going

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.410 
wide open the man coverage isn't going
to<00:02:13.950> be<00:02:14.069> able<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.400> handle<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.849> especially<00:02:15.000> if

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
to be able to handle it especially if

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.990 
to be able to handle it especially if
you<00:02:15.510> have<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.659> fast<00:02:16.110> receiver<00:02:16.680> there<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.159> last

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
you have a fast receiver there and last

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.670 
you have a fast receiver there and last
but<00:02:18.090> not<00:02:18.330> least<00:02:18.390> another<00:02:19.019> thing<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.379> can<00:02:19.530> do

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
but not least another thing you can do

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.950 
but not least another thing you can do
against<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.639> zone<00:02:20.849> coverage<00:02:21.359> like<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:21.810> here

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
against the zone coverage like this here

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.500 
against the zone coverage like this here
you<00:02:23.380> can<00:02:23.560> flatter<00:02:23.950> out<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.520> right<00:02:24.760> bumper<00:02:25.090> and

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
you can flatter out the right bumper and

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.990 
you can flatter out the right bumper and
you<00:02:25.660> can<00:02:25.810> actually<00:02:25.960> motion<00:02:26.650> in<00:02:26.830> be<00:02:27.190> here<00:02:27.640> and

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
you can actually motion in be here and

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.370 
you can actually motion in be here and
what<00:02:28.570> you're<00:02:28.660> going<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.870> have<00:02:29.050> is<00:02:29.260> you're

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
what you're going to have is you're

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.470 
what you're going to have is you're
going<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.560> be<00:02:29.830> wide<00:02:30.130> open<00:02:30.190> in<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.640> seams<00:02:31.060> there

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
going to be wide open in the seams there

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.600 
going to be wide open in the seams there
so<00:02:32.080> that's<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.350> nice<00:02:32.560> little<00:02:32.800> concept<00:02:33.370> there

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
so that's a nice little concept there

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.370 
so that's a nice little concept there
that<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:33.820> can<00:02:33.970> actually<00:02:34.150> throw<00:02:34.630> into<00:02:35.200> pretty

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
that you can actually throw into pretty

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.830 
that you can actually throw into pretty
much<00:02:35.470> any<00:02:35.860> formation<00:02:36.370> just<00:02:37.270> throw<00:02:37.570> them<00:02:37.630> on<00:02:37.810> a

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
much any formation just throw them on a

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.820 
much any formation just throw them on a
flat<00:02:38.460> motion<00:02:39.460> being<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.940> little<00:02:40.120> bit<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:40.830> then

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
flat motion being a little bit and then

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.830 
flat motion being a little bit and then
hit<00:02:42.070> them<00:02:42.160> when<00:02:42.310> he's<00:02:42.430> up<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.730> field<00:02:43.030> that's<00:02:43.750> a

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
hit them when he's up the field that's a

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.770 
hit them when he's up the field that's a
nice<00:02:43.990> quick<00:02:44.230> game<00:02:44.470> of<00:02:44.500> 22<00:02:45.100> yards<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:46.210> this<00:02:46.420> here

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780
