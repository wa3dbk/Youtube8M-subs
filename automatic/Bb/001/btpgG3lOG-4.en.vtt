here here's a little finish silt you can
see<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.880> bit<00:00:21.710> comes<00:00:22.710> down<00:00:22.949> sharp<00:00:23.310> like<00:00:23.490> an<00:00:23.640> axe

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710

see the bit comes down sharp like an axe
they're<00:00:25.710> kinda<00:00:26.279> like<00:00:26.400> an<00:00:26.550> axe<00:00:26.760> they're<00:00:27.480> not<00:00:28.019> as

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
they're kinda like an axe they're not as

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.030 
they're kinda like an axe they're not as
old<00:00:28.289> as<00:00:28.439> an<00:00:28.590> axe<00:00:30.500> well<00:00:31.500> that's<00:00:31.710> what<00:00:31.890> that

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
old as an axe well that's what that

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.370 
old as an axe well that's what that
claimed<00:00:32.369> in<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.610> way<00:00:32.759> but<00:00:34.100> they're<00:00:35.100> not<00:00:35.250> grooved

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
claimed in a way but they're not grooved

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.920 
claimed in a way but they're not grooved
this<00:00:39.290> would<00:00:40.290> be<00:00:40.440> at<00:00:40.590> full<00:00:40.950> groove<00:00:41.250> axe<00:00:41.840> see<00:00:42.840> how

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
this would be at full groove axe see how

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.119 
this would be at full groove axe see how
it's<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.140> groove<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.710> pole<00:00:43.950> area<00:00:49.010> you<00:00:50.010> can

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
it's a groove and a pole area you can

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.709 
it's a groove and a pole area you can
kind<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.399> tell<00:00:50.610> how<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.090> used<00:00:51.860> they<00:00:52.860> were

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
kind of tell how it was used they were

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
kind of tell how it was used they were
that's<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.930> full<00:00:55.140> grip<00:00:55.320> here's<00:00:55.620> a

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
that's a full grip here's a

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.490 
that's a full grip here's a
three-quarter<00:00:56.340> groove<00:00:56.579> axe<00:00:57.260> little<00:00:58.260> rough

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
three-quarter groove axe little rough

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.380 
three-quarter groove axe little rough
but<00:00:58.920> three-quarter<00:00:59.579> grooves<00:00:59.940> means<00:01:00.210> that

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
but three-quarter grooves means that

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.459 
but three-quarter grooves means that
when<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.629> goes<00:01:00.780> three-quarters<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.410> way

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
when it goes three-quarters the way

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.599 
when it goes three-quarters the way
around<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> stone

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
around the stone

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.070 
around the stone
this<00:01:03.300> one's<00:01:03.539> been<00:01:03.750> hit<00:01:03.960> by<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> disc<00:01:04.500> apply

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
this one's been hit by a disc apply

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.260 
this one's been hit by a disc apply
splat<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.350> top<00:01:07.710> full<00:01:08.490> groups<00:01:08.790> go<00:01:09.000> all<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> way

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
splat on top full groups go all the way

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.740 
splat on top full groups go all the way
around<00:01:10.340> they<00:01:11.340> say<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> full<00:01:12.479> grooves

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
around they say that a full grooves

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:20.450 
around they say that a full grooves
older<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.700> then<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> 3/4<00:01:15.420> groove<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:20.159> then

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
older and then the 3/4 groove and then

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.820 
older and then the 3/4 groove and then
here's<00:01:20.729> another<00:01:20.790> silt<00:01:23.330> nice<00:01:24.330> sharp<00:01:24.720> bit<00:01:25.049> now

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
here's another silt nice sharp bit now

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.819 
here's another silt nice sharp bit now
this<00:01:26.040> one<00:01:26.220> here<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.670> found<00:01:26.909> today<00:01:27.619> you<00:01:28.619> can

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
this one here that I found today you can

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.719 
this one here that I found today you can
see<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.340> perfect<00:01:29.850> lines<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:32.520> would

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
see the perfect lines on it and it would

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.870 
see the perfect lines on it and it would
have<00:01:32.820> been<00:01:34.310> this<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.610> would<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:35.820> been

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
have been this here would have been

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.880 
have been this here would have been
pecked<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.540> ground<00:01:36.780> down<00:01:36.930> until<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.710> had<00:01:37.860> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
pecked and ground down until it had a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.890 
pecked and ground down until it had a
real<00:01:38.220> fine<00:01:38.670> bit<00:01:40.400> just<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.880> one<00:01:42.090> does

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
real fine bit just like this one does

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:52.100 
real fine bit just like this one does
or<00:01:44.530> this<00:01:44.770> one<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:47.290> one<00:01:47.500> here<00:01:47.680> I<00:01:47.710> think<00:01:48.280> that

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.380 

see<00:01:53.110> it's<00:01:53.230> perfectly<00:01:54.010> pecked<00:01:54.400> out<00:01:54.640> squared<00:01:55.120> at

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
see it's perfectly pecked out squared at

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.630 
see it's perfectly pecked out squared at
the<00:01:55.420> flat<00:01:55.750> region<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.830> flat<00:01:57.100> across<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.460> top

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
the flat region the flat across the top

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.450 
the flat region the flat across the top
of<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.650> and<00:01:59.650> the<00:01:59.770> backside<00:02:00.310> of<00:02:00.370> it<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.780> back<00:02:02.460> it

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
of it and the backside of it the back it

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.980 
of it and the backside of it the back it
would<00:02:03.610> have<00:02:03.700> been<00:02:03.820> a<00:02:03.850> really<00:02:04.180> nice<00:02:04.300> cell<00:02:04.720> had

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
would have been a really nice cell had

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.990 
would have been a really nice cell had
the<00:02:05.140> bit<00:02:05.350> been<00:02:05.710> on<00:02:05.860> it<00:02:06.010> and<00:02:06.100> maybe<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.790> bit

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
the bit been on it and maybe the bit

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.690 
the bit been on it and maybe the bit
half<00:02:07.360> been<00:02:07.720> on<00:02:07.900> it<00:02:08.020> one<00:02:08.260> time<00:02:08.500> they<00:02:08.740> just<00:02:08.770> wore

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
half been on it one time they just wore

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.290 
half been on it one time they just wore
it<00:02:09.729> down

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
it down

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.170 
it down
I<00:02:10.650> really<00:02:11.650> don't<00:02:11.770> know<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.040> tend<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.820> say<00:02:13.030> it's

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
I really don't know I tend to say it's

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.400 
I really don't know I tend to say it's
probably<00:02:13.390> not<00:02:13.720> finished

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
probably not finished

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.480 
probably not finished
but<00:02:15.150> that's<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.360> difference<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:18.790> them<00:02:18.970> and

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
but that's the difference in them and

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.770 
but that's the difference in them and
thanks<00:02:21.490> for<00:02:21.610> watching<00:02:22.000> this<00:02:22.090> video<00:02:22.300> I<00:02:22.540> hope

thanks for watching this video I hope
you<00:02:23.140> get<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.320> little<00:02:23.560> better<00:02:23.650> understanding

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
you get a little better understanding

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.160 
you get a little better understanding
here's<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.770> broken<00:02:26.770> cell<00:02:27.720> it's<00:02:28.720> got<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:28.930> good

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
here's a broken cell it's got a good

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
here's a broken cell it's got a good
there's<00:02:29.740> a<00:02:29.860> good<00:02:30.160> bit<00:02:30.400> area<00:02:31.710> so<00:02:32.710> they<00:02:32.950> worked

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
there's a good bit area so they worked

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
there's a good bit area so they worked
it<00:02:33.370> down<00:02:33.550> to<00:02:33.820> work<00:02:34.030> sharp<00:02:34.450> like<00:02:34.870> an<00:02:34.990> axe

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
it down to work sharp like an axe

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.080 
it down to work sharp like an axe
basically<00:02:37.210> all<00:02:37.360> our<00:02:37.390> self<00:02:37.840> was<00:02:38.140> is<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:39.090> chopping
