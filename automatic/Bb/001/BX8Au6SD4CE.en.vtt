00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
it's quick it's kind of painful but it

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.750 
it's quick it's kind of painful but it
gives<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.109> a<00:03:37.140> really<00:03:37.349> good<00:03:37.620> clean<00:03:38.040> arch<00:03:38.400> and

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
gives you a really good clean arch and

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.490 
gives you a really good clean arch and
it<00:03:38.849> lasts<00:03:39.060> longer<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.660> me<00:03:39.750> than<00:03:39.930> waxing<00:03:40.290> does

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500
