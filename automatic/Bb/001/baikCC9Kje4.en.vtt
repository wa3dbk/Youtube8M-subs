00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
getting into my clothing so this is a

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.770 
getting into my clothing so this is a
great<00:01:31.369> way<00:01:31.549> to<00:01:31.610> show<00:01:32.030> this<00:01:32.330> you<00:01:32.540> can<00:01:32.659> either

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
great way to show this you can either

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.950 
great way to show this you can either
offset<00:01:33.380> it<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:33.770> get<00:01:34.040> it<00:01:34.220> a<00:01:34.369> slight<00:01:35.299> edge<00:01:35.630> or

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
offset it so you get it a slight edge or

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.140 
offset it so you get it a slight edge or
if<00:01:36.440> one<00:01:36.680> napkin<00:01:36.950> is<00:01:37.220> larger<00:01:37.670> than<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:37.880> other

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
if one napkin is larger than the other

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.289 
if one napkin is larger than the other
they<00:01:38.450> layer<00:01:38.720> very<00:01:39.200> very<00:01:39.500> well<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:40.299> then

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
they layer very very well and then

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.789 
they layer very very well and then
giving<00:01:41.720> sort<00:01:41.930> of<00:01:41.990> a<00:01:42.080> Moroccan<00:01:42.680> feel<00:01:42.979> or<00:01:44.799> India
