a blur number to you but an ass do you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.370 
a blur number to you but an ass do you
ask<00:01:54.299> Tico<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.780> might<00:01:54.930> want<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.140> take<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.290> look

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
ask Tico you might want to take a look

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.649 
ask Tico you might want to take a look
up<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:55.950> how<00:01:56.670> much<00:01:56.850> are<00:01:57.060> each<00:01:57.180> items<00:01:57.450> are

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
up like that how much are each items are

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.569 
up like that how much are each items are
and<00:01:57.840> then<00:01:57.930> when<00:01:58.619> something<00:01:58.920> sold<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.310> want<00:01:59.520> to

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
and then when something sold you want to

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.039 
and then when something sold you want to
take<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> look<00:01:59.880> at<00:02:00.000> like<00:02:00.149> what's<00:02:00.390> what's<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:00.899> at

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
take a look at like what's what's so at

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.139 
take a look at like what's what's so at
what<00:02:01.200> price<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.740> then<00:02:01.799> if<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.909> keep<00:02:03.119> doing

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
what price and then if you keep doing

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.780 
what price and then if you keep doing
this<00:02:03.479> way<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.140> eventually<00:02:04.530> see<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> trend<00:02:05.219> of

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
this way you eventually see a trend of

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.850 
this way you eventually see a trend of
what<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.420> there<00:02:06.600> but<00:02:06.659> it's<00:02:06.990> not<00:02:07.049> there<00:02:07.350> what

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
what is there but it's not there what

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.139 
what is there but it's not there what
sells<00:02:08.160> what<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:08.700> doesn't<00:02:09.030> sell

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
sells what but doesn't sell

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.000 
sells what but doesn't sell
that<00:02:10.840> is<00:02:10.989> how<00:02:11.110> i<00:02:11.140> started<00:02:11.470> off<00:02:11.939> and<00:02:14.010> it's

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
that is how i started off and it's

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.920 
that is how i started off and it's
better<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.459> take<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.790> slow<00:02:16.090> I<00:02:16.120> mean<00:02:16.450> they<00:02:16.900> just

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
better to take it slow I mean they just

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.300 
better to take it slow I mean they just
in<00:02:17.379> the<00:02:17.439> beginning<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.799> might<00:02:18.010> not<00:02:18.069> really

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
in the beginning you might not really

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.449 
in the beginning you might not really
know<00:02:18.549> prices<00:02:18.909> so<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.920> might<00:02:21.069> have<00:02:21.129> you<00:02:21.340> might

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
know prices so you might have you might

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.610 
know prices so you might have you might
miss<00:02:21.670> couple<00:02:22.030> things<00:02:22.239> that's<00:02:22.930> cheap<00:02:23.349> tin<00:02:23.530> to

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
miss couple things that's cheap tin to

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.559 
miss couple things that's cheap tin to
my<00:02:23.709> final<00:02:24.069> later<00:02:24.280> on<00:02:24.489> which<00:02:24.700> is<00:02:24.849> completely

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
my final later on which is completely

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.270 
my final later on which is completely
okay<00:02:25.989> because<00:02:26.290> like<00:02:26.470> they're<00:02:26.739> just<00:02:26.950> hard<00:02:27.129> if

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
okay because like they're just hard if

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.160 
okay because like they're just hard if
there<00:02:27.819> are<00:02:27.909> we<00:02:28.000> saved<00:02:28.209> in<00:02:28.359> a<00:02:28.420> story<00:02:28.629> so<00:02:28.900> it's

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
there are we saved in a story so it's

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.649 
there are we saved in a story so it's
better<00:02:29.319> to<00:02:29.530> just<00:02:29.680> take<00:02:29.829> it<00:02:29.980> slow<00:02:30.450> rather<00:02:31.450> than

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
better to just take it slow rather than

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.289 
better to just take it slow rather than
just<00:02:32.620> rush<00:02:32.859> in<00:02:33.069> and<00:02:33.099> end<00:02:33.640> up<00:02:33.760> losing<00:02:34.120> money

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
just rush in and end up losing money

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.020 
just rush in and end up losing money
because<00:02:34.540> some<00:02:35.159> it<00:02:36.159> could<00:02:36.370> be<00:02:36.519> quite

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
because some it could be quite

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.089 
because some it could be quite
devastated<00:02:37.629> when<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:37.870> have<00:02:38.290> no<00:02:38.470> findings<00:02:38.920> and

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
devastated when you have no findings and

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.780 
devastated when you have no findings and
the<00:02:39.459> item<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:39.819> not<00:02:39.939> selling<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:41.530> yeah<00:02:41.790> take

with the regular screen mode this is
seems<00:04:11.109> to<00:04:11.229> work<00:04:11.379> out<00:04:11.470> better<00:04:11.650> for<00:04:11.889> me<00:04:11.979> so<00:04:12.159> far

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
seems to work out better for me so far

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.509
