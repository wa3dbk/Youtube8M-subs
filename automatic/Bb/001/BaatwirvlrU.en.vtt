00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello today there's ice cream and 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.720
 Although no sugar cream 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.820
 dairy and other pork 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.740
 So exactly the right one for all fans 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.019
 the stone age diet or mario de 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.790
 or the sin at their general 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.369
 Many people find it hard to imagine 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.470
 that ice cream can be made that way 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.080
 many people without these additional products 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.730
 Mine must necessarily rainer sugar must 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.859
 from the numerous westens about it 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.840
 not because she just thinks otherwise 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.250
 it does not work that is completely possible 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.579
 simple around there not much for 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.680
 even only two ingredients are the basis for 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.910
 This recipe is bananas for two 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.600
 you need two small portions 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.670
 bananas 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.079
 which should be as equal as possible and 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.020
 very important that should be before 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.700
 freeze for at least three four hours 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.559
 then about ten to fifteen minutes 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.809
 let it thaw a bit 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.360
 better to process then 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.039
 Allowed if only in small slices 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.410
 give them a tube with a flat 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.940
 ground and then they are tamped and 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.809
 The potato mash was the whole thing 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.489
 one also in a kitchen machine 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.390
 let it be done there is of course 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.860
 much less effort went 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.450
 The mesh can do this as well 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.310
 also with a potato rammer 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.130
 or perhaps with a nothing thing 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.180
 I work once the basic mass of 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.010
 ice finished 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.080
 that does not taste like an extreme punch 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.970
 banana but one tastes 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.799
 mainly something is this sweet 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.990
 are quite enough despite the cold 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.810
 I'll give you a few spoonfuls now 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.930
 cocoa powder 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.299
 more or less simply very strong 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:34.220
 his unsecured sale of valrhona 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.720
 good luck kneaded well that too 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.539
 Guarantee more exhausting than with the 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.429
 machine and after some time and something 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.429
 patience has a nice ice mass 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.680
 that's the whole thing 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.530
 as simple as that ice cream 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.810
 chocolate is very healthy and rehm 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.580
 of course this recipe and many 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.830
 further development also in my new 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.300
 book de mur taste this book 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.630
 just appeared 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.120
 there are many such recipes in it too 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.750
 of course, all after the widespread 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:14.520
 stink time concepts palÃ©o concepts 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.590
 and so it is therefore a matter of 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.660
 to recognize conventional come with 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.730
 natural ingredients and healthy ingredients 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.410
 still taste very good 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.470
 and that's all 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.820
 I hope that was interesting many 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.060
 thanks for watching and until the next 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.060
