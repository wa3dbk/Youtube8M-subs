00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.260 

is<00:01:14.920> that<00:01:15.100> you<00:01:15.220> really<00:01:15.520> need<00:01:15.700> to<00:01:15.850> be<00:01:15.970> in

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
is that you really need to be in

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.630 
is that you really need to be in
particular<00:01:17.170> in<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:17.830> water<00:01:18.040> safely

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
particular in the water safely

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.850 
particular in the water safely
temperature<00:01:19.390> is<00:01:19.540> sixteen<00:01:20.140> point<00:01:20.170> five

I'll<00:01:23.950> write<00:01:24.190> that<00:01:24.220> down<00:01:25.380> 194

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
I'll write that down 194

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.790 
I'll write that down 194
194<00:01:28.290> for<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.650> conductivity<00:01:30.140> okay<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.200> he<00:01:31.650> hits

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
194 for the conductivity okay so he hits

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.440 
194 for the conductivity okay so he hits
two<00:01:32.010> different<00:01:32.340> bottle<00:01:32.820> which<00:01:32.940> is<00:01:33.060> water

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
two different bottle which is water

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.640 
two different bottle which is water
there's<00:01:33.840> two<00:01:34.020> different<00:01:34.410> techniques<00:01:39.650> all

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
there's two different techniques all

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.760 
there's two different techniques all
right<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:40.950> first<00:01:41.130> one<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:42.510> the<00:01:42.930> e.coli

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
right the first one is for the e.coli

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.050 
right the first one is for the e.coli
testing

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.359 

we<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:51.720> steal<00:01:51.900> that<00:01:52.140> bottle<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:52.740> all<00:01:53.010> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
we just steal that bottle up all the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.000 
we just steal that bottle up all the
testing<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.940> done<00:01:53.970> back<00:01:54.420> at<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> lab<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.590> we're

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
testing is done back at the lab so we're

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.920 
testing is done back at the lab so we're
all<00:01:56.130> done<00:01:56.400> with<00:01:56.580> preparation<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.690> sample

for<00:03:04.060> number<00:03:04.299> one<00:03:04.540> it's<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.319> packet<00:03:05.650> for<00:03:05.799> number

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
for number one it's a packet for number

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.460 
for number one it's a packet for number
two<00:03:06.310> those<00:03:07.030> go<00:03:07.269> in<00:03:07.450> right<00:03:07.780> as<00:03:08.079> soon<00:03:08.260> as<00:03:08.349> you

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
two those go in right as soon as you

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.940 
two those go in right as soon as you
take<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.769> sample<00:03:08.980> out<00:03:09.220> of

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
take the sample out of

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.490 
take the sample out of
shake<00:03:10.640> it<00:03:10.790> up<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.569> take<00:03:11.750> it<00:03:11.780> back<00:03:12.020> to<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.319> lab

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
shake it up and take it back to the lab

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.000 
shake it up and take it back to the lab
and<00:03:12.800> adds<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.970> third<00:03:14.050> reagent<00:03:15.050> and<00:03:15.680> then<00:03:15.860> it's

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
and adds a third reagent and then it's

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.100 
and adds a third reagent and then it's
ready<00:03:16.160> for<00:03:16.280> further<00:03:16.700> testing<00:03:17.209> so<00:03:17.780> they<00:03:17.810> had

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
ready for further testing so they had

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.610 
ready for further testing so they had
one<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.440> two<00:03:18.740> right<00:03:19.040> here<00:03:19.250> by<00:03:19.490> the<00:03:19.550> stream

and<00:04:13.730> flocculants<00:04:14.299> there's<00:04:14.510> a<00:04:14.569> bunch<00:04:14.780> of<00:04:14.870> stuff

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
and flocculants there's a bunch of stuff

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.499 
and flocculants there's a bunch of stuff
floating<00:04:15.230> around<00:04:15.680> then<00:04:16.519> a<00:04:16.609> sip<00:04:17.000> and<00:04:17.180> settle
