around one car at first but then i was

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.010 
around one car at first but then i was
like<00:03:11.400> forget<00:03:11.790> this<00:03:11.910> i<00:03:12.150> must<00:03:12.600> spread<00:03:12.750> them<00:03:12.930> out

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020

like forget this i must spread them out
all<00:03:13.320> through<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.700> map<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.630> that's<00:03:15.870> and

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
all through the the map and that's and

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.590 
all through the the map and that's and
it<00:03:16.290> made<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.620> whole<00:03:16.770> lot<00:03:16.800> easier<00:03:17.360> so<00:03:18.360> that's

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
it made it a whole lot easier so that's

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
it made it a whole lot easier so that's
pretty<00:03:18.750> much<00:03:18.810> how<00:03:18.990> you<00:03:19.020> have<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.260> do<00:03:19.380> that's
