00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
shadow side of Katherine here this will

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.310 
shadow side of Katherine here this will
decrease<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.790> contrast<00:01:42.360> between<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.899> dark

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320

remember<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.270> white<00:01:48.570> being<00:01:49.229> reflector

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
remember it's a white being reflector

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.020 
remember it's a white being reflector
that<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.579> being<00:01:50.850> used<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.570> acts<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:53.189> stage

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
that is being used it acts like a stage
