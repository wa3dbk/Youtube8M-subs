 it's an event that takes place 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.420
 not only at the French level was 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.240
 saved in other countries there are some 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.360
 outstanding animations the one that go 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.530

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.799
 give up because maybe have it 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:48.680
 forgot what this batman game is already worth 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.369
 the bat lives is touched at 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.479
 neck 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:58.369
 ohlala the goblins not immune to a 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:02.569
 mouse I missed it a year ago 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:08.060
 now the young man at the cafe adorned 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:10.850
 of croissants as we dream blow the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.100
 Germans begin then this is 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.180
 important bat 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.910
 he's really called fernand but 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.100
 is about to close on him 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.770
 it's swelling milestones for us doing this 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.600
 we will not let you 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.950
 to listen to it by explaining why 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.980
 it's important the bat because 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.480
 that mosquitoes obviously if you 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.550
 had bats with you summer 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.930
 broustic around you is not it 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.830
 does not it transport it anyway? 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.200
 I prefer a mosquito bite 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.060
 since heart of fire it's true that without 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.060
 she would still have his wife 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.790
 it's back to school 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:03:01.080
 without her she would call herself the mouse 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:02.220
 it's a good comeback and without hair yes 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.580
 the bat is there bernard 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.990
 darniche of rare not said gentleman 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.990
 I seriously do opens 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.670
 these assholes is that it's true that 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.700
 mosquitoes are afraid of the bald 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.050
 mouse befriends the bats himself 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.060
 feed on mosquitoes but not 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.420
 only she feeds on dogs not 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.120
 of butterfly insects night it's from 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.310
 small Coleoptera beetles lci that 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.260
 there are too many insects is limited 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.090
 insect populations and so are 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.500
 very useful for us what this summer 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.170
 she's not onfray bats 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:48.280
 invaded by a set in the article of the 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:49.690
 Parisian signed flora on his knees this is the 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.800
 ours the journalist of parisian flora 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.480
 knee to no luck what is it 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.790
 she lives what she says flora 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:00.010
 knee she said alcohol we had yet 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.870
 talked about heaps of misconceptions about the 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.910
 bat for example the bald 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.950
 mouse does not cling to hair 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.620
 as is told in Bobigny are 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.830
 actually low and cd people 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.860
 that remained in the minds 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.560
 people are still afraid to get there 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.930
 it's not an accident it's normally 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.060
 but here it is named will of 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.280
 want to hold on to them which 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.010
 much more afraid of us christian is 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.260
 so then here you are a will 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.850
 you have to sell the bat better 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.770
 because you speak in a monotone 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:37.210
 like that and it's true what do we do 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:39.070
 language the victory of mark and me on the 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.229
 bat it's extraordinary she 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.910
 she creates maternities currently 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.250
 ie it's great it's a 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.560
 wonderful organization of mammals 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.110
 that is, there are pots paul yesterday 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.330
 of bats where she is delegating 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.750
 raising babies to go hunting 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.910
 it's true or not yes yes it's true 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.880
 so this lan is not given but 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.070
 it's good you said it you said it well 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.410
 a lot of chabanais 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.640
 are cute both it's not 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:14.100
 true either that they are all 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:16.930
 lucie fuse we know what that means 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:20.340
 No, that's not the name of July 15th 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.340
 they do not fear all the light 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.960
 go to us too much who calm under the 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.570
 light even more prevalent in the 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.800
 live trees in broad daylight and here it is 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.120
 include bats that make 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.040
 especially to put or two meters 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.780
 fifty in particular in the 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.890
 islands like for example the seychelles and 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.030
 where people sleeves elsewhere because 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.410
 I have enough to eat for a family 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.580
 and they not fear the light they 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.390
 go out in full day we see them 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.680
 are monsters but then why 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.060
 makes the bat night so 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.190
 they can live the day because he 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.900
 is pro seychelles down because the 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.780
 species at home I still arrive at 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.160
 overwhelmingly 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.920
 on the other hand, they carry the 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.290
 coronavirus yes it's beer like 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.370
 Chirac 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.960
 why we can get excited I'm going 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.840
 tell you mister jouve maybe go 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.610
 the jdd yesterday is here so I had to elisa 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.980
 know another journalist we 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.470
 said that thanks to the bat pit 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.930
 lane some a certain jason 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:17.670
 richman and all possess live a lot 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:20.380
 older so to horror indeed 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:22.480
 unlike unlike the legend 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.650
 who says that the bigger we are the more we live 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.630
 old bastards 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.430
 I have my hands in mammals yes 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.070
 because there is a small thing 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.440
 and yes this elephant the elephant lives longer 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.150
 old that the horse the horse lives more 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.500
 old that mouse bags and animals 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.630
 can basically more they live 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.820
 a long time but it's not always true 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.850
 we found a tiny bats 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.400
 who lives a long time ago 41 years 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.330
 she's called the murine de brent it's 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.130
 that's good, sir 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.170
 yes that's it so it's thanks to 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.060
 luggage that they were practiced on 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:55.680
 bats have to ask them a little 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.680
 aluminum ring 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.030
 find a mouse that was ringed 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.870
 little more excited 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.380
 which means that means that 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:11.060
 this 41- year - old baguet animal may be 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.580
 as bats from 7 to lviv 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.860
 of course and it is possible we have it 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.270
 regained confidence that this one it's 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.850
 finds died prematurely at the 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.170
 ball off residential have these 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.220
 month we're all going to bury you maybe 

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.300
 that it was the bat that is 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.950
 just and she shoots a hood 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:29.780
 bat and we thought it was 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:31.040
 like that it would have been a pie ix by 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.360
 against I had bats to 

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.220
 marseille is a lot and a good 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.540
 owl who arrived two years later 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:41.090
 more bats that's not true 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:42.950
 incredible the wall interested what 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.110
 listen thanks I think you spent 

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.640
 a nice night between Saturday to Sunday 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.320
 but what they did with 

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.910
 this seventh international night 

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.620
 the bat nailed on the 

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.090
 the doors of the big names so in fact 

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.970
 at the end we did some 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:59.650
 animations to raise awareness 

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.650
 the general public to this info
