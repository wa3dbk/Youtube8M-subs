thing<00:01:31.140> I'm<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.470> little<00:01:31.680> cautious<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.670> I

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
thing I'm a little cautious of is I

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.760 
thing I'm a little cautious of is I
don't<00:01:33.060> really<00:01:33.450> know<00:01:33.659> if<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.049> coating<00:01:34.350> will

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
don't really know if this coating will

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.950

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
this for heat outside I have tested this

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.120 
this for heat outside I have tested this
already<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.840> takes<00:01:49.110> about<00:01:49.290> three<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.100> half

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
already it takes about three and a half

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.149 
already it takes about three and a half
of<00:01:50.490> these<00:01:50.640> fill<00:01:51.270> one<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.540> these<00:01:51.630> up<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.950> little

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
of these fill one of these up the little

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.410 
of these fill one of these up the little
can<00:01:53.430> two<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.329> them<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.990> guys<00:01:55.820> hand<00:01:56.820> sanitizer

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
can two of them so guys hand sanitizer

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.910 
can two of them so guys hand sanitizer
is<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.320> answer

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
is the answer

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.880 
is the answer
forward<00:01:59.869> gel<00:02:00.869> fuel<00:02:01.079> that's<00:02:01.409> all<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.680> got<00:02:01.799> to

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
forward gel fuel that's all you got to

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.370 
forward gel fuel that's all you got to
have<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.909> can't<00:02:03.149> beat<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.630> dollar<00:02:03.990> for

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
have and you can't beat it a dollar for

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.080 
have and you can't beat it a dollar for
this<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.009> like<00:02:05.159> two<00:02:05.340> bucks<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.759> refill

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
this so it's like two bucks to refill

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.930 
this so it's like two bucks to refill
this<00:02:06.240> that's<00:02:06.479> half<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.930> price<00:02:07.250> even<00:02:08.250> almost<00:02:08.670> a

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
this that's half the price even almost a

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.520 
this that's half the price even almost a
third<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.209> what<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.780> would<00:02:09.929> cost<00:02:09.959> you

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
third of what it would cost you

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.060 
third of what it would cost you
or<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:11.090> regular<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:13.200> hope<00:02:13.500> that's<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.860> help
