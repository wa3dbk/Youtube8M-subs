00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.780
 in the current model of understanding the learning processes 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.499
 in Western civilization 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:13.590
 learning is directly associated with the idea of 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.980
 with a dictionary 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.660
 especially with regard to the skills we have developed 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.250
 the excellence of our abilities 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.250
 are obtained with the repetition 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:35.079
 and discernment from a great deal of experience 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.789
 until we are able to perceive in the smallest detail 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.910
 and make distinctions 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.500
 on this 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.210
 all the learning take us on 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.400
 while helping us to develop a new competence 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.530
 and we can limit 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.660
 in learning other skills 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.660
 which are competitors of that 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.660
 sports experiments 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.540
 show 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.570
 that with a high level athlete who has a gesture an already conditioned ability 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.130
 to make a minor technical change 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.920
 maybe you need sein 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.260
 repetitions of the new gesture 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.010
 until the nervous circuits 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.030
 and all his musculature 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.030
 adapt to the new gesture 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.110
 well 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.490
 taking this into account 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.350
 when we learn our mother tongue 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.770
 often this conditioning becomes so sturdy and so strong 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.410
 that goal and not learn another language 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.100
 it's not lack of attention 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.330
 or dedication 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.310
 is that the automatic is already 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.870
 so stable 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.180
 that when we think the tomato promises all the repertoire is triggered 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.350
 for mother tongue 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.290
 there are no alternative ways to insert 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.459
 other neural circuits 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.689
 as strong as 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.750
 except through much practice and repetition 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:20.920
 in the last ten years 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.080
 neuroscientists have made very interesting discoveries 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.739
 regarding these neurochemical 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.049
 which are responsible for learning 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.479
 that you have an apprenticeship 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:37.899
 we humans 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:39.849
 what was discovered 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.870
 is that with the human brain grows along 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.879
 our whole life 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.009
 if we are properly stimulated 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.549
 for you to have an idea of ​​what this represents 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.889
 Experiments with laboratory mice have given an idea of ​​the 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.929
 of what is possible 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:03.919
 were we have three groups of rat pups 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.230
 that were treated in the same feeding conditions 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:12.169
 the water and space of such in abundance 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:16.569
 throughout the morning from childhood to adulthood 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:22.599
 each of these three groups was given a different challenge 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:28.849
 the first group did nothing but the mice grew as mice 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.029
 normal laboratory conditions 

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:34.359
 was a control group 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:35.689
 the second group 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:40.090
 was given a toy for each little bit to entertain 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.090
 during its entire development phase 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:45.659
 to the third group 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:46.980
 was given 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.720
 a new toy every two with the 3 days 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:54.249
 during the entire development period 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.799
 in adulthood 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.050
 these animals were slaughtered 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.410
 and their brains were heavy 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:07.049
 the results were impressive 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.560
 the first thousand 2nd group 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.379
 had an average brain of almost the same size 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.609
 and practically the same mass 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.590
 the third group 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.330
 compared to the other two 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.370
 had a brain almost twice the size 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.020
 and almost three times as much a cup 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:36.680
 this also occurs with the human being 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.440
 there is a very large amount of cells in our brain called 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.379
 the prostitutes 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:45.090
 which are germinal and mixed neurons 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.270
 whose function was unknown 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.110
 in the phase of youth to adulthood aging 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:56.939
 what has been discovered in the last 10 or 15 years by neuroscientists 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.670
 and what 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.660
 increasing the concentration of my baptized laughs in our organism 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.089
 and are released in higher flow 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:11.279
 in the presence of some hormones 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:16.099
 and if astrocytes can medicine the old your other dreams 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.620
 if new nerve connections 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.260
 that is, the astrocytes are from the germinal sinister plane 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.529
 ready to be activated 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:32.989
 if the person actually achieves the concentrations of no breaks 

00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:35.169
 dollars 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.979
 the scientists went further and identified at least 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.080
 three categories of stimuli 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.199
 three types of stimuli that promote the release 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.599
 with increasing concentration 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.029
 demille activators 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:52.800
 the first of them 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.059
 curiosity 

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:59.840
 tutor quinquênios aroused interest everything that falls in love with us 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.039
 everything that motivates us 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.419
 pulls feelings of inner excitement - well known 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:10.279
 are these substances flowing through our body 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:13.930
 creating new neurons 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.229
 activating new circuits 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.650
 increasing our ability to learn 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:23.710
 the second category of stimuli 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.889
 are the very stimuli of the environment 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:30.889
 the situations of life that often make us more flexible 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:34.900
 that require us to make decisions, I had to change my mind 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:39.569
 that ask us to learn new skills and competences 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:42.369
 some of them are both stressful 

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:45.409
 and provided it is not a trauma before 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:46.689
 that is 

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:50.989
 whose concentration of hormones and stress hemingway the function of my 

00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:52.619
 activators 

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:54.759
 these day-to-day situations 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:56.020
 also 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.310
 cause new neurons to go live 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.490
 increasing our banks 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.960
 of learning 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.669
 the third category of stimuli 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:12.300
 are the new body movements and patterns of sensory perception 

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:16.270
 evidently do not fit into this category 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.510
 the automatic movements 

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.770
 and repetitive features of an old-fashioned 'industrial production line' 

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:26.999
 and new movements 

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:29.559
 the new patterns of perception 

00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:33.080
 the new coordination between the senses 

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:36.089
 thus 

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:38.169
 we can keep each other 

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:41.620
 permanently stimulated throughout life 

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:47.330
 with the goal of expanding our learning ability 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.710
 our potential 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.710
 development 

00:07:52.219 --> 00:07:54.629
 if you take that into account 

00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:56.860
 then you will know here 

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.210
 every one or two years it would be very interesting to learn a new 

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.380
 abiliity 

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:03.860
 a new sport 

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.870
 a new musical instrument 

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.129
 a new competence 

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:13.310
 exploring interesting and curious or motivating things 

00:08:13.999 --> 00:08:15.300
 to keep german 

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.029
