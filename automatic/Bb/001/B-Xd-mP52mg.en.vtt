00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.179 
is the blast 180 x-pro 1800 now what is
different<00:01:15.210> about<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.659> may<00:01:15.810> ask<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.320> has

four<00:01:17.640> ports<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.960> 1800<00:01:19.710> versus<00:01:20.040> 15-6<00:01:20.820> now

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
four ports it's 1800 versus 15-6 now

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.070 
four ports it's 1800 versus 15-6 now
let's<00:01:21.600> take<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.049> look<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:22.560> far<00:01:22.920> as<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.159> size<00:01:23.400> I

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
let's take a look as far as the size I

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.960 
let's take a look as far as the size I
mean<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.259> nearly<00:01:25.650> identical<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.729> one's<00:01:26.909> a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
mean it's nearly identical this one's a

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.130 
mean it's nearly identical this one's a
little<00:01:27.119> bit<00:01:27.360> thicker<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.780> little<00:01:28.049> bit

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
little bit thicker and a little bit

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.440 
little bit thicker and a little bit
heavier<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:29.220> nearly<00:01:29.430> identical<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.270> to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
heavier but it's nearly identical and to

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.920 
heavier but it's nearly identical and to
me<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:30.960> totally<00:01:31.799> worth<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:33.000> get<00:01:33.329> four

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
me it's totally worth it to get four

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.170 
me it's totally worth it to get four
ports<00:01:34.320> instead<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.650> two<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.040> may<00:01:35.460> not<00:01:35.640> need<00:01:35.880> four

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
ports instead of two I may not need four

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.359 
ports instead of two I may not need four
ports<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:37.290> if<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.470> ever<00:01:37.590> did<00:01:37.829> need<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.250> is

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
ports but if I ever did need it it is

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.609 
ports but if I ever did need it it is
handy<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.020> actually<00:01:40.170> does

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
handy to have this so it actually does

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.490 
handy to have this so it actually does
work<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.340> exact<00:01:41.790> same<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.390> remains<00:01:43.140> my
