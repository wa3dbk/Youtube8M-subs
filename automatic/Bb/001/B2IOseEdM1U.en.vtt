question but if you are looking for a

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.950 
question but if you are looking for a
good<00:00:23.859> snack<00:00:24.130> beef<00:00:24.670> beef<00:00:25.240> jerky<00:00:25.599> is<00:00:25.660> a<00:00:25.750> great

good snack beef beef jerky is a great

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.950 
good snack beef beef jerky is a great
one<00:00:26.140> as<00:00:26.380> far<00:00:26.560> as<00:00:26.679> high<00:00:26.830> protein<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:28.359> does<00:00:28.570> they

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
one as far as high protein it does they

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.450 
one as far as high protein it does they
debt<00:00:29.170> they<00:00:29.380> do<00:00:29.439> tend<00:00:29.710> to<00:00:29.800> have<00:00:29.980> a<00:00:30.250> lot<00:00:30.400> of

debt they do tend to have a lot of

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.580 
debt they do tend to have a lot of
sodium<00:00:30.849> in<00:00:31.179> them<00:00:31.269> so<00:00:31.570> if<00:00:31.839> you<00:00:32.050> have<00:00:32.230> high<00:00:32.410> blood
