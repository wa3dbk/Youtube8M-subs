00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 I find it very funny when I hear 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.879
 on tv the expression money laundering 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.970
 Someone was convicted of 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.110
 money and then I think about another crime 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.719
 no victim 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.460
 because for those who do not know that it will 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.190
 money simply the subject that 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.560
 gets money from an activity that 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.189
 State considers it not acceptable 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.199
 illegal and the subject is obliged to 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.160
 to introduce this money into an activity 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.070
 legal to mask the source of money 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.940
 then according to the state parameters the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.920
 guy turned the dirty money into 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.960
 clean to start 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.610
 these terms money laundering 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.059
 money appears clean they are childish 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.629
 because dirty money is not clean 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.059
 money then you already have a vision 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.039
 there distorted than money money is 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.260
 morality does not have 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.090
 no matter for what you use 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.289
 money will continue without money going 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.940
 have the same value 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:05.010
 simple but let's go then what are 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.659
 the two main errors of the state 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.430
 first that the state is illegitimate he 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.920
 does not have the capacity and legitimacy to 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.140
 set nothing on right though people 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.060
 say the opposite, it just happens 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.700
 because the state uses force against 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.970
 people against peaceful people 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.350
 ok second point the state part of the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.299
 false premise that you are already being 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.860
 a slave of the state and that you are 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.490
 thanks to collaborate with the state 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.409
 collaborate as saying what you do 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.869
 with your own money you trade 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.030
 you do nothing more false than 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.220
 that this and I have no obligation to 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.170
 collaborate with absolutely nobody 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.670
 much less the state 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.130
 The only people I have to 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.250
 to collaborate are those with which I 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.670
 I make a voluntary exchange with 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.770
 I have established a contract is with which 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.020
 I owe something based on a 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.060
 voluntary exchange and yes but the state 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.770
 It was completely alien has not 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.810
 contract with the state 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.130
 then the state does not have to wait for the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.320
 collaborate with nothing 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.450
 imagine the following example imagine that the 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.780
 cannabidiol amount to help people 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.709
 who need cannabidiol 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:20.010
 Is the state going to say that I'm is 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.020
 trafficked any illegal substance 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.000
 now has this controversy have to ask 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.850
 authorization for life at last matters 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.459
 is that it is any other substance and 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.050
 I do not care if it's going to be for 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.140
 solve a health plan or if it will be 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.580
 for someone to use for fun 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.330
 no matter i can traffic what i 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.900
 I want to escape the fucking action 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.550
 is I have to wash this money right 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.900
 and then the state will say that the comet 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.870
 another crime 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.880
 it does not make sense, it does not make sense then 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.489
 in the money laundering fund was created 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.590
 by desperate jurists who saw that 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.380
 was completely incompetent in 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.230
 combating what they called a crime is 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.660
 and then they said so let's make 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.519
 miserable the life of the subject to 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.000
 make the most difficult and mess with money 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:12.120
 It's how I say money is the way 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.610
 I was against your life, it's money 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.310
 monopoly the state has a monopoly 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.829
 on the money it issues this 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.430
 money he wants to track down this money 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:28.079
 that is to control is it all inclusive 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.549
 devalues ​​your money is and it is so 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.130
 that he encountered his life until he 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.500
 decide what coins you will receive 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.360
 your salary 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.290
 So it's great that today we have 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.630
 such as bitcoin, for example, that is 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.400
 Yes, they are real money. 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.239
 money that depends on a bank 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.709
 central bureaucrats the currencies 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.540
 completely free of charge. 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.940
 central bank or government etc. 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.459
 it is even looks that interesting if I 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.630
 I wish I could wash bitcoin, you know. 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.220
 that bitcoin a global registry and 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.440
 we know that the address went to the 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.030
 which address a transaction that weigh 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.750
 address are not associated with a 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.640
 specific name of someone else but 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.859
 I wish I can do a wash of 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.079
 bitcoin and someone will say that I am 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:19.280
 committing the crime 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:22.830
 Of course there is not even digital coins 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.590
 is after which the beak appeared that are 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.580
 made to be completely anonymous 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.470
 this is the worst 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.930
 only gave to any lawyer for any 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.669
 political for any statistics they 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.250
 they will be desperate how we 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.650
 will handle so much technology with so much 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.719
 freedom that absurd it the technology 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.449
 giving freedom to the people with whom 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:45.569
 control will control them 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:49.259
 so deep down it's all an excuse to 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:52.469
 control your life then do not fall 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:55.259
 this whenever you see that the state 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:57.719
 It is to want to control the exchange 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:00.180
 I want to violate your right 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:03.060
 ownership over your body over the 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:07.530
 that's yours is your money 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:11.219
 Can you be sure that it's up to you? 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.270
 is that of just having control over the 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:15.240
 people's lives 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:19.050
 this should not happen then stop 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.810
 think about it and you need to wash 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.729
