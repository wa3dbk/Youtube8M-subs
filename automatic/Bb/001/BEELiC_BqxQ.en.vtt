00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
it for pc as well but it is quite

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.000 
it for pc as well but it is quite
smaller<00:00:20.279> than<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.090> other<00:00:22.039> logitech<00:00:23.539> mouse

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
is the the performance mouse MX so this

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.880 
is the the performance mouse MX so this
is<00:00:32.610> how<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.790> box<00:00:33.090> looks<00:00:33.329> like<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:34.110> got<00:00:34.590> it

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
is how the box looks like I just got it

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
pretty well with your hand it's slightly

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.350 
pretty well with your hand it's slightly
bigger<00:00:43.110> than<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:44.210> VX<00:00:45.210> nano<00:00:45.950> and<00:00:47.030> here<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.120> see

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
bigger than the VX nano and here you see

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.920 
bigger than the VX nano and here you see
the<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:51.020> unifying<00:00:52.160> USB<00:00:53.480> dongle<00:00:54.480> that

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
the this is the unifying USB dongle that

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.340 
the this is the unifying USB dongle that
they<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.320> here<00:00:55.670> so<00:00:56.670> let<00:00:57.390> me<00:00:57.420> let<00:00:58.109> me<00:00:58.199> open

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
they have here so let me let me open

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.080 
they have here so let me let me open
this<00:00:58.590> up<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.010> let's<00:00:59.550> see<00:00:59.670> what's<00:00:59.879> actually

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
this up and let's see what's actually

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:15.340 
this up and let's see what's actually
inside<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:01.160> try<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.219> see<00:01:02.370> how<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.640> works

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.999 

let's<00:01:16.350> say<00:01:17.119> so<00:01:18.140> this<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:20.180> almost<00:01:21.180> looks<00:01:21.600> like

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
let's say so this is almost looks like

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:28.940 
let's say so this is almost looks like
um<00:01:24.890> pretty<00:01:25.890> pretty<00:01:26.580> small<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.439> you<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.619> see

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
um pretty pretty small it you can see

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.609 
um pretty pretty small it you can see
here<00:01:29.630> this<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.790> on<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.180> off<00:01:33.750> or<00:01:34.259> dark

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
here this is the on and off or dark

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.390 
here this is the on and off or dark
field<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.340> if<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.909> are<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> glass<00:01:37.290> table<00:01:37.680> it

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
field so if you are on a glass table it

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.280 
field so if you are on a glass table it
picks<00:01:38.729> up<00:01:38.880> really<00:01:39.479> well<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:41.310> then<00:01:42.500> also<00:01:43.579> you

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
picks up really well and then also you

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.109 
picks up really well and then also you
can<00:01:46.290> open<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:47.780> it<00:01:48.780> uses<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.520> two<00:01:50.520> double<00:01:51.000> A

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
can open this it uses a two double A

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.399 
can open this it uses a two double A
batteries<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:53.750> there<00:01:54.750> should<00:01:55.110> be<00:01:55.380> a

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
batteries and there should be a

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.520 
batteries and there should be a
compartment<00:01:56.369> out<00:01:56.640> right<00:01:57.329> here<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:58.259> actually

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
compartment out right here to actually

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.420 
compartment out right here to actually
put<00:01:58.770> your<00:01:59.450> USB<00:02:01.670> see<00:02:02.670> how<00:02:02.850> actually<00:02:03.780> fits

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
put your USB see how actually fits

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:20.600 
put your USB see how actually fits
pop<00:02:06.430> this<00:02:06.670> out<00:02:13.320> so<00:02:15.720> hope<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:17.200> fits<00:02:18.130> right<00:02:18.400> in<00:02:19.110> so

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
pop this out so hope it fits right in so

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.950 
pop this out so hope it fits right in so
yes<00:02:21.610> all<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.910> have<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.120> do<00:02:22.270> is<00:02:22.450> press<00:02:22.750> this

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.090 
yes all you have to do is press this
little<00:02:23.170> mechanism<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:25.740> suppose<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.860> pop

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
little mechanism and suppose the pop

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:42.660 
little mechanism and suppose the pop
right<00:02:27.370> up<00:02:38.250> it's<00:02:39.250> not<00:02:39.430> popping<00:02:39.850> up<00:02:41.580> there<00:02:42.580> you

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
right up it's not popping up there you

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:50.850 
right up it's not popping up there you
go<00:02:43.050> so<00:02:44.280> quite<00:02:45.280> small<00:02:45.640> compared<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:49.860> older

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
go so quite small compared to the older

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.310 
go so quite small compared to the older
version<00:02:50.890> of<00:02:51.460> the<00:02:51.700> other<00:02:52.570> mouse<00:02:54.990> this<00:02:55.990> is

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
version of the other mouse this is

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.520 
version of the other mouse this is
actually<00:02:56.950> my<00:02:57.570> old<00:02:58.570> logitech<00:03:01.530> performance

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
actually my old logitech performance

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.510 
actually my old logitech performance
mouse<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:04.750> size<00:03:05.380> comparison<00:03:06.220> oh<00:03:08.160> not<00:03:09.160> not<00:03:09.459> too

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
mouse so size comparison oh not not too

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.720 
mouse so size comparison oh not not too
small<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.600> I<00:03:11.200> mean<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.620> really<00:03:12.100> fits<00:03:12.459> really

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
small and I mean it really fits really

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.970 
small and I mean it really fits really
well<00:03:12.850> with<00:03:13.180> your<00:03:13.360> hand<00:03:13.800> so<00:03:14.800> it<00:03:16.470> also<00:03:17.470> has<00:03:17.650> the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
well with your hand so it also has the

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.470 
well with your hand so it also has the
hyper<00:03:18.370> scroll<00:03:18.989> as<00:03:19.989> you<00:03:20.200> can<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.770> can<00:03:20.920> hear<00:03:21.480> so

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
hyper scroll as you can you can hear so

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.400 
hyper scroll as you can you can hear so
I<00:03:23.020> think<00:03:23.430> once<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:24.580> press<00:03:24.790> down<00:03:24.989> your<00:03:25.989> hair

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
I think once you press down your hair

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.240 
I think once you press down your hair
hear<00:03:26.680> that<00:03:26.860> click<00:03:28.380> this<00:03:29.380> is<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.860> regular

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
hear that click this is the regular

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.460 
hear that click this is the regular
scroll<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:33.010> is<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:34.120> hyper<00:03:34.300> scroll<00:03:34.780> take<00:03:35.320> the

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.500 
score really fast on the pages you also
have<00:03:39.340> this<00:03:40.180> button<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:41.080> flip<00:03:41.590> through<00:03:41.920> i'm

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
have this button to flip through i'm

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.820 
have this button to flip through i'm
guessing<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.720> folder<00:03:44.320> two<00:03:44.470> different
