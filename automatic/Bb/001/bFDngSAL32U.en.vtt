00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
are interesting to us because there are

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.890 
are interesting to us because there are
two<00:00:39.440> biological<00:00:39.910> crossroads<00:00:40.910> many<00:00:41.630> of<00:00:41.750> them

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
two biological crossroads many of them

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.660 
two biological crossroads many of them
plants<00:00:42.260> the<00:00:42.380> animals<00:00:42.710> here<00:00:42.950> are<00:00:43.100> at<00:00:43.400> the<00:00:43.550> edge

here some from the north on the edge in
the<00:00:49.550> south<00:00:52.239> well<00:00:53.239> we're<00:00:53.420> looking<00:00:53.510> at<00:00:53.750> seaweeds

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
the south well we're looking at seaweeds

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.320 
the south well we're looking at seaweeds
on<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:54.500> outer<00:00:54.620> city<00:00:55.010> so<00:00:55.460> at<00:00:55.880> the<00:00:55.940> moment<00:00:56.090> we

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
on the outer city so at the moment we

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.299 
on the outer city so at the moment we
just<00:00:56.360> come<00:00:56.630> to<00:00:56.750> this<00:00:56.870> show<00:00:57.170> and<00:00:57.800> it's<00:00:57.980> very<00:00:58.190> low

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
just come to this show and it's very low

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:59.950 
just come to this show and it's very low
tide<00:00:58.550> so<00:00:58.580> we've<00:00:58.850> been<00:00:58.940> able<00:00:59.090> to<00:00:59.180> get<00:00:59.390> quite<00:00:59.690> far

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
tide so we've been able to get quite far

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.080 
tide so we've been able to get quite far
out<00:00:59.989> into<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.590> kelp<00:01:00.770> beds<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:01.610> look<00:01:01.880> at<00:01:02.000> what

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
out into the kelp beds and look at what

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.069 
out into the kelp beds and look at what
seaweeds<00:01:02.510> are<00:01:02.600> growing<00:01:02.870> here

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:11.260

the aims of this project are to collect

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.279 
the aims of this project are to collect
good<00:01:12.200> quality<00:01:12.860> fresh<00:01:13.750> well<00:01:14.750> preserved

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.480 
material to add to the museum's
collections<00:01:17.810> so<00:01:18.380> that<00:01:18.409> we<00:01:18.649> can<00:01:18.829> extract<00:01:19.130> DNA

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
collections so that we can extract DNA

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.819 
collections so that we can extract DNA
but<00:01:20.060> we<00:01:20.179> can<00:01:20.329> understand<00:01:20.929> the<00:01:21.049> diversity<00:01:21.799> of

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
but we can understand the diversity of

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.550 
but we can understand the diversity of
life<00:01:22.039> but<00:01:22.670> also<00:01:22.820> how<00:01:23.270> shifts<00:01:23.990> in<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:24.350> world

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
life but also how shifts in the world

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.260 
life but also how shifts in the world
are<00:01:24.829> affecting<00:01:25.520> our<00:01:25.640> bodies<00:01:29.500> this<00:01:30.500> is

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
are affecting our bodies this is

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.520 
are affecting our bodies this is
probably<00:01:32.270> one<00:01:32.479> of<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:32.659> first<00:01:32.869> time<00:01:33.170> that

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
probably one of the first time that

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.260 
probably one of the first time that
we've<00:01:33.710> been<00:01:33.860> able<00:01:34.009> everywhere<00:01:34.880> any<00:01:35.030> one<00:01:35.179> has

of the insects on the sealy ours so when
we<00:01:40.849> go<00:01:41.000> collecting<00:01:41.569> when<00:01:41.959> we<00:01:42.049> give<00:01:42.200> flies<00:01:42.560> you

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
we go collecting when we give flies you

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.800 
we go collecting when we give flies you
either<00:01:42.920> hunt<00:01:43.189> the<00:01:43.310> fly<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:43.939> you're<00:01:44.509> seen<00:01:44.780> with

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
either hunt the fly so you're seen with

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.539 
either hunt the fly so you're seen with
some<00:01:45.229> of<00:01:45.289> the<00:01:45.349> larger<00:01:45.679> flies<00:01:45.890> people<00:01:46.220> just<00:01:46.429> go

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
some of the larger flies people just go

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.969 
some of the larger flies people just go
up<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:46.939> just<00:01:47.090> spend<00:01:47.659> ages<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:48.530> rest<00:01:48.709> of<00:01:48.860> us

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.949 
up and just spend ages the rest of us
run<00:01:49.610> free<00:01:49.819> with<00:01:49.849> wild<00:01:50.240> abandon<00:01:50.479> wouldn't

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:50.959 
run free with wild abandon wouldn't

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:55.920

events mellitus in the afternoon and
they're<00:02:17.690> all<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:17.810> bit<00:02:18.160> that's<00:02:19.160> why<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:20.780> can<00:02:20.990> cut

now we can use GPS logging and get

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.390 
now we can use GPS logging and get
accurate<00:04:30.300> data<00:04:30.560> we've<00:04:31.560> just<00:04:31.830> been<00:04:31.980> here<00:04:32.160> one

information to help understand shifts in
the<00:05:09.289> environments<00:05:09.830> look<00:05:10.460> at<00:05:10.610> time<00:05:10.939> series<00:05:11.569> and

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
the environments look at time series and

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.709 
the environments look at time series and
how<00:05:11.900> the<00:05:11.960> environment<00:05:12.530> around<00:05:12.650> is<00:05:12.949> changing

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:13.719 
how the environment around is changing

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:17.110 
how the environment around is changing
so<00:05:14.830> time<00:05:15.830> to<00:05:16.039> leave<00:05:16.250> this<00:05:16.490> absolutely
