and if you have a contract if you have

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.000 
and if you have a contract if you have
it<00:00:20.300> in<00:00:20.450> writing<00:00:21.010> you<00:00:22.010> you<00:00:22.940> can<00:00:23.380> vary<00:00:24.380> that<00:00:24.740> by

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
it in writing you you can vary that by

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.590

having an agreement with manager you can

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.000 
having an agreement with manager you can
say<00:00:26.750> okay<00:00:27.020> you<00:00:27.080> know<00:00:27.230> I<00:00:27.260> understand<00:00:27.770> you're<00:00:27.950> in

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
say okay you know I understand you're in

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.310 
say okay you know I understand you're in
a<00:00:28.100> tough<00:00:28.130> time<00:00:28.550> but<00:00:29.360> and<00:00:29.630> maybe<00:00:29.810> we<00:00:30.080> need<00:00:30.290> to

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
a tough time but and maybe we need to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.350 
a tough time but and maybe we need to
really<00:00:30.680> look<00:00:31.010> at<00:00:31.550> some<00:00:31.730> of<00:00:31.850> these<00:00:31.910> things<00:00:32.210> and

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
really look at some of these things and

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.540 
really look at some of these things and
maybe<00:00:32.540> come<00:00:32.810> to<00:00:32.840> agreement<00:00:33.620> on<00:00:33.680> it<00:00:33.830> but<00:00:34.340> you

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
maybe come to agreement on it but you

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.720 
maybe come to agreement on it but you
get<00:00:34.700> to<00:00:34.850> choose<00:00:35.180> which<00:00:35.930> areas<00:00:36.800> you<00:00:37.130> change

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
get to choose which areas you change

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.940 
get to choose which areas you change
well<00:00:38.480> I<00:00:38.510> think<00:00:38.630> the<00:00:38.870> economy<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:39.530> way<00:00:39.650> it<00:00:39.800> is

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
well I think the economy the way it is

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.319 
well I think the economy the way it is
it's<00:00:40.190> pretty<00:00:40.430> obvious<00:00:40.880> that<00:00:40.910> you<00:00:41.180> need

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
it's pretty obvious that you need

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.930 
it's pretty obvious that you need
protections<00:00:41.990> of<00:00:42.170> some<00:00:42.410> kind<00:00:42.710> and<00:00:43.010> I<00:00:43.670> think

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
protections of some kind and I think

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.360 
protections of some kind and I think
even<00:00:44.360> if<00:00:44.450> the<00:00:44.570> economy<00:00:44.840> was<00:00:45.290> fine<00:00:45.980> and<00:00:46.160> dandy

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
even if the economy was fine and dandy

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.360 
even if the economy was fine and dandy
in<00:00:47.210> today's<00:00:48.140> business<00:00:48.410> world<00:00:48.680> just<00:00:49.190> like

in today's business world just like

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.040 
in today's business world just like

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
protections you need to know that you

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.440 
protections you need to know that you

right now just where do you see yourself

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.560 
right now just where do you see yourself
in<00:01:00.680> that<00:01:00.829> equation<00:01:01.300> nothing's<00:01:02.300> guaranteed

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
in that equation nothing's guaranteed

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.129 
in that equation nothing's guaranteed
the<00:01:03.530> only<00:01:03.890> thing<00:01:04.070> guaranteed<00:01:04.280> is<00:01:04.729> when<00:01:04.909> it's

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:05.139 
the only thing guaranteed is when it's

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:07.330 
the only thing guaranteed is when it's
documented<00:01:06.139> when<00:01:06.350> it's<00:01:06.499> written<00:01:06.740> when<00:01:07.249> you

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
documented when it's written when you

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.819 
documented when it's written when you
have<00:01:07.520> an<00:01:07.639> agreement<00:01:07.969> that's<00:01:08.689> negotiated<00:01:09.649> and

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:09.829 
have an agreement that's negotiated and

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:11.499 
have an agreement that's negotiated and
you<00:01:10.009> don't<00:01:10.189> get<00:01:10.429> nothing<00:01:10.759> without

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
you don't get nothing without

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.639 
you don't get nothing without
negotiating<00:01:12.639> effective<00:01:14.289> contracts<00:01:15.289> come

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
negotiating effective contracts come

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.219 
negotiating effective contracts come
from<00:01:16.209> negotiating<00:01:17.209> effectively<00:01:17.990> I<00:01:18.170> think

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
from negotiating effectively I think

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.109 
from negotiating effectively I think
we're<00:01:18.530> gonna<00:01:18.619> build<00:01:18.829> a<00:01:19.069> really<00:01:19.369> great<00:01:19.639> company

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
we're gonna build a really great company

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.849 
we're gonna build a really great company
but<00:01:20.749> we<00:01:20.869> need<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.109> do<00:01:21.229> it<00:01:21.319> with<00:01:21.439> the<00:01:21.530> power<00:01:21.709> of<00:01:21.770> a

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:21.859 
but we need to do it with the power of a

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:23.440 
but we need to do it with the power of a
contract<00:01:22.340> we<00:01:22.490> need<00:01:22.639> to<00:01:22.700> have<00:01:22.850> some<00:01:23.119> things<00:01:23.329> in

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.170 
I believe labor is on that priority list
somewhere<00:02:33.920> but<00:02:34.670> I<00:02:34.700> don't<00:02:34.910> think<00:02:35.060> it's

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
somewhere but I don't think it's

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.390 
somewhere but I don't think it's
anywhere<00:02:35.450> near<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.660> top<00:02:35.840> with<00:02:36.709> a<00:02:36.740> legally

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400
