people try to do it this way and when
you<00:00:45.449> let<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.660> go<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:46.199> pops<00:00:46.500> back<00:00:46.649> out<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.309> it's

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
you let it go it pops back out and it's

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.970 
you let it go it pops back out and it's
really<00:00:47.820> hard<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.270> control<00:00:48.530> I'll<00:00:49.530> show<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
really hard to control I'll show you the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.910 
really hard to control I'll show you the
easy<00:00:50.190> way<00:00:50.309> make<00:00:50.910> your<00:00:51.120> loop<00:00:51.379> then<00:00:52.379> take<00:00:52.739> your

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
easy way make your loop then take your

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.380 
easy way make your loop then take your
middle<00:00:53.100> finger<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.440> hold<00:00:55.519> these<00:00:56.519> pieces<00:00:56.879> here

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
middle finger and hold these pieces here

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.290 
middle finger and hold these pieces here
do<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.079> same<00:00:58.320> thing<00:00:58.590> on<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> other<00:00:58.890> side<00:00:59.300> now

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
do the same thing on the other side now

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.650 
do the same thing on the other side now
your<00:01:00.809> loop<00:01:01.050> stays<00:01:01.410> open<00:01:02.120> so<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.269> you<00:01:03.449> can

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
your loop stays open so that you can

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.750 
your loop stays open so that you can
pass<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.110> back<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.650> tagging<00:01:05.100> back<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.519> forth

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
pass it back the tagging back and forth

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.830 
pass it back the tagging back and forth
from<00:01:05.940> one<00:01:06.150> hand<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.480> the<00:01:06.540> other

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
from one hand to the other

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.710 
from one hand to the other
so<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.590> pass<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.100> through<00:01:08.280> grab<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.150> switch<00:01:09.390> hand

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
so I pass it through grab it switch hand

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.380 
so I pass it through grab it switch hand
and<00:01:10.530> if<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.830> constantly<00:01:11.370> switch<00:01:11.700> hands<00:01:12.000> each

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
and if you constantly switch hands each

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.730 
and if you constantly switch hands each
pass<00:01:12.690> through

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:42.800

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
same thing I'm gonna make a loop and I'm

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.420 
same thing I'm gonna make a loop and I'm

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.330 
gonna hold that loop open with my middle
fingers<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.410> use<00:02:22.410> my<00:02:22.620> thumb<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.040> index

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
fingers and use my thumb and index

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.270 
fingers and use my thumb and index
finger<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.820> pass<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.239> back<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.630> forth<00:02:25.280> and

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
finger to pass it back and forth and

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.250 
finger to pass it back and forth and
that's<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:26.850> that's<00:02:27.300> what<00:02:27.480> makes<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.840> easy<00:02:28.050> if

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
that's the that's what makes it easy if

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.280 
that's the that's what makes it easy if
you<00:02:28.380> don't<00:02:28.560> hold<00:02:28.739> this<00:02:28.950> thing<00:02:29.190> open<00:02:29.370> with<00:02:29.760> your

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
you don't hold this thing open with your

you don't hold this thing open with your
middle<00:02:31.290> fingers<00:02:31.910> it's<00:02:32.910> hard

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
middle fingers it's hard

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.840 
middle fingers it's hard
you<00:02:33.690> lose<00:02:34.230> control<00:02:34.350> that<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.280> can<00:02:35.459> see<00:02:35.610> how<00:02:35.700> to

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
you lose control that you can see how to

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.880 
you lose control that you can see how to
unwrap<00:02:36.239> so<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:36.989> never<00:02:37.050> want<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.470> let<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.650> go

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
unwrap so I never want to let it go

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.559

seven to eight wraps pull that down nice
and<00:02:44.790> slow<00:02:45.330> should<00:02:45.660> make<00:02:45.840> some<00:02:46.019> nice<00:02:46.200> tight

main lines and these wraps will smash up
against<00:02:58.320> each<00:02:58.440> other<00:02:58.680> and<00:03:00.410> they'll<00:03:01.410> form<00:03:01.799> a

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
against each other and they'll form a

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.460

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.720 
make sure you have enough left over pass
it<00:03:58.599> back<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:58.810> forth<00:03:59.069> let's<00:04:00.069> start<00:04:00.310> passing

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
it back and forth let's start passing

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:09.530 
it back and forth let's start passing
that<00:04:00.849> through<00:04:01.150> two<00:04:01.920> three<00:04:03.689> four<00:04:05.159> five<00:04:07.739> six

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
that through two three four five six

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.000 
that through two three four five six
seven<00:04:10.540> yeah<00:04:10.780> it's<00:04:10.959> getting<00:04:11.200> kind<00:04:11.409> of<00:04:11.530> short<00:04:11.799> so

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
seven yeah it's getting kind of short so

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.490 
seven yeah it's getting kind of short so
I<00:04:12.099> didn't<00:04:12.430> have<00:04:13.060> this<00:04:13.420> much<00:04:13.689> I<00:04:13.930> ran<00:04:14.290> out<00:04:14.470> of

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
I didn't have this much I ran out of

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.240 
I didn't have this much I ran out of
line<00:04:15.209> pull<00:04:16.209> these<00:04:16.419> down<00:04:16.750> nice<00:04:17.139> and<00:04:17.169> slow<00:04:17.769> so

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
line pull these down nice and slow so

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.810 
line pull these down nice and slow so
that<00:04:18.430> they<00:04:18.579> wrap<00:04:18.789> evenly<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:20.579> then<00:04:21.579> I'm<00:04:21.699> going

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
that they wrap evenly and then I'm going
