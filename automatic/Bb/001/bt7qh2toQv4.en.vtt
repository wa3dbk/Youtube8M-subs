00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
so here are a bunch of crayons my

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.000 
so here are a bunch of crayons my
husband<00:00:25.670> had<00:00:25.940> bought<00:00:26.120> on<00:00:26.270> sale<00:00:26.300> for<00:00:27.050> phia<00:00:27.290> but

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.410 
husband had bought on sale for phia but
then<00:00:28.130> we<00:00:28.220> decided<00:00:28.550> not<00:00:28.940> to<00:00:29.120> use<00:00:29.150> them<00:00:29.360> because

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
then we decided not to use them because

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.420 
then we decided not to use them because
they<00:00:29.600> weren't<00:00:29.780> washable<00:00:30.350> so<00:00:31.130> they'll<00:00:31.340> be

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
they weren't washable so they'll be

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.750 
they weren't washable so they'll be

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
blowtorch this should work with a better
