00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
simple rig to go down through the middle

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.260 
simple rig to go down through the middle
just<00:02:09.000> make<00:02:09.239> three<00:02:10.229> bones<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:11.160> now<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.879> click

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
just make three bones for now so click

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.369 
just make three bones for now so click
on<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.510> top

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
on the top

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:20.089 
on the top
and<00:02:14.269> maybe<00:02:15.269> right<00:02:15.480> on<00:02:15.659> there<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:19.099> doesn't

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
and maybe right on there and doesn't

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.149 
and maybe right on there and doesn't
have<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.400> be<00:02:20.519> perfect<00:02:20.969> or<00:02:21.120> anything<00:02:21.180> just

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
have to be perfect or anything just

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.280 
have to be perfect or anything just
approximate<00:02:23.159> and<00:02:23.609> now<00:02:23.999> you<00:02:24.060> can<00:02:24.299> see<00:02:24.569> it's

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
approximate and now you can see it's

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.080 
approximate and now you can see it's
right<00:02:25.799> in<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.069> center<00:02:26.099> both<00:02:26.609> on<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.909> front

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
right in the center both on the front

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.259 
right in the center both on the front
and<00:02:27.269> right<00:02:27.569> view<00:02:27.950> so<00:02:28.950> it's<00:02:29.310> perfectly<00:02:29.939> aligned

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
and right view so it's perfectly aligned

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.770 
and right view so it's perfectly aligned
with<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.540> character<00:02:31.129> but<00:02:32.129> if<00:02:32.519> you<00:02:32.939> notice<00:02:33.120> or

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
object we won't be doing much with this

and it also has this Auto way thing so

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.990 
and it also has this Auto way thing so
now<00:03:26.400> if<00:03:26.639> I<00:03:26.790> were<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.000> rotate<00:03:27.419> you<00:03:28.139> can<00:03:28.169> see

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
now if I were to rotate you can see

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.830 
now if I were to rotate you can see
moves<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:31.099> capsule<00:03:32.099> but<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.909> does<00:03:33.269> look<00:03:33.569> kind

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
moves the capsule but it does look kind

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.229 
moves the capsule but it does look kind
of<00:03:33.989> odd<00:03:34.259> I<00:03:34.620> mean<00:03:35.009> if<00:03:35.159> I<00:03:35.280> were<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.489> rotate<00:03:35.699> here

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
of odd I mean if I were to rotate here

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.879 
of odd I mean if I were to rotate here
it's<00:03:38.120> going<00:03:39.120> very<00:03:39.419> it's<00:03:39.840> very<00:03:39.959> concave<00:03:40.650> right

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
it's going very it's very concave right

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.969 
it's going very it's very concave right
here<00:03:41.099> which<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.639> thought<00:03:42.090> might<00:03:42.389> not<00:03:42.750> want<00:03:43.049> so

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:43.979

strength so make it 100 0 keep it around
20<00:04:20.519> you<00:04:21.329> can<00:04:21.570> have<00:04:21.840> it<00:04:21.989> add<00:04:22.199> erase<00:04:22.830> all<00:04:23.130> of

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
20 you can have it add erase all of

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.189 
20 you can have it add erase all of
these<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.580> usually<00:04:23.880> only<00:04:24.029> use<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.449> degrace<00:04:24.900> so

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
these I usually only use a degrace so

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.540 
these I usually only use a degrace so
add

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
add

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.700 
add
for<00:04:26.639> example<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.150> then<00:04:27.270> just<00:04:27.720> selecting<00:04:28.470> here

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
for example and then just selecting here

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.450 
for example and then just selecting here
will<00:04:28.970> make<00:04:29.970> it<00:04:30.090> all<00:04:30.180> nice<00:04:30.419> and<00:04:30.629> white<00:04:30.750> or<00:04:31.680> race

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
will make it all nice and white or race

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.230 
will make it all nice and white or race
and<00:04:32.819> we'll<00:04:33.180> take<00:04:33.389> away<00:04:33.569> that<00:04:33.870> strength<00:04:34.590> and

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
and we'll take away that strength and

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.189 
and we'll take away that strength and
make<00:04:36.240> it<00:04:36.389> very<00:04:36.650> blackish<00:04:37.879> so<00:04:38.879> for<00:04:39.720> example<00:04:40.110> if

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
make it very blackish so for example if

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.719 
make it very blackish so for example if
you<00:04:40.319> want<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.560> see<00:04:40.680> how<00:04:40.800> this<00:04:40.919> works<00:04:41.159> just<00:04:41.580> go

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
you want to see how this works just go

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.600 
you want to see how this works just go
back<00:04:41.909> into<00:04:42.090> your<00:04:42.210> rotate<00:04:42.690> tool<00:04:42.900> and<00:04:43.610> rotate

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
back into your rotate tool and rotate

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.550 
back into your rotate tool and rotate
this<00:04:45.560> and<00:04:46.560> you<00:04:46.650> see<00:04:46.860> in<00:04:46.979> this<00:04:47.190> side<00:04:48.409> nothing<00:04:49.409> is

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
this and you see in this side nothing is

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.779 
this and you see in this side nothing is
really<00:04:50.129> being<00:04:50.430> moved<00:04:50.699> while<00:04:51.330> on<00:04:51.750> this<00:04:52.020> side<00:04:52.319> a

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
really being moved while on this side a

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.999 
really being moved while on this side a
bunch<00:04:53.789> is<00:04:53.940> being<00:04:54.150> moved<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:55.020> it<00:04:55.409> looks<00:04:55.620> even

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009 
bunch is being moved and it looks even

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.119 
bunch is being moved and it looks even
more<00:04:56.190> ugly<00:04:56.460> than<00:04:56.639> before<00:04:57.500> so<00:04:58.500> let's<00:04:58.949> go<00:04:59.099> back

00:04:59.119 --> 00:04:59.129 
more ugly than before so let's go back

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:03.369 
more ugly than before so let's go back
into<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.550> weight<00:05:00.449> tool<00:05:00.690> and<00:05:00.990> let's<00:05:01.469> undo<00:05:01.770> that

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:03.379 
into the weight tool and let's undo that

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:06.670 
into the weight tool and let's undo that
so<00:05:04.379> say<00:05:04.919> I<00:05:04.949> wanted<00:05:05.340> maybe<00:05:05.789> a<00:05:05.909> little<00:05:06.090> less

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
so say I wanted maybe a little less

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:13.129 
so say I wanted maybe a little less
round<00:05:07.680> here<00:05:08.190> let<00:05:08.789> me<00:05:08.819> see<00:05:09.180> yeah<00:05:10.190> oops<00:05:12.020> come<00:05:13.020> on

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
round here let me see yeah oops come on

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:14.869 
round here let me see yeah oops come on
on<00:05:13.289> this<00:05:13.379> area<00:05:13.860> so<00:05:14.099> I<00:05:14.129> would<00:05:14.370> pick<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.669> erase

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:14.879 
on this area so I would pick the erase

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:18.320 
on this area so I would pick the erase
and<00:05:15.090> maybe<00:05:15.210> change<00:05:15.990> that<00:05:16.229> to<00:05:16.409> 10%<00:05:16.919> and<00:05:17.400> zoom<00:05:18.210> in

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
and maybe change that to 10% and zoom in

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.290 
and maybe change that to 10% and zoom in
a<00:05:18.419> little<00:05:18.539> bit<00:05:18.719> and<00:05:19.460> I'll<00:05:20.460> switch<00:05:20.819> my<00:05:20.849> view

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
a little bit and I'll switch my view

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.200 
a little bit and I'll switch my view
maybe<00:05:22.550> and<00:05:24.319> the<00:05:25.319> display<00:05:25.770> so<00:05:26.009> you<00:05:26.039> can<00:05:26.159> see<00:05:26.580> the

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
maybe and the display so you can see the

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.269 
maybe and the display so you can see the
shading<00:05:27.690> and<00:05:29.719> maybe<00:05:30.719> select<00:05:31.229> this<00:05:31.409> kind<00:05:32.219> of

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:32.279 
shading and maybe select this kind of

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:35.930 
shading and maybe select this kind of
area<00:05:32.789> right<00:05:33.000> around<00:05:33.090> here<00:05:33.509> I<00:05:34.430> don't<00:05:35.430> know<00:05:35.759> how

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
area right around here I don't know how

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.700 
area right around here I don't know how
good<00:05:36.330> this<00:05:36.479> will<00:05:36.690> look<00:05:36.840> probably<00:05:37.110> not<00:05:37.409> very

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
good this will look probably not very

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.540 
good this will look probably not very
good<00:05:37.949> at<00:05:38.069> all<00:05:38.330> but<00:05:39.330> it's<00:05:39.630> just<00:05:39.719> an<00:05:40.020> example

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
good at all but it's just an example

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.260 
good at all but it's just an example
yeah<00:05:41.550> that<00:05:41.699> doesn't<00:05:42.000> look<00:05:42.060> good<00:05:42.360> at<00:05:42.479> all<00:05:44.270> so

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
yeah that doesn't look good at all so

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.909 
yeah that doesn't look good at all so
now<00:05:45.389> that<00:05:45.449> we've<00:05:45.719> done<00:05:45.900> that<00:05:46.110> you<00:05:46.409> see<00:05:46.680> this

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
now that we've done that you see this

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.360 
now that we've done that you see this
whole<00:05:47.130> area<00:05:47.699> is<00:05:47.909> darkened<00:05:48.659> at<00:05:48.960> the<00:05:49.590> bone<00:05:50.099> will

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
whole area is darkened at the bone will

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.550 
whole area is darkened at the bone will
have<00:05:50.520> no<00:05:50.699> effect<00:05:50.849> on<00:05:51.300> it<00:05:51.479> so<00:05:51.690> let's<00:05:52.110> go<00:05:52.349> into

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
have no effect on it so let's go into

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.980 
have no effect on it so let's go into
rotate<00:05:52.889> tool<00:05:53.069> which<00:05:53.819> is<00:05:54.000> a<00:05:54.150> for<00:05:54.630> keyboard

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
rotate tool which is a for keyboard

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.790 
rotate tool which is a for keyboard
Walker<00:05:55.289> and<00:05:55.699> move<00:05:56.699> it<00:05:56.879> and<00:05:57.210> as<00:05:58.020> you<00:05:58.259> can<00:05:58.349> see<00:05:58.409> it

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
Walker and move it and as you can see it

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.059 
Walker and move it and as you can see it
collapses<00:05:59.460> right<00:05:59.729> in<00:06:00.180> on<00:06:00.330> itself<00:06:00.889> so<00:06:01.889> if<00:06:01.949> you

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:02.069 
collapses right in on itself so if you

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:04.640 
collapses right in on itself so if you
were<00:06:02.190> to<00:06:02.250> render<00:06:02.610> that<00:06:03.229> it<00:06:04.229> wouldn't<00:06:04.560> look

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
were to render that it wouldn't look

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.140 
were to render that it wouldn't look
pretty<00:06:04.919> at<00:06:05.039> all<00:06:05.779> kind<00:06:06.779> of<00:06:06.870> looks<00:06:07.020> like<00:06:07.110> a<00:06:07.199> face

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
pretty at all kind of looks like a face

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.200 
pretty at all kind of looks like a face
but<00:06:09.150> that's<00:06:09.330> beside<00:06:09.629> the<00:06:09.659> point

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
but that's beside the point

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.080 
but that's beside the point
so<00:06:12.210> that's<00:06:12.389> pretty<00:06:12.779> much<00:06:12.870> the<00:06:13.199> basics<00:06:13.740> of

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
so that's pretty much the basics of

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.140 
so that's pretty much the basics of
creating<00:06:15.090> joints<00:06:15.659> and<00:06:16.430> moving<00:06:17.430> objects<00:06:17.940> with

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
creating joints and moving objects with

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.249 
creating joints and moving objects with
them<00:06:18.590> you<00:06:19.590> can<00:06:19.830> use<00:06:20.610> them<00:06:20.879> on<00:06:20.909> characters<00:06:21.900> like

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 
them you can use them on characters like

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:26.749 
them you can use them on characters like
I<00:06:22.469> have<00:06:23.360> in<00:06:24.360> this<00:06:24.810> one<00:06:24.990> this<00:06:25.680> is<00:06:25.740> far<00:06:26.729> from

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 
I have in this one this is far from

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:28.790 
I have in this one this is far from
being<00:06:27.090> completed<00:06:27.479> it's<00:06:27.750> a<00:06:27.900> game<00:06:28.590> character

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
being completed it's a game character

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.279 
being completed it's a game character
I'm<00:06:29.069> trying<00:06:29.340> to<00:06:29.460> create<00:06:29.729> and<00:06:29.969> as<00:06:30.930> you<00:06:31.050> can<00:06:31.139> see

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:31.289 
I'm trying to create and as you can see

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:36.260 
I'm trying to create and as you can see
is<00:06:31.469> the<00:06:31.680> body<00:06:31.949> with<00:06:32.370> all<00:06:32.580> the<00:06:33.389> components<00:06:35.270> on

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
is the body with all the components on

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.300 
is the body with all the components on
it

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
it

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.200 
it
and<00:06:37.400> then<00:06:37.820> here's<00:06:38.180> the<00:06:39.160> route<00:06:40.160> with<00:06:40.430> every

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
and then here's the route with every

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:46.420 
and then here's the route with every
single<00:06:41.570> bone<00:06:42.910> yeah<00:06:43.910> it's<00:06:44.240> a<00:06:44.540> lot<00:06:44.690> of<00:06:44.840> bones<00:06:45.430> but

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.430 
single bone yeah it's a lot of bones but

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.900 
single bone yeah it's a lot of bones but
I<00:06:46.670> can<00:06:47.570> control<00:06:48.470> pretty<00:06:48.770> much<00:06:48.950> how<00:06:49.580> each<00:06:49.880> of

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910 
I can control pretty much how each of

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.090 
I can control pretty much how each of
these<00:06:50.210> will<00:06:50.750> work<00:06:50.780> so<00:06:51.320> to<00:06:51.770> give<00:06:51.920> you<00:06:51.950> an

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 
these will work so to give you an

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.460 
these will work so to give you an
example<00:06:52.840> I<00:06:53.840> can<00:06:54.620> rotate<00:06:54.830> this<00:06:55.220> upper<00:06:55.820> arm

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
example I can rotate this upper arm

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.530 
example I can rotate this upper arm
however<00:06:57.470> I<00:06:57.740> want<00:06:57.980> it<00:06:58.100> and<00:06:58.250> as<00:06:58.850> you<00:06:59.060> can<00:06:59.180> see<00:06:59.240> it

00:06:59.530 --> 00:06:59.540 
however I want it and as you can see it

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.990 
however I want it and as you can see it
kind<00:07:00.350> of<00:07:00.470> collapses<00:07:01.010> in<00:07:01.190> on<00:07:01.280> itself<00:07:01.340> here<00:07:01.940> in

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 
kind of collapses in on itself here in

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.400 
kind of collapses in on itself here in
the<00:07:02.090> back<00:07:02.300> and<00:07:03.140> if<00:07:03.830> I<00:07:03.920> were<00:07:04.040> to<00:07:04.100> move<00:07:04.310> it<00:07:04.460> down

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.410 
the back and if I were to move it down

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.560 
the back and if I were to move it down
we'll<00:07:06.410> do<00:07:06.530> the<00:07:06.680> same<00:07:06.860> thing<00:07:06.920> kind<00:07:07.700> of<00:07:07.820> collapse

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:08.570 
we'll do the same thing kind of collapse

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.300 
we'll do the same thing kind of collapse
right<00:07:08.900> in<00:07:09.050> there<00:07:09.550> so<00:07:10.550> then<00:07:11.240> do<00:07:11.390> that<00:07:11.800> but<00:07:12.800> you

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.310 
right in there so then do that but you

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.130 
right in there so then do that but you
get<00:07:13.490> the<00:07:13.610> idea<00:07:13.880> and<00:07:13.910> it<00:07:14.090> does<00:07:14.330> take<00:07:14.630> some<00:07:14.900> time

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.140 
get the idea and it does take some time

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.520 
get the idea and it does take some time
to<00:07:15.460> align<00:07:16.460> all<00:07:16.700> the<00:07:16.850> joints<00:07:17.140> to<00:07:18.140> where<00:07:18.410> the

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.530 
to align all the joints to where the

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.860 
to align all the joints to where the
mesh<00:07:18.710> should<00:07:18.950> be<00:07:19.100> and<00:07:19.340> then<00:07:19.690> especially<00:07:20.690> do

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:20.870 
mesh should be and then especially do

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.900 
mesh should be and then especially do
the<00:07:21.020> weighting<00:07:21.380> so<00:07:21.680> let<00:07:22.310> me<00:07:22.400> find<00:07:22.640> a<00:07:22.700> way<00:07:22.730> to

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:22.910 
the weighting so let me find a way to

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:29.050 
the weighting so let me find a way to
all<00:07:23.240> oops<00:07:24.490> and<00:07:26.140> so<00:07:27.140> you<00:07:27.260> can<00:07:27.380> see<00:07:27.590> we've<00:07:28.550> waited

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:29.060 
all oops and so you can see we've waited

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.180 
all oops and so you can see we've waited
this<00:07:30.610> specific<00:07:31.610> area<00:07:31.850> just<00:07:32.390> for<00:07:32.830> the<00:07:33.830> right

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:34.190 
this specific area just for the right

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.680 
this specific area just for the right
upper<00:07:34.640> arm<00:07:34.850> and<00:07:35.120> then<00:07:35.840> like<00:07:36.230> right<00:07:36.260> lower<00:07:36.800> arm

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:37.690 
upper arm and then like right lower arm

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:44.250 
upper arm and then like right lower arm
and<00:07:38.690> then<00:07:38.990> of<00:07:39.170> course<00:07:39.440> all<00:07:39.650> the<00:07:39.680> fingers<00:07:40.630> well

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:44.260 

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.400 

have<00:07:45.260> been<00:07:45.440> separately<00:07:46.570> weighted<00:07:47.570> which<00:07:48.080> does

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:48.410 
have been separately weighted which does

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.980 
have been separately weighted which does
take<00:07:48.770> a<00:07:48.800> lot<00:07:49.040> of<00:07:49.100> time<00:07:49.430> but<00:07:50.300> if<00:07:50.450> you<00:07:50.570> pull<00:07:50.900> it

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:50.990 
take a lot of time but if you pull it

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.380 
take a lot of time but if you pull it
off<00:07:51.080> correctly<00:07:51.460> it<00:07:52.460> does<00:07:52.670> save<00:07:52.910> you<00:07:52.940> a<00:07:53.090> lot<00:07:53.330> of

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:53.390 
off correctly it does save you a lot of

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.620 
off correctly it does save you a lot of
time<00:07:53.780> when<00:07:54.020> animating<00:07:55.270> instead<00:07:56.270> of<00:07:56.390> just

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:56.630 
time when animating instead of just

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:01.930 
time when animating instead of just
grabbing<00:07:59.410> instead<00:08:00.410> of<00:08:00.500> just<00:08:00.680> grabbing<00:08:00.980> one

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:01.940 
grabbing instead of just grabbing one

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.150 
grabbing instead of just grabbing one
point<00:08:02.360> here<00:08:02.720> and<00:08:02.900> then<00:08:03.020> moving<00:08:03.320> it<00:08:03.590> around<00:08:03.800> and

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 
point here and then moving it around and

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.090 
point here and then moving it around and
we<00:08:04.670> pretty<00:08:05.390> much<00:08:05.570> we<00:08:05.750> sculpting<00:08:06.380> the<00:08:06.500> mesh<00:08:06.680> for

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:07.100 
we pretty much we sculpting the mesh for

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.050 
we pretty much we sculpting the mesh for
every<00:08:07.400> frame<00:08:07.790> of<00:08:07.970> the<00:08:08.090> animation<00:08:09.610> so<00:08:10.610> that's

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:11.060 
every frame of the animation so that's

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.600 
every frame of the animation so that's
about<00:08:11.480> it<00:08:11.690> for<00:08:12.050> this<00:08:12.170> tutorial<00:08:12.830> hope<00:08:13.460> you

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:13.610 
about it for this tutorial hope you

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.090 
about it for this tutorial hope you
enjoyed<00:08:13.910> it
