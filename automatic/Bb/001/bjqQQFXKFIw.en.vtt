00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.520 

sorry<00:06:34.240> I<00:06:34.330> thought<00:06:34.540> my<00:06:34.720> phone<00:06:34.930> cut<00:06:35.169> out<00:06:35.200> there

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
sorry I thought my phone cut out there

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.020 
sorry I thought my phone cut out there
for<00:06:35.680> a<00:06:35.740> second<00:06:36.040> and<00:06:36.190> then<00:06:36.550> I<00:06:36.640> have<00:06:36.730> the<00:06:36.820> box

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
for a second and then I have the box

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.310 
for a second and then I have the box
that's<00:06:37.270> down<00:06:37.480> here<00:06:37.510> and<00:06:37.960> what<00:06:38.050> I<00:06:38.080> started

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
that's down here and what I started

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.650 
that's down here and what I started
doing<00:06:38.940> with<00:06:39.940> the<00:06:40.090> steel

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
doing with the steel

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.870 
doing with the steel
as<00:06:40.870> I<00:06:41.020> took<00:06:41.290> them<00:06:41.470> out<00:06:41.650> and<00:06:41.830> put<00:06:42.280> them<00:06:42.430> in<00:06:42.700> this

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
as I took them out and put them in this

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.610 
as I took them out and put them in this
case<00:06:43.300> right<00:06:43.540> here<00:06:43.600> it<00:06:43.930> holds<00:06:44.140> a<00:06:44.200> hundred<00:06:44.500> and

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
case right here it holds a hundred and

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.320 
case right here it holds a hundred and
something<00:06:44.950> like<00:06:45.330> 128<00:06:46.330> discs<00:06:47.070> so<00:06:48.270> instead<00:06:49.270> of

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
something like 128 discs so instead of

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.000 
something like 128 discs so instead of
having<00:06:49.540> to<00:06:49.720> open<00:06:50.080> up<00:06:50.200> the<00:06:50.320> packages<00:06:50.980> and

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.010 
having to open up the packages and

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.820 
having to open up the packages and
possibly<00:06:51.850> like<00:06:52.150> damage<00:06:52.750> the<00:06:52.990> steel<00:06:53.260> books<00:06:53.620> I

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830 
possibly like damage the steel books I

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.880 
possibly like damage the steel books I
keep<00:06:54.340> the<00:06:54.490> disks<00:06:54.940> in<00:06:55.120> there<00:06:55.600> which<00:06:56.530> is<00:06:56.560> much

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:56.890 
keep the disks in there which is much

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.520 
keep the disks in there which is much
easier<00:06:57.310> and<00:06:57.760> I<00:06:58.120> will<00:06:58.720> eventually<00:06:59.200> be<00:06:59.320> able<00:06:59.410> to

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
easier and I will eventually be able to

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.620 
easier and I will eventually be able to
display<00:06:59.950> these<00:07:00.280> and<00:07:00.670> not<00:07:01.180> have<00:07:01.330> to<00:07:01.450> worry

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630 
display these and not have to worry

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.750 
display these and not have to worry
about<00:07:01.720> having<00:07:02.020> to<00:07:02.140> get<00:07:02.380> them<00:07:02.530> down<00:07:02.770> and<00:07:03.100> you
