then you also have a USB cable right in

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.319 
then you also have a USB cable right in
the<00:03:56.560> other<00:03:56.739> poach<00:03:59.430> and<00:04:00.430> that's<00:04:00.910> this<00:04:01.120> guy

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
the other poach and that's this guy

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:02.640 
the other poach and that's this guy
right<00:04:01.510> here<00:04:01.569> so<00:04:01.930> that<00:04:02.079> will<00:04:02.319> be<00:04:02.470> for

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
right here so that will be for

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.659 
right here so that will be for
connecting<00:04:03.069> it<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.340> computer<00:04:03.519> obviously

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
connecting it to the computer obviously

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:09.390 
connecting it to the computer obviously
then<00:04:06.669> you're<00:04:07.389> also<00:04:07.510> going<00:04:07.870> to<00:04:07.959> get<00:04:08.230> an<00:04:08.500> hdmi

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
then you're also going to get an hdmi

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.809 
then you're also going to get an hdmi

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.819 

we've<00:04:17.130> got<00:04:17.280> an<00:04:17.400> hdmi<00:04:17.820> cable<00:04:17.850> here<00:04:18.829> pretty

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
we've got an hdmi cable here pretty

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.070 
we've got an hdmi cable here pretty
typical<00:04:21.049> and<00:04:22.049> we've<00:04:22.410> also<00:04:22.590> had<00:04:23.870> this<00:04:24.870> little

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
typical and we've also had this little

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.950 
typical and we've also had this little
power<00:04:25.350> is<00:04:25.530> after<00:04:25.890> that<00:04:26.730> compact<00:04:27.360> car<00:04:27.570> adapter

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
power is after that compact car adapter

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.710 
power is after that compact car adapter
not<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.680> most<00:04:28.860> compact<00:04:29.340> honestly<00:04:29.880> but<00:04:30.060> it's

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
not the most compact honestly but it's

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.040 
not the most compact honestly but it's
not<00:04:30.900> too<00:04:31.050> bad<00:04:31.430> comparison<00:04:32.430> to<00:04:32.460> my<00:04:32.580> hand

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
not too bad comparison to my hand

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.450 
not too bad comparison to my hand
comparison<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:34.080> 0<00:04:34.880> mighty<00:04:35.880> mouse<00:04:36.090> so<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:37.620> then

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
comparison to 0 mighty mouse so and then

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.190 
comparison to 0 mighty mouse so and then
you've<00:04:38.580> got<00:04:38.610> your<00:04:38.760> proprietary<00:04:39.210> jack<00:04:39.930> down

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
you've got your proprietary jack down

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.880 
you've got your proprietary jack down
here<00:04:40.440> which<00:04:40.590> not<00:04:41.250> my<00:04:41.370> favorite<00:04:41.730> but<00:04:42.890> I'll

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
here which not my favorite but I'll

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.370 
here which not my favorite but I'll
we'll<00:04:44.190> deal<00:04:44.370> with<00:04:44.430> it<00:04:44.670> then<00:04:44.910> you've<00:04:45.570> got<00:04:45.810> this

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
we'll deal with it then you've got this

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.470 
we'll deal with it then you've got this
is<00:04:46.560> a<00:04:46.590> gift<00:04:46.770> a<00:04:46.890> stylus<00:04:47.340> pen<00:04:47.580> it's<00:04:48.210> kind<00:04:48.390> of

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
is a gift a stylus pen it's kind of

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.520 
is a gift a stylus pen it's kind of
weird<00:04:48.630> i'm<00:04:48.750> not<00:04:48.900> even<00:04:48.960> going<00:04:49.110> to<00:04:49.170> open<00:04:49.410> it

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
weird i'm not even going to open it

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.190 
weird i'm not even going to open it
because<00:04:50.250> i<00:04:50.640> use<00:04:50.970> it<00:04:51.180> in<00:04:51.300> the<00:04:51.360> store<00:04:51.600> and<00:04:51.840> you

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
because i use it in the store and you

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.140 
because i use it in the store and you
can<00:04:52.380> use<00:04:52.560> your<00:04:52.740> you<00:04:53.430> can<00:04:53.610> use<00:04:53.700> your<00:04:53.820> finger

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
can use your you can use your finger

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.030 
can use your you can use your finger
it's<00:04:54.330> not<00:04:54.510> that<00:04:54.750> too<00:04:54.960> bad<00:04:55.140> i<00:04:55.380> think<00:04:55.920> it's

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
it's not that too bad i think it's

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.350 
it's not that too bad i think it's
resistive<00:04:56.550> but<00:04:56.700> it's<00:04:56.820> not<00:04:56.970> too<00:04:57.180> bad<00:04:57.300> for

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
resistive but it's not too bad for

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.750 
resistive but it's not too bad for
resistive<00:04:58.080> it's<00:04:58.260> not<00:04:58.410> like<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:59.130> d/s<00:04:59.460> scream

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
resistive it's not like the d/s scream

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.640 
resistive it's not like the d/s scream
it's<00:04:59.940> that<00:05:00.120> hard<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.420> push<00:05:00.630> so<00:05:01.350> then<00:05:01.500> here's

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
it's that hard to push so then here's

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.210 
it's that hard to push so then here's
your<00:05:01.860> intelligent<00:05:02.900> lithium-ion<00:05:03.900> battery<00:05:04.410> so

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
your intelligent lithium-ion battery so

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.340 
your intelligent lithium-ion battery so
this<00:05:05.340> batteries<00:05:05.640> are<00:05:05.730> actually<00:05:06.000> pretty<00:05:06.150> smart

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
this batteries are actually pretty smart
