00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.120 
and then when the reclassification and
playoffs<00:01:43.969> and<00:01:44.329> districts<00:01:44.779> came<00:01:45.079> about<00:01:45.409> they

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130

luster<00:01:50.419> and<00:01:50.659> it's

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
luster and it's

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.930 
luster and it's
still<00:01:52.300> a<00:01:52.330> sin<00:01:53.260> one<00:01:53.380> of<00:01:53.500> those<00:01:54.250> great<00:01:54.490> rivalries
