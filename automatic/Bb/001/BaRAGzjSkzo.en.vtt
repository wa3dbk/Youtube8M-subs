volcanologist Don Swanson was sent to
Mount<00:00:06.750> Saint<00:00:06.960> Helens<00:00:07.020> in<00:00:07.440> March<00:00:07.680> 1980<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.849> join

Mount Saint Helens in March 1980 to join

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.839 
Mount Saint Helens in March 1980 to join
a<00:00:09.120> team<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.630> USGS<00:00:10.160> geologists<00:00:11.160> monitoring<00:00:11.759> the

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
a team of USGS geologists monitoring the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.209 
a team of USGS geologists monitoring the
volcano<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.630> was<00:00:12.780> pretty<00:00:12.990> startling<00:00:13.440> actually

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
volcano it was pretty startling actually

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.680 
volcano it was pretty startling actually
and<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.549> course<00:00:14.759> initially<00:00:15.000> we<00:00:15.360> thought<00:00:15.389> the

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
and of course initially we thought the

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.260 
and of course initially we thought the
measurements<00:00:16.170> were<00:00:16.260> incorrect<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:18.029> we

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
measurements were incorrect and so we

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.029 
measurements were incorrect and so we
repeated<00:00:18.869> them<00:00:19.020> over<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.439> over<00:00:19.500> again<00:00:19.740> and

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
repeated them over and over again and

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.590 
repeated them over and over again and
kept<00:00:20.189> getting<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.520> same<00:00:20.550> result<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.330> then<00:00:21.449> we

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
kept getting the same result so then we

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.060 
kept getting the same result so then we
knew<00:00:21.750> we<00:00:21.900> had<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.140> accept<00:00:22.470> them<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
knew we had to accept them and that the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.470 
knew we had to accept them and that the
mountain<00:00:23.369> was<00:00:23.400> doing<00:00:23.789> something<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.300> we

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
mountain was doing something that we

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.900 
mountain was doing something that we
really<00:00:24.689> hadn't<00:00:25.350> anticipated<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:26.340> activity

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
really hadn't anticipated the activity

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
getting red pitchers I knew we should

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.590 
getting red pitchers I knew we should
have<00:01:13.680> been<00:01:13.799> up<00:01:13.920> there<00:01:13.950> I'm<00:01:14.250> angry<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.150> then<00:01:15.299> in
