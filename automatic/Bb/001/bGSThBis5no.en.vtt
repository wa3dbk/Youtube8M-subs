already<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.289> guess<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.559> probably<00:00:55.770> should<00:00:56.010> have

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
already I guess you probably should have

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.799 
already I guess you probably should have
save<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.460> cuz<00:00:56.850> he<00:00:57.000> probably<00:00:57.360> could<00:00:57.780> have

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
save it cuz he probably could have

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.349

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
friend resets himself so I guess he can

heck and hex so what he would do would
just<00:03:46.040> simply<00:03:46.370> run<00:03:46.760> around<00:03:46.970> in<00:03:47.060> circles<00:03:47.090> using

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
just simply run around in circles using

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.810 
just simply run around in circles using
all<00:03:47.810> three<00:03:48.049> and<00:03:49.040> i<00:03:49.160> would<00:03:49.280> have<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.459> time<00:03:49.640> my

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
all three and i would have to time my

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.940 
all three and i would have to time my
cooldowns<00:03:50.329> so<00:03:50.930> I'm<00:03:51.049> able<00:03:51.170> to<00:03:51.350> hit<00:03:51.530> them<00:03:51.739> and

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
cooldowns so I'm able to hit them and

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
where you can actually uh change your

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.010 
where you can actually uh change your
targeting<00:03:56.850> so<00:03:56.970> you<00:03:57.030> don't<00:03:57.240> target<00:03:57.480> non-player

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
targeting so you don't target non-player

there's<00:04:15.300> a<00:04:15.360> way<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.510> change<00:04:15.750> it<00:04:15.960> so<00:04:16.320> now<00:04:16.470> here's

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
there's a way to change it so now here's

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.530 
there's a way to change it so now here's
how<00:04:16.829> fat<00:04:17.250> this<00:04:17.400> is<00:04:17.549> how<00:04:17.670> long<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:18.000> took<00:04:18.180> so<00:04:18.420> this

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
how fat this is how long it took so this

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.210 
how fat this is how long it took so this
is<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.780> max<00:04:19.079> speed<00:04:19.290> i<00:04:19.590> can<00:04:19.859> speed<00:04:20.040> up<00:04:20.070> the

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
is the max speed i can speed up the

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.730 
is the max speed i can speed up the
video<00:04:20.340> this<00:04:20.970> is<00:04:21.150> only<00:04:21.329> part<00:04:21.780> of<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.530> battle

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
fast-forwarding so as you can see the

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.110 
fast-forwarding so as you can see the
same<00:04:29.280> thing<00:04:29.430> happened<00:04:29.460> over<00:04:29.850> and<00:04:29.910> over<00:04:29.970> again

off the Bucky kick and we end up killing
a<00:04:52.110> shaman<00:04:52.440> we're<00:04:52.680> just<00:04:52.830> like<00:04:52.980> yeah<00:04:53.570> like<00:04:54.570> after

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
a shaman we're just like yeah like after

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.430 
a shaman we're just like yeah like after
17<00:04:55.440> minutes<00:04:55.770> of<00:04:55.919> brutal<00:04:56.720> low-rank<00:04:57.720> you<00:04:58.290> know

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
17 minutes of brutal low-rank you know

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.350 
17 minutes of brutal low-rank you know
doesn't<00:04:58.980> really<00:04:59.040> matter<00:04:59.190> arenas<00:04:59.880> we<00:05:00.060> probably

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
doesn't really matter arenas we probably

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.110 
doesn't really matter arenas we probably
killed<00:05:01.320> a<00:05:01.440> shaman<00:05:01.919> so<00:05:02.190> basically<00:05:02.700> from<00:05:02.940> there

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
killed a shaman so basically from there

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.580 
killed a shaman so basically from there
on<00:05:03.330> if<00:05:03.480> we<00:05:03.600> ever<00:05:03.720> get<00:05:03.870> like<00:05:03.990> a<00:05:04.050> healer<00:05:04.290> comp

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
on if we ever get like a healer comp

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.500 
on if we ever get like a healer comp
like<00:05:04.770> that<00:05:05.010> the<00:05:05.550> monk<00:05:05.820> does<00:05:06.090> a<00:05:06.180> really<00:05:06.300> good

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
like that the monk does a really good

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.990 
like that the monk does a really good
job<00:05:06.570> of<00:05:07.410> surviving<00:05:08.010> so<00:05:08.130> we<00:05:08.250> pretty<00:05:08.430> much<00:05:08.550> will

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
job of surviving so we pretty much will

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.480 
job of surviving so we pretty much will
just<00:05:09.210> have<00:05:09.390> them<00:05:09.540> focusing<00:05:10.530> on<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:10.950> healer

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
just have them focusing on the healer

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.610 
just have them focusing on the healer
which<00:05:11.729> helped<00:05:12.090> out<00:05:12.210> a<00:05:12.240> lot<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:12.930> so<00:05:13.260> that's<00:05:13.470> all

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
which helped out a lot and so that's all

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.900 
which helped out a lot and so that's all
we<00:05:13.650> needed<00:05:13.950> it<00:05:14.130> if<00:05:14.250> I<00:05:14.340> realized<00:05:14.729> that<00:05:14.820> earlier

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
we needed it if I realized that earlier

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.430 
we needed it if I realized that earlier
we<00:05:15.360> probably<00:05:15.540> could<00:05:15.720> have<00:05:15.750> worn<00:05:15.960> a<00:05:16.050> long<00:05:16.169> time

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
we probably could have worn a long time

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.010 
we probably could have worn a long time
