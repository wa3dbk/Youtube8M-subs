00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.040 
but they're impervious to excess charge
shot<00:02:24.880> so<00:02:25.150> they'll<00:02:25.300> actually<00:02:25.480> getting<00:02:25.870> away

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
shot so they'll actually getting away

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.360 
shot so they'll actually getting away
you<00:02:26.080> trying<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.709> hit<00:02:26.860> them

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
you trying to hit them

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.940 
you trying to hit them
I<00:02:28.659> get<00:02:29.659> lucky<00:02:29.959> with<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.170> place<00:02:30.379> here<00:02:30.799> though
