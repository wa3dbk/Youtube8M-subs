couple of trays of pentium fours there's

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.559 
couple of trays of pentium fours there's
a<00:04:41.289> few<00:04:41.530> empty<00:04:41.680> trays<00:04:42.129> here<00:04:42.490> from<00:04:42.819> other<00:04:43.180> chips

a few empty trays here from other chips

a few empty trays here from other chips
which<00:04:43.840> I<00:04:44.139> think<00:04:44.650> these<00:04:44.770> were<00:04:45.039> a<00:04:45.310> few<00:04:45.520> Pentium

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
which I think these were a few Pentium

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.909 
which I think these were a few Pentium
fours<00:04:46.479> which<00:04:46.900> I<00:04:47.110> threw<00:04:47.440> in<00:04:47.590> there<00:04:47.770> because

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
fours which I threw in there because

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.040 
fours which I threw in there because
they<00:04:48.159> even<00:04:48.849> though<00:04:48.970> they<00:04:49.150> were<00:04:49.210> probably

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
they even though they were probably

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.749 
they even though they were probably
working<00:04:50.680> they<00:04:50.860> were<00:04:50.889> only<00:04:51.099> about<00:04:51.310> one<00:04:51.580> point

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
working they were only about one point

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.339 
working they were only about one point
three<00:04:51.879> gigahertz<00:04:52.330> there's<00:04:52.870> not<00:04:53.020> really<00:04:53.169> much

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
three gigahertz there's not really much

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:55.860 
three gigahertz there's not really much
point<00:04:53.680> in<00:04:53.830> keeping<00:04:53.889> them<00:04:54.430> just<00:04:55.419> shift<00:04:55.659> these

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
point in keeping them just shift these

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.520 
point in keeping them just shift these
over<00:04:56.289> here<00:04:57.419> again<00:04:58.419> I<00:04:58.539> think<00:04:58.599> all<00:04:59.020> these<00:04:59.289> are

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
over here again I think all these are

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.129 
over here again I think all these are
just<00:04:59.680> old<00:04:59.860> pea<00:05:00.400> fries<00:05:00.759> and<00:05:01.120> seller<00:05:01.509> ons<00:05:01.750> that

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
just old pea fries and seller ons that

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.559 
just old pea fries and seller ons that
sort<00:05:02.440> of<00:05:02.469> thing<00:05:02.909> let's<00:05:03.909> just<00:05:04.090> pick<00:05:04.270> one<00:05:04.419> out<00:05:04.449> of

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:04.569 
sort of thing let's just pick one out of

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:09.300 
sort of thing let's just pick one out of
random<00:05:05.080> here<00:05:06.449> Celeron<00:05:07.889> 1000<00:05:08.889> so<00:05:08.979> it's<00:05:09.099> a<00:05:09.159> one

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
random here Celeron 1000 so it's a one

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.360 
random here Celeron 1000 so it's a one
gig<00:05:09.550> seller<00:05:09.879> on<00:05:10.090> which<00:05:10.360> has<00:05:10.960> no<00:05:11.560> really<00:05:11.949> useful

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
gig seller on which has no really useful

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.999 
gig seller on which has no really useful
value<00:05:12.900> these<00:05:13.900> are<00:05:13.960> a<00:05:14.139> bit<00:05:14.259> suspect<00:05:14.469> to<00:05:14.889> me

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
value these are a bit suspect to me

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.680 
value these are a bit suspect to me
really<00:05:15.250> because<00:05:15.729> some<00:05:16.000> of<00:05:16.030> them<00:05:16.180> have<00:05:16.419> things

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
really because some of them have things

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.570 
really because some of them have things
like<00:05:16.960> this<00:05:17.139> written<00:05:17.409> on<00:05:17.560> them<00:05:17.740> which

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
like this written on them which

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.930 
like this written on them which
indicates<00:05:19.060> they<00:05:19.270> may<00:05:19.479> well<00:05:19.719> all<00:05:19.990> be<00:05:20.050> faulty<00:05:20.940> so

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
indicates they may well all be faulty so

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.430 
indicates they may well all be faulty so
what<00:05:22.180> I'm<00:05:22.270> probably<00:05:22.389> going<00:05:22.659> to<00:05:22.719> do<00:05:22.870> is<00:05:23.020> all<00:05:23.259> of

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
what I'm probably going to do is all of

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.159 
what I'm probably going to do is all of
these<00:05:23.650> all<00:05:24.310> be<00:05:24.699> five<00:05:25.120> of<00:05:25.360> five<00:05:25.509> or<00:05:25.960> tight

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
these all be five of five or tight

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.490 
these all be five of five or tight
boards<00:05:26.620> I'm<00:05:26.770> going<00:05:26.949> to<00:05:27.009> scrap<00:05:27.250> these<00:05:27.550> now

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
boards I'm going to scrap these now

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.839 
boards I'm going to scrap these now
these<00:05:29.500> I<00:05:29.560> didn't<00:05:30.069> actually<00:05:30.190> get<00:05:30.460> from<00:05:30.729> the

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
these I didn't actually get from the

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:33.240 
these I didn't actually get from the
booth<00:05:31.000> there<00:05:31.330> I<00:05:31.509> bought<00:05:31.719> these<00:05:31.930> on<00:05:32.259> eBay<00:05:32.800> from

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
booth there I bought these on eBay from

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.689 
booth there I bought these on eBay from
a<00:05:33.550> seller<00:05:34.090> who<00:05:34.180> was<00:05:34.449> selling<00:05:34.750> a<00:05:34.810> server<00:05:35.080> and<00:05:35.699> it

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
a seller who was selling a server and it

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:38.700 
a seller who was selling a server and it
was<00:05:36.880> up<00:05:37.000> in<00:05:37.180> Northamptonshire<00:05:37.900> or<00:05:38.259> somewhere

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
was up in Northamptonshire or somewhere

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.589 
was up in Northamptonshire or somewhere
so<00:05:39.069> I<00:05:39.099> I<00:05:39.460> couldn't<00:05:39.759> be<00:05:39.909> bothered<00:05:40.060> to<00:05:40.210> go<00:05:40.330> up<00:05:40.389> and

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
so I I couldn't be bothered to go up and

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.140 
so I I couldn't be bothered to go up and
get<00:05:40.750> it<00:05:40.960> so<00:05:41.560> I<00:05:41.590> simply<00:05:41.860> asked<00:05:42.310> him<00:05:42.460> to<00:05:42.729> remove

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
get it so I simply asked him to remove

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.019 
get it so I simply asked him to remove
the<00:05:43.300> processes<00:05:43.960> and<00:05:44.139> post<00:05:44.919> them<00:05:45.069> to<00:05:45.099> me<00:05:45.430> so<00:05:45.789> he

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:46.029 
the processes and post them to me so he

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:49.140 
the processes and post them to me so he
was<00:05:46.210> kind<00:05:46.449> enough<00:05:46.569> to<00:05:46.810> do<00:05:46.930> that<00:05:47.190> I<00:05:48.190> paid<00:05:48.849> I

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
was kind enough to do that I paid I

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.719 
was kind enough to do that I paid I
think<00:05:49.479> I<00:05:49.569> paid<00:05:49.750> about<00:05:49.810> 20<00:05:50.289> quid<00:05:50.529> for<00:05:50.860> server

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729 
think I paid about 20 quid for server

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.200 
think I paid about 20 quid for server
and<00:05:52.120> the<00:05:52.710> Enver<00:05:53.710> delivery<00:05:54.069> on<00:05:54.340> these<00:05:54.849> chips

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
and the Enver delivery on these chips

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.969 
and the Enver delivery on these chips
which<00:05:55.509> was<00:05:55.690> an<00:05:55.779> absolute<00:05:56.139> bargain<00:05:56.409> because

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
which was an absolute bargain because

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.089 
which was an absolute bargain because
considering<00:05:57.930> these<00:05:58.930> are<00:05:59.139> probably<00:05:59.409> worth

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
considering these are probably worth

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:02.219 
considering these are probably worth
about<00:06:00.279> 30<00:06:00.699> pounds<00:06:01.180> each<00:06:01.330> just<00:06:01.719> in<00:06:01.840> their<00:06:01.990> gold

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
about 30 pounds each just in their gold

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.189 
about 30 pounds each just in their gold
value<00:06:02.879> I've<00:06:03.879> decided<00:06:04.270> to<00:06:04.389> hang<00:06:04.599> onto<00:06:04.750> these<00:06:04.990> as

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 
value I've decided to hang onto these as

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.129 
value I've decided to hang onto these as
an<00:06:05.289> investment<00:06:05.740> because<00:06:06.629> over<00:06:07.629> the<00:06:07.719> next<00:06:07.900> few

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.139 
an investment because over the next few

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:09.719 
an investment because over the next few
years<00:06:08.199> as<00:06:08.620> more<00:06:08.830> and<00:06:09.009> more<00:06:09.069> of<00:06:09.310> these<00:06:09.460> get

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
years as more and more of these get

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.740 
years as more and more of these get
scrapped<00:06:10.120> as<00:06:10.930> the<00:06:11.139> price<00:06:11.349> of<00:06:11.529> gold<00:06:11.650> goes<00:06:11.830> up

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
scrapped as the price of gold goes up

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.180 
scrapped as the price of gold goes up
CPU<00:06:13.750> collectors<00:06:14.289> will<00:06:14.560> be<00:06:14.710> willing<00:06:14.919> to<00:06:14.949> pay

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
CPU collectors will be willing to pay

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.459 
CPU collectors will be willing to pay
more<00:06:15.219> and<00:06:15.610> more<00:06:15.759> for<00:06:16.060> them<00:06:16.240> so<00:06:17.199> I've<00:06:17.289> decided

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:17.469 
more and more for them so I've decided

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:20.879 
more and more for them so I've decided
to<00:06:18.039> hang<00:06:18.400> on<00:06:18.520> to<00:06:18.669> fitness<00:06:18.849> for<00:06:19.180> now<00:06:19.650> the<00:06:20.650> same

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889 
to hang on to fitness for now the same

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:23.279 
to hang on to fitness for now the same
with<00:06:21.129> the<00:06:21.400> Intel<00:06:21.969> confidential<00:06:22.750> chips<00:06:23.020> I<00:06:23.169> may

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289 
with the Intel confidential chips I may

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:25.439 
with the Intel confidential chips I may
well<00:06:23.469> hang<00:06:23.650> on<00:06:23.800> to<00:06:23.919> them<00:06:24.099> but<00:06:24.759> all<00:06:25.120> of<00:06:25.270> those

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
well hang on to them but all of those

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:27.230 
well hang on to them but all of those
chips<00:06:26.409> in<00:06:26.590> that<00:06:26.620> box

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
chips in that box

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.529 
chips in that box
and<00:06:27.710> most<00:06:28.710> likely<00:06:29.160> most<00:06:29.370> of<00:06:29.610> these<00:06:29.759> chips<00:06:30.090> here

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
and most likely most of these chips here

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:33.050 
and most likely most of these chips here
I'm<00:06:31.080> a<00:06:31.259> well<00:06:31.470> scrap<00:06:31.830> these<00:06:32.009> because<00:06:32.550> I<00:06:32.789> don't

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
I'm a well scrap these because I don't

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.330 
I'm a well scrap these because I don't
know<00:06:33.180> the<00:06:33.300> history<00:06:33.569> behind<00:06:33.780> them<00:06:34.169> and<00:06:34.340> there's

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
know the history behind them and there's

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.620 
know the history behind them and there's
not<00:06:35.460> much<00:06:35.610> point<00:06:35.819> in<00:06:35.940> keeping<00:06:36.030> a<00:06:36.330> load<00:06:36.509> of

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
not much point in keeping a load of

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.050 
not much point in keeping a load of
processes<00:06:37.229> if<00:06:37.610> half<00:06:38.610> of<00:06:38.819> them<00:06:38.940> are<00:06:39.000> not

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
processes if half of them are not

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.480 
processes if half of them are not
working<00:06:39.440> especially<00:06:40.440> when<00:06:40.919> they're<00:06:41.069> only<00:06:41.190> one

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
working especially when they're only one

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.689 
working especially when they're only one
gig<00:06:41.669> Celeron<00:06:42.150> chips<00:06:42.590> but<00:06:43.590> well<00:06:44.280> thanks<00:06:44.580> for

over the past few weeks there's a few
there's<00:06:57.569> an<00:06:57.690> interesting<00:06:57.960> oscilloscope<00:06:58.740> down

00:06:58.999 --> 00:06:59.009 
there's an interesting oscilloscope down

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:01.460 
there's an interesting oscilloscope down
there<00:06:59.280> there's<00:06:59.820> a<00:06:59.970> bench<00:07:00.240> multimeter<00:07:00.930> which

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470 
there there's a bench multimeter which

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.730 
there there's a bench multimeter which
is<00:07:02.070> is<00:07:02.940> valve<00:07:03.360> controlled<00:07:03.900> and<00:07:04.139> some<00:07:04.440> Nixie

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
is is valve controlled and some Nixie

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.409 
is is valve controlled and some Nixie
tubes<00:07:05.070> in<00:07:05.250> it<00:07:05.370> which<00:07:05.970> should<00:07:06.180> be<00:07:06.270> quite

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:06.419 
tubes in it which should be quite

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:09.890 
tubes in it which should be quite
interesting<00:07:06.990> to<00:07:07.020> tear<00:07:07.349> down<00:07:07.380> and<00:07:08.690> yeah<00:07:09.690> I'll

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 
interesting to tear down and yeah I'll

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.570 
interesting to tear down and yeah I'll
have<00:07:10.349> to<00:07:10.380> see<00:07:10.800> what<00:07:10.949> I<00:07:10.979> can<00:07:11.099> do<00:07:11.250> with<00:07:11.430> all<00:07:11.520> that
