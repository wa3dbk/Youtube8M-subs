um just a great little rifle you know I

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.690 
um just a great little rifle you know I
think<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.159> paid<00:01:17.310> $160<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.619> brand<00:01:19.619> new<00:01:19.830> you

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
think I paid $160 for this brand new you

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.340 
think I paid $160 for this brand new you
know<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.060> had<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> scope<00:01:21.570> lying<00:01:21.780> around<00:01:21.900> so

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
know and I had the scope lying around so

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.609 
know and I had the scope lying around so
it<00:01:22.530> doesn't<00:01:22.770> really<00:01:22.830> qualify<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> cost

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
it doesn't really qualify on the cost

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.929 
it doesn't really qualify on the cost
but<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:25.770> not<00:01:25.920> expensive<00:01:26.220> either<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.790> just

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
but it's not expensive either it's just

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.480 
but it's not expensive either it's just
a<00:01:27.060> cheap<00:01:27.540> Nikon

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.140 
I got it in some sort of trade or swap
or<00:01:31.920> something<00:01:32.220> but<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.850> know<00:01:32.880> it's

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
or something but it you know it's

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.200

the<00:01:36.750> single<00:01:37.110> action<00:01:37.259> breech<00:01:38.100> load<00:01:38.340> way<00:01:39.210> better

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the single action breech load way better

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.319 
the single action breech load way better
than<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:40.049> bolt<00:01:40.439> action<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.890> me<00:01:41.009> for<00:01:41.340> hunting<00:01:41.700> you

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
than a bolt action to me for hunting you

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.660 
than a bolt action to me for hunting you
know<00:01:42.450> bolt<00:01:43.020> actions<00:01:43.380> are<00:01:43.530> great<00:01:43.740> they're<00:01:44.130> much

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
know bolt actions are great they're much

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.889 
know bolt actions are great they're much
faster<00:01:45.090> than<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.270> breech<00:01:45.479> slow<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:45.810> you're

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
faster than the breech slow but you're

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.120 
faster than the breech slow but you're
going<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.079> get<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> same<00:01:46.439> kind<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.710> accuracy

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
going to get the same kind of accuracy

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.330 
going to get the same kind of accuracy
out<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.700> would<00:01:47.820> have<00:01:47.880> bolt<00:01:49.310> for<00:01:50.310> a

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
out of this you would have bolt for a

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.850 
out of this you would have bolt for a
