00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
so obviously something's up with Madera

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.310 
power even is cut in half perfectly and
that's<00:03:22.940> something<00:03:23.510> pretty<00:03:23.750> interesting

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
that's something pretty interesting

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.660

about<00:03:24.500> that<00:03:24.560> character<00:03:24.860> I<00:03:25.010> think<00:03:25.130> move<00:03:25.489> is<00:03:25.610> a

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
about that character I think move is a

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.100 
about that character I think move is a
character<00:03:26.030> who's<00:03:26.180> gonna<00:03:26.360> get<00:03:26.570> swept<00:03:26.959> under

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
this guy Naruto immediately thinks that

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.289 
this guy Naruto immediately thinks that
he's<00:03:43.010> actually<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.400> guy<00:03:43.489> with<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.820> mask<00:03:44.030> but

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
he's actually the guy with the mask but

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.970 
he's actually the guy with the mask but
this<00:03:44.359> is<00:03:44.570> not<00:03:44.750> true<00:03:44.930> seeing<00:03:45.260> as<00:03:45.380> how<00:03:45.500> he<00:03:45.560> is<00:03:45.829> in

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
this is not true seeing as how he is in

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.490 
this is not true seeing as how he is in
reanimation<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:46.970> that's<00:03:47.900> where<00:03:48.079> the<00:03:48.140> episode

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
reanimation and that's where the episode

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.699 
reanimation and that's where the episode
comes<00:03:48.769> to<00:03:48.890> a<00:03:48.980> very<00:03:49.250> ominous<00:03:49.459> close<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:50.709> make

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
comes to a very ominous close and make

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.259 
comes to a very ominous close and make
sure<00:03:51.890> and<00:03:52.010> watch<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.340> preview<00:03:52.700> for<00:03:52.820> next<00:03:52.880> week
