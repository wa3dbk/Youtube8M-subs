00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
so as you can see it's got a bracket

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.660 
so as you can see it's got a bracket
right<00:01:06.900> here<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.830> little<00:01:07.950> L<00:01:08.189> bracket

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
right here it's just a little L bracket

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.149 
right here it's just a little L bracket
this<00:01:08.790> comes<00:01:09.060> with<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> kit<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.920> there

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
this comes with a kit and I just there

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.789 
this comes with a kit and I just there
was<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.450> bolt<00:01:12.450> right<00:01:12.720> here<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.049> 12<00:01:13.409> millimeter

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
was a bolt right here a 12 millimeter

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.190 
was a bolt right here a 12 millimeter
bolt<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:14.970> just<00:01:15.479> actually<00:01:15.720> put<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
bolt and so I just actually put the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.080 
bolt and so I just actually put the
bracket<00:01:16.650> right<00:01:16.680> there<00:01:17.189> mounted<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.700> there<00:01:17.939> and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
bracket right there mounted it there and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.260 
bracket right there mounted it there and
then<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.409> way<00:01:19.590> I've<00:01:19.770> got<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.280> oil<00:01:20.610> catch-can

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
then the way I've got the oil catch-can

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.810 
then the way I've got the oil catch-can
around<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.110> by<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> band<00:01:22.799> clamp<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.400> just

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
around it is by a band clamp that just

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.310 
around it is by a band clamp that just
goes<00:01:23.970> around<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.390> curved<00:01:24.720> part<00:01:24.930> right<00:01:25.080> here

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
goes around this curved part right here

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.950 
goes around this curved part right here
so<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.920> order<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.189> take<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.580> out<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.090> just

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
so in order to take this out you just

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.319 
so in order to take this out you just
undo<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:28.979> band<00:01:29.220> clamp<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.030> whole<00:01:30.150> thing

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
undo this band clamp and the whole thing

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.620 
undo this band clamp and the whole thing
slides<00:01:30.630> out<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.020> as<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.829> see<00:01:32.630> it's

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
slides out and as you can see it's

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.649 
slides out and as you can see it's
pretty<00:01:33.900> full<00:01:34.290> it's<00:01:34.590> almost<00:01:35.360> 3/4<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.509> way

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
pretty full it's almost 3/4 of the way

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.510 
pretty full it's almost 3/4 of the way
up<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.350> we're<00:01:37.500> going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.650> go<00:01:37.799> ahead<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.100> drain

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
up so we're going to go ahead and drain

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.060 
up so we're going to go ahead and drain
this<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:39.930> what<00:01:40.079> you're<00:01:40.200> going<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.350> do<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.710> drain

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
this so what you're going to do to drain

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.380 
this so what you're going to do to drain
is<00:01:41.280> you're<00:01:41.909> going<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:43.700> unbolt<00:01:44.700> both<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.270> these

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
is you're going to unbolt both of these

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.660 
is you're going to unbolt both of these
hoses<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:46.290> can<00:01:46.380> undo<00:01:46.590> these<00:01:46.740> clamps<00:01:47.100> pulleys

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
hoses you can undo these clamps pulleys

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.999 
hoses you can undo these clamps pulleys
hoses<00:01:48.000> off<00:01:48.119> remember<00:01:48.659> where<00:01:48.840> they<00:01:48.990> go<00:01:49.020> because

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
hoses off remember where they go because

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.520 
hoses off remember where they go because
it's<00:01:50.340> imperative<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.149> they<00:01:51.899> go<00:01:52.049> back<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
it's imperative that they go back on the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.310 
it's imperative that they go back on the
right<00:01:52.710> way<00:01:52.890> one<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.310> them<00:01:53.399> comes<00:01:53.670> from<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.320> PCV

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
right way one of them comes from the PCV

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.840 
right way one of them comes from the PCV
valve<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.829> then<00:01:55.920> one<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.159> them<00:01:56.250> goes<00:01:56.430> back<00:01:56.670> to

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
valve and then one of them goes back to

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.679 
valve and then one of them goes back to
the<00:01:56.969> intake<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.790> this<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.570> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
the intake so this is the this is the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.510 
the intake so this is the this is the
one<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.930> comes<00:02:01.079> from<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.380> PCV<00:02:01.829> valve<00:02:02.070> this

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
one that comes from the PCV valve this

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.859 
one that comes from the PCV valve this
is<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.700> one<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:02.909> goes<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.240> intake<00:02:03.509> on<00:02:03.719> my

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
is the one that goes to the intake on my

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.649 
is the one that goes to the intake on my
setup<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.500> make<00:02:04.950> sure<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.880> label<00:02:06.329> those
