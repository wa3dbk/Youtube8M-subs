00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.730
 ah 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.480
 to prepare this sorbet we need 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.320
 mixer 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.400
 and half a kilo of figs 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.320
 sugar 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.390
 glass to beat 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.940
 squeezer 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.360
 half a lemon 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.510
 cooking cream 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.770
 Water 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.780
 bed 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.329
 tape 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.870
 and a knife 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.000
 we already have everything so I started 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.570
 The first thing we are going to do is peel 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.570
 the figs 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:08.990
 we squeeze the lemon to extract the juice 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.990
 we spent the centuries in the glass 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.869
 we add a glass of water 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:22.200
 lemon juice 2 tablespoons sugar 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.320
 and beat a little we add a glass of 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.430
 digging 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.310
 and we beat everything well 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.760
 we throw in the tupper only half and 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.950
 it would be already the first way 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.720
 for our second type of sorbet what 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.120
 The only thing we have to do is add 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.230
 cream and it changes the flavor a lot and it's 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.230
 completely different 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.500
 and we beat it well and put it in another 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.500
 as well 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.510
 we leave it in the freezer during a 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.640
 hour and after that time what 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.870
 stir with a spoon and we return 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.870
 to put another hour 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.269
 and we have it ready to serve 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.290
 to decorate you can put a fig and 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.290
 colored straw or whatever you want 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.720
 to this recipe that is delicious and is 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.720
 very light
