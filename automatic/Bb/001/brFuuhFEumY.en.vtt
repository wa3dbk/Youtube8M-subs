 and elements of metal structures 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.090
 for example, let's see installation 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.950
 ceiling avoiding the street on two levels in 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.719

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.539
 direct suspensions 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:15.379
 the first ceiling profile is mounted on

 distance start millimeters from the wall 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.300
 all subsequent is put on 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.000
 distance not less than 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.379
 three millimeter countries 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.809
 here then the waiting constructions are all 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:33.459
 follow 900 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:34.799

 didorenko 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.819
 and if we need to lower the ceiling on 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.349
 some distance for laying 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.039
 ventilation for example 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:52.569
 then will be used

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.900
 the element is strictly horizontal 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.120
 fixed straight profile for this 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.349
 at all levels he 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.879
 profile is fixed by self tapping 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.819
 wood screws 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:20.840
 on both sides of the basement screws with each 

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.710
 strange 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.139
 at a distance of a thousand millimeters 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.330
 mounted second straight profile 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.689
 in the same way for each 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:34.860
 direct suspensions accounted for 4 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.909
 screw 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.909
 padva show was on each side 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.849
 when the design of the main profile 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:43.840
 ready 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.090
 we begin installation 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.090
 of the best profiles 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.439
 transverse profile attached to 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:10.060
 guides 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.980
 using a two-tier 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.670
 connecting 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.150
 it is easy to snap but not in a hurry 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.210
 fixes his st 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.449
 on direct profile 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.259
 The first carrier profile is mounted on 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.800
 distance gstaad millimeters from the wall 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:59.229
 after checking the distance 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.620
 two level among 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.950
 mitin is fixed on the main profile 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:07.590
 two screws one at a time 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.590
 bow on each side 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.219
 the second chamber is fixed on 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:24.089
 distance sleep stark millimeters 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:28.310
 respectable or four became millimeters 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.010
 from the first did not happen profile 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.780
 third thousand millimeters from the wall 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.430
 and finally 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.110
 all subsequent at a distance of 400 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.759
 millimeters he 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:56.339
 last ceiling removing st 

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:58.240
 movable design 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.229
 to avoid hard mating 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:03.480
 plasterboard structures 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.909
 with other materials 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:08.709
 in places of possible mates 

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:10.639
 applied 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.289
 separation tape 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:16.589
 extra sliver of tape 

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:19.460
 that's why they just cut off 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.460
 son when cross profiles are marked 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:26.710
 they can be fixed on their main 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.140
 profiles recall from injured with that 

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:32.509
 sides of the leaf crown which 

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:36.600
 in contact with the wall and cut off and 

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:39.830
 taken off fao scad sheets must have them 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.830
 Kosice who is sensible 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.979
