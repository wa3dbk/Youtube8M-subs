00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.650 

pivoting<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.490> track<00:00:05.819> is<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.029> move<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:06.299> shares

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
pivoting the track is a move that shares

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.299 
pivoting the track is a move that shares
a<00:00:06.720> number<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:07.109> technical<00:00:07.440> similarities<00:00:08.130> with

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
a number of technical similarities with

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.040 
a number of technical similarities with
pivoting<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:08.849> editing<00:00:09.210> which<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.570> why<00:00:09.750> it<00:00:09.809> has

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
pivoting and editing which is why it has

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.129 
pivoting and editing which is why it has
the<00:00:10.230> same<00:00:10.410> name<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:11.870> pivoting<00:00:12.870> we<00:00:12.990> would

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
the same name in pivoting we would

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.810 
the same name in pivoting we would
create<00:00:13.320> overlapping<00:00:13.799> groups<00:00:14.219> by<00:00:14.429> placing

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
create overlapping groups by placing

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.189 
create overlapping groups by placing
cameras<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.330> each<00:00:15.480> have<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.719> particular

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
cameras that each have a particular

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.660 
cameras that each have a particular
character<00:00:16.619> visible<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.190> both<00:00:17.340> shots

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
character visible in both shots

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.930 
character visible in both shots
preferably<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.480> same<00:00:18.750> part<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.080> frame

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:20.940 
preferably in the same part of the frame

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.790 
preferably in the same part of the frame
which<00:00:21.720> would<00:00:21.900> smooth<00:00:22.140> out<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.440> cut<00:00:22.619> and

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
which would smooth out the cut and

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.050 
which would smooth out the cut and
create<00:00:22.950> spatial<00:00:23.340> continuity

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
create spatial continuity

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.010 
create spatial continuity
pivoting<00:00:27.060> on<00:00:27.119> track<00:00:27.390> can<00:00:27.570> do<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.750> same<00:00:27.960> by

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
pivoting on track can do the same by

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.929 
pivoting on track can do the same by
replacing<00:00:28.529> those<00:00:28.890> two<00:00:29.130> locked<00:00:29.369> cameras<00:00:29.789> with

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
replacing those two locked cameras with

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.100 
replacing those two locked cameras with
one<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.270> track

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
one on a track

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.170 
one on a track
and<00:00:32.200> actually<00:00:33.010> tracking<00:00:33.460> between<00:00:33.910> the<00:00:34.030> two

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
and actually tracking between the two

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.830 
and actually tracking between the two
positions

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.720 

the<00:00:37.560> effect<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.190> keep<00:00:38.400> the<00:00:38.460> man

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
the effect is that we keep the man

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.190 
the effect is that we keep the man
locked<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> same<00:00:39.510> part<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.900> frame

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
locked in the same part of the frame

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.720 
locked in the same part of the frame
during<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.560> move<00:00:40.740> while<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.130> background<00:00:41.340> is

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
during the move while the background is

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.150 
during the move while the background is
being<00:00:41.910> replaced

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
being replaced

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.340 
being replaced
but<00:00:44.850> while<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> end<00:00:45.300> result<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:45.960> case<00:00:46.170> is

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
but while the end result in this case is

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.020 
but while the end result in this case is
the<00:00:46.470> same<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.829> with<00:00:46.950> pivot<00:00:47.250> editing<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.880> is

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
the same as with pivot editing this is

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.280 
the same as with pivot editing this is
where<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.330> similarities<00:00:48.930> end

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
where the similarities end

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.720 
where the similarities end
because<00:00:49.560> pivoting<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.070> track<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.460> such<00:00:50.610> an

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
because pivoting with track is such an

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.430 
because pivoting with track is such an
essential<00:00:51.030> move<00:00:51.330> that<00:00:51.540> it<00:00:51.660> deserves<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.170> stand

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
essential move that it deserves to stand

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.740 
essential move that it deserves to stand
on<00:00:52.590> its<00:00:52.739> own

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
on its own

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.990 
on its own
the<00:00:55.500> key<00:00:55.680> distinction<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.310> pivoting<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.850> that

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
the key distinction in pivoting is that

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.550 
the key distinction in pivoting is that
we're<00:00:57.150> locking<00:00:57.450> on<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.720> something<00:00:58.080> as<00:00:58.200> we<00:00:58.350> move

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
we're locking on to something as we move

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.640 
we're locking on to something as we move
and<00:00:58.770> keep<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.010> fixed<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> frame<00:01:00.440> this<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
and keep it fixed in the frame this is

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.080 
and keep it fixed in the frame this is
an<00:01:01.770> effective<00:01:02.160> way<00:01:02.220> to<00:01:02.400> reveal<00:01:02.730> something

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
an effective way to reveal something

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.840 
an effective way to reveal something
which<00:01:03.360> we'll<00:01:03.540> look<00:01:03.660> at<00:01:03.810> in<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.050> next<00:01:04.320> chapter

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
which we'll look at in the next chapter

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.160 
which we'll look at in the next chapter
but<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.120> chapter<00:01:06.450> we'll<00:01:06.690> look<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:06.960> using

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
but in this chapter we'll look at using

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.750 
but in this chapter we'll look at using
it<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.500> follow<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.800> second<00:01:08.250> character<00:01:08.580> while

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
it to follow a second character while

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.320 
it to follow a second character while
pivoting<00:01:09.180> around<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.510> first

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.720 

as<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:13.170> woman<00:01:13.440> walks<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:14.010> pivot<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.550> man

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
as the woman walks we pivot on the man

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.750 
as the woman walks we pivot on the man
to<00:01:14.880> keep<00:01:15.090> her<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.420> frame

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.700 

we're<00:01:18.480> essentially<00:01:18.840> countering<00:01:19.380> around<00:01:19.620> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
we're essentially countering around the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.470 
we're essentially countering around the
man<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.310> result<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.120> keep<00:01:21.270> both

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
man and the result is that we keep both

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.060 
man and the result is that we keep both
characters<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.050> the<00:01:22.140> frame<00:01:22.350> almost<00:01:22.710> no<00:01:22.860> matter

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
characters in the frame almost no matter

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.890 
characters in the frame almost no matter
where<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.490> woman<00:01:23.760> moves<00:01:24.000> as<00:01:24.240> long<00:01:24.510> as<00:01:24.660> the<00:01:24.750> man

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
where the woman moves as long as the man

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.550 
where the woman moves as long as the man
is<00:01:25.080> stationary

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
is stationary

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.830 
is stationary
so<00:01:28.369> a<00:01:28.400> pivot<00:01:28.790> is<00:01:28.909> really<00:01:29.150> able<00:01:29.299> to<00:01:29.450> cover<00:01:29.690> an

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
so a pivot is really able to cover an

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.750 
so a pivot is really able to cover an
entire<00:01:30.140> scene<00:01:30.500> between<00:01:30.860> two<00:01:31.040> characters<00:01:31.250> and

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
entire scene between two characters and

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.010 
entire scene between two characters and
it<00:01:31.880> can<00:01:32.000> be<00:01:32.090> useful<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.510> base<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:32.900> whole

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
it can be useful to base the whole

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.600 
it can be useful to base the whole
coverage<00:01:33.409> on<00:01:33.590> one<00:01:33.770> pivoting<00:01:34.190> cameras<00:01:34.580> a

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
coverage on one pivoting cameras a

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.609 
coverage on one pivoting cameras a
backbone<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:35.270> then<00:01:35.630> add<00:01:35.780> lock<00:01:35.960> traverses<00:01:36.500> to

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
backbone and then add lock traverses to

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.219 
backbone and then add lock traverses to
fill<00:01:36.770> in<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:37.070> each<00:01:37.190> stop<00:01:37.840> so<00:01:38.840> let's<00:01:39.020> create

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
fill in and each stop so let's create

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.050 
fill in and each stop so let's create
three<00:01:39.560> stops<00:01:39.860> for<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.190> woman<00:01:40.490> starting<00:01:40.970> at

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
three stops for the woman starting at

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.889 
three stops for the woman starting at
the<00:01:41.150> door<00:01:41.799> then<00:01:42.799> in<00:01:42.950> front<00:01:43.070> of<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.280> man<00:01:43.899> then

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
the door then in front of the man then

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.460 
the door then in front of the man then
over<00:01:45.170> here<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:45.880> add<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:47.119> lock<00:01:47.330> traverses

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
over here and add to lock traverses

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
is the same as we just did

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.319 
is the same as we just did
as<00:02:34.709> she<00:02:35.189> walks<00:02:35.400> in<00:02:35.579> and<00:02:35.700> out<00:02:35.819> of<00:02:35.939> the<00:02:36.030> depth<00:02:36.209> of

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.510 

but<00:02:41.220> we<00:02:41.310> do<00:02:41.460> again<00:02:41.760> as<00:02:41.910> she<00:02:41.940> moves<00:02:42.240> over<00:02:42.480> here

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.700 

so<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.360> woman<00:02:47.510> can<00:02:47.780> in<00:02:47.900> fact<00:02:48.080> move<00:02:48.320> around<00:02:48.560> the

putting the lock Traverse on a track is

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.490 
putting the lock Traverse on a track is
naturally<00:04:06.240> better<00:04:06.420> than<00:04:06.660> doing<00:04:06.870> two<00:04:07.140> separate

what<00:05:04.690> makes<00:05:04.900> a<00:05:05.020> move<00:05:05.170> a<00:05:05.260> pivot<00:05:05.620> is<00:05:05.740> simply<00:05:06.040> that

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
what makes a move a pivot is simply that

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.710 
what makes a move a pivot is simply that
we<00:05:06.280> lock<00:05:06.430> on<00:05:06.640> to<00:05:06.820> something<00:05:07.240> and<00:05:07.360> counter

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
we lock on to something and counter

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.220 
we lock on to something and counter
around<00:05:08.020> it<00:05:08.880> but<00:05:09.880> to<00:05:10.030> extend<00:05:10.210> this<00:05:10.480> idea<00:05:10.660> we<00:05:11.080> can

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
around it but to extend this idea we can

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.800 
around it but to extend this idea we can
really<00:05:11.440> lock<00:05:11.620> on<00:05:11.830> to<00:05:11.950> anything<00:05:12.250> we<00:05:12.400> want

really lock on to anything we want

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.210 
really lock on to anything we want
so<00:05:13.810> let's<00:05:14.020> pivot<00:05:14.290> around<00:05:14.410> the<00:05:14.650> woman<00:05:14.950> instead

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
so let's pivot around the woman instead

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.430 
so let's pivot around the woman instead
as<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.900> man<00:05:17.050> walk<00:05:17.290> she's<00:05:17.680> now<00:05:17.890> the<00:05:17.950> fix

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
as the man walk she's now the fix

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.870 
as the man walk she's now the fix
so<00:05:20.440> for<00:05:20.620> these<00:05:20.710> bits<00:05:20.980> of<00:05:21.100> movement<00:05:21.490> the<00:05:21.670> scene

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
so for these bits of movement the scene

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.060 
so for these bits of movement the scene
revolves<00:05:22.300> around<00:05:22.390> her

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070

a<00:05:26.130> converge<00:05:27.060> also<00:05:27.420> easily<00:05:27.690> turns<00:05:27.960> into<00:05:28.140> a

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
a converge also easily turns into a

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.110 
a converge also easily turns into a
pivot<00:05:28.500> if<00:05:28.740> the<00:05:28.860> track<00:05:29.100> is<00:05:29.130> angled

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
pivot if the track is angled

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.719 
pivot if the track is angled
astray<00:05:32.110> converge<00:05:32.440> by<00:05:32.650> itself<00:05:32.979> compresses<00:05:33.610> the

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
astray converge by itself compresses the

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.540 
astray converge by itself compresses the
attention<00:05:34.180> of<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:34.389> scene

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.610 

but<00:05:38.240> if<00:05:38.360> we<00:05:38.480> angle<00:05:38.630> the<00:05:38.840> track<00:05:39.200> the<00:05:39.440> move

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
but if we angle the track the move

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.340 
but if we angle the track the move
becomes<00:05:39.950> a<00:05:40.100> pivot<00:05:40.400> converge

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
becomes a pivot converge

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.680 
becomes a pivot converge
as<00:05:42.410> we<00:05:43.280> converge<00:05:43.640> we're<00:05:43.970> now<00:05:44.090> moving<00:05:44.240> more<00:05:44.600> to

we can just leave it at that but we

in<00:06:18.850> this<00:06:19.720> scene<00:06:19.990> we're<00:06:20.170> really<00:06:20.350> just

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
in this scene we're really just

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.080 
in this scene we're really just
countering<00:06:20.980> on<00:06:21.100> the<00:06:21.190> man<00:06:21.370> as<00:06:21.520> he<00:06:21.550> walks<00:06:21.820> to<00:06:22.000> the

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
woman but by starting on the pumpkin

woman but by starting on the pumpkin
which<00:06:23.950> is<00:06:24.070> a<00:06:24.100> completely<00:06:24.580> arbitrary<00:06:24.760> object

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:25.540

which is a completely arbitrary object
the<00:06:25.720> first<00:06:25.900> half<00:06:26.200> of<00:06:26.320> the<00:06:26.410> move<00:06:26.560> becomes<00:06:26.890> a

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
the first half of the move becomes a

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.720 
the first half of the move becomes a
pivot

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:31.730 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.850 

because<00:06:32.480> these<00:06:32.630> moves<00:06:32.960> are<00:06:33.110> so<00:06:33.260> similar<00:06:33.530> it's

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
because these moves are so similar it's

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.440 
because these moves are so similar it's
extremely<00:06:34.370> easy<00:06:34.400> to<00:06:34.790> go<00:06:34.910> from<00:06:34.940> one<00:06:35.300> to<00:06:35.390> the

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450 
extremely easy to go from one to the

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.530 
extremely easy to go from one to the
other<00:06:36.340> even<00:06:37.340> with<00:06:37.460> a<00:06:37.490> red<00:06:37.730> man<00:06:37.940> not<00:06:38.120> visible

other even with a red man not visible

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.180 
other even with a red man not visible
yet<00:06:38.780> it's<00:06:39.020> still<00:06:39.170> a<00:06:39.320> pivot<00:06:39.770> which<00:06:39.950> then

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
yet it's still a pivot which then

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.840 
yet it's still a pivot which then
becomes<00:06:40.520> a<00:06:40.610> counter

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850 
becomes a counter

becomes a counter
combinations<00:06:43.850> like<00:06:44.060> these<00:06:44.270> can<00:06:44.479> be<00:06:44.570> quite

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
combinations like these can be quite

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.700 
combinations like these can be quite

another<00:06:47.640> interesting<00:06:48.150> way<00:06:48.270> to<00:06:48.300> pivot<00:06:48.720> around

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
another interesting way to pivot around

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.720 
another interesting way to pivot around
objects<00:06:49.380> is<00:06:49.560> to<00:06:49.680> pivot<00:06:49.830> around<00:06:50.040> a<00:06:50.250> gap<00:06:50.430> in<00:06:50.640> the

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:50.730 
objects is to pivot around a gap in the

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.190 
objects is to pivot around a gap in the
foreground

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:53.200 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.200 

here<00:06:53.890> we<00:06:54.040> counter<00:06:54.370> the<00:06:54.460> man's<00:06:54.640> movement<00:06:55.120> by

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
here we counter the man's movement by

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.710 
here we counter the man's movement by
pivoting<00:06:55.600> around<00:06:55.690> the<00:06:55.930> hole<00:06:56.110> in<00:06:56.260> the<00:06:56.350> wall

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.050 

if<00:07:00.780> he<00:07:01.620> walks<00:07:01.830> back<00:07:02.100> we<00:07:02.310> simply<00:07:02.610> pivot<00:07:02.940> in<00:07:03.030> the

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 
if he walks back we simply pivot in the

if he walks back we simply pivot in the
opposite<00:07:03.510> direction
