this one all we're going to do is we're

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.990 
this one all we're going to do is we're
going<00:05:23.610> to<00:05:23.790> wrap<00:05:24.660> the<00:05:25.050> hair<00:05:25.320> around<00:05:25.350> the<00:05:25.980> barrel

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.430 

not<00:05:30.000> using<00:05:30.390> the<00:05:30.510> clamp<00:05:30.750> you<00:05:30.960> could<00:05:31.140> use<00:05:31.290> the

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
not using the clamp you could use the

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.980 
not using the clamp you could use the
clamp<00:05:31.680> if<00:05:31.860> you<00:05:32.010> want<00:05:32.280> but<00:05:32.640> I<00:05:32.910> like<00:05:33.360> the<00:05:33.630> look<00:05:33.810> of

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
clamp if you want but I like the look of

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.940 
clamp if you want but I like the look of
just<00:05:34.440> wrapping<00:05:35.010> it<00:05:35.130> around<00:05:35.340> the<00:05:35.820> barrel<00:05:36.950> like

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
just wrapping it around the barrel like

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.170 
just wrapping it around the barrel like
so<00:05:38.370> and<00:05:39.500> this<00:05:40.500> specific<00:05:40.800> curling<00:05:41.520> iron<00:05:41.700> gets

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
so and this specific curling iron gets

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.360 
so and this specific curling iron gets
hardly<00:05:42.720> fast<00:05:43.050> so<00:05:43.410> you<00:05:43.500> do<00:05:43.650> not<00:05:43.830> need<00:05:44.040> to<00:05:44.190> leave

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
hardly fast so you do not need to leave

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.760 
hardly fast so you do not need to leave
it<00:05:44.520> on<00:05:44.640> there<00:05:44.910> for<00:05:45.570> more<00:05:45.750> than<00:05:45.780> 10<00:05:46.080> seconds<00:05:46.500> or

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
it on there for more than 10 seconds or

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:53.350 
it on there for more than 10 seconds or
you<00:05:46.860> could<00:05:47.070> risk<00:05:47.280> damaging<00:05:48.000> your<00:05:48.060> hair<00:05:50.720> no

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
you could risk damaging your hair no

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.580 
you could risk damaging your hair no
okay<00:05:54.360> so<00:05:54.419> you<00:05:54.540> got<00:05:54.660> a<00:05:54.690> curl<00:05:54.990> like<00:05:55.140> that<00:05:55.380> and

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
okay so you got a curl like that and

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.740 
okay so you got a curl like that and
we're<00:05:55.710> gonna<00:05:55.830> continue<00:05:56.520> on<00:05:56.700> doing<00:05:57.120> that<00:05:57.300> to

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
we're gonna continue on doing that to

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:16.200 
we're gonna continue on doing that to
all<00:05:58.050> the<00:05:58.100> strands<00:05:59.100> that<00:05:59.220> we<00:05:59.340> have<00:05:59.520> out<00:05:59.820> here

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.779 

so<00:06:17.210> this<00:06:18.050> is<00:06:18.229> optional<00:06:18.860> but<00:06:19.159> I'm<00:06:19.309> just<00:06:19.490> going

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:19.789 
so this is optional but I'm just going

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:22.149 
so this is optional but I'm just going
to<00:06:20.119> kind<00:06:20.449> of<00:06:20.569> flick<00:06:20.959> my<00:06:21.169> bangs<00:06:21.469> out<00:06:21.830> a<00:06:21.860> little

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:22.159 
to kind of flick my bangs out a little

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:32.109 
to kind of flick my bangs out a little
bit<00:06:23.559> just<00:06:24.999> no<00:06:25.999> just<00:06:26.509> like<00:06:26.689> that<00:06:30.819> so<00:06:31.819> it<00:06:31.909> kind<00:06:32.089> of

00:06:32.109 --> 00:06:32.119 
bit just no just like that so it kind of

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:39.909 
bit just no just like that so it kind of
goes<00:06:32.419> with<00:06:32.719> all<00:06:32.929> the<00:06:33.110> hair<00:06:38.679> they're<00:06:39.679> flipping

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 
goes with all the hair they're flipping

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:41.499 
goes with all the hair they're flipping
it<00:06:40.159> over<00:06:40.219> I'm<00:06:40.429> just<00:06:40.610> going<00:06:40.819> with<00:06:40.939> the<00:06:41.089> curling

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:41.509 
it over I'm just going with the curling

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:43.629 
it over I'm just going with the curling
iron<00:06:41.689> and<00:06:42.169> make<00:06:42.289> I'm<00:06:42.740> using<00:06:42.979> the<00:06:43.189> barrel<00:06:43.459> this

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 
iron and make I'm using the barrel this

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:46.570 
iron and make I'm using the barrel this
time<00:06:43.969> and<00:06:44.629> I'm<00:06:44.719> just<00:06:44.899> blitek<00:06:45.349> because<00:06:46.309> it

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:46.580 
time and I'm just blitek because it

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.589 
time and I'm just blitek because it
reaches<00:06:47.089> the<00:06:47.240> bottom<00:06:47.680> so<00:06:48.680> just<00:06:48.709> like<00:06:49.129> that<00:06:49.599> and

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:50.599 
reaches the bottom so just like that and

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:55.149 
reaches the bottom so just like that and
this<00:06:51.050> is<00:06:51.110> basically<00:06:51.469> the<00:06:52.069> finished<00:06:52.550> look<00:06:54.159> so

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:55.159 
this is basically the finished look so

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:56.920 
this is basically the finished look so
now<00:06:55.309> if<00:06:55.459> you<00:06:55.520> want<00:06:55.729> to<00:06:55.819> play<00:06:55.999> it<00:06:56.119> up<00:06:56.240> with<00:06:56.509> some

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
now if you want to play it up with some

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.799 
now if you want to play it up with some
little<00:06:57.800> bowls<00:06:58.129> as<00:06:58.999> you<00:06:59.270> can<00:06:59.419> see<00:06:59.539> I've<00:06:59.629> put<00:06:59.779> a
