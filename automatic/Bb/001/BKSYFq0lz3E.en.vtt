00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello friends how are you 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:12.990
 in this new video 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.709
 I will show you how to install a new rum 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.709
 call 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:24.380
 sg s 3 in its version 4 there is as already 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.400
 you know 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.579
 we have to download the 22 files the 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.910
 rom and the club I will leave them in the 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.630
 description and we have to have permission 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.170
 of superuser 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.070
 I recommend installing it from the stock 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.580
 rom 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.610
 Y 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:51.050
 and make a backup in case you do not like the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.050
 rom or some problem arises 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.550
 the first thing is 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.240
 to pay good download the files 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:05.010
 and put them in the root of the sd 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.010
 now we will turn off the cell phone 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.540
 but let's turn it off 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.220
 once it has been turned off we will enter 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:21.909
 Recovery mode with power key volume 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.939
 up and home button at the same time 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.420
 and now the mode will start 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.420
 recovery 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.410
 there's the recovery mode 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.259
 the first thing we have to do 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:48.680
 go to the second option that is apple 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:51.550
 update from sd card 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.550
 and then 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:00.590
 we will choose the clockwork rate 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.590
 cwv m zip 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.800
 and as you can see, the appearance has changed 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.840
 let us focus it well it looks a bit 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.510
 fuzzy but I'll tell them to leave 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.530
 guiding the first thing we have to do 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.910
 is to go to the third option wipe data 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.460
 reset 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.680
 and we give him that yes 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.740
 there is remember that we move with 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.070
 Volume keys plus volume minus 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:37.490
 and select with the home button what 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.830
 next the fourth option wipe cache 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.810
 partition 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:47.050
 and we will give in 10 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.120
 and then we'll go to the last option 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:55.750
 where it says advanced 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:59.590
 and the second option wipe dalvik cache 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.590
 we give in yes 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.420
 and there it is 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.470
 now we're going with the button 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.569
 recoil and we will give you in the fifth 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.630
 install zip option 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.510
 fromme cd 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:21.520
 the first option I know if I promise 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.790
 kart and we will look for the rom that is called s 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.910
 that 3 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:31.480
 ron p 4.0 points 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:36.750
 we will give you that yes 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.750
 and if the process will begin 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.499
 and there begins to settle 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.499
 this is version 4 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.260
 there is already a version 5 but that has 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.380
 to go first we have to install 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.000
 version 4 later I will teach you how to 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.830
 install that version 5 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.810
 remember that the process takes a bit 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:10.849
 do not despair 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.350
 I'll leave the video so they can see how the 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.900
 process 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:19.209
 and you almost can not see good and this one 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.209
 says installing the kernel 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.330
 and there he says 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:28.690
 install promise of card complete good 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:33.490
 we will give you with the backspace key and the 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:38.349
 first option of boot system now 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.349
 there is restarting is the phone 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.729
 remember that the first start always 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.650
 it takes a while 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.129
 He says 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.969
 there is 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:53.969
 turning on 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:34.720
 the boot animation being encouraged 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.420
 switched on 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.720
 now we'll just wait for them to understand 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.770
 the 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.770
 the keys 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.440
 and forgive because it looks fuzzy 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.440
 but that 's the quality of my video 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:58.940
 I will try to get a better camera 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.940
 to make the videos look better 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:09.090
 I am very pleased with the response 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.090
 had my videos 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:16.069
 I hope it continues to continue like this 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:20.009
