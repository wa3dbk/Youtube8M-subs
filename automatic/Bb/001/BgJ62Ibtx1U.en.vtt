00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:10.790
 Media players come in all types and 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.379
 sizes that are devices that are all kinds 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.510
 digital files from your tablet 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:17.900
 smartphone or your own home network 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.940
 play and philips now has the a2 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.369
 that is also a so-called network audio 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.259
 player no less than a big asset there 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.939
 namely, an amplifier is built in and 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.499
 they strengthen no less than twice 50 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.999
 supply watts of power 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:31.339
 so you still have a good couple at home 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.990
 speakers are then this may be 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.460
 the device because your old amplifier can 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.350
 to replace 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.930
 the fidelio a2 from philips is actually 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.630
 but a very small light device 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.460
 it is less than 2 kilograms what it weighs 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.450
 and that naturally translates into the 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.580
 used materials 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.570
 it's all plastic even the 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.370
 topside 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.500
 looks like brushed aluminum but is 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.240
 just plastic what do you think of that 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.130
 device, of course, the volume button 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.650
 as on any amplifier 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.690
 their on-off button five for choices 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.270
 and was handy to internet radio stations 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.610
 under programming and a button true 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.320
 you operated the famous stream 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.600
 on the back actually not quite 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.429
 many more digital analog inputs and 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.840
 of course so must guess because it is one 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:14.990
 amplifier is 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.759
 and a wireless antenna the device 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.590
 do not operate with a remote control 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.619
 it is not included 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.299
 no you should not immediately take the a2 of everything 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.560
 philips is fairly easy with 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.999
 he just barely gets him 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.659
 instructions for use with this device 

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:28.340
 delivered 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.409
 The intention is that you use the device with 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:35.359
 the buttons on the device itself 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.799
 or with a very studio app there you can 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.569
 of everything million by you 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.499
 scroll your own music 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.439
 but also very easy for example 

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:44.899
 to an internet radio station 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.299
 You can also just jump 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.369
 on your laptop or a PC or for you 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.259
 mac you have special software for that 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.600
 the media manager software have over 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.219
 in general the a2 plays pretty much 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.090
 all the files that I go for really 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.469
 to be 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.450
 and it does that in a reasonable way 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.280
 user-friendly way 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.010
 of course your WiFi network is the one 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.050
 kinda decent now 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.430
 no matter how small the fidelio to two is 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.880
 sound that comes out is generally 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.260
 quite large and 52 what can the but 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.050
 so much as come to feel 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.880
 living room but a big plus is that 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.320
 it actually doesn't sound at all 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.270
 coloring is given 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.700
 it is of course dependent on the 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.350
 quality of your digital files and 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.780
 you must have really good speakers 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.550
 to hear that this device is not 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.160
 from the very best electronics parts 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.720
 is constructed but good or general 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.660
 headline can tackle dynamics from it 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.760
 device and if desired you can via the app 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.410
 there he is the first studio app again 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.310
 you adjust the sound in the 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.310
 eyes the layer anyway 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.459
 this video to two of philips is one 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.380
 media play but a bit one 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.630
 strange duck because it is one 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.490
 media player only for audio and it 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.200
 has an amplifier part but good 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.330
 it may be the solution to you 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.310
 replace old amplifier and so 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.650
 all kinds of streaming possibilities via PC 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.390
 tablet or laptop 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.310
 the operation of the device is over 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.900
 although the general aptitude 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.510
 depending on your WiFi network 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.790
 but given the price of less than 300 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.790
 euro see 4 stars certainly worth it
