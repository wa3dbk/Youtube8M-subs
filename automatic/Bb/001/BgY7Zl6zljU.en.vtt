halo 3 legendary walkthrough for next
now<00:00:13.220> this<00:00:13.400> is<00:00:13.610> a<00:00:13.639> really<00:00:14.150> funny<00:00:14.420> part<00:00:14.660> and<00:00:14.840> it's

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
now this is a really funny part and it's

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.150 
now this is a really funny part and it's
actually<00:00:15.290> the<00:00:15.380> more<00:00:15.559> difficult<00:00:15.710> than<00:00:16.039> you

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
actually the more difficult than you

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.190 
actually the more difficult than you
would<00:00:16.279> think<00:00:16.430> because<00:00:17.180> there's<00:00:17.480> two<00:00:17.750> scarabs

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
would think because there's two scarabs

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.570 
would think because there's two scarabs
right<00:00:18.410> now<00:00:18.560> and<00:00:18.920> you're<00:00:19.520> in<00:00:19.550> the<00:00:19.670> Pelican

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
right now and you're in the Pelican

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.179 
right now and you're in the Pelican
so<00:00:22.150> what<00:00:22.449> I<00:00:22.509> would<00:00:22.570> try<00:00:22.720> to<00:00:22.779> do<00:00:23.019> is<00:00:23.230> just<00:00:23.740> shoot

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
so what I would try to do is just shoot

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.730 
so what I would try to do is just shoot
at<00:00:24.429> the<00:00:25.000> scarabs<00:00:25.359> on<00:00:25.480> the<00:00:25.570> Wrights<00:00:25.779> leg<00:00:26.169> and

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
at the scarabs on the Wrights leg and

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.700 
at the scarabs on the Wrights leg and
with<00:00:27.460> as<00:00:27.669> many<00:00:27.910> missiles<00:00:28.359> and<00:00:28.599> bullets<00:00:29.079> as<00:00:29.259> you

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
with as many missiles and bullets as you

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.990 
with as many missiles and bullets as you
can<00:00:29.919> as<00:00:30.130> quickly<00:00:30.340> as<00:00:30.520> possible

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
can as quickly as possible

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.729 
can as quickly as possible
keeping<00:00:31.869> in<00:00:31.960> mind<00:00:32.110> that<00:00:32.259> there's<00:00:32.439> a<00:00:32.470> lot<00:00:32.619> of

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
quickly hopefully you can take it out or

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.650 
quickly hopefully you can take it out or

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
and what it's on the ground what you

and what it's on the ground what you
want<00:00:53.110> to<00:00:53.170> do<00:00:53.290> is<00:00:53.380> you<00:00:53.470> want<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:53.650> shoot<00:00:53.890> out<00:00:54.010> that

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
want to do is you want to shoot out that

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.880 
want to do is you want to shoot out that
back<00:00:54.430> panel<00:00:54.730> on<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.090> beta<00:00:55.360> sheet<00:00:55.600> or<00:00:56.500> on<00:00:56.650> the

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
back panel on the beta sheet or on the

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.250 
back panel on the beta sheet or on the
scarab

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.110 

and<00:01:00.560> I<00:01:00.890> didn't<00:01:01.190> manage<00:01:01.399> to<00:01:01.430> kill<00:01:01.579> it<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:01.880> first

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
and I didn't manage to kill it the first

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.190 
and I didn't manage to kill it the first
time<00:01:02.270> I<00:01:02.360> knocked<00:01:02.540> it<00:01:02.660> to<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.840> ground

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.100 

but<00:01:07.829> I<00:01:07.860> did<00:01:08.219> do<00:01:08.850> some<00:01:09.030> damage<00:01:09.329> to<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.930> back

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
but I did do some damage to that back

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.660 
but I did do some damage to that back
panel<00:01:10.289> so<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.710> next<00:01:10.979> time<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.219> knocked<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
panel so the next time I knocked to the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:21.810 
panel so the next time I knocked to the
ground<00:01:11.729> it'll<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.810> easier<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.170> take<00:01:13.380> out

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.790 

so<00:01:22.360> I'm<00:01:22.450> not<00:01:22.570> gonna<00:01:22.720> grind<00:01:22.990> a<00:01:23.110> second<00:01:23.440> time<00:01:23.590> and

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
so I'm not gonna grind a second time and

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.350 
so I'm not gonna grind a second time and
notice<00:01:24.310> how<00:01:24.460> I'm<00:01:24.550> keeping<00:01:24.910> my<00:01:25.030> elevation

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
notice how I'm keeping my elevation

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.960 
notice how I'm keeping my elevation
pretty<00:01:26.050> low<00:01:26.470> to<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.650> ground<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.880> that's

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
pretty low to the ground and that's

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.310 
pretty low to the ground and that's
because<00:01:28.420> you<00:01:28.750> want<00:01:28.870> to<00:01:28.930> be<00:01:28.990> able<00:01:29.050> to<00:01:29.200> get<00:01:29.290> a

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
because you want to be able to get a

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.070 
because you want to be able to get a
direct<00:01:29.680> shot<00:01:30.130> at<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.670> power<00:01:30.850> port<00:01:31.180> while

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
direct shot at the power port while

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
direct shot at the power port while
staying<00:01:32.440> in<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.890> Hornet

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
staying in the Hornet

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.290 
staying in the Hornet
so<00:01:36.100> just<00:01:36.340> keeps<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.610> in<00:01:36.700> that<00:01:36.790> back<00:01:36.910> panel<00:01:37.090> and

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
so just keeps you in that back panel and

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.060 
so just keeps you in that back panel and
then<00:01:37.390> you<00:01:37.420> can<00:01:37.630> get<00:01:37.690> a<00:01:37.750> direct<00:01:37.930> shot<00:01:38.320> right<00:01:38.920> at

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
then you can get a direct shot right at

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.190 
then you can get a direct shot right at
the<00:01:39.280> at<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.880> core<00:01:40.150> of<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.480> scare<00:01:40.750> up<00:01:40.870> and<00:01:41.020> take

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
the at the core of the scare up and take

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.380 
the at the core of the scare up and take
it<00:01:41.229> out<00:01:41.380> without<00:01:41.560> ever<00:01:41.860> leaving<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:43.090> morning

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
it out without ever leaving the morning

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.300 
it out without ever leaving the morning
and<00:01:44.200> then<00:01:44.320> you<00:01:44.350> got<00:01:44.530> just<00:01:44.740> gotta<00:01:44.920> do<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.130> same

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
and then you got just gotta do the same

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.090 
and then you got just gotta do the same
thing<00:01:45.520> for<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.760> second<00:01:46.150> scarab<00:01:47.050> except<00:01:47.620> it's

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
thing for the second scarab except it's

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.469 
thing for the second scarab except it's
probably<00:01:48.400> good<00:01:48.490> idea<00:01:48.729> to<00:01:48.850> take<00:01:49.030> out<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.300> rest

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
probably good idea to take out the rest

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:50.790 
probably good idea to take out the rest
of<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.600> band<00:01:49.720> shoes<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.140> ghosts<00:01:50.470> instead<00:01:50.620> of

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
of the band shoes and ghosts instead of

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.450 
of the band shoes and ghosts instead of
flying<00:01:50.979> around<00:01:52.500> before<00:01:53.500> you<00:01:53.740> start<00:01:54.280> focusing

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
flying around before you start focusing

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.109 
flying around before you start focusing
on<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:54.910> scarab<00:01:56.490> even<00:01:57.490> though<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.759> Scarab

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
on the scarab even though the Scarab

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.760 
on the scarab even though the Scarab
boots<00:01:58.300> you<00:01:58.810> know<00:01:58.840> super<00:01:59.320> vague<00:01:59.500> and

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
boots you know super vague and

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.690 
boots you know super vague and

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
threatening looking and has this a

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.240 
threatening looking and has this a
couple<00:02:03.700> different<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:05.350> lasers<00:02:05.800> on<00:02:06.009> it<00:02:06.160> to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
couple different like lasers on it to

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.609 
couple different like lasers on it to
take<00:02:06.400> you<00:02:06.610> out<00:02:06.729> and<00:02:07.210> birds<00:02:07.750> walking<00:02:08.290> all<00:02:08.380> over
