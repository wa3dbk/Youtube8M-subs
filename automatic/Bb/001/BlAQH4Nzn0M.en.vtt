look without the need to constantly

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.259 
look without the need to constantly
create<00:00:13.410> renders<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.820> I'm<00:00:14.910> gonna<00:00:15.030> add<00:00:15.240> a

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
create renders so I'm gonna add a

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.970 
create renders so I'm gonna add a
spotlight<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.199> scene<00:00:16.440> just<00:00:16.470> by<00:00:16.770> clicking

on this icon in the rendering shelf to
add<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> spotlight<00:00:20.279> I'll<00:00:21.210> use<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.539> Move<00:00:21.720> tool

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990

to drag it up I'm gonna drag it over

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.490 
to drag it up I'm gonna drag it over
here<00:00:25.949> I'm<00:00:26.519> gonna<00:00:26.640> go<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.820> panels<00:00:27.300> look<00:00:28.260> through

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
here I'm gonna go to panels look through

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.439 
here I'm gonna go to panels look through
selected<00:00:28.980> camera<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.580> can<00:00:29.789> see<00:00:30.000> through<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
selected camera so I can see through the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.709 
selected camera so I can see through the
spotlight<00:00:31.189> this<00:00:32.189> allows<00:00:32.489> me<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.759> easily

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
spotlight this allows me to easily

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.229 
spotlight this allows me to easily
position<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.550> attribute<00:00:36.059> editor

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
position it I have the attribute editor

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.020 
position it I have the attribute editor
opened<00:00:36.870> up<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.469> spotlight<00:00:37.980> shape<00:00:38.460> one<00:00:38.730> tab

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
opened up to the spotlight shape one tab

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.790 
opened up to the spotlight shape one tab
so<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.510> can<00:00:39.750> adjust<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.230> settings<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
so that I can adjust the settings of the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.830 
so that I can adjust the settings of the
light<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.250> I'm<00:00:42.030> gonna<00:00:42.120> increase<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.450> cone

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
light and I'm gonna increase the cone

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.319 
light and I'm gonna increase the cone
angle<00:00:43.079> I'll<00:00:43.920> switch<00:00:44.190> back<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.489> my<00:00:44.730> perspective

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
angle I'll switch back to my perspective

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.720 
angle I'll switch back to my perspective
view<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.320> now<00:00:46.590> if<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.920> want<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.160> see<00:00:47.340> how<00:00:47.520> this

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
view and now if I want to see how this

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.840 
view and now if I want to see how this
lighting<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.149> gonna<00:00:48.360> look<00:00:48.570> I'll<00:00:49.260> go<00:00:49.469> into<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
lighting is gonna look I'll go into the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.330 
lighting is gonna look I'll go into the
lighting<00:00:51.120> window<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.050> choose<00:00:52.559> use<00:00:53.010> all

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
lighting window and choose use all

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.000 
lighting window and choose use all
lights<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.420> hotkey<00:00:54.840> for<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
lights the hotkey for this is just the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.450 
lights the hotkey for this is just the
number<00:00:56.309> 7<00:00:56.930> now<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.199> see<00:00:58.440> how<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.070> light

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
number 7 now I can see how the light

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.939 
number 7 now I can see how the light
cone<00:00:59.850> angle<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.960> gonna<00:01:01.170> work<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> scene

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
cone angle is gonna work in the scene

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.680 
cone angle is gonna work in the scene
and<00:01:02.219> where<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> lights<00:01:02.699> coming<00:01:02.820> from<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:03.600> I

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
and where the lights coming from so if I

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.450 
and where the lights coming from so if I
just<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.170> cone<00:01:04.379> angle<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.070> see<00:01:05.250> how<00:01:05.400> that

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
just the cone angle you can see how that

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.870 
just the cone angle you can see how that
affects<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.090> light<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> scene<00:01:07.729> I'm<00:01:08.729> going

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
affects the light in the scene I'm going

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.280 
affects the light in the scene I'm going
to<00:01:08.939> set<00:01:09.119> my<00:01:09.240> renderer<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.990> high<00:01:10.229> quality

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
to set my renderer to high quality

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.399 
to set my renderer to high quality
rendering<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.570> that<00:01:12.570> will<00:01:12.750> allow<00:01:12.960> me<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.170> see

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
rendering and that will allow me to see

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.840 
rendering and that will allow me to see
the<00:01:13.439> cone<00:01:13.890> angle<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.310> little<00:01:14.430> bit<00:01:14.640> more

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the cone angle a little bit more

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.560 
the cone angle a little bit more
accurately<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:16.320> more<00:01:16.560> nicely<00:01:16.770> defined<00:01:17.570> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
accurately it's more nicely defined and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.080 
accurately it's more nicely defined and
if<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.650> want<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.950> see<00:01:20.100> how<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.340> shadows<00:01:20.880> are

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
if I want to see how the shadows are

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.340 
if I want to see how the shadows are
gonna<00:01:21.210> look<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> scene<00:01:21.900> or<00:01:21.930> where<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
gonna look in the scene or where the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.109 
gonna look in the scene or where the
shadows<00:01:22.680> are<00:01:22.830> coming<00:01:22.950> from<00:01:23.250> I'll<00:01:23.580> go<00:01:23.759> into<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
shadows are coming from I'll go into the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.960 
shadows are coming from I'll go into the
lighting<00:01:24.330> menu<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.960> I'll<00:01:25.049> turn<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.320> shadows

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
lighting menu and I'll turn on shadows

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.460 
lighting menu and I'll turn on shadows
I'm<00:01:26.970> not<00:01:27.090> gonna<00:01:27.240> see<00:01:27.450> anything<00:01:27.720> yet<00:01:28.020> until<00:01:28.439> I

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
I'm not gonna see anything yet until I

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.740 
I'm not gonna see anything yet until I
actually<00:01:28.710> add<00:01:29.130> some<00:01:29.430> shadows<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.540> light

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
actually add some shadows to the light

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.649 
actually add some shadows to the light
so<00:01:31.740> if<00:01:31.829> I'm<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.220> attribute<00:01:33.119> editor<00:01:33.150> for

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
so if I'm in the attribute editor for

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.780 
so if I'm in the attribute editor for
the<00:01:33.780> spotlight<00:01:33.869> shape<00:01:34.500> I'll<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.250> go<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.430> and

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
the spotlight shape I'll just go on and

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.420 
the spotlight shape I'll just go on and
I'll<00:01:36.030> turn<00:01:36.240> use<00:01:36.869> depth<00:01:37.200> map<00:01:37.439> shadows<00:01:37.950> this

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
I'll turn use depth map shadows this

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.179 
I'll turn use depth map shadows this
works<00:01:38.700> for<00:01:39.030> both<00:01:39.689> depth<00:01:40.229> map<00:01:40.470> shadows<00:01:40.890> and

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
works for both depth map shadows and

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.810 
works for both depth map shadows and
rate<00:01:41.430> ratios<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:43.049> I'll<00:01:43.110> turn<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.409> shadows<00:01:43.820> and

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
rate ratios so I'll turn on shadows and

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.649 
rate ratios so I'll turn on shadows and
now<00:01:45.060> as<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.329> position<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.960> light<00:01:47.210> you<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.390> see

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
now as I position the light you can see

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.060 
now as I position the light you can see
what<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.020> shadow<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.470> gonna<00:01:49.649> look<00:01:49.829> like

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
what that shadow is gonna look like

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.580 
what that shadow is gonna look like
without<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.640> need<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:50.970> create<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.600> test<00:01:52.170> render

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
without the need to create a test render

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.789 
without the need to create a test render
I<00:01:52.710> can<00:01:53.100> also<00:01:53.280> preview<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:54.899> penumbra<00:01:55.229> angle

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
I can also preview the penumbra angle

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.010 
I can also preview the penumbra angle
basically<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.640> softness<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.479> edge<00:01:57.630> of

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
basically the softness of the edge of

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.649 
basically the softness of the edge of
the<00:01:58.829> spotlight<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.939> if<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.060> start<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.420> increase

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
the spotlight so if I start to increase

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.719 
the spotlight so if I start to increase
this<00:02:01.020> we<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.290> see<00:02:01.439> how<00:02:01.590> that's<00:02:01.829> getting<00:02:02.159> nice

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
this we can see how that's getting nice

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.499 
this we can see how that's getting nice
and<00:02:02.759> soft

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
and soft

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.490 
and soft
I<00:02:03.560> can<00:02:04.560> also<00:02:04.740> preview<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.579> drop<00:02:05.969> off<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
I can also preview the drop off is the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.400 
I can also preview the drop off is the
intensity<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:09.300> center<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.989> light<00:02:10.200> as

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
intensity of the center of the light as

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.330 
intensity of the center of the light as
it<00:02:10.440> hits<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.860> surface<00:02:11.129> as<00:02:11.550> opposed

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
it hits the surface as opposed

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.570 
it hits the surface as opposed
the<00:02:12.400> edge<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:14.170> now<00:02:14.590> before<00:02:14.769> even<00:02:15.129> creating<00:02:15.519> a

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
the edge so now before even creating a

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.640 
the edge so now before even creating a
test<00:02:15.760> render<00:02:16.000> I<00:02:16.120> have<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.360> good<00:02:16.599> idea<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:17.349> what

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
test render I have a good idea of what

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.680 
test render I have a good idea of what
that<00:02:17.800> lighting<00:02:18.220> is<00:02:18.310> going<00:02:18.519> to<00:02:18.580> look<00:02:18.760> like<00:02:21.690> and

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
that lighting is going to look like and

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.280 
that lighting is going to look like and
if<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:22.900> do<00:02:22.959> a<00:02:23.080> render<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.620> scene<00:02:24.989> you<00:02:25.989> can<00:02:26.050> see

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
if I do a render the scene you can see

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.500 
if I do a render the scene you can see
how<00:02:26.440> well<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.739> matches<00:02:26.769> at<00:02:27.700> this<00:02:27.910> point<00:02:28.180> I<00:02:28.330> can

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
how well it matches at this point I can

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.210 
how well it matches at this point I can
start<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.900> adjust<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.440> quality<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:30.040> my

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
start to adjust the quality of my

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.740 
start to adjust the quality of my
shadows<00:02:30.670> but<00:02:31.000> I've<00:02:31.269> already<00:02:31.569> established

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
shadows but I've already established

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.339 
shadows but I've already established
where<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.379> lights<00:02:32.560> coming<00:02:32.830> from<00:02:33.299> and<00:02:34.349> I've

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
where the lights coming from and I've

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.140 
where the lights coming from and I've
previewed<00:02:35.769> it<00:02:35.860> in<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.099> scene<00:02:36.340> which<00:02:36.790> gonna<00:02:37.030> be

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
previewed it in the scene which gonna be

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.880 
previewed it in the scene which gonna be
very<00:02:37.330> convenient<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:38.110> save<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:38.410> time<00:02:38.620> when

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
very convenient and save you time when

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.849 
very convenient and save you time when
you're<00:02:39.040> working<00:02:39.400> with<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.640> lights
