00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.170
 chapter 3 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.339
 there was a man of the Pharisees whose name was Nicodemus 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.790
 a principal among the Jews 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.249
 he came to jesus at night and told him 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:15.519
 we know that you have come from God as a teacher because nobody can do these 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.929
 signs that you make but stadiums with him 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.919
 Jesus answered and told him 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:26.189
 desert desert I tell you that whoever is not born again can not see the kingdom 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.519
 of God 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:28.989
 nicodemo told him 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.390
 how can a man be born being old 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.000
 can enter the second time in the womb of his mother and be born 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.430
 Jesus answered 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.640
 desert desert I tell you that whoever is not born of water and spirit can not 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.670
 enter the kingdom of God 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.530
 what is born of the meat meats 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.530
 and what is born of spirit spirit is 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.270
 do not you wonder what I told you 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.480
 or it is necessary to be born again 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.640
 the wind blows from where it wants 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.060
 and hears its sound 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.180
 more you do not know where it comes from or where it is going 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.640
 so is everyone who is born of the spirit 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.570
 Nicodemus replied and told him 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.560
 how can this be done 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.540
 Jesus answered and told him 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.540
 you are your master of israel and you do not know this 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.290
 Certainly I tell you that what we know we speak and what we have seen 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.290
 we testify and you do not receive our testimony 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.650
 if I have told you earthly things and do not believe as credit digests the 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.340
 heavenly 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.320
 no one went up to heaven but he who descended from heaven the son of man 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.010
 who is in heaven 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.140
 and as a bassinet he raised the serpent in the desert 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.659
 Thus it is necessary that the son of man be raised up so that everyone who 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:44.410
 he believes 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.490
 Do not miss 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.520
 more have eternal life 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.330
 because in such a way God loved the world 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.470
 who has given his only begotten son 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.859
 so that everyone who believes in him 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:55.990
 Do not miss 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.200
 more have eternal life 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.710
 because God did not give his son to the world to condemn the world 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.830
 but for the world to be saved by him 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.130
 he who believes in him is not condemned 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.109
 but whoever does not believe has already been condemned 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.369
 because he has not believed in the name of the unifem landmark son of god 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:16.079
 and this is the condemnation 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.750
 that light came to the world 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.950
 and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:27.010
 because everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to light 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.779
 so that his works are not reproved 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:32.649
 But the one who practices the truth comes to light 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:36.019
 for it has been stated that his works are done in God 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:41.979
 after this came Jesus with his disciples to the land of Judea 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:44.979
 and he was there with them and baptized 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:50.399
 John also baptized n not with Salim because there were many waters there 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:53.299
 and they came and they have walked 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.199
 because Juan had not been imprisoned yet 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:03:00.259
 then there was discussion between the disciples of John and the Jews about 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:01.809
 of purification 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:03.809
 and they came to joan and they told him 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:04.639
 rami 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.620
 look that the one who was with you on the other side of the Jordan 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.240
 of whom you gave baptized witness and all come to him 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:13.679
 he answered what he said 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:17.199
 Man can not receive anything if it is not given to him from heaven 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:20.650
 you yourselves are not witnesses that I said 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.140
 I am not the Christ but I am sent before him 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.109
 the one with the wife is the husband 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.299
 more the friend of the husband who is by his side and hears him 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.009
 secco sa greatly of the voice of the husband 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:36.189
 so this vigorous is fulfilled 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:38.260
 it is necessary that he grow 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.519
 but that I die 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.120
 the one above comes 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.290
 it's about everyone 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.119
 he who is of the earth is earthly and earthly things speaks 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:50.139
 He who comes from heaven is above all 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.549
 and what he saw and heard this testifies 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.809
 and nobody receives his testimony 

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:56.760
 the one who receives his testimony 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.429
 this attests that god is candles 

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:03.739
 because the one that God gave me the words of God speaks because God does not give 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.739
 the spirit by measure 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.589
 the father loves the son and all the things he has delivered in his hand 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.609
 who believe the son has eternal life 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.749
 but he who refuses to believe in him said 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:17.690
 noguera the life but the wrath of god scarce
