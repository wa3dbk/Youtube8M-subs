that to kind of come up with a guide for
how<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.159> think<00:01:05.489> 4j<00:01:05.820> studios<00:01:06.180> will<00:01:06.420> implement

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
how I think 4j studios will implement

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.810 
how I think 4j studios will implement
features<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.590> next<00:01:07.829> coming<00:01:07.950> update<00:01:08.340> so

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
features in the next coming update so

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.219 
features in the next coming update so
let's<00:01:09.000> get<00:01:09.090> started<00:01:09.240> first<00:01:09.509> of<00:01:09.869> all<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.020> think

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
let's get started first of all I think

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.719 
let's get started first of all I think
we<00:01:10.500> are<00:01:10.590> going<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.920> be<00:01:11.009> seeing<00:01:11.250> villager

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
we are going to be seeing villager

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.219 
we are going to be seeing villager
trading<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.329> obviously<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.079> I<00:01:13.110> think

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
trading and obviously with that I think

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.989 
trading and obviously with that I think
we're<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:13.740> some<00:01:13.829> emerald<00:01:14.310> because

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:14.999 
we're going to see some emerald because

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:17.359 
we're going to see some emerald because
villager<00:01:15.450> trading<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:16.109> the<00:01:16.649> currency<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.069> that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
villager trading is the currency of that

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.830 
villager trading is the currency of that
is<00:01:17.520> actually<00:01:17.880> emerald<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.329> obviously<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.810> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
is actually emerald so obviously to a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.179 
is actually emerald so obviously to a
villager<00:01:19.200> trading<00:01:19.319> you<00:01:19.560> would<00:01:19.649> need<00:01:19.740> emeralds

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
villager trading you would need emeralds

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.980 
villager trading you would need emeralds
and<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:21.030> villager<00:01:21.359> trading<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.719> think<00:01:21.899> we're

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and for villager trading I think we're

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.599 
and for villager trading I think we're
going<00:01:22.079> to<00:01:22.170> get<00:01:22.319> that<00:01:22.499> because<00:01:22.950> over<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.520> past

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:23.609 
going to get that because over the past

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:25.730 
going to get that because over the past
couple<00:01:23.969> of<00:01:24.149> updates<00:01:24.299> 4j<00:01:24.869> Studios<00:01:25.229> has<00:01:25.409> really

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
couple of updates 4j Studios has really

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.550 
couple of updates 4j Studios has really
been<00:01:25.920> pushing<00:01:26.219> updates<00:01:26.819> in<00:01:26.969> MPC<00:01:27.509> villages<00:01:27.929> you

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
been pushing updates in MPC villages you

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.139 
been pushing updates in MPC villages you
know<00:01:28.590> zombie<00:01:29.100> sieges<00:01:29.490> iron<00:01:29.729> golems<00:01:30.060> and

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
know zombie sieges iron golems and

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:31.219 
know zombie sieges iron golems and
things<00:01:30.329> like<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.840> think<00:01:30.960> that

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
things like that so I think that

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.169 
things like that so I think that
villager<00:01:31.679> trading<00:01:31.859> is<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.789> next<00:01:33.030> thing

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
villager trading is is the next thing

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.149 
villager trading is is the next thing
that<00:01:33.210> they<00:01:33.420> are<00:01:33.479> going<00:01:33.539> to<00:01:33.719> add<00:01:33.899> in<00:01:33.929> with<00:01:34.649> npc

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
that they are going to add in with npc

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.309 
that they are going to add in with npc
villages<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.700> with<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.689> also<00:01:36.929> think<00:01:37.139> we

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
villages and with that I also think we

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:38.899 
villages and with that I also think we
are<00:01:37.409> going<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.649> be<00:01:37.740> seeing<00:01:37.979> sideways<00:01:38.520> logs

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
are going to be seeing sideways logs

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.059 
are going to be seeing sideways logs
chiseled<00:01:39.630> sandstone<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.380> smooth<00:01:40.679> sandstone

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069 
chiseled sandstone and smooth sandstone

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:43.580 
chiseled sandstone and smooth sandstone
now<00:01:41.789> I<00:01:41.850> say<00:01:42.179> this<00:01:42.359> because<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.139> game<00:01:43.380> as

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
now I say this because in the game as

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.260 
now I say this because in the game as
many<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.889> you<00:01:43.979> probably<00:01:44.009> already<00:01:44.459> know<00:01:44.729> there

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
many of you probably already know there

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.999 
many of you probably already know there
are<00:01:45.420> glitches<00:01:45.719> to<00:01:46.079> get<00:01:46.229> these<00:01:46.409> blocks<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.979> I

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
are glitches to get these blocks and I

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.889 
are glitches to get these blocks and I
think<00:01:47.219> for<00:01:47.369> some<00:01:47.609> reason<00:01:47.939> maybe<00:01:48.090> 4j<00:01:48.509> Studios

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
think for some reason maybe 4j Studios

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.389 
think for some reason maybe 4j Studios
was<00:01:49.079> originally<00:01:49.560> planning<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:50.009> adding<00:01:50.130> them

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
was originally planning on adding them

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.190 
was originally planning on adding them
in<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.729> then<00:01:51.179> decided<00:01:51.209> against<00:01:51.959> it<00:01:52.049> for

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
in and then decided against it for

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.019 
in and then decided against it for
whatever<00:01:52.679> reason<00:01:53.039> so<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.189> think<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.759> since

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:54.029 
whatever reason so I think that since

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:56.209 
whatever reason so I think that since
the<00:01:54.149> glitches<00:01:54.359> out<00:01:54.659> there<00:01:55.560> sure<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.979> shows

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
the glitches out there sure that shows

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.410 
the glitches out there sure that shows
that<00:01:56.249> there<00:01:56.459> was<00:01:56.579> some<00:01:56.700> kind<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:56.999> texture

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
that there was some kind of texture

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.699 
that there was some kind of texture
thing<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.869> they<00:01:57.929> were<00:01:57.990> planning<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.499> doing

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
thing that they were planning on doing

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:00.889 
thing that they were planning on doing
but<00:01:58.859> decided<00:01:59.189> not<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.490> do<00:01:59.609> and<00:01:59.789> thus<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.630> think

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
but decided not to do and thus I think

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.059 
but decided not to do and thus I think
they<00:02:01.020> are<00:02:01.079> going<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.319> be<00:02:01.439> adding<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
they are going to be adding it in the

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.249 
they are going to be adding it in the
next<00:02:02.310> update<00:02:02.429> now<00:02:03.240> as<00:02:03.420> many<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.840> know<00:02:03.869> we

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
next update now as many of you know we

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.589 
next update now as many of you know we
also<00:02:04.469> recently<00:02:04.889> got<00:02:05.279> the<00:02:05.429> addition<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.909> rare

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:06.599 
also recently got the addition of rare

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:08.930 
also recently got the addition of rare
mob<00:02:06.899> drops<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.529> with<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.130> I<00:02:08.369> think<00:02:08.759> we<00:02:08.849> are

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
mob drops and with that I think we are

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.550 
mob drops and with that I think we are
next<00:02:09.149> going<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.420> be<00:02:09.569> seeing<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.990> addition<00:02:10.410> of

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
next going to be seeing the addition of

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.589 
next going to be seeing the addition of
mobs<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.069> wear<00:02:11.310> armor<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.180> if<00:02:12.270> any<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.480> you

mobs that wear armor so if any of you

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.660 
mobs that wear armor so if any of you
guys<00:02:12.750> have<00:02:12.810> ever<00:02:13.170> played<00:02:13.500> on<00:02:13.980> minecraft<00:02:14.550> for

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
guys have ever played on minecraft for

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.730 
guys have ever played on minecraft for
the<00:02:14.730> PC<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.390> know<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.750> sometimes<00:02:16.050> mobs<00:02:16.590> will

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
the PC you know that sometimes mobs will

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.440 
the PC you know that sometimes mobs will
be<00:02:16.860> wearing<00:02:17.069> helmets<00:02:17.550> or<00:02:17.670> using<00:02:17.910> swords<00:02:18.150> or

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
be wearing helmets or using swords or

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.030 
be wearing helmets or using swords or
doing<00:02:19.020> different<00:02:19.290> things<00:02:19.320> like<00:02:19.500> that<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:19.950> I

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
doing different things like that and I

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
doing different things like that and I
feel<00:02:20.220> like<00:02:20.250> that's<00:02:20.370> going<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.730> be<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.940> next

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
feel like that's going to be the next

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.120 
feel like that's going to be the next
thing<00:02:21.300> for<00:02:21.510> do<00:02:21.630> Studios<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.020> going<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.320> add

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
thing for do Studios is going to add

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
thing for do Studios is going to add
I feel<00:02:23.430> like<00:02:23.490> they're<00:02:23.640> trying<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:23.910> make<00:02:24.000> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
I feel like they're trying to make the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.400 
I feel like they're trying to make the
game<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.360> little<00:02:24.450> bit<00:02:24.600> more<00:02:24.750> difficult<00:02:25.020> a

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
game a little bit more difficult a

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.050 
game a little bit more difficult a
little<00:02:25.590> more<00:02:25.680> interesting<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.310> with<00:02:26.850> that<00:02:26.880> I

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
little more interesting and with that I

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.520 
little more interesting and with that I
also<00:02:27.300> think<00:02:27.570> they're<00:02:27.750> going<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.050> be<00:02:28.170> adding<00:02:28.320> in

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
also think they're going to be adding in

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.190 
also think they're going to be adding in
hardcore<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.370> adventure<00:02:29.880> mode<00:02:30.060> now<00:02:31.020> these

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
hardcore and adventure mode now these

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.230 
hardcore and adventure mode now these
modes<00:02:31.500> are<00:02:31.650> essentially<00:02:32.130> just<00:02:32.370> expansions<00:02:33.060> of

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
modes are essentially just expansions of

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.450 
modes are essentially just expansions of
what<00:02:33.450> we<00:02:33.540> have<00:02:33.720> now<00:02:33.870> hardcore<00:02:34.200> mode<00:02:34.530> obviously

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
what we have now hardcore mode obviously

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.010 
what we have now hardcore mode obviously
if<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.640> die<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:35.850> do<00:02:36.210> not<00:02:36.360> come<00:02:36.570> back<00:02:36.600> into<00:02:36.930> the

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
if you die you do not come back into the

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.960 
if you die you do not come back into the
world<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.380> world<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.680> deleted<00:02:38.100> at<00:02:38.700> least<00:02:38.820> that

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
world the world is deleted at least that

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.310 
world the world is deleted at least that
is<00:02:39.000> how<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.210> is<00:02:39.360> on<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.540> pc<00:02:39.900> i<00:02:39.930> don't<00:02:40.170> know<00:02:40.230> if

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
is how it is on the pc i don't know if

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.300 
is how it is on the pc i don't know if
they're<00:02:40.410> going<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.590> change<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.980> little<00:02:41.010> bit

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
they're going to change it a little bit

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.520 
they're going to change it a little bit
you<00:02:41.910> know<00:02:41.940> historically<00:02:42.750> they've<00:02:43.200> kind<00:02:43.470> of

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
you know historically they've kind of

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.870 
you know historically they've kind of
made<00:02:43.770> their<00:02:43.920> own<00:02:43.950> little<00:02:44.160> changes<00:02:44.730> and

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
made their own little changes and

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.850 
made their own little changes and
additions<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.930> they<00:02:46.020> might<00:02:46.170> change<00:02:46.590> up<00:02:46.770> some

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
additions so they might change up some

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.350 
additions so they might change up some
of<00:02:46.980> these<00:02:47.040> things<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.280> little<00:02:47.400> bit<00:02:47.580> but<00:02:48.120> for<00:02:48.300> the

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
of these things a little bit but for the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.430 
of these things a little bit but for the
most<00:02:48.480> part<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:48.780> think<00:02:48.810> we<00:02:49.020> are<00:02:49.110> going<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.350> be

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
most part I think we are going to be

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.020 
most part I think we are going to be
seeing<00:02:49.590> hardcore<00:02:50.040> in<00:02:50.100> adventure<00:02:50.430> mode<00:02:50.580> all
