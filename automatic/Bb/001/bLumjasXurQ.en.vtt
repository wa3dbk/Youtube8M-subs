00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:09.520 
we're basically done with all of our

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.140 
we're basically done with all of our
porting

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150

porting
I<00:00:10.180> got<00:00:10.750> the<00:00:10.840> cylinder<00:00:11.230> where<00:00:11.410> I<00:00:11.440> want<00:00:11.740> it<00:00:11.920> the

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.130 
I got the cylinder where I want it the

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.430 
I got the cylinder where I want it the
last<00:00:12.370> thing<00:00:12.670> that<00:00:13.120> we<00:00:13.240> have<00:00:13.389> to<00:00:13.420> do<00:00:13.690> is<00:00:13.840> chamfer

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
last thing that we have to do is chamfer

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.620 
last thing that we have to do is chamfer
all<00:00:15.219> the<00:00:15.549> ports<00:00:16.030> that<00:00:16.990> we<00:00:17.710> read<00:00:17.950> round<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:19.510> is

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
all the ports that we read round this is

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.019 
all the ports that we read round this is
an<00:00:19.720> itself<00:00:20.260> stone<00:00:20.470> they're<00:00:20.830> a<00:00:21.000> little<00:00:22.000> tricky

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
an itself stone they're a little tricky

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.540 
an itself stone they're a little tricky
which<00:00:25.029> if<00:00:25.539> you<00:00:25.630> do<00:00:25.779> this<00:00:25.929> thing<00:00:26.080> correctly<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
which if you do this thing correctly the

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.189 
which if you do this thing correctly the
chance<00:00:27.820> that<00:00:27.910> oil<00:00:28.179> can<00:00:28.420> get<00:00:28.630> under<00:00:28.929> the<00:00:29.019> neck

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
chance that oil can get under the neck

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.529 
chance that oil can get under the neck
and<00:00:29.349> so<00:00:29.439> on<00:00:29.589> flake<00:00:29.859> the<00:00:30.009> cell<00:00:30.220> on<00:00:30.369> there<00:00:30.550> so<00:00:31.509> you

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
and so on flake the cell on there so you

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.930 
and so on flake the cell on there so you
gotta<00:00:31.929> kind<00:00:32.140> of<00:00:32.290> stick<00:00:32.470> to<00:00:32.590> your<00:00:32.740> specs<00:00:33.040> what

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
gotta kind of stick to your specs what

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.370 
gotta kind of stick to your specs what
we're<00:00:34.060> gonna<00:00:34.150> do<00:00:34.420> is<00:00:34.810> we're<00:00:34.990> going<00:00:35.080> to<00:00:35.140> run<00:00:35.290> in
