00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.410
 I find it very quickly Port that is in the year of our anniversary takes place 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.670

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.310
 convinced of this project 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.859
 The project will sustainably enrich urban development 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:28.179
 That's why we'd rather help this path that's quite a brave way 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:29.140
 kg 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.009
 be prevented 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:38.879
 Trade we will not be after who wants to come outside for that 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:39.929
 like to do 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:42.379
 the underground car park is not yet 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.379

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.599
 one experiences 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.409

 l as he puts all things together 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.420
 Sören it is the one in Iraq with the Santa Annen suddenly and next to it

 l Dr that will be explained to be next to Dr Sandstein who will be new again 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.449
 I hope analyst next year 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.449
 I've been doing a lot this is not a joke of the ten plagues 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.889
 Only once the SG is that here we have our parents' home on the exact 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.740
 on the spot where we are now 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.979
 the 1907 our single enterprise was founded we stand up now 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.729
 the place where the basement stairs used to go down and down here 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.650
 Warehouses were stocked and there was this shop up front so that was why 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.839
 to me 

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:12.189
 a big pleasure 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:13.770
 when the possibility existed 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.330
 redesigning this one here and bringing it back to life 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.120
 to be fulfilled since 1990 he was not WDR with a trading company 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.550
 more active and that will be so again in the future again then will be 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.599
 Again, a private merchant here running a grocery that was 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.879
 the first point and then when the cleaning houses burned down and some 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:34.969
 were dilapidated 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:38.290
 and then I'm with our mayor 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.710
 in front of Dankwardt 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.059
 aap composed and percent 

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:45.959
 Percent said we should rethink this entire area around this 

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:49.520
 Part of the city the former No had a very good reputation 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.779
 to fill with life and that will happen now 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:57.360
 It can be done there by the end of next year 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.889
 Kalsow 1 built in the end of 2012 so we need so well every one and a half years 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:03.610
 construction time 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.830
 So if everything goes well now and we can work with the clubs 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.719
 then we will do it 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:12.819
 during tests with the FC never about this beautiful building in Dolberg the beautiful 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:17.029
 Building maybe something because there are two large building complexes once 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:22.229
 this is an underground car park with residential buildings over there and the other house is one 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:23.699
 business house 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:27.689
 and service woman out and includes a hole assisted living 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:29.839
 because we will be sure of that in the future 

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:34.379
 Nis are needed in many but in every city due to the age- 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:37.469
 Development of German compliance everywhere much more elderly 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.460
 which is very good but also often a bit support 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.439
 use and there are often 

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:47.150
 your own family members are no longer available 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.590
 and then one takes one then rents oneself into such apartments and sheer 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.119
 in this case who cares then of the Arbeiterwohlfahrt 

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:59.479
 I think we have found great partners here and there and how many 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:00.899
 Apartment have already been sold 

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:04.499
 Percent of these apartments will not be sold but this apartment during 

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:08.060
 rented and all 31 apartments are so much 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.770
 be from the Arbeiterwohlfahrt 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.499
 from us the rent is and then they have 

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:14.840
 Interested parties then go in there 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.800
 and someone told me that 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.319
 m big crowd on this apartment is already not one though 

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:22.510
 only apartment 

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.149
 Percent has been built 

00:07:24.149 --> 00:07:28.679
 and then you can go to a café of Sinah lemonade drink this 

00:07:28.679 --> 00:07:30.360
 I'm sure it'll be nice for you 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.500
 Century Mama Chancellor drive in front of the underground car park Mr. Chancellor and in 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.169
 the cellar a camera car 

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:39.169
 the species-appropriate is kept tight 

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:43.269
 At that time we got straight and we are happy that it will be ready soon 

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:46.159
 would have 

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:49.159
 Holger Vehren 

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:53.319
 more 

00:07:58.419 --> 00:08:01.419
 and the day after 

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:13.289
 we will continue to report 

00:08:15.869 --> 00:08:16.089
