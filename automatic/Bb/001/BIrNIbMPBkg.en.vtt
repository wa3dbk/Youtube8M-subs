 At the same time he warned the time is clear I like doing with across the 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:31.069
 garden 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:34.360
 I've got a few more things for me today 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:37.750
 Once they say it and it was so important now that it was 

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:39.380
 Packed bags 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.210
 For example, her only sentence is Thun that means she has to do something 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.080

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.900
 ward off some of my the video already noted that I'm always more on it 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.040
 that's what the Sega Dreamcast is all about 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.010
 because MDK 2 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.100
 For the winner Dreamcast actually also an absolutely super game 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.990
 I had a lot of fun 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.330
 everything has once built its vocally 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.960
 then a photo cd for the winner says Thon some do not believe anything 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.610
 So if you have the iPhone he can work at the Dan market right now 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.620
 Since many series Kross Planet talk that was what you play on the Internet 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.160
 So could the version with the games 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.080
 Halle Berry and not on the shore squad two tables is around I like this one 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.979
 Buster's book stories are very much her to record 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.009
 Sega Saturn with these relatively sporty and lose packs 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.389
 then for the Sega Mega CD he was a cd drive for the Sega Mega 

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:51.049
 Drive 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.159
 from baroque 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.540
 also a super game 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.410
 very very good at that time USDA for that time very good technique and 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.230
 graphic 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.170
 then for the Sega Master System territories yes that's already with 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.570
 thick pack that used to be so very flat part 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.950
 Percent delivered here it's supposed to be Monica's picus needs 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.080
 Peetz it would be that it is the players of both books they still 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.889
 to the beginnings 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:21.019
 Then here we have Japanese enter the Atom Spiders 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.529
 Railway certification people 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:27.809
 he is especially from japanese report showing pictures alone with real time for 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:28.799
 me in training 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.720
 Percent develops that knows that he used to be a lot more often then a lot 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.869
 nice game for the victory capture Kosice divorce 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:40.059
 I really enjoyed playing 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.579
 percent 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.579
 then the Dragons got afloat for the Sega Dreamcast 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:49.059
 When did it all come to a collection today, then I have so a bit 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:50.310
 space problems 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.109
 The "Space Plane" would be Dream Cars for the Japanese winner 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.049
 Here always looks at the Japanese is there and the warrior Tornesch 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:03.579
 good for them during the current years, which of course would be the case with the 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:04.450
 German 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.299
 Tanja Biller Wulff 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.069
 Summer and the next game for Sega Saturn is too clear that is now 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.109
 Japanese food Japanese sticking game that was the price up 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.529
 Adhesive Timo still upgrade her 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:23.119
 St I have here a legend from the Crystals fine Fanta them »Volume 1 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.509
 videocassette 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:29.889
 of fine Fanta she »unfortunately does not contain ten players a video recorder 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:30.479
 from 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:34.750
 because Sebastian for the former SPOX 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.800
 with such a brook in which also musically can move 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.289
 then we hurt a corner here 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:43.750
 for swords have Sega 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.099
 40 years up 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.009
 but for the Sega Master System 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:51.809
 Since you could frolicking games manipulate percent of the original game 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:54.409
 and infinitely many and so on 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.430
 Walter Dangelmaier Jens for the PlayStation 1 very fancy 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:04.359
 He has a new 80 percent mark in the rating maybe leading to several CDs 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.469
 CeBIT ignited the way he himself I have a bit 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:12.309
 then played the first part that is here daily between 1 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:15.249
 also very stormy had watery diarrhea 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:19.669
 then GSC of Cain is also very clear that he is on the 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.000
 PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1 the series also 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.729
 December in Hamburg 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.280
 the Japanese version of the first part dedicated to the rebellion of the Halle 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:30.840
 Goal coach said clearly 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.040
 the latter was white but higher environment environment therefore word break point 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.289
 then it is for the plaintiff to decide RJ Berger 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.289
 You can not do much because you just have to stop at the right moment 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.819
 in the area here a devil finally the harder action 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.720
 because the money says Allianz I already have two for the more gags of the school 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.520
 for this the export 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.930
 then again we fell 4 8 percent here 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.210
 for the Sega Mega Drive is a fantastic player super 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.529
 Ballerspielen 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:03.750
 at 3 he was also class 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.650
 here you can see some of Keith for Damon our customers for what else 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.409
 was time 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.100
 Thon says for the winner 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.110
 and I can add it from 4 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.550
 get kind of packed 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.819
 why the Terminator now has no idea 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.720
 as further on 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.490
 Ears then here I have for Sega Saturn Source the King of Fighters 95 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.439
 the first time 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:30.699
 Collections Japanese league says Rump 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.460
 Without a small box there are also globe- would be a few little things 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.639
 then I have a kind of fighting for Neo Geo Limited Box 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.900
 Copper Corp. how much time I have left 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.029
 Bruno Hambüchen can clearly say what that brings 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:46.009
 but hard 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:50.009
 The drivers then play percent, Marxen said 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:54.710
 then I go to people place for Mainz it goes 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.580
 years at this collection 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.509
 which had the highest percent of PlayStation Network and Action there were several 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:04.250
 Things also looked like you can take care of the internet 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.839
 the one for the 7th 

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:10.829
 the ladies or something like my english is class Bocholt Bayern 

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:13.829

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.150
 of children first represent resin already for the PlayStation 2 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:26.659
 and I said something new before 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:28.760
 Herti 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.729
 Herald here 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:32.639
 also cares for something on the spot 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.590
 It is already known that the suburban train but it is also more than 50 percent 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.870
 there the last wishes I also here we see for example times an original 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.300
 he is Sega 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.720
 Here you could make Percent Sega Mega Drive games that's one of those 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.119
 bag 

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:51.929
 which we were able to sell for leaders every ten d-mark at that time 

00:06:51.929 --> 00:06:52.960
 sold out 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.210
 the dam was a multi here 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.210
 Keith percent six small adapters for the Sega Saturn 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:03.530
 that was content of several tests could connect and promptly laced 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.649
 Of course, should something Japanese 

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:11.329
 that's anyway for Porsche Boxter so I had detained them before 

00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:13.919
 stopped around 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:18.680
 Time is practically dead right now, especially since the city is not that cute 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.040
 and in there he is practically a son 

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.210
 the books a DVD 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.819
 and yet such an additional module for the Sega Saturn and all that a bit 

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:27.870
 to make faster 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.330
 it should be both 5% firmer the star at least so judges 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.370
 but better shown the same thing again the true goal says Meinel 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.659
 New arrivals will now be a corpse or bring 

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:43.779
