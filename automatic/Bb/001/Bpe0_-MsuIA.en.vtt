well<00:01:36.950> now<00:01:37.950> if<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.220> was<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> tool<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.180> were

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
well now if this was a tool that we were

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.480 
well now if this was a tool that we were
really<00:01:39.689> familiar<00:01:40.380> with<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.100> been<00:01:41.250> using

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
really familiar with we have been using

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.429 
really familiar with we have been using
like<00:01:41.790> red<00:01:42.030> snow<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.540> instance<00:01:42.930> then<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.229> would

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
like red snow for instance then I would

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.230 
like red snow for instance then I would
skip<00:01:43.560> past<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.250> lot<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.520> these<00:01:44.610> reboots<00:01:45.090> and

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
skip past a lot of these reboots and

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.760 
skip past a lot of these reboots and
things<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.659> just<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.140> save<00:01:46.380> your<00:01:46.560> time

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
things like that just to save your time

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.530 
things like that just to save your time
but<00:01:47.009> since<00:01:47.189> we're<00:01:47.369> not<00:01:47.549> very<00:01:47.970> familiar<00:01:48.180> with

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
but since we're not very familiar with

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.690 
but since we're not very familiar with
this<00:01:48.869> tool<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.380> felt<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.950> was<00:01:50.040> probably<00:01:50.369> best<00:01:50.610> to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
this tool I felt it was probably best to

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.550 
this tool I felt it was probably best to

some of the stuff I may you know speed
up<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.200> little<00:01:55.229> bit<00:01:55.680> but<00:01:56.219> for<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.460> most<00:01:56.640> part

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729

you're<00:01:57.000> going<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.240> see<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.509> jailbreak<00:01:58.170> in

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
you're going to see this jailbreak in

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.130 
you're going to see this jailbreak in

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
its entirety from start to finish so now

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.429 
its entirety from start to finish so now
it's<00:02:01.290> waiting<00:02:01.649> for<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.950> device<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.250> reboot<00:02:02.850> it

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
it's waiting for the device to reboot it

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.050 
it's waiting for the device to reboot it
shouldn't<00:02:04.439> take<00:02:04.500> too<00:02:04.619> much<00:02:04.860> longer<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.700> an

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
the device to be ready so we should be

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.780 
the device to be ready so we should be
almost<00:02:10.020> there<00:02:10.530> there<00:02:10.800> we<00:02:10.890> go<00:02:11.039> back<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.580> our

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
almost there there we go back to our

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.850 
almost there there we go back to our

injecting jailbreak data stage 3 and
that's<00:03:44.129> pretty<00:03:44.370> much<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.930> step<00:03:45.930> 10<00:03:46.319> so<00:03:47.129> now<00:03:47.310> the

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
that's pretty much it step 10 so now the

evasion tool should show a done message

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.649 
evasion tool should show a done message
and<00:03:49.979> then<00:03:50.190> your<00:03:50.400> device<00:03:50.669> will<00:03:50.879> reboot<00:03:50.940> as<00:03:51.510> you

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
and then your device will reboot as you

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.530 
and then your device will reboot as you
see<00:03:51.870> in<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.109> bottom<00:03:52.260> right<00:03:52.620> hand<00:03:52.650> corner<00:03:52.889> and

it's<00:03:54.540> still<00:03:54.780> rebooting<00:03:55.139> you<00:03:55.409> can<00:03:55.530> actually

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
it's still rebooting you can actually

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.559 
it's still rebooting you can actually

close out of the evasion tool now we're

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.599 
close out of the evasion tool now we're
completely<00:03:57.959> done<00:03:58.229> with<00:03:58.440> it<00:03:58.620> then<00:03:59.340> we<00:03:59.430> just

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
completely done with it then we just

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.610 
completely done with it then we just
need<00:03:59.849> a<00:03:59.879> wait<00:04:00.120> for<00:04:00.389> our<00:04:00.510> device<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:01.109> finish<00:04:01.440> up

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620
