the<00:05:14.550> pinnacle<00:05:15.590> and<00:05:16.590> I<00:05:16.680> think<00:05:16.740> that<00:05:16.950> connection

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
the pinnacle and I think that connection

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.290 
the pinnacle and I think that connection
with<00:05:18.750> people<00:05:19.200> is<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:20.610> probably<00:05:20.970> the<00:05:21.030> coolest

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
with people is the probably the coolest

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.330 
with people is the probably the coolest
thing<00:05:21.600> about<00:05:21.630> this<00:05:22.080> both<00:05:22.710> artists<00:05:23.190> and

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
thing about this both artists and

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.969 
thing about this both artists and
patients<00:05:23.970> and<00:05:24.810> that's<00:05:25.050> what<00:05:25.260> makes<00:05:25.440> us<00:05:25.620> just

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
patients and that's what makes us just

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.330 
patients and that's what makes us just
the<00:05:26.130> coolest<00:05:26.310> thing<00:05:26.669> going

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.210
