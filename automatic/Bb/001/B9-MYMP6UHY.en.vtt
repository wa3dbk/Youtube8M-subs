00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.480
 let's talk about when it takes the 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.480
 hamster to the vet 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.120
 Well, we'll start talking about the 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.340
 digestive problems of hamsters that 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.350
 undoubtedly they are the most common in 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.359
 particularly the diarrheas diarrheas are 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.420
 very common and very serious in hamsters and 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:21.640
 caused by many different factors 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.460
 among which we can highlight for example 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.570
 the parasites is very important 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.589
 deworm these animals that the 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.390
 people believe that animals 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:30.460
 tiny little rodents these are not 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.770
 they need to get dewormed and it's not like that 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.020
 of course they need and also with 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.239
 frequency on the other hand happens to us in 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.789
 the deviations is the alterations of the 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.039
 intestinal flora that are due to 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.230
 feed changes 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.690
 to a very important stress abrupt 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.579
 It is also very common and can end 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.309
 unchaining what we call with the 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.690
 moisture that is such a profuse diarrhea and 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.190
 so liquid that it is called with moisture 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.739
 because really what we see in the 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.269
 animal is that it has wet tail 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.980
 I will give an example so that 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.030
 You can see that I brought an animal from 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.030
 who is affected by this problem 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.400
 It is very important that every day 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.650
 let's look at the physical condition of 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.140
 your animal and that in particular 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.230
 look at the area around the anus 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.510
 because this diarrhea so liquid is with 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.510
 the humidity of the hamster can make 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:27.520
 in a few hours the animal gets dehydrated 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:31.540
 decompensate and also that its end be 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.680
 very serious then as soon as possible in the 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.330
 If you see that you have diarrhea 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.760
 let's hydrate it, you can take a 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.590
 syringe and force her to drink water and 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.780
 You also have the products that 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.660
 you can use as are the digestive flora 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.600
 or the vital serum these cuny products 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.370
 peak cause the flora to be restored 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.710
 intestinal as soon as possible and that the animal 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.500
 hydrate and post the ions he has 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.540
 lost as soon as possible second and 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.479
 in order of importance they can be highlighted 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.340
 pneumonias and respiratory processes 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.000
 it is very common to find hamsters with 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.450
 problems of conjunctivitis rhinitis 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.640
 and pneumonia in general by conditions 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.070
 environmental ie environments 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.260
 too loaded too cold or 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.540
 too hot for very hot environments 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.640
 initiated and very closed also though 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.310
 it's true that hamsters hold up well 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.980
 the cold weather conditions is very 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.260
 important to control that these these 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.610
 climatic changes are not abrupt is 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.040
 to say that we do not move from heat to cold 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.709
 quickly especially when we ventilate 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.560
 a room for example in winter 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.209
 as well as also control the quality 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.310
 of the soil that we put on them is very 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.560
 important to put newspaper 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.590
 pressed and also put a shelter like 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.860
 you see hay here where the animals are 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.530
 they can shelter and they can wrap themselves 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.300
 they like to make their nest with fibers 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.459
 of vegetable origin such as hay that 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.320
 besides, by the way, the hay goes very well 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.840
 for the conditions that we have talked about 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.840
 before the diarrheas the hay controls 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.240
 very well the digestive processes and that 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.580
 fiber will make the animal 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.800
 It is of better quality and more 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.080
 consistency and finally I'm going to 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.000
 talk about another common problem of the 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.330
 cutaneous problems the problems of the 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.190
 skin alopecias wounds and others that are 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.440
 very frequent, particularly in 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.750
 hamsters so much for external parasites is 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.910
 very important I insist on deworming 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.470
 both externally and internally to 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.690
 your animals that live at home do not 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.910
 for being little we must leave 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.310
 do the external parasites in 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.770
 The mites give many problems 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.470
 of ears and skin in rodents and in 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.590
 hamsters in particular and also also 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.680
 If you have several good fights 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.690
 among them also originates that they have 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.030
 many lacerations and many wounds in 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.980
 the skin are frequent fungi and 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.930
 It is also very common in environments that 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.020
 they are not very clean, that's why the cage 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.910
 the hamster should be cleaned 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.920
 practically every week and also it 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.750
 should check every day and the animal 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.730
 in particular every day because the 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.250
 tiny animals can get sick 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.350
 very fast and when we go to see him 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.280
 let's try to catch him and check him 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.280
 all over
