this is the zombie apocalypse so
therefore<00:01:44.579> you'll<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.970> clear<00:01:45.360> out

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
therefore you'll have to clear out

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.270 
therefore you'll have to clear out
zombies<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.530> you're<00:01:46.649> gonna<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.130> that

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
zombies and you're gonna have to do that

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.130 
zombies and you're gonna have to do that
through<00:01:47.490> some<00:01:47.670> very<00:01:47.909> visceral<00:01:48.479> combat<00:01:48.960> where

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
through some very visceral combat where

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.960 
through some very visceral combat where
you're<00:01:49.560> rolling<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> better

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
you're rolling and you have a better

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.819 
you're rolling and you have a better
chance<00:01:51.090> by<00:01:51.600> rolling<00:01:52.049> for<00:01:52.259> five<00:01:52.409> or<00:01:52.560> six<00:01:52.590> of

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
chance by rolling for five or six of

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.679 
chance by rolling for five or six of
killing<00:01:53.130> zombies<00:01:53.549> but<00:01:54.030> if<00:01:54.119> any<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.390> them<00:01:54.600> are

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
killing zombies but if any of them are

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.510 
killing zombies but if any of them are
left<00:01:54.930> they're<00:01:55.500> gonna<00:01:55.649> try<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.950> kill<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.369> as

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
left they're gonna try to kill you as

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.280 
left they're gonna try to kill you as
well<00:01:56.670> because<00:01:56.820> that's<00:01:57.450> what<00:01:57.719> zombies<00:01:57.930> do

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
well because that's what zombies do

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.139 
well because that's what zombies do

they're the unending horde and out of

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.300 
they're the unending horde and out of
five<00:02:00.299> or<00:02:00.479> six<00:02:00.659> or<00:02:00.810> even<00:02:00.840> kill<00:02:01.170> your<00:02:01.649> survivors

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
now mechanically speaking the game is

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.499 
now mechanically speaking the game is
going<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.740> 1<00:02:04.950> by<00:02:05.369> victory<00:02:06.000> points<00:02:06.390> and

going to be 1 by victory points and

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.090 
going to be 1 by victory points and
victory<00:02:06.719> points<00:02:06.990> can<00:02:07.140> be<00:02:07.229> from<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.770> number<00:02:08.070> of

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
victory points can be from the number of

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.499 
victory points can be from the number of
survivors<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.850> have<00:02:08.970> left<00:02:09.149> at<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.329> end<00:02:09.450> of

the game the buildings that you have

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.580 
the game the buildings that you have
control<00:02:12.120> over<00:02:12.480> every<00:02:12.810> tile<00:02:13.079> is<00:02:13.260> going<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.470> have

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
control over every tile is going to have

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.199 
control over every tile is going to have
different<00:02:14.220> stats<00:02:14.430> on<00:02:14.640> them<00:02:14.790> one<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.090> those

different stats on them one of those

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.900 
different stats on them one of those
stats<00:02:15.390> are<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.959> victory<00:02:16.350> points<00:02:16.769> that<00:02:17.340> the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
stats are the victory points that the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.170 
stats are the victory points that the
tile<00:02:18.120> will<00:02:18.299> be<00:02:18.360> worth<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.750> other<00:02:18.900> stats<00:02:19.230> are

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
tile will be worth the other stats are

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.900 
tile will be worth the other stats are
how<00:02:21.180> many<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:22.530> scavenging<00:02:23.280> cards<00:02:23.669> you<00:02:23.760> might

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
how many the scavenging cards you might

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.000 
how many the scavenging cards you might
find<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.570> things<00:02:25.019> like<00:02:25.199> that<00:02:25.260> and

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
how many action points it takes to

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.839 
how many action points it takes to
actually<00:02:27.599> plant<00:02:28.080> your<00:02:28.260> flag<00:02:28.530> there<00:02:28.920> but<00:02:29.700> how

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
actually plant your flag there but how

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.179 
actually plant your flag there but how
the<00:02:29.909> game<00:02:30.209> actually<00:02:30.450> ends<00:02:31.439> is<00:02:31.620> actually

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
the game actually ends is actually

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:33.559 
the game actually ends is actually
different<00:02:32.579> there's<00:02:32.700> several<00:02:33.120> different<00:02:33.269> ways

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
different there's several different ways

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.789 
different there's several different ways
that<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.720> game<00:02:33.840> can<00:02:33.989> and<00:02:34.170> one<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.379> them<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.650> if

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
that the game can and one of them is if

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.339 
that the game can and one of them is if
you<00:02:35.280> find<00:02:35.579> the<00:02:35.879> medical<00:02:36.360> facility<00:02:36.810> tile<00:02:37.049> and

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
you find the medical facility tile and

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.140 
you find the medical facility tile and
somebody<00:02:37.799> actually<00:02:38.010> takes<00:02:38.579> control<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.970> it

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
somebody actually takes control of it

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.119 
somebody actually takes control of it
plants<00:02:39.480> are<00:02:39.569> flagged<00:02:39.840> there<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.590> represents

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
plants are flagged there that represents

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.190 
plants are flagged there that represents
a<00:02:41.250> cure<00:02:41.730> being<00:02:41.970> found<00:02:42.239> for<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.690> zombie<00:02:43.019> virus

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
a cure being found for the zombie virus

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.649 
a cure being found for the zombie virus
so<00:02:43.620> no<00:02:44.310> more<00:02:44.519> war<00:02:44.760> everyone<00:02:45.150> is<00:02:45.299> kind<00:02:45.420> of<00:02:45.540> at

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
so no more war everyone is kind of at

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.149 
so no more war everyone is kind of at
peace<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.140> pick<00:02:46.530> through<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.769> rubble<00:02:47.040> and

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
peace you pick through the rubble and

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.850 
peace you pick through the rubble and
try<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.430> rebuild<00:02:48.269> but<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.690> course<00:02:48.959> one<00:02:49.379> faction

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.050 
try to rebuild but of course one faction
is<00:02:49.950> going<00:02:50.099> to<00:02:50.190> be<00:02:50.250> more<00:02:50.370> powerful<00:02:50.819> than<00:02:50.940> the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
is going to be more powerful than the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.110 
is going to be more powerful than the
rest<00:02:51.390> in<00:02:51.659> this<00:02:52.200> brave<00:02:52.620> new<00:02:52.650> world<00:02:52.970> another<00:02:53.970> way

rest in this brave new world another way
that<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.390> game<00:02:54.540> could<00:02:54.720> end<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.019> the

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
that the game could end is that the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.500 
that the game could end is that the
military<00:02:55.709> base<00:02:56.040> is<00:02:56.280> found<00:02:56.549> in<00:02:56.790> someone<00:02:57.209> claims

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
military base is found in someone claims

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.440 
military base is found in someone claims
that<00:02:57.959> whoever<00:02:58.590> has<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.890> most<00:02:59.010> guns<00:02:59.459> is<00:02:59.879> going

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
that whoever has the most guns is going

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.839 
that whoever has the most guns is going
to<00:03:00.540> have<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.720> significant<00:03:01.650> edge<00:03:01.859> in<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.700> new

to have a significant edge in the new
world<00:03:03.150> so<00:03:03.569> at<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:04.230> point<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.709> game<00:03:04.829> end<00:03:05.099> is

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
world so at that point the game end is

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.849 
world so at that point the game end is
going<00:03:05.579> to<00:03:05.639> be<00:03:05.730> triggered<00:03:06.049> also<00:03:07.049> some<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.769> the

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
going to be triggered also some of the

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.710 
going to be triggered also some of the
tiles<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:08.519> find<00:03:08.879> throughout<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.480> game

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
tiles that you find throughout the game

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.740 
tiles that you find throughout the game
are<00:03:09.959> actually<00:03:10.349> farming<00:03:11.159> tiles<00:03:11.639> because<00:03:12.060> in<00:03:12.510> a

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
are actually farming tiles because in a

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.509 
are actually farming tiles because in a
zombie<00:03:12.840> apocalypse<00:03:13.079> if<00:03:13.530> we<00:03:13.650> can<00:03:14.010> be<00:03:14.159> kind<00:03:14.430> of

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
zombie apocalypse if we can be kind of

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.789 
zombie apocalypse if we can be kind of
hard<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.940> find<00:03:15.510> food<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.409> if<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.590> can<00:03:16.709> actually

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
hard to find food so if you can actually

food you might eat them because as we've

post-apocalyptic world

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.920 
post-apocalyptic world
cannibalism<00:04:59.130> can<00:04:59.550> be<00:04:59.760> a<00:04:59.790> thing<00:05:00.270> so<00:05:00.570> that's

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
cannibalism can be a thing so that's

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.630 
cannibalism can be a thing so that's

control<00:05:09.780> and<00:05:09.990> combat<00:05:10.500> you<00:05:11.070> add<00:05:11.250> that<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:11.730> a

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
control and combat you add that to a

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.730 
control and combat you add that to a
game<00:05:12.090> that<00:05:12.120> has<00:05:12.480> very<00:05:12.810> interesting<00:05:13.110> tiles

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
game that has very interesting tiles

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.320 
game that has very interesting tiles
because<00:05:13.890> it<00:05:14.100> has<00:05:14.220> this<00:05:14.430> sort<00:05:14.910> of<00:05:15.030> digital

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
because it has this sort of digital

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.530 
because it has this sort of digital
pixelated<00:05:16.320> art<00:05:16.560> style<00:05:16.920> that<00:05:17.250> is<00:05:18.060> done<00:05:18.270> in<00:05:18.390> such

pixelated art style that is done in such

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.870 
pixelated art style that is done in such
a<00:05:18.570> way<00:05:18.750> that<00:05:18.960> it<00:05:19.050> gives<00:05:19.140> a<00:05:19.350> better<00:05:20.310> idea<00:05:20.730> of<00:05:20.790> a

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
a way that it gives a better idea of a

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.580 
a way that it gives a better idea of a
broader<00:05:21.120> scope<00:05:21.450> of<00:05:21.630> how<00:05:21.780> big<00:05:22.080> the<00:05:22.230> city<00:05:22.380> is

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
broader scope of how big the city is

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.800 
broader scope of how big the city is
because<00:05:22.890> every<00:05:23.280> tile<00:05:23.490> has<00:05:23.940> this<00:05:24.120> big<00:05:24.450> ornate

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
because every tile has this big ornate

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.530 
because every tile has this big ornate
building<00:05:25.200> on<00:05:25.320> it<00:05:25.440> with<00:05:25.530> a<00:05:25.560> lot<00:05:25.830> going<00:05:26.280> on

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
building on it with a lot going on

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.090 
building on it with a lot going on
together<00:05:27.540> with<00:05:27.750> that<00:05:27.960> and<00:05:28.320> with<00:05:28.440> the<00:05:28.620> flags

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
together with that and with the flags

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.280 
together with that and with the flags
and<00:05:29.580> with<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.180> cubes<00:05:30.510> it<00:05:30.660> really<00:05:30.960> gives<00:05:31.140> a

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
and with the cubes it really gives a

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.550 
and with the cubes it really gives a
sense<00:05:31.530> of<00:05:31.800> both<00:05:32.010> a<00:05:32.810> euro<00:05:33.810> game<00:05:34.110> but<00:05:34.380> with<00:05:34.530> a

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
sense of both a euro game but with a

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.890 
sense of both a euro game but with a
thematic<00:05:35.070> a<00:05:35.640> Meritage<00:05:36.120> game<00:05:36.420> at<00:05:36.630> the<00:05:36.750> same

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
thematic a Meritage game at the same

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.250 
thematic a Meritage game at the same
time<00:05:37.170> it<00:05:37.290> sort<00:05:37.410> of<00:05:37.500> blends<00:05:37.800> these<00:05:38.370> different

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
time it sort of blends these different

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.700 
time it sort of blends these different
gaming<00:05:40.340> ideas<00:05:41.340> together<00:05:41.580> into<00:05:42.270> one<00:05:42.930> hybrid<00:05:43.290> so

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
gaming ideas together into one hybrid so

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.990 
gaming ideas together into one hybrid so
I<00:05:43.740> think<00:05:43.920> that<00:05:44.250> it's<00:05:44.340> going<00:05:44.460> to<00:05:44.640> appeal<00:05:44.970> to

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
I think that it's going to appeal to

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.940 
I think that it's going to appeal to
people<00:05:45.390> who<00:05:45.720> like<00:05:45.930> both<00:05:46.260> of<00:05:46.470> those<00:05:46.560> types<00:05:46.830> of

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
people who like both of those types of

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.940 
people who like both of those types of
games<00:05:47.190> a<00:05:47.370> deeply<00:05:47.940> strategic<00:05:48.570> area<00:05:49.470> control

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
games a deeply strategic area control

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.460 
games a deeply strategic area control
trying<00:05:50.460> to<00:05:50.760> out<00:05:51.300> think<00:05:51.660> your<00:05:51.780> opponent<00:05:51.990> taking

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
trying to out think your opponent taking

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.410 
trying to out think your opponent taking
different<00:05:52.890> areas<00:05:53.460> and<00:05:53.820> gaining<00:05:54.120> the<00:05:54.210> most

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
different areas and gaining the most

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.570 
different areas and gaining the most
resources<00:05:54.930> possible<00:05:55.590> well<00:05:55.950> at<00:05:56.040> the<00:05:56.130> same<00:05:56.340> time

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
resources possible well at the same time

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.310 
resources possible well at the same time
you're<00:05:57.180> killing<00:05:57.570> zombies<00:05:58.020> and<00:05:58.200> that's

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
you're killing zombies and that's

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.140 
you're killing zombies and that's
definitely<00:05:58.740> going<00:05:58.920> to<00:05:58.950> appeal<00:05:59.310> to<00:05:59.460> a<00:05:59.490> large

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
definitely going to appeal to a large

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.600 
definitely going to appeal to a large
segment<00:06:00.630> of<00:06:01.020> the<00:06:01.530> gaming<00:06:01.890> population<00:06:02.070> we've

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
segment of the gaming population we've

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.130 
segment of the gaming population we've
seen<00:06:02.880> that<00:06:03.030> the<00:06:03.210> zombie<00:06:03.510> trend<00:06:03.750> just<00:06:03.900> is<00:06:04.020> not

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
seen that the zombie trend just is not

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.930 
seen that the zombie trend just is not
dying<00:06:04.470> down<00:06:04.680> it's<00:06:04.920> been<00:06:05.070> a<00:06:05.100> huge<00:06:05.430> thing<00:06:05.460> and

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
dying down it's been a huge thing and

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.600 
dying down it's been a huge thing and
but<00:06:06.840> but<00:06:07.290> you<00:06:07.440> do<00:06:07.620> stand<00:06:07.890> up<00:06:08.010> and<00:06:08.160> take<00:06:08.280> note

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
but but you do stand up and take note

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.270 
but but you do stand up and take note
when<00:06:09.240> a<00:06:09.270> game<00:06:09.570> takes<00:06:09.960> that<00:06:10.200> zombie<00:06:10.800> theme<00:06:11.070> and

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
when a game takes that zombie theme and

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.820 
when a game takes that zombie theme and
does<00:06:11.550> it<00:06:11.730> in<00:06:11.850> a<00:06:12.180> unique<00:06:12.600> and<00:06:12.750> interesting<00:06:13.380> way

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
does it in a unique and interesting way

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.580 
does it in a unique and interesting way
and<00:06:13.860> I<00:06:14.190> think<00:06:14.580> that<00:06:14.790> that's<00:06:14.940> where<00:06:15.590> surviving

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
and I think that that's where surviving

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.160 
and I think that that's where surviving
one<00:06:16.950> month<00:06:17.220> in<00:06:17.550> is<00:06:17.790> going<00:06:18.090> to<00:06:18.240> lie<00:06:18.480> a<00:06:18.510> lot<00:06:19.050> of

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.170 
one month in is going to lie a lot of

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.970 
one month in is going to lie a lot of
people<00:06:19.440> are<00:06:19.620> going<00:06:19.860> to<00:06:20.040> want<00:06:20.850> to<00:06:21.300> a<00:06:22.050> play<00:06:22.590> game

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
people are going to want to a play game

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.070 
people are going to want to a play game
that<00:06:23.460> is<00:06:23.580> just<00:06:23.760> taking<00:06:23.970> that<00:06:24.240> whole<00:06:24.450> genre<00:06:24.480> and

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
that is just taking that whole genre and

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.810 
that is just taking that whole genre and
putting<00:06:25.290> it<00:06:25.350> on<00:06:25.410> its<00:06:25.560> head<00:06:25.620> and<00:06:25.890> doing<00:06:26.250> it<00:06:26.490> in<00:06:26.640> a

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
putting it on its head and doing it in a

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.880 
putting it on its head and doing it in a
fresh<00:06:27.390> way<00:06:27.900> and<00:06:28.380> if<00:06:28.470> you're<00:06:28.590> one<00:06:28.740> of<00:06:28.830> those

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
fresh way and if you're one of those

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.440 
fresh way and if you're one of those
people<00:06:29.190> if<00:06:29.340> you<00:06:29.430> like<00:06:29.640> what<00:06:29.820> you<00:06:29.940> saw<00:06:30.150> do<00:06:30.390> you

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450 
people if you like what you saw do you

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.360 
people if you like what you saw do you
think<00:06:30.630> that<00:06:30.860> surviving<00:06:31.860> is<00:06:31.980> something<00:06:32.250> that

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
think that surviving is something that

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.010 
think that surviving is something that
you<00:06:32.520> might<00:06:32.670> enjoy<00:06:32.850> I<00:06:33.270> would<00:06:33.420> encourage<00:06:33.690> you<00:06:33.900> to

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
you might enjoy I would encourage you to
