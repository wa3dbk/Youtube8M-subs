00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:09.320
 well we started very well we did a very 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.660
 good start already we were in the 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.539
 tenth position and unfortunately 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.600
 I was losing control and he hit me in the 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:20.150
 curve 38 rear millÃ¡n I had to give 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.800
 all around and we lost all the progress 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.770
 that we have merged the compound 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.890
 hard and fortunately came to the 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.140
 mean I do not go back many 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.870
 positions 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.910
 and then we had some problems with the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:43.629
 engine with the power and I could not move to 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.629
 subtle and I was stuck with the most d 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.030
 67 laps and that's what he got 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.199
 our our career also because 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.850
 we had more than 2 seconds per round 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:59.120
 then it was quite frustrating that 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.530
 not that we could not come back more 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.399
 we could enter the points we 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.009
 we are outside and then there is no more 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:09.590
 more than thinking about malaysia and thinking about 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.610
 the points as you have seen the race is 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.030
 a little after having done the tests 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.800
 that now suddenly you see yourself in career 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.290
 how have you seen the car the 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.570
 behavior the handling of all 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.890
 commanders already in the race with attention 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.900
 own competition well I think 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.670
 that well and unfortunately with the 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.650
 rating that we had yesterday is always 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.630
 complicated and this is very 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.400
 it is very feasible that this kind of thing 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.690
 happen to you as happened to us today what 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.060
 problems of other pilots ruin your 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.579
 career and that's how it was today 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.530
 but good and think about the future think 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.680
 in the next race take out the positive 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.479
 of that I think there's enough 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.970
 information and quite learning from 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.009
 this race to go to malaysia with 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.049
 a lot of confidence that we have to enter 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.909
 in the points on the net later malaysia the 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.580
 Mercedes engine can be an advantage with 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.910
 compared to other competitors yes I think 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.910
 that can be a good difference not 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.010
 and especially in the race for 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.930
 Mercedes engines can be more 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.930
 competitive than others
