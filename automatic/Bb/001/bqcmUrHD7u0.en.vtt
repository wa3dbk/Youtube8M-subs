00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
on my arms which go 360 and the waist

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.700 
on my arms which go 360 and the waist
which<00:00:59.969> go<00:01:00.149> 360<00:01:02.989> now<00:01:04.760> if<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.939> make<00:01:06.210> mine<00:01:06.710> stand

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
which go 360 now if you make mine stand

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.500 
which go 360 now if you make mine stand
the<00:01:07.950> wrong<00:01:08.100> way<00:01:08.310> he<00:01:08.610> sometimes<00:01:09.030> has<00:01:09.240> an<00:01:09.390> issue

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the wrong way he sometimes has an issue

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.880 
the wrong way he sometimes has an issue
of<00:01:09.720> falling<00:01:10.320> but<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.770> fixed<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.760> hopefully

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
of falling but I fixed that hopefully

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.469 
of falling but I fixed that hopefully
now<00:01:13.890> anyway<00:01:14.340> why<00:01:14.760> don't<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:14.970> go<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.180> size

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
now anyway why don't we go to size

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.289 
now anyway why don't we go to size
comparisons<00:01:16.880> let's<00:01:17.880> start<00:01:18.119> off<00:01:18.270> with

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
comparisons let's start off with

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.730 
comparisons let's start off with
monsters<00:01:18.930> he<00:01:19.110> fought<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> original

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
monsters he fought in the original

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.060 
monsters he fought in the original
Ultraman<00:01:20.520> sugary<00:01:20.850> stuff<00:01:21.619> for<00:01:22.619> starters

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
Ultraman sugary stuff for starters

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.590 
Ultraman sugary stuff for starters
here's<00:01:23.659> Gomorrah<00:01:28.820> I<00:01:29.820> would<00:01:30.119> say<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.540> is

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
here's Gomorrah I would say this is

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.130 
here's Gomorrah I would say this is
pretty<00:01:31.140> accurate<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:32.509> mean<00:01:33.509> I've<00:01:33.659> seen<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
pretty accurate I mean I've seen the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.690 
pretty accurate I mean I've seen the
battle<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.920> couldn't<00:01:35.340> tell<00:01:35.490> who<00:01:35.670> was

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
battle but I couldn't tell who was

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.490 
battle but I couldn't tell who was
taller<00:01:36.150> because<00:01:36.450> those<00:01:36.900> two<00:01:37.079> were<00:01:37.200> mostly

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
taller because those two were mostly

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.109 
taller because those two were mostly
grappling<00:01:38.130> with<00:01:38.280> each<00:01:38.400> other<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.759> doing<00:01:38.939> each

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
grappling with each other and doing each

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.080 
grappling with each other and doing each
other<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> ground<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:40.710> i<00:01:41.070> would<00:01:41.939> think

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
other on the ground but i would think

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.950 
other on the ground but i would think
maybe<00:01:42.360> like<00:01:42.570> up<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.780> here<00:01:43.189> but<00:01:44.390> that's<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.689> me

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
maybe like up to here but that's just me

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.160 
maybe like up to here but that's just me
and<00:01:48.079> another<00:01:49.079> monster<00:01:50.360> who<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.540> he<00:01:51.930> fought

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
and another monster who the he fought

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.700 
and another monster who the he fought
twice<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> series<00:01:54.079> easily<00:01:55.079> defeated<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
twice in the series easily defeated the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.039 
twice in the series easily defeated the
first<00:01:55.950> time<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:57.000> second<00:01:57.420> time<00:01:57.450> had<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> little

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
first time the second time had a little

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:06.390 
first time the second time had a little
bit<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.229> trouble<00:01:58.680> it's<00:02:01.369> red<00:02:02.369> king

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.260 

I<00:02:08.979> would<00:02:09.979> say<00:02:10.190> this<00:02:10.399> is<00:02:10.460> pretty<00:02:11.000> accurate

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
I would say this is pretty accurate

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.370 
I would say this is pretty accurate
because<00:02:12.230> Red<00:02:13.100> King<00:02:13.370> was<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.970> not<00:02:14.600> taller<00:02:15.080> than

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
because Red King was a not taller than

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.040 
because Red King was a not taller than
Ultraman<00:02:15.860> or<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:16.220> same<00:02:16.400> size<00:02:16.670> i<00:02:16.940> forgot<00:02:17.390> half

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
Ultraman or the same size i forgot half

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.800 
Ultraman or the same size i forgot half
goes<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.500> what<00:02:19.370> makes<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.090> good<00:02:20.240> pairing<00:02:22.810> now

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
goes to what makes a good pairing now

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.600 
goes to what makes a good pairing now
I'm<00:02:24.050> going<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.260> compare<00:02:24.590> him<00:02:24.740> with<00:02:27.310> someone<00:02:28.310> he

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
I'm going to compare him with someone he

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.100 
I'm going to compare him with someone he
fought<00:02:28.880> in<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.150> ultra<00:02:29.570> galaxy<00:02:30.080> legends<00:02:30.470> movie

Ultraman be Lyle George Eli looks very
huge<00:02:40.400> compared<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:40.970> Ultraman<00:02:42.250> not<00:02:43.250> only<00:02:43.520> that

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
huge compared to Ultraman not only that

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.260

but I intend to get it later on in the
future<00:02:59.440> now<00:03:00.440> before<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.630> size<00:03:02.630> him<00:03:02.840> up<00:03:02.930> with

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
future now before I size him up with

Godzilla<00:03:03.680> I'm<00:03:04.280> gonna<00:03:04.430> try<00:03:04.640> out<00:03:04.940> yeah<00:03:10.120> this

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
Godzilla I'm gonna try out yeah this

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.350 
Godzilla I'm gonna try out yeah this
isn't<00:03:11.330> very<00:03:12.019> accurate<00:03:12.170> because<00:03:12.890> it<00:03:13.880> was<00:03:14.060> told

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
isn't very accurate because it was told

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.449 
isn't very accurate because it was told
that<00:03:14.630> gamera<00:03:15.080> was<00:03:15.290> supposed<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.650> be<00:03:15.739> 60<00:03:16.100> meters

that gamera was supposed to be 60 meters

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.710 
that gamera was supposed to be 60 meters
so<00:03:16.700> he'd<00:03:16.910> be<00:03:17.060> like<00:03:17.239> update<00:03:18.230> like<00:03:19.480> here<00:03:20.480> to

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
the final wars Godzilla this is way off

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.580 
the final wars Godzilla this is way off
because<00:04:14.550> the<00:04:15.550> final<00:04:15.940> wars<00:04:16.150> Godzilla<00:04:16.690> isn't

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
because the final wars Godzilla isn't

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.190 
because the final wars Godzilla isn't
supposed<00:04:17.950> to<00:04:18.010> be<00:04:18.160> shorter<00:04:19.000> than<00:04:19.209> ultraman

even all those two never met Ultraman is

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.510 
even all those two never met Ultraman is
too<00:04:24.160> tall<00:04:24.370> so<00:04:25.140> basically<00:04:26.140> this<00:04:27.010> doesn't<00:04:27.430> work

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
too tall so basically this doesn't work

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.680

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
Godzilla which probably is bigger than

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.659 
Godzilla which probably is bigger than

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
poses more of a threat this one does

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.290 
poses more of a threat this one does
because<00:04:58.540> he's<00:04:59.200> a<00:04:59.229> lot<00:04:59.560> thicker<00:05:00.190> and<00:05:00.610> bigger
