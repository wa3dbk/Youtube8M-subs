00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
video is just going to be heavy

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.690 
video is just going to be heavy
speculation<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.260> might<00:01:04.769> be<00:01:04.920> totally<00:01:05.460> wrong

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
speculation I might be totally wrong

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.550 
speculation I might be totally wrong
they<00:01:05.939> might<00:01:06.150> do<00:01:06.330> something<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.020> can't

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
they might do something that I can't

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.859 
they might do something that I can't
even<00:01:07.860> imagine<00:01:08.390> something<00:01:09.390> that's<00:01:09.750> very

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
even imagine something that's very

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.350 
even imagine something that's very
common<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.710> bat<00:01:11.070> titles<00:01:11.610> at<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.880> moment<00:01:12.270> that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
common in bat titles at the moment that

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.270 
common in bat titles at the moment that
kind<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.750> was<00:01:12.900> very<00:01:13.110> common<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> 90s<00:01:14.159> as

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
kind of was very common in the 90s as

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.060 
kind of was very common in the 90s as
well<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.930> cover<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.680> comic

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
well is that the cover of the comic

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.490 
well is that the cover of the comic
doesn't<00:01:17.490> necessarily<00:01:18.330> reflect<00:01:18.840> what's<00:01:19.170> going

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
doesn't necessarily reflect what's going

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.499 
doesn't necessarily reflect what's going
to<00:01:19.650> happen<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> comic<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.970> example<00:01:21.420> in

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
to happen in the comic for example in

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.719 
to happen in the comic for example in
Batman<00:01:21.900> eternal<00:01:22.470> issue<00:01:22.680> number<00:01:23.159> three<00:01:23.460> or

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
Batman eternal issue number three or

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.499 
Batman eternal issue number three or
four<00:01:24.150> or<00:01:24.720> maybe<00:01:24.990> five<00:01:25.189> it<00:01:26.189> showed<00:01:26.520> Barbara<00:01:27.240> and

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
four or maybe five it showed Barbara and

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.950 
four or maybe five it showed Barbara and
Batman<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.619> fight<00:01:28.979> then<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.270> comic<00:01:30.659> it

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
Batman in a fight then in the comic it

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.450 
Batman in a fight then in the comic it
was<00:01:31.110> actually<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.890> Barbara<00:01:32.369> and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
was actually just that Barbara and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.950 
was actually just that Barbara and
Batman<00:01:32.880> we're<00:01:33.030> going<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.360> an<00:01:33.450> argument

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
Batman we're going to have an argument

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.289 
Batman we're going to have an argument
so<00:01:34.170> what<00:01:34.320> I'm<00:01:34.409> saying<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.890> at<00:01:35.130> most<00:01:35.579> take<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
so what I'm saying is at most take the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.330 
so what I'm saying is at most take the
cover<00:01:36.540> with<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> grain<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.200> salt<00:01:37.409> because<00:01:37.920> it

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
cover with a grain of salt because it

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.640 
cover with a grain of salt because it
might<00:01:38.520> be<00:01:38.700> totally<00:01:39.630> wrong<00:01:39.840> what<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.290> think<00:01:40.590> this

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
might be totally wrong what I think this

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.560 
might be totally wrong what I think this
cover<00:01:40.890> might<00:01:41.100> represent<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
cover might represent is that the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.630 
cover might represent is that the
bat-family<00:01:43.020> are<00:01:43.320> kind<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.799> shambles<00:01:44.490> at

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
bat-family are kind of in shambles at

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.190 
bat-family are kind of in shambles at
the<00:01:44.729> moment<00:01:45.060> these<00:01:45.270> three<00:01:45.600> characters<00:01:45.840> in

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
the moment these three characters in

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.080 
the moment these three characters in
particular<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:47.340> distanced<00:01:47.820> themselves

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
particular have distanced themselves

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.690 
particular have distanced themselves
from<00:01:48.450> Batman<00:01:49.049> more<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.890> more<00:01:50.100> as<00:01:50.340> time<00:01:50.369> has

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
from Batman more and more as time has

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.149 
from Batman more and more as time has
gone<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.899> think<00:01:52.290> what<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.560> issue<00:01:52.860> might

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
gone on I think what this issue might

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.190 
gone on I think what this issue might
serve<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.430> do<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.600> going<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.869> show

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
serve to do is that it's going to show

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.499 
serve to do is that it's going to show
Batman<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.920> these<00:01:56.100> characters<00:01:56.729> should<00:01:57.240> mean

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
Batman that these characters should mean

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.800 
Batman that these characters should mean
just<00:01:58.229> as<00:01:58.530> much<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.890> him<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.340> Robin<00:02:00.119> they<00:02:00.570> should

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
just as much to him as Robin they should

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.499 
just as much to him as Robin they should
not<00:02:00.990> be<00:02:01.110> treated<00:02:01.350> as<00:02:01.710> less<00:02:01.770> than<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.759> Robin<00:02:03.299> in

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
not be treated as less than a Robin in

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
his heart at the same time I'm thinking

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.730 
his heart at the same time I'm thinking
it's<00:02:06.299> going<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.540> show<00:02:06.750> these<00:02:06.960> characters<00:02:07.530> that

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740

Batman<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.330> father<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.869> them<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.649> they

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
Batman is like a father to them so they

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.400

couldn't<00:03:34.470> remember<00:03:34.740> how<00:03:35.010> long<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.670> was

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
couldn't remember how long and it was

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.790 
couldn't remember how long and it was
successful<00:03:35.910> from<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.780> beginning<00:03:37.290> right<00:03:37.560> to

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
successful from the beginning right to

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
the end so in my mind if they're not

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.810 
the end so in my mind if they're not
