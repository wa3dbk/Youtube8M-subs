00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.830 
came out a few years ago and it was a
good<00:02:55.590> concept<00:02:56.159> where<00:02:56.519> it<00:02:57.060> was<00:02:57.239> like<00:02:57.359> a<00:02:57.419> hundred

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
good concept where it was like a hundred

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.099 
good concept where it was like a hundred
people<00:02:58.019> first<00:02:58.829> 100<00:02:59.400> people<00:02:59.579> on<00:02:59.939> this<00:03:00.209> massive

helicopters more tanks more explosions

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.670 
helicopters more tanks more explosions
just<00:03:07.560> more<00:03:07.769> craziness<00:03:08.250> because<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.930> can<00:03:10.139> you

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
just more craziness because you can you

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.599 
just more craziness because you can you
can<00:03:10.859> actually<00:03:11.549> play<00:03:11.790> battlefield<00:03:12.510> without

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
like being on the ground you could just

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.649 
like being on the ground you could just
be<00:03:16.739> a<00:03:16.769> tanker<00:03:17.459> or<00:03:17.639> you<00:03:17.879> could<00:03:18.030> just<00:03:18.060> be<00:03:18.629> a

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 
be a tanker or you could just be a

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.990 
be a tanker or you could just be a
helicopter<00:03:19.139> pilot<00:03:19.500> or<00:03:20.069> a<00:03:20.099> gyp<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.879> know

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
helicopter pilot or a gyp you know

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.030 
helicopter pilot or a gyp you know
fighter<00:03:21.329> whatever<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:21.959> want<00:03:22.139> to<00:03:22.229> do<00:03:22.409> you<00:03:23.010> can

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
fighter whatever you want to do you can

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.180 
fighter whatever you want to do you can
do<00:03:23.370> it<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:23.699> it's<00:03:24.659> it's<00:03:25.229> fun<00:03:25.530> it's<00:03:25.829> a<00:03:25.979> lot<00:03:26.129> of

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
do it and it's it's fun it's a lot of

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.979 
do it and it's it's fun it's a lot of
fun<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.790> think<00:03:26.819> it<00:03:27.180> just<00:03:27.329> adds<00:03:27.510> another

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
fun and I think it just adds another

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.849 
fun and I think it just adds another
element<00:03:28.379> and<00:03:29.000> something<00:03:30.000> more<00:03:30.859> unpredictable

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
element and something more unpredictable

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.219
