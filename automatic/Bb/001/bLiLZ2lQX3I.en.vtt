the<00:01:51.479> center<00:01:51.950> of<00:01:53.060> this<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:56.040> second<00:01:56.399> type

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
the center of this and the second type

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.850 
the center of this and the second type
I'm<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:56.909> going<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.090> leave<00:01:57.240> alone<00:01:57.680> now<00:01:58.680> with

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
I'm just going to leave alone now with

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.760 
I'm just going to leave alone now with
this<00:01:58.979> jello<00:01:59.219> mix<00:01:59.520> I'm<00:01:59.670> just<00:01:59.790> going<00:01:59.909> to<00:01:59.939> pour<00:02:00.299> it

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
this jello mix I'm just going to pour it

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.889 
this jello mix I'm just going to pour it
in<00:02:01.770> here<00:02:04.040> fill<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.189> up<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.520> top<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
in here fill it up to the top and the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.979 
in here fill it up to the top and the
same<00:02:07.170> goes<00:02:07.799> with<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.190> one<00:02:08.250> here<00:02:08.989> now

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
same goes with this one here now

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.630 
same goes with this one here now
hopefully<00:02:10.200> these<00:02:10.530> pineapple<00:02:11.160> pieces<00:02:11.520> are

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
hopefully these pineapple pieces are

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.940 
hopefully these pineapple pieces are
floating<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.209> bit<00:02:12.420> which<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.720> great

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
floating a bit which is great

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.199 
floating a bit which is great
because<00:02:14.099> that<00:02:14.310> means<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.640> jelly<00:02:14.849> will<00:02:15.060> get

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
because that means that jelly will get

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.330 
because that means that jelly will get
underneath<00:02:15.720> as<00:02:15.930> well<00:02:15.959> now<00:02:16.739> these<00:02:16.920> go<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.310> the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
underneath as well now these go in the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.460 
underneath as well now these go in the
fridge<00:02:17.640> for<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.940> minimum<00:02:18.300> of<00:02:18.510> four<00:02:18.870> hours<00:02:18.930> to

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
fridge for a minimum of four hours to

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.990 
fridge for a minimum of four hours to
set<00:02:19.739> okay<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.099> now<00:02:20.430> I'm<00:02:20.550> going<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.730> put<00:02:20.879> these

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
set okay so now I'm going to put these

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.970 
set okay so now I'm going to put these
in<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.239> fridge<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:21.989> four<00:02:22.200> hours<00:02:22.410> time<00:02:22.709> I'm

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980

going to show you how to get them out

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.910 
going to show you how to get them out
okay<00:02:24.750> well<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.050> has<00:02:25.170> been<00:02:25.200> several<00:02:25.739> hours

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
later and they are out of the fridge and

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.229 
later and they are out of the fridge and
ready<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:30.780> be<00:02:30.930> taken<00:02:31.319> out<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:32.069> tins<00:02:32.400> but

knife<00:02:42.060> nice<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.569> hot<00:02:42.720> okay<00:02:43.709> now<00:02:43.950> let's<00:02:44.220> give

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
knife nice and hot okay now let's give

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.199 
knife nice and hot okay now let's give
this<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.640> go

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.930 

well<00:02:51.209> that<00:02:51.330> hot<00:02:51.540> knife<00:02:51.750> does<00:02:52.140> actually<00:02:52.940> slide

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
well that hot knife does actually slide

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.850 
well that hot knife does actually slide
through<00:02:54.420> quite<00:02:55.200> easily

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
through quite easily

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.800 
through quite easily
you<00:02:56.340> probably<00:02:56.519> want<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.819> use<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:57.000> knife<00:02:57.329> that<00:02:57.630> is

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
you probably want to use a knife that is

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.259 
you probably want to use a knife that is
fairly<00:02:58.200> flexible<00:02:58.530> as<00:02:59.040> well<00:02:59.250> you<00:03:00.030> probably

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
fairly flexible as well you probably

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.210 
fairly flexible as well you probably
don't<00:03:00.480> even<00:03:00.540> need<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.870> hot<00:03:01.079> knife<00:03:01.290> okay<00:03:02.040> well

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
don't even need a hot knife okay well

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.400 
don't even need a hot knife okay well
let's<00:03:02.370> see<00:03:02.519> how<00:03:02.640> these<00:03:02.819> turned<00:03:03.150> out<00:03:03.390> mind<00:03:04.290> you

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
let's see how these turned out mind you

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.910 
let's see how these turned out mind you
I've<00:03:04.530> never<00:03:04.709> done<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.130> before<00:03:05.190> so<00:03:06.709> this<00:03:07.709> is

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
I've never done this before so this is

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:16.009 
I've never done this before so this is
new<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:08.579> as<00:03:08.849> it<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.150> me<00:03:14.420> all<00:03:15.420> right<00:03:15.870> well

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
new to you as it is to me all right well

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.349 
new to you as it is to me all right well
it<00:03:16.110> did<00:03:16.260> fall<00:03:16.500> apart<00:03:16.829> a<00:03:16.950> tiny<00:03:17.190> bit<00:03:17.459> in<00:03:17.970> fact<00:03:18.209> it

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
it did fall apart a tiny bit in fact it

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.170 
it did fall apart a tiny bit in fact it
fell<00:03:18.630> apart<00:03:18.959> quite<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.350> lot<00:03:19.940> let's<00:03:20.940> try<00:03:21.120> this

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
fell apart quite a lot let's try this

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.289 
fell apart quite a lot let's try this
one

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
one

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.610 
one
well<00:03:24.299> I<00:03:24.329> have<00:03:24.569> got<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.900> say<00:03:25.079> that<00:03:25.350> was<00:03:25.470> pretty

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
well I have got to say that was pretty

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.370 
well I have got to say that was pretty
much<00:03:25.859> a<00:03:26.069> major<00:03:26.340> fail<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:27.109> probably<00:03:28.109> should<00:03:28.350> have

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
much a major fail I probably should have

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.009 
much a major fail I probably should have
not<00:03:28.650> used<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.220> jar<00:03:29.489> that<00:03:29.910> it<00:03:30.030> came<00:03:30.239> in<00:03:30.510> but

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
not used the jar that it came in but

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.750 
not used the jar that it came in but
trying<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.319> find<00:03:31.590> one<00:03:31.829> that's<00:03:32.220> quite<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.549> bit

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
trying to find one that's quite a bit

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.240 
trying to find one that's quite a bit
thicker<00:03:33.000> but<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:33.750> gives<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.139> idea<00:03:34.250> well

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
thicker but it gives you the idea well

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.849 
thicker but it gives you the idea well
let's<00:03:35.700> just<00:03:35.940> see<00:03:36.090> how<00:03:36.780> this<00:03:37.019> piece<00:03:37.290> tastes

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
let's just see how this piece tastes

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.099 
let's just see how this piece tastes
either<00:03:38.250> way<00:03:38.549> you<00:03:38.609> look<00:03:38.850> at<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:39.600> can't<00:03:39.870> go

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
either way you look at it you can't go

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.340 
either way you look at it you can't go
past<00:03:40.350> jelly<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.100> custard<00:03:41.690> okay<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:42.870> admit<00:03:43.079> it

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
past jelly and custard okay I admit it

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.890 
past jelly and custard okay I admit it
that<00:03:43.500> was<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.859> major<00:03:44.130> fail<00:03:44.519> but<00:03:45.299> it<00:03:45.450> still<00:03:45.660> did

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
that was a major fail but it still did

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.860 
that was a major fail but it still did
taste<00:03:46.139> really<00:03:46.410> good<00:03:46.940> now<00:03:47.940> if<00:03:48.269> I<00:03:48.420> did<00:03:48.660> have<00:03:48.840> a

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
taste really good now if I did have a

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.440 
taste really good now if I did have a
jar<00:03:49.380> that<00:03:49.410> was<00:03:49.769> maybe<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:50.579> centimeter<00:03:51.000> thicker

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
jar that was maybe a centimeter thicker

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.080 
jar that was maybe a centimeter thicker
on<00:03:51.630> each<00:03:51.810> side<00:03:52.170> of<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.709> jelly<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.850> would<00:03:54.000> have

on each side of the jelly it would have

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.629

turned<00:03:54.239> out<00:03:54.480> perfectly<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.410> I<00:03:55.590> dare<00:03:55.829> say<00:03:55.859> it

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
turned out perfectly and I dare say it

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.089 
turned out perfectly and I dare say it
would<00:03:56.760> have<00:03:56.880> been<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.030> complete<00:03:57.480> success<00:03:58.099> so
