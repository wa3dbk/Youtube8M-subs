with the Unified Divas Championship is
that<00:01:36.329> having<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.630> raw<00:01:36.780> title<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> Smackdown

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
that having a raw title on a Smackdown

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.219 
that having a raw title on a Smackdown
title<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:39.390> think<00:01:39.780> they're<00:01:39.930> gonna<00:01:40.049> come

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
title and I think they're gonna come

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.510 
title and I think they're gonna come
into<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> lot<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.710> problems<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.340> and

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
into a lot of problems like this and

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.039 
into a lot of problems like this and
hopefully<00:01:41.640> they're<00:01:42.119> gonna<00:01:42.210> start<00:01:42.570> letting<00:01:42.899> a

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
hopefully they're gonna start letting a

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.480 
hopefully they're gonna start letting a
lot<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.380> these<00:01:43.500> divas<00:01:43.770> go<00:01:43.979> because<00:01:44.189> there's<00:01:44.369> no

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
lot of these divas go because there's no

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.030 
lot of these divas go because there's no
real<00:01:44.759> room<00:01:45.090> for<00:01:45.420> them<00:01:45.540> if<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.350> champion<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.920> on

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
real room for them if the champion is on

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.700 
real room for them if the champion is on
Raw<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.880> have<00:01:48.090> matches<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.170> Smackdown

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
Raw and you have matches on Smackdown

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.980 
Raw and you have matches on Smackdown
with<00:01:49.920> divas<00:01:50.310> what's<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.390> point<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.840> doesn't

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
with divas what's the point it doesn't

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.569 
with divas what's the point it doesn't
really<00:01:52.170> matter<00:01:52.560> because<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.040> know<00:01:53.250> that

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
really matter because you know that

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.580 
really matter because you know that
these<00:01:53.759> girls<00:01:54.000> aren't<00:01:54.329> know<00:01:54.600> what's<00:01:55.350> gonna<00:01:55.500> be

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
these girls aren't know what's gonna be

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.109 
these girls aren't know what's gonna be
on<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.950> pay-per-view<00:01:56.310> it's<00:01:56.640> your<00:01:56.759> time<00:01:56.969> to

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
on the pay-per-view it's your time to

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.760 
on the pay-per-view it's your time to
get<00:01:57.270> up<00:01:57.479> get<00:01:57.719> yourself<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.110> drink<00:01:58.259> I've<00:01:58.590> some

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
get up get yourself a drink I've some

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.109 
get up get yourself a drink I've some
more<00:01:58.890> Ritz<00:01:59.100> crackers<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> bag<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.939> chips

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
more Ritz crackers and a bag of chips

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.830 
more Ritz crackers and a bag of chips
because<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:01.530> doesn't<00:02:01.829> matter<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.810> honestly<00:02:03.810> I

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
because it doesn't matter so honestly I

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.780 
because it doesn't matter so honestly I
think<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.110> losing<00:02:04.710> Melina<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.369> big<00:02:05.549> loss

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
think that losing Melina is a big loss

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.619 
think that losing Melina is a big loss
for<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.119> Derby<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.979> I<00:02:08.060> wish<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.090> she<00:02:09.360> was

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
for the Derby and I wish that she was

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.940 
for the Derby and I wish that she was
still<00:02:09.810> around<00:02:09.899> hopefully<00:02:10.319> she<00:02:10.560> got<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.770> pick

guy's career they've saved it for big
show<00:02:56.900> times<00:02:57.319> but<00:02:57.739> I<00:02:58.569> don't<00:02:59.569> think<00:02:59.629> you'd<00:02:59.840> be

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
show times but I don't think you'd be

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.509 
show times but I don't think you'd be
able<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.200> save<00:03:00.349> it<00:03:00.470> for<00:03:00.560> with<00:03:00.680> Kozlov<00:03:01.190> it's

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
able to save it for with Kozlov it's

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.600 
able to save it for with Kozlov it's
just<00:03:01.760> it's<00:03:02.450> done<00:03:02.690> it's<00:03:02.959> over<00:03:03.319> I<00:03:03.530> think<00:03:04.099> if<00:03:04.190> TNA

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
just it's done it's over I think if TNA

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.400 
just it's done it's over I think if TNA
