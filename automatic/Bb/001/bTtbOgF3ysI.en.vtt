00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.300 
a good idea to take the neighbors car
and<00:02:41.060> drive<00:02:41.450> down<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.750> street<00:02:42.020> actually<00:02:42.890> he

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
and drive down the street actually he

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.130 
and drive down the street actually he
was<00:02:43.460> speeding<00:02:43.880> down<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.090> street<00:02:44.210> with<00:02:45.110> a

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
was speeding down the street with a

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.830 
was speeding down the street with a
pistol<00:02:45.800> in<00:02:45.890> hand<00:02:46.060> trying<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.180> copy<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.720> video

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
pistol in hand trying to copy the video

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.950 
pistol in hand trying to copy the video
game<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.790> without<00:02:49.790> paying<00:02:49.970> attention<00:02:50.480> he

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
game and without paying attention he

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.560 
game and without paying attention he
smashed<00:02:51.560> into<00:02:51.710> a<00:02:51.830> lamppost<00:02:52.420> showing<00:02:53.420> an

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
smashed into a lamppost showing an

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.360 
smashed into a lamppost showing an
impact<00:02:54.820> so<00:02:55.820> I<00:02:56.830> have<00:02:57.830> to<00:02:57.980> actually<00:02:58.130> this

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
impact so I have to actually this

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.670 
impact so I have to actually this
question<00:02:58.790> did<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.720> video<00:02:59.960> games<00:03:00.200> actually
