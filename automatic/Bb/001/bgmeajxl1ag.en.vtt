00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.170
 hello everyone how is it is good 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.760
 welcome again to my channel in this 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.849
 video I bring you a product that to me 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.830
 like it a lot and therefore it will appear in 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.279
 the space that I opened a long time ago 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.350
 blog about recommended products on 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.690
 drama is kiko and it's about a 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.670
 powder mineral makeup 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.670
 the product in question is this 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.430
 the number is this 2 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.579
 Y 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.730
 It takes 10 and a half grams 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.129
 good because I like me so much because 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.870
 I like his way of applying it and the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.719
 result that you get the way to 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.719
 apply it is this takes a little ball 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.320
 good the product you see 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.820
 and simply what you have to do is 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.280
 apply it 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.590
 impregnate the product pellet and I 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.659
 you are applying on the face 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.549
 if you have product access if you take 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.500
 are you of the product then you are about 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:29.670
 touches monet and eliminates jce from 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.329
 I agree that you wear it or apply it 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.630
 in the face is worth it because I like it 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.789
 good 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.039
 it's a mineral makeup like there was 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.799
 said then for people like me 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:44.259
 who have mixed or oily skin this is 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.270
 great because it is not greased 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:50.200
 absolutely nothing and coverage for 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.420
 making powders is very well besides what 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.640
 you can also use in the case of 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.189
 that you get more coverage you can 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.560
 use after your base of 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.860
 usual makeup or your cream 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.840
 moisturizer with color or from to be cream 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.539
 you can use these powders and you give a 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.099
 more coverage and you're also sealing 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:14.260
 that make-up base or xavi cream and 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:17.650
 removing the excess glitter then 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.410
 it's also to massify I use it 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.650
 hot weather a lot to me 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.849
 like more for more facing the summer 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.620
 Since I am very burdened by 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.870
 makeup and good take something in the 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.549
 but I like to give it a little 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.470
 of color and how makeup bases 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.940
 I do not find it heavy even 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.690
 I lived cream I do not like to see anything in the 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.320
 face 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.270
 because of that type of liquid nothing 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.870
 I put a few ticks of this makeup 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.730
 mineral and great or I love myself 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.520
 since providing it has been part of 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.330
 my favorite products nothing simply 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.130
 tell you that you can buy it you know 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.510
 kiko or else in a physical store that 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.800
 sure sure you have in your 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:06.790
 city ​​or near your yours 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:09.010
 our place where you live and if 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.650
 Well, you know that it contains a web 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.230
 where they sell their products online I 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.850
 what I did was to take advantage of my first 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.200
 purchase that there are seven registrations per 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.530
 First time have the shipping costs 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.840
 free and what I did was I so 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.420
 take advantage of that occasion to ask for them 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.700
 because I really wanted to try them and 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.430
 I already tell you they are in different shades not 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.280
 I know if in the three tones 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.500
 I think I remember 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.620
 and I already say if you have skin problems 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.810
 mixed or fat is great and if you do not 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.040
 You can use already I say to seal 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.670
 your makeup or that base of 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.850
 makeup that also goes super well 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.690
 nothing if you have used this once 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.340
 product, I would like for me 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.160
