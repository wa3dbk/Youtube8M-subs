you<00:02:05.240> haven't<00:02:05.630> tried<00:02:05.750> 360<00:02:06.590> or<00:02:06.709> haven't<00:02:07.039> seen<00:02:07.280> an

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
you haven't tried 360 or haven't seen an

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.050 
you haven't tried 360 or haven't seen an
action<00:02:07.909> yet<00:02:08.090> this<00:02:08.989> I<00:02:09.259> think<00:02:09.319> has<00:02:09.910> some<00:02:10.910> of<00:02:11.000> the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
action yet this I think has some of the

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.610 
action yet this I think has some of the
potential<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.690> be<00:02:11.810> one<00:02:11.959> of<00:02:12.049> the<00:02:12.110> most<00:02:12.319> powerful

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
potential to be one of the most powerful

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.500 
potential to be one of the most powerful
things<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:14.810> will<00:02:15.019> never<00:02:15.260> use<00:02:16.420> when<00:02:17.420> it

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
things that you will never use when it

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.780 
things that you will never use when it
comes<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.959> sonar<00:02:18.379> fast<00:02:18.890> efficient<00:02:19.400> looking

well<00:02:23.390> we'll<00:02:24.319> have<00:02:24.470> more<00:02:25.299> 360<00:02:26.299> action<00:02:26.690> this

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810
