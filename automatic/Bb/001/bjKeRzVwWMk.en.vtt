a look at Kyle XY the premiere of the

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.059 
a look at Kyle XY the premiere of the
second<00:03:49.010> season<00:03:49.190> I<00:03:50.410> worked<00:03:51.410> years<00:03:51.769> on

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
second season I worked years on

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.520 
second season I worked years on
developing<00:03:52.609> an<00:03:52.790> artificial<00:03:53.239> womb<00:03:56.470> finally<00:03:57.470> I

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
developing an artificial womb finally I

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.020 
developing an artificial womb finally I
designed<00:03:57.920> a<00:03:58.040> chamber<00:03:58.430> that<00:03:58.459> I<00:03:58.609> believed<00:03:58.880> at

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
designed a chamber that I believed at

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.069 
designed a chamber that I believed at
work<00:03:59.829> and<00:04:00.829> I<00:04:01.250> invented<00:04:01.609> the<00:04:01.700> fluid<00:04:02.060> that<00:04:02.930> would

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
work and I invented the fluid that would

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.990 
work and I invented the fluid that would
provide<00:04:03.350> oxygen<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:04.100> nourish<00:04:04.579> the<00:04:04.700> embryo

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
provide oxygen and nourish the embryo

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.530 
provide oxygen and nourish the embryo
placed<00:04:05.269> inside<00:04:07.030> so<00:04:08.030> there<00:04:08.150> was<00:04:08.239> no<00:04:08.329> need<00:04:08.359> for

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
placed inside so there was no need for

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.830 
placed inside so there was no need for
natural<00:04:09.049> mother<00:04:09.170> and<00:04:10.100> obviously<00:04:10.970> no

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
natural mother and obviously no

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.650 
natural mother and obviously no
umbilical<00:04:12.109> cord<00:04:12.470> and<00:04:13.250> as<00:04:13.400> a<00:04:13.430> result<00:04:13.639> the<00:04:14.420> job

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
umbilical cord and as a result the job

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.220 
umbilical cord and as a result the job
would<00:04:14.810> not<00:04:14.959> have<00:04:15.079> a<00:04:15.109> belly<00:04:15.350> button
