my rail here and I placed a mark 3/4 of

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.680 
my rail here and I placed a mark 3/4 of
an<00:01:20.080> inch<00:01:20.170> in<00:01:20.380> from<00:01:20.740> here<00:01:21.220> which<00:01:21.970> is<00:01:22.270> going<00:01:22.630> to

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.529 
be the length of my tendon then all I do
is<00:01:26.229> lay<00:01:26.440> this<00:01:26.710> right<00:01:27.280> here<00:01:27.670> lining<00:01:28.060> up<00:01:28.330> this

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
is lay this right here lining up this

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.630 
is lay this right here lining up this
line<00:01:28.810> with<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.140> edge<00:01:29.229> of<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.470> board<00:01:29.649> like<00:01:30.580> so

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
line with the edge of the board like so

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.809 
line with the edge of the board like so
and<00:01:31.270> I<00:01:32.200> mark<00:01:32.440> here<00:01:32.830> this<00:01:33.100> is<00:01:33.250> going<00:01:33.369> to<00:01:33.460> be<00:01:33.549> for

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
and I mark here this is going to be for

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:36.330 
and I mark here this is going to be for
one<00:01:34.000> cheek<00:01:34.330> and<00:01:34.569> then<00:01:34.899> I<00:01:35.049> mark<00:01:35.319> right<00:01:35.619> here<00:01:36.159> and

one cheek and then I mark right here and

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.279 
one cheek and then I mark right here and
that<00:01:37.209> will<00:01:37.360> be<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.630> distance<00:01:37.929> for<00:01:38.080> my<00:01:38.170> other

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.280 

alright<00:03:28.550> guys<00:03:28.730> so<00:03:28.940> I<00:03:28.970> got<00:03:29.060> all<00:03:29.480> my<00:03:29.510> Tenon's<00:03:30.050> cut

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
alright guys so I got all my Tenon's cut

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.740 
alright guys so I got all my Tenon's cut
on<00:03:30.710> my<00:03:30.920> rails<00:03:31.160> and<00:03:31.550> I<00:03:31.970> realized<00:03:32.450> I<00:03:32.570> made<00:03:32.720> a

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
on my rails and I realized I made a

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.110 
on my rails and I realized I made a
pretty<00:03:33.020> big<00:03:33.230> mistake<00:03:33.680> when<00:03:34.550> I<00:03:34.610> did<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:34.970> math

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
pretty big mistake when I did the math

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.700 
pretty big mistake when I did the math
to<00:03:35.420> figure<00:03:35.450> out<00:03:35.720> how<00:03:35.870> long<00:03:35.930> these<00:03:36.320> had<00:03:36.560> to<00:03:36.590> be

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.710 
to figure out how long these had to be

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.980 
to figure out how long these had to be
and<00:03:37.490> I<00:03:37.550> took<00:03:37.610> an<00:03:37.880> account<00:03:38.210> that<00:03:38.480> I<00:03:38.540> had<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:38.840> add

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
and I took an account that I had to add

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.050 
and I took an account that I had to add
a<00:03:39.020> 3/4<00:03:39.860> of<00:03:39.890> an<00:03:39.980> inch<00:03:40.070> for<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.400> distance<00:03:40.820> of<00:03:40.940> my

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
a 3/4 of an inch for the distance of my

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.810 
a 3/4 of an inch for the distance of my
tenon<00:03:41.450> but<00:03:42.260> what<00:03:42.500> I<00:03:42.530> didn't<00:03:42.980> take<00:03:43.640> into

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
tenon but what I didn't take into

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.510 
tenon but what I didn't take into
account<00:03:43.970> is<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.870> other<00:03:45.020> 3/8<00:03:45.530> of<00:03:45.680> an<00:03:45.830> inch<00:03:45.950> for

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
account is the other 3/8 of an inch for

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.810 
account is the other 3/8 of an inch for
the<00:03:46.640> thickness<00:03:46.880> of<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:48.560> rabbit<00:03:49.070> so<00:03:49.460> as<00:03:49.700> you

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
the thickness of the rabbit so as you

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.620 
the thickness of the rabbit so as you
can<00:03:49.910> see<00:03:49.970> when<00:03:50.390> you<00:03:50.480> slide<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:50.960> in<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:53.090> rabbit

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
can see when you slide it in the rabbit

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.170 
can see when you slide it in the rabbit
also<00:03:54.290> takes<00:03:54.920> away<00:03:55.220> three-eighths<00:03:55.790> of<00:03:55.940> an<00:03:56.060> inch

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
also takes away three-eighths of an inch

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.650 
also takes away three-eighths of an inch
so<00:03:56.510> all<00:03:57.170> my<00:03:57.500> rails<00:03:57.770> are<00:03:58.459> now<00:03:58.670> three<00:03:59.390> quarters

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
so all my rails are now three quarters

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.720 
so all my rails are now three quarters
of<00:03:59.690> an<00:03:59.810> inch<00:03:59.900> short<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:00.650> have<00:04:00.950> no<00:04:01.190> choice<00:04:01.459> but

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
of an inch short so I have no choice but

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.550 
of an inch short so I have no choice but
to<00:04:01.790> remake<00:04:02.150> all<00:04:02.360> of<00:04:02.510> these<00:04:02.630> which<00:04:02.930> sucks

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
to remake all of these which sucks

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.500 
to remake all of these which sucks
pretty<00:04:03.709> bad<00:04:03.950> by<00:04:04.190> something<00:04:04.400> in<00:04:04.610> the<00:04:04.640> world<00:04:04.850> so

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
pretty bad by something in the world so

00:04:05.510 --> 00:05:08.730 
pretty bad by something in the world so
I'll<00:04:05.600> go<00:04:05.750> ahead<00:04:05.780> and<00:04:06.140> do<00:04:06.200> that<00:04:06.320> now

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.990 

so<00:05:09.740> the<00:05:09.860> cheapest<00:05:10.130> where<00:05:10.400> I<00:05:10.430> could<00:05:10.610> find<00:05:10.820> are

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
so the cheapest where I could find are

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.280 
so the cheapest where I could find are
those<00:05:11.180> like<00:05:11.389> door<00:05:11.630> mirrors<00:05:11.930> you<00:05:12.020> can<00:05:12.050> get<00:05:12.200> at

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
those like door mirrors you can get at

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.780 
those like door mirrors you can get at
Walmart<00:05:12.440> or<00:05:12.740> whatever<00:05:12.800> for<00:05:13.130> about<00:05:13.310> 12<00:05:13.580> bucks

Walmart or whatever for about 12 bucks

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.300 
Walmart or whatever for about 12 bucks
and<00:05:14.330> all<00:05:14.930> I<00:05:14.960> did<00:05:15.139> is<00:05:15.230> broke<00:05:15.470> the<00:05:15.590> frame<00:05:15.800> off<00:05:16.070> it

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
and all I did is broke the frame off it

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.920 
and all I did is broke the frame off it
and<00:05:16.460> then<00:05:16.669> measured<00:05:17.060> it<00:05:17.180> what<00:05:17.300> I<00:05:17.330> needed

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
and then measured it what I needed

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.750 
and then measured it what I needed

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
score with a glass cutter and snapped it

00:05:19.760 --> 00:07:10.110 
score with a glass cutter and snapped it
I<00:05:19.940> seemed<00:05:20.120> to<00:05:20.210> work<00:05:20.300> pretty<00:05:20.360> good

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120
