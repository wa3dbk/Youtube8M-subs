00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.290
 and good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.080
 new race for adrián lessons ep 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.300
 today about the great prize of brazil a 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.740
 rosberg race won after 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.360
 master from the beginning of the great 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.490
 prize 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.070
 and hamilton when finished in second 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.170
 position after having been much of 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.900
 the race pushing Rosberg but 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.680
 without going over there and that pressure that has 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.130
 exercised has also taken its toll on 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.899
 some moment of the race when it has 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.420
 After a bit of braking and putting the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.329
 car a whiplash that almost did not 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.930
 abandonment costs and from there on 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.270
 instead of staying calmer he has gone to 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.730
 for all to contact again with 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.910
 robert and has stayed again behind 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.670
 of him to press him and force him to see 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.520
 If he made a mistake, he did not commit 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.650
 no rosberg error and right now the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.000
 championship is with hamilton at first 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:05.489
 position 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.410
 and rosberg second to 17 points these 17 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.530
 points of difference between them supposes 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.490
 that if hamilton wants to win the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.369
 championship you just need to be second 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.010
 if Rosberg wins is to say if Rosberg 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.619
 wins the last race in abu dhabi a 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.660
 hamilton is only worth being second to 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.680
 win the championship the third position 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:31.470
 would give the championship to rosberg so 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.290
 we are going to have in that career of abu 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.690
 dhabi much tension as an abandonment 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.060
 also on the part of hamilton would leave him 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.360
 on a platter the rosberg championship or if 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.900
 Rosberg can not reach 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.970
 the victory because hamilton would already be 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.130
 much quieter because he has there is a 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.110
 mattress but good can not be neglected 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.660
 because anything a puncture or 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.760
 You can also make the championship 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.130
 I took it rosberg because as I say only 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.250
 it's worth low chin with six seconds and 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.970
 wins rosberg so we'll see in that 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.509
 weekend of November 22 and 23 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.060
 what what we have on the other hand 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.520
 in third position has been left behind 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.550
 a pretty complicated race again 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.010
 for the team williams 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.310
 Massa is wrong when it comes to stopping 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.800
 the box has had 5 seconds of 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.140
 penalty and good today despite everything 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.240
 that and the 4 stops that he has done the most 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.090
 has managed to climb to the third 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.680
 podium position and good a good 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.170
 race to further back all those 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.020
 difficulties then get that third 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.880
 fourth position position for jenson 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.620
 button that good and a little chees it 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.420
 Callando has gotten a good 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.410
 position 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.230
 in points is a relief in terms of 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.530
 that fight with ferrari in the championship 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.840
 of builders and it helps them but hey 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.230
 everything will be decided the last race in 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.360
 Abu Dhabi for next year if 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.970
 Alonso is not in Ferrari and the 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.130
 mclaren ballots has all of the 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.800
 men means more money to 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.770
 mclaren be ahead 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.750
 I would prefer if Alonso to the year that 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.580
 comes to mclaren so that mclaren 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.770
 ahead this year in the championship of 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.500
 builders we will see in fifth position 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.780
 vettel who has made only two stops 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.410
 and he has done a good race but Alonso 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.230
 I was very attached to the end of race 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.900
 to be able to pass him but raikkonen have 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.150
 charged to cover several turns and 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.160
 Alonso to be his teammate not 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.490
 risked too much and in the end has not 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.770
 could try to fight against vettel 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.260
 for that fifth position and cover a 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.660
 little more in points to ferrari with that 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.920
 fight that I have commented with mclaren but 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.950
 good 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.770
 ferrari we already know that as for 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.900
 decisions and others are not very fine and 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.410
 especially this weekend with that 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.180
 ayayay de alonso because he had not left 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.260
 with the batteries charged to the 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.900
 classification 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.180
 since he leaves the team then man 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.280
 It is not a plan to leave bad after 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.769
 of five years in ferrari so be it what 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.239
 to make him look a little face 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.910
 to the last race because the truth that 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.100
 it was not good at all that 's the time 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.610
 that after all they are seeing it 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.289
 millions of people and still can not 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.350
 It seems that the team is trying 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.030
 annoy your pilot but good in 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.910
 seventh place has been raikkonen 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.250
 eighth hülkenberg ninth magnussen and 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.720
 we say boots so nothing here ends 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.770
 the video I hope you liked a 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.770
 greeting and until next time 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.090
 okay
