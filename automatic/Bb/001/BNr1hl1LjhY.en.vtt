00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
made it look like right here's what my

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.810 
made it look like right here's what my
case<00:00:45.210> looks<00:00:45.450> like<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:46.320> looks<00:00:46.410> like<00:00:46.559> iPhone<00:00:47.550> 5

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
case looks like it looks like iPhone 5

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.139 
case looks like it looks like iPhone 5
with<00:00:48.629> white<00:00:49.260> glass<00:00:50.190> stripes<00:00:50.579> right<00:00:50.760> there<00:00:50.969> but

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
with white glass stripes right there but

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.170 
with white glass stripes right there but
it's<00:00:51.270> not<00:00:51.329> glass<00:00:51.690> it's<00:00:51.989> more<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> plastic

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
it's not glass it's more like a plastic

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.729 
it's not glass it's more like a plastic
it<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.420> easy<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.989> scratch<00:00:55.199> your<00:00:55.350> nails<00:00:55.590> off

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
it is easy to scratch your nails off

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.830 
it is easy to scratch your nails off
here<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.190> that's<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> one<00:00:57.239> downside<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.750> it

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
here so that's the one downside of it

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.160 
here so that's the one downside of it
but<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:59.609> does<00:00:59.789> look<00:00:59.969> like<00:01:00.000> an<00:01:00.510> actual<00:01:00.780> hi<00:01:00.960> phone

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170

the camera still works let's hold us a
flash<00:01:25.310> which<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.729> anchor

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:41.980 

my<00:01:33.320> Flash<00:01:33.620> still<00:01:34.010> works

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.340 

but<00:01:43.880> yeah<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.360> only<00:01:45.479> other<00:01:45.810> thing<00:01:46.140> that's

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
but yeah the only other thing that's

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.580 
but yeah the only other thing that's
wrong<00:01:46.619> with<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.369> um<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:49.020> Apple<00:01:49.380> doesn't

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
wrong with this is um the Apple doesn't

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.230 
wrong with this is um the Apple doesn't
show<00:01:49.979> up<00:01:50.100> here<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.789> get<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.180> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
show up here so I have to get like a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.340 
show up here so I have to get like a
little<00:01:51.420> sticker<00:01:52.140> thing<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:53.039> show<00:01:53.539> but<00:01:54.539> what's

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
little sticker thing to show but what's

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.109 
little sticker thing to show but what's
easier<00:01:56.009> mine<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.430> because<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.789> bought<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
easier mine is because I bought the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.789 
easier mine is because I bought the
engraving<00:01:57.600> with<00:01:57.750> my<00:01:57.929> name<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.350> then<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.590> said

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
engraving with my name and then it said

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.090 
engraving with my name and then it said
iPod<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.929> so<00:02:00.929> it<00:02:01.049> actually<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.590> says<00:02:01.830> I

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
iPod on it so it actually just says I

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.499 
iPod on it so it actually just says I
bought<00:02:02.340> there<00:02:02.549> instead<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.970> my<00:02:03.060> name

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
bought there instead of my name

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.630 
bought there instead of my name
I<00:02:03.539> just<00:02:03.840> says<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.170> fine<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:05.130> kind<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.399> weird

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
I just says I fine so it's kind of weird

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.300 
I just says I fine so it's kind of weird
how<00:02:05.729> only<00:02:06.240> iPod<00:02:06.869> shows<00:02:07.380> up<00:02:07.590> there<00:02:07.770> instead<00:02:07.979> of

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
how only iPod shows up there instead of

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.350 
how only iPod shows up there instead of
it<00:02:08.429> saying<00:02:08.640> iPhone

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
it saying iPhone

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.910 
it saying iPhone
they've<00:02:09.720> that's<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.110> way<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.380> Apple<00:02:10.739> made

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
they've that's the way that Apple made

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.020 
they've that's the way that Apple made
it<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:11.370> people<00:02:11.550> won't<00:02:11.790> copy<00:02:12.799> but

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
it just so people won't copy but

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.400 
it just so people won't copy but
everything<00:02:15.030> does<00:02:15.180> fit<00:02:15.569> I'm<00:02:15.780> not<00:02:15.930> sure<00:02:16.140> if<00:02:16.260> this

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
everything does fit I'm not sure if this

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.190 
everything does fit I'm not sure if this
does<00:02:16.739> right<00:02:16.980> here<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.480> make<00:02:18.600> it<00:02:18.750> look<00:02:18.900> real

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
does right here but to make it look real

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.050 
does right here but to make it look real
you<00:02:19.470> don't<00:02:19.620> want<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.980> get<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.160> permanent<00:02:20.640> marker

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
you don't want to get a permanent marker

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.750 
you don't want to get a permanent marker
and<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:22.230> permanent<00:02:22.560> black<00:02:22.860> marker<00:02:23.489> like<00:02:23.730> a

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760
