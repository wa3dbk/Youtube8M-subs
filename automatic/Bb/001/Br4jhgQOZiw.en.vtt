00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hi everyone today I you 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.879
 found in this new video that 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.560
 will be indirect as year earlier bet his 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.540
 laptop or ipod shell 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.759
 you can obviously changed according to 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.070
 seasons and your tastes you will need 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.690
 a transparent shell as I 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.210
 buy at the small grocery store for 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.210
 about 4 euros from a pencil 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:29.429
 a pair of scissors and a small 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.510
 for nails and printed patterns 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.390
 on the Internet 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.649
 we will start by taking the pattern 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.120
 cause and chooses so you want 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.390
 find on google images all 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.340
 you simply flip your hull and 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.969
 opened with the pencil paper form and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.969
 contour 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.520
 here is the result obtained 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.070
 then with the pair of scissors 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.649
 normal size we will cut out the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.649
 outline by doing the rounded 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.620
 here is the result once dolls 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.850
 so you will see that if but the 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.970
 paper in the hull 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.830
 it will be too big so low that will be 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.320
 too big which is quite normal 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:45.210
 so we go with our scissors 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:50.140
 normal always shrink the paper into 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.240
 simply cutting out the surplus 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:57.069
 do not forget to always round 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:01.009
 edges once you're done 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.630
 try it down if it goes in here that's me 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.759
 it comes back so it's perfect 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.490
 then put your finger behind the 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:14.360
 hole is with the crime paper does the 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:18.220
 form very slightly remove the paper 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.799
 and took with the small scissors of 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.629
 so you're going we're going to actually cut to 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.120
 inside so I folded a 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.160
 little and I cut a little bit like this and 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.140
 this after a small nick where I pass 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:35.650
 the the blade inside and I start 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.510
 to cut out the outline so these are the 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.930
 scissors with a rounded tip so that's 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.959
 really super good to do the little 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:49.760
 the small angle group to the rounded and 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:53.140
 you cut gently without too low 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.140
 without being overworked 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.760
 once all that makes place your 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.790
 paper in the hull and here is the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.790
 result 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.180
 and here are the girls I hope this 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.920
 have you enjoyed do not forget that you 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.080
 can change the pattern of your hull 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.239
 according to your moods and your desires 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.830
 and here I hope the video will have you 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.340
