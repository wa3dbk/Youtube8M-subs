00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
think if you can have a preseason get

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.440 
think if you can have a preseason get
through<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.920> not<00:01:23.340> lose<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.640> crawley<00:01:23.909> town<00:01:24.000> I've

ambitious<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.490> actually<00:02:26.700> think<00:02:27.030> pilots

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
ambitious and I actually think pilots

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.630 
ambitious and I actually think pilots

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
actually if you look at it on paper this

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.310 
actually if you look at it on paper this
is<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.070> team<00:03:35.310> that<00:03:35.340> could<00:03:36.120> go<00:03:36.300> a<00:03:36.540> long<00:03:36.810> way<00:03:36.989> yeah

first game back in the Premier League at

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.170 
first game back in the Premier League at
home<00:04:07.290> crowds<00:04:08.040> going<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.340> be<00:04:08.459> you<00:04:08.670> know<00:04:08.790> gonna

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
home crowds going to be you know gonna

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.820 
home crowds going to be you know gonna
be<00:04:09.269> a<00:04:09.299> big<00:04:09.450> crowd<00:04:09.600> I<00:04:09.989> think<00:04:10.500> it's<00:04:10.590> going<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.739> be

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
be a big crowd I think it's going to be

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.560 
be a big crowd I think it's going to be
difficult<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.280> think<00:04:11.310> probably<00:04:11.549> be<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:11.820> draw<00:04:12.239> to

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
difficult I think probably be a draw to

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.159 
difficult I think probably be a draw to
another<00:04:12.900> score<00:04:13.230> draw<00:04:13.500> but<00:04:14.250> i<00:04:14.280> would<00:04:14.610> say<00:04:14.790> that

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
another score draw but i would say that

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.210 
another score draw but i would say that
palace<00:04:16.169> won't<00:04:16.410> they<00:04:16.830> did<00:04:17.010> one
