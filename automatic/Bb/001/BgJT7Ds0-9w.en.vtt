00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.460
 Let's talk about something serious, very serious. 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.100
 the vampires are going to attack again and it 's angels 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.960
 of the night five a franchise when it is good 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.520
 she has 1 2 3 4 5 6 and up as 7 as harry 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.280
 potter out there 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.950
 so night angels were so nice since 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.899
 2003 has been so successful that 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:51.689
 now 28 October 2016 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:53.310
 of thee 28 October 27, 2016 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.399
 still have time for you to prepare 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.790
 because the recordings are still going to start there 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.990
 plague in October this year, so only 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.090
 next year 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.420
 on October 17th you will know the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.520
 which is rolling in the one of which is the end 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.590
 of all this night angels 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.860
 but I want to tell you angels of the night 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.959
 and is one of the best works of vampires 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.030
 because the first logical for me to 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.030
 interview with the thousand vampire 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:38.239
 it's very good 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.239
 and the second is the queen of the damned 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.259
 [Applause] 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:16.580
 Angels of the night have a cool thing 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:18.590
 because it joins EMTU science and joins 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.870
 in one thing and it gives that face of the 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.599
 vampire of the night angels the first was 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.870
 so good, so good, you got the guys 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:29.180
 in the year the story that history is 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.209
 simple the vampire war against 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.390
 breed lycan lycans that are 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:39.110
 werewolves right war and two of them had 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:42.709
 selena that presented to the world right this 3 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.829
 wonderful that that just did not come in one 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.680
 Of the two angels of the night was the 3 was 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.900
 When everything came back to tell 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.890
 starry starting even but it's hot 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:59.510
 time I do not know the name of the rights 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:03.230
 surname cattebeke netback went out to 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:06.079
 You know you 're much better at trying. 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.900

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:12.230

 I leave the leave is coming back in 2005 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:20.060
 and in 2003 the first help at night 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:22.610
 3 presented this to the world right this 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.860
 in the vampire celina watching her with 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.110
 Those contact lenses are there for you. 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.310
 there what is that one but it's one thing 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.260
 online medium 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.160
 She looks very different when I see 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:41.110
 she in the movie and then I saw her without 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:43.280
 characterization of the film eg the 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.389
 line 3 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:50.060
 she appears in the film there is one thing in 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:53.750
 another movie I found so different that 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.270
 I could not identify until after 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:03.860
 read the credits and see the name kate betts 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:06.020
 oh now it will come back it will be written 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.110
 by the same author of the priest who also 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.320
 a very good action film and such a priest 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.740
 worth watching and directed 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.599
 by a woman 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.910
 first woman to direct the franchise 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:23.229
 Angels give the night that rain is the name 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.880

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:30.099
 external 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:32.560
 the ana who directed the attack on the white house 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.720
 It's a really cool people but now while 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.169
 There is no video of five night angels. 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.180
 nor trailer teaser law in image any 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.819
 Let's throw a little bit to 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.849
 remember the old ones are until the 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:48.729
 Next video I was with the a 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.710
