00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.890
 ah 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.840
 for at least a couple of 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.450
 decades the argentina is one of the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.750
 leading countries in the amount of cars 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.970
 that circulate converted to gas gmc 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.000
 natural why we wanted to make a 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.980
 report related to the CNG CNG that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.169
 It has been able to adapt to the times has 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.270
 accompanied the evolution of the cars and 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:33.000
 of the engines and today in Argentina is 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.100
 growing again the amount of 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.500
 conversions because many users by 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.510
 economic issues convert their 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.359
 cars are already popular cars but 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.469
 there are also many high-end and gmc 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:45.469
 for all 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.280
 by the unit of the area we can go to peak 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.710
 and liberator can be like no 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.730
 it's cool but the weather always breaks 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.750
 the cubito in the seen taxi 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.670
 beautifully flowers has gas and has gas 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.840
 has a state-of-the-art equipment and 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.079
 It has a very large cylinder 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.390
 of 60 liters and how much they pay more or less 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:19.049
 walking here in cities according to my 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.319
 working mode roughly between 120 and 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.200
 130 km so we can be talking 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:26.939
 of about 12.5 meters of gas every 100 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.829
 kilometer 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.590
 and that and the gas meter is in three 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.009
 weights and something and it depends on the places of 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.880
 where it does not charge and three times a day until 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:40.840
 360 taking 3 with 30 then for 12 5 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.200
 meters 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.079
 that gives me an expense of 41 pesos every 100 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.630
 kilometers of use and anne up this car 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:53.049
 is about 10 liters in the 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.850
 city yes on day 10 and a half then 10 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.569
 liters and the price of super naphtha more 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:02.409
 or less how many are the 13 pesos for 13 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:04.869
 weights then this gives us about 130 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.819
 Naphtha weights every 100 kilometers that is 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.450
 which is practically triple the amount 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.450
 it is spent 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.270
 which is more or less autonomy en route 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.820
 of the whole experience is between 170 and 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.210
 190 kilometers and here in the city ​​the 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.160
 autonomy with low coherent management and 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.650
 we are talking about 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.740
 120 kilometers or so what I do 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.690
 average 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.030
 according to my friendship 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.370
 work 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.810
 where I better look at a little bit 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.760
 closer if step does not have to give the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.450
 return 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.450
 how much is 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.659
 to 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.310
 and how am I doing a note on CNG 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.900
 where do I have to go to talk to the 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.099
 who still know what to do the installation 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.099
 of genes 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.230
 We are in one of the workshops 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.760
 hygiene installation 100 more 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.220
 representative of the city of good 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.600
 air eddie thank you for receiving us 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.870
 the idea is to come just to 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.400
 ask yourself how is the CNG today and 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.380
 in terms of technology in terms of 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.960
 new equipment if you get along with the 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.490
 new cars if it's something that lent itself 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.960
 better to old cars good as is a 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.700
 little this world actually in the 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.010
 genesio and we reach a point at which 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.240
 we always dream the most modern cars 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.710
 are the ones that best suits the 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.600
 management today, so I can 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.790
 have a very modern car with injection 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.320
 multipoint with electronic modules of 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.120
 last generation and it goes perfect without 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.710
 multipoint intention there is no 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.080
 problem and what happens with the wear 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.060
 because there is an anti-CNG current that 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.310
 says that if you have grace in the engine 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.500
 the service life is halved by 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.230
 example , why is not it so 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.020
 even CNG systems today can 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.150
 provide the vehicle when you need it 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.490
 the necessary amount of naphtha for not 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.840
 lose power and to maintain 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.840
 exactly the same lifespan 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.870
 mean we are seeing the installation 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.060
 and they are placing a fifth team 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.340
 generation as we are in the middle 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.290
 of the process but you can see 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.109
 we are basically injecting with a 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.790
 multipoint ramp the gas exactly the 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.710
 same way that it would enter the naphtha at 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.590
 engine then here we see the two ramps 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.449
 in section the CNG and the naphtha that 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.060
 comes originally in the car are very 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.889
 close and from here aisha se 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.990
 injects one fuel or the other the 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.090
 same way in the engine when it is 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.639
 running the gas the brain of 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.350
 team cheats in some way the 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.490
 Sinai naphtha system the system 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.930
 naphtha and makes him believe that they are giving 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.270
 naphtha as those of the values ​​are 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.000
 similar there is very little difference 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.289
 equipment has a self-adjustment system 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.289
 the car does not realize that they are giving 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.430
 we realize that I bring my 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.289
 auto or I do not count time I need to 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.180
 make this facility in my schedule 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.000
 work in the day we take out without fifth 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.520
 down put generation down 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.889
 the tubes took a day for the subject 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.110
 of the location can be below 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.910
 chassis inside the trunk and we see that in 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.289
 some models like these hours are 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.229
 use to the taste of the spare wheel 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:22.240
 cs and the regular maintenance of a 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.400
 team of which in this case that 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.139
 they are fifth generation is every 20,000 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.990
 kilometers an oil filter is changed 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.759
 that goes before the regulator and the ramp 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.830
 so that it does not spoil every 60 thousand 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.940
 we started the ramp and each 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.729
 90 minutes 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.500
 we clean the equipment why 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:42.400
 of the compressors of the stations 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.199
 they filter oil towards the part of now 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.020
 the million dollar question costs me 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:49.449
 a CNG team today we install the 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.789
 fully installed equipment enabled to 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:54.250
 ready to circulate we are talking about that 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:57.699
 is more or less with a cylinder 60 16 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:00.130
 thousand 900 pesos and one with double cylinder 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.060
 there are 17,900 pesos and this also 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.740
 can pay 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.870
 of course so the ideal would be 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.460
 pay the bill because I had been paying 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.200
 with the amortization then 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:17.710
 practically that the more its moorings 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:20.470
 from his father to summarize a bit this 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.110
 CNG issue remains to say that nobody 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.900
 put a 'gaza' the car because you like the 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.790
 gas is a matter of economy let's 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.669
 take a case of someone who uses a lot 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.830
 his car that travels 100 kilometers 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:35.380
 day every day from Monday to Friday 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.540
 with your car and suppose that person 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.780
 He has a gasoline car that he spends in 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:43.180
 average 10 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:47.560
 then those 100 kilometers that runs 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:50.080
 per day they will end up being 625 pesos 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.610
 of naphtha every week always taking in 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.330
 account for the price of super naphtha that 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:57.669
 is approximately 12 pesos with 50 if 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.370
 we take into account that the consumption more or 

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:03.639
 less equivalent in CNG to one liter of 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.650
 naphtha is 12 meters of gas and if 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:06.820
 we have in mind that the gas meter in 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:10.510
 average costs 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:14.280
 weights with 36 not good that person is going to 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:17.380
 spend just 198 pesos of gas 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:19.750
 practically the third part we are going to 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:23.920
 see that with that level of consumption we have 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:27.610
 about 30 thousand pesos of naphtha 

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:31.390
 year and with CNG the same calculation gives us 9 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:34.390
 thousand 500 pesos is saved per year 20 thousand 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:37.000
 500 pesos of fuel using genes 

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:39.400
 therefore the first year of use is already 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.800
 amortized the CNG team if there is someone 

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.780
 that has an even more intensive use what 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.640
 amortize before and if the car is not used 

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:48.340
 too much maybe we are going to use a 

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:51.340
 shortly after but always the equation of 

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:54.000
 use is totally convenient for the 

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.000
 genesis
