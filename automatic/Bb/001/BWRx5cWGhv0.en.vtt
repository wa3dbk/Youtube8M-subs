00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
 Y 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.880
 do not 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.740
 and how very good is the expert 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.800
 new notice 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.110
 here in the alberto sector channel 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.070
 good in this case we are 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:29.699
 experiencing a rom that the truth does not 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:34.070
 I do not know on what date released was released 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:37.940
 but in the law for droid crappy himself 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.970
 well this room is very recommended for 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.150
 those who like a lot on the internet and 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:48.650
 it's as much as it was for facebook pace 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:52.190
 whatsapp and that frees me quite a 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:56.090
 little more than ram and 120 up 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.710
 then we said that they are common evidence 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.940
 to increase memory 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:10.350
 well let's make us 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:13.670
 this is the explorer we open it without 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.670
 permission this route 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.410
 the live retreat 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.320
 then they attend and this one of employees 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:27.840
 double we click and wait for 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.840
 tell us we are going to open them with 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.070
 text editor 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.150
 that for all this information to you 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:53.490
 in any this works in any 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:53.490
 type of course more in the ctv 693 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:05.740
 well let's find what is called 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:08.700
 and one that is called rock point 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:14.480
 lidia gomez 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.480
 a good point let me look for it 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:25.890
 or medium and a bass and a bass of j 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.890
 good 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.060
 this first of all 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.099
 First of all I 'm sorry to modify the 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:40.420
 attitude appear in a moment but here 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:44.040
 you put on we're going to put this text that 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.950
 stand out space 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:53.519
 Enable to store the launcher in 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:59.670
 memory of truth is not then that is this 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:03:01.349
 but I want to look like that before 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.819
 put this you must verify that this one 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:08.220
 it's up but it's good up text 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.620
 Above these text you put this 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.379
 of enabling love storage in 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.590
 the author in memory already from there everything 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:20.340
 to do this it's going to look like one 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.340
 you put minus 25 and that's going to release a lot 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.379
 more ram 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.379
 and that would be absolutely everything 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.220
 no longer would it be a matter of restarting the 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.100
