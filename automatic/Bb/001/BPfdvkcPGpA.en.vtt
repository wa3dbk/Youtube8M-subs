00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.629
 with budding engineers at home 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.980

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.899
 own vehicles are screens 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.329
 tactile made it really very 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.430

 a case-by-case suspension of the fins 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.489

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.729
 trial 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.030
 one of the things I like most about 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.740
 from scratch is that we are always in 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.140
 to tell you stories at 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.550
 this is their specialty here at 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.170
 kingdom animal park to dezon 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.430
 the expedition is true it is the story 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.600
 of a mountain expedition that will see 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.009
 the marriage as such is part 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.640
 large roller coaster of detainees 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.640
 it's a must 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.159
 I love to make shipments and even brest 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.570
 the queue of an iphone is like 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.350
 a kind of museums on expeditions 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.350
 in the mountains 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.409
 of years that I do not tell you why 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.520
 but we cross hayettes cypihot again 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.940
 the rule in super fun it's clever 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.940
 come 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.110
 it's that match 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.229
 we arrive at claims in Hollywood 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.899
 studios the first thing I want 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.899
 do is rock n roll coasters sea 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.760
 it's my management it's all about 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.959
 the state asks to see 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.180
 just because his life upside down 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.920
 laonnois it's going super fast but also 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.450
 because it's rock'n roll history 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.220
 is based on the universe of redheads but 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.599
 throughout the course we follow the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.519
 barley musicians who play at the 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.340
 console where they are obviously very 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:38.310
 kids so it's going so fast it's 0 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.310
 95 kg now in less than 3 seconds 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.400
 before the vote an increase of 18.1 others 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.620
 rides that I love is twilight 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.000
 the towers 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.620
 it's a haunted house mix and 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.820
 Sauerkraut 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.540
 we walk aboard the song 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.370
 during the scorer author 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.110
 and there obviously without warning us he 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.110
 we must fall back from Therese Bishops 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:19.100
 it's completely terrorized we are 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:22.670
 survivors taponnat the 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.020
 it's a bit by allowing you to laugh in 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.460
 every carousel and pictures that 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.960
 presents automatically that one can 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.340
 buy them after but me what I like 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.030
 it's making faces funny at every 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.030
 times like that 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.940
 the favorite ride at magic kingdoms is 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.940
 the big thunder mountain 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.239
 for this not the withdrawal bar in a 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.239
 gold mine 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.000
 recently discovered the mind trine a 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.170
 family russian mountain based on 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.909
 the story of the seven dwarves as in 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.290
 snow white it's the roller coaster 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.870
 more sinuous and the most incredible 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.459
 worthy or fan of cylinders I could 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.349
 you talk for the sliders 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.939
 rides to disneyland so there is 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.040
 so so the proof game talk about 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.940
 space mountain like story mania 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.500
 Pirates of the Caribbean 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.920

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.920
