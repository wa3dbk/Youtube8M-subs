hello<00:00:05.460> I'm<00:00:06.180> here<00:00:06.420> today<00:00:06.750> as<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.589> request

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
hello I'm here today as a request

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.680 
hello I'm here today as a request
because<00:00:08.400> somebody<00:00:08.879> asked<00:00:09.150> me<00:00:09.180> to<00:00:09.389> talk<00:00:09.540> about

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
because somebody asked me to talk about

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.310 
because somebody asked me to talk about
high<00:00:10.530> fly<00:00:10.770> cables<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.599> there's<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.660> reason<00:00:13.080> why

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
high fly cables and there's a reason why

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.499 
high fly cables and there's a reason why
I<00:00:13.860> haven't<00:00:14.219> done<00:00:14.429> in<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.639> past<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.269> that's

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
I haven't done in the past and that's

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.290 
I haven't done in the past and that's
because<00:00:16.550> it's<00:00:17.550> one<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.330> darkest<00:00:19.050> sort<00:00:19.739> of

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
because it's one of the darkest sort of

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.700 
because it's one of the darkest sort of
most<00:00:22.820> unfathomable<00:00:23.820> area<00:00:24.509> of<00:00:24.660> hi-fi<00:00:24.899> that<00:00:25.619> you

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
most unfathomable area of hi-fi that you

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.310 
most unfathomable area of hi-fi that you
can<00:00:25.860> ever<00:00:26.070> really<00:00:26.849> sort<00:00:27.270> of<00:00:27.360> imagine<00:00:28.079> and<00:00:28.230> we

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
can ever really sort of imagine and we

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.409 
can ever really sort of imagine and we
like<00:00:28.470> with<00:00:28.649> ordinary<00:00:29.099> components<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.059> things

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
like with ordinary components and things

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.659 
like with ordinary components and things
-<00:00:31.020> manufacturers<00:00:31.739> as<00:00:31.860> I've<00:00:31.980> said<00:00:32.160> before<00:00:32.220> they

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
- manufacturers as I've said before they

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.979 
- manufacturers as I've said before they
do<00:00:32.730> like<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.030> try<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.390> blind<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.809> with

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
do like to try and blind you with

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.460 
do like to try and blind you with
science<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:35.399> really<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.660> science<00:00:37.020> has<00:00:37.170> very

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
science and really the science has very

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.040 
science and really the science has very
little<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.920> do<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.240> what<00:00:39.240> the<00:00:39.390> stuff<00:00:39.600> sounds

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
little to do with what the stuff sounds

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.010 
little to do with what the stuff sounds
like<00:00:40.230> okay<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.760> that's<00:00:42.270> why<00:00:42.510> I've<00:00:42.630> not<00:00:42.810> really

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
like okay so that's why I've not really

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.640 
like okay so that's why I've not really
talked<00:00:43.230> about<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> past<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:45.650> do

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
talked about it in the past and I do

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.490 
talked about it in the past and I do
know<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.250> philosophy<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:47.940> cables<00:00:48.870> though<00:00:49.079> or

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
know the philosophy of cables though or

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.710 
know the philosophy of cables though or
what<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.040> what<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.550> philosophy<00:00:51.120> ought<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.570> be

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
what the what the philosophy ought to be

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.750 
what the what the philosophy ought to be
and<00:00:53.690> it<00:00:54.690> goes<00:00:54.989> something<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.040> that

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
and it goes something like this that

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.530 
and it goes something like this that
they're<00:00:57.000> there<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.630> tweak<00:00:58.020> an<00:00:58.340> otherwise

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
they're there to tweak an otherwise

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.109 
they're there to tweak an otherwise
acceptable<00:01:00.540> or<00:01:00.810> good<00:01:01.350> HiFi<00:01:03.500> in<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:05.009> room<00:01:05.670> or

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
acceptable or good HiFi in a room or

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.370 
acceptable or good HiFi in a room or
something<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.720> where<00:01:07.079> something

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
something like that where something

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.340 
something like that where something
isn't<00:01:07.950> quite<00:01:08.070> right<00:01:08.190> and<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:09.210> need<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.810> sort

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
isn't quite right and you need to sort

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.830 
isn't quite right and you need to sort
it<00:01:10.500> out<00:01:10.620> and<00:01:10.830> meet<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.190> example<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.390> will

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
it out and meet the example but I will

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.490 
it out and meet the example but I will
give<00:01:13.440> is<00:01:14.210> from<00:01:15.210> my<00:01:15.330> own<00:01:15.479> experience<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
give is from my own experience and

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.730 
give is from my own experience and
you'll<00:01:17.220> hear<00:01:17.640> about<00:01:17.760> it<00:01:18.120> a<00:01:18.180> bit<00:01:18.330> more<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.840> my

that<00:01:32.760> were<00:01:32.940> being<00:01:33.210> problems<00:01:33.840> or<00:01:34.799> some<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.250> my

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400

mainly to do with the bass in the room

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.870 
mainly to do with the bass in the room
that<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.549> was<00:01:44.850> listening<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.240> them<00:01:45.600> at<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.619> time

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
that I was listening to them at the time

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.289 
that I was listening to them at the time
the<00:01:47.880> bass<00:01:48.090> was<00:01:48.659> slightly<00:01:49.229> too<00:01:49.740> heavy<00:01:50.270> when<00:01:51.270> I

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the bass was slightly too heavy when I

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.480 
the bass was slightly too heavy when I
played<00:01:51.630> them<00:01:51.900> on<00:01:53.090> you<00:01:54.090> know<00:01:54.210> really<00:01:54.750> top<00:01:55.049> end

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
played them on you know really top end

which is in hi-fi terms very cheap they

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.660 
which is in hi-fi terms very cheap they
were<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.250> radar<00:02:06.240> s3s<00:02:06.920> I've<00:02:07.920> got<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.220> arteries

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
were the radar s3s I've got the arteries

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.609 
were the radar s3s I've got the arteries
which<00:02:09.090> are<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
which are the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.720 
which are the
sort<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.099> previous<00:02:11.849> generation<00:02:12.450> model<00:02:12.810> I

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
sort of previous generation model I

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.880 
sort of previous generation model I
suddenly<00:02:14.730> realize<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.360> actually<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.620> base

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
suddenly realize that actually that base

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.110 
suddenly realize that actually that base
isn't<00:02:17.400> really<00:02:17.670> there<00:02:18.049> and<00:02:19.310> that<00:02:20.310> yeah<00:02:20.549> I<00:02:20.760> was

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
isn't really there and that yeah I was

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.210 
isn't really there and that yeah I was
having<00:02:21.420> problems<00:02:21.810> with<00:02:22.019> my<00:02:22.230> with<00:02:22.890> my<00:02:23.040> base

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
having problems with my with my base

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:31.190 
having problems with my with my base
control<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:27.170> rather<00:02:28.170> than<00:02:29.060> sort<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.200> going

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
control and so rather than sort of going

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.360 
control and so rather than sort of going
through<00:02:31.349> all<00:02:32.129> the<00:02:33.379> all<00:02:34.379> my<00:02:34.590> own<00:02:34.739> salaries<00:02:35.190> and

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
through all the all my own salaries and

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.770
