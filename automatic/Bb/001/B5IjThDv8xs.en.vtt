 hello techno friends minutes and of 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.000
 virtualize i am bed borrero and thank you 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.100
 for being here good one of the 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.530
 main problems that we have when 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.510
 we bought a new android and we have a 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.210
 iphone is we are changing our 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.100
 iphone by an android is like my grams 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.500
 the contacts so the first thing that 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.110
 let's do is make sure that 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.120
 you have synchronized your contacts 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.650
 with icloud and this you do it already 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.469
 basically automatically in the 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.329
 good phone to start with the 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.380
 tutorial it is important that you have 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.900
 activated the icloud inside your iphone and 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.180
 it's very simple you are going to go to the area 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.700
 settings will look for the icloud option 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.960
 and you have to make sure that the option that 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:54.559
 says contacts be in on be in the area 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.880
 blue then you have that ready the 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.040
 phone will synchronize 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.559
 Automatically your contacts with icloud 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.260
 and then we are going to start the process 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.409
 of accelerate cop and synchronize your 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.869
 icloud contacts from your iphone to your 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.630
 new android phone then you are going 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:14.630
 icloud.com is registered 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.729
 with your account and contact number in 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.420
 this case after you enter here to 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.479
 contacts will give the control button to 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.970
 which means select or if you 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.310
 set the number of contact numbers 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.100
 in my case they are thousand 608 at this moment 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.560
 so control 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.759
 here a moment and I have only one 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.380
 control has chosen the 1,608 I'm going to 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.420
 be little wheel that you see down here 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.330
 which says action menu I give here I give 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:51.370
 export vizcar I will give you here export 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:54.100
 card that is doing the process I'm going to 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.030
 place the one where it says sport sport of 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.990
 icloud bikers I'll put it here bs.f 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.340
 directly in the text you can catch 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.340
 any other place but in reality 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.830
 it can be the text after I have it 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.660
 here is already for you 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.880
 all my thousand 608 contacts 10 here and 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.140
 now I'm going to go to my gmail account in 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.030
 my gmail account 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.240
 I will go here when you normally 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.670
 is on it goes to this little arrow and it's going to 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.100
 give the contacts option as you 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.800
 here to contacts will take you to the area 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.650
 where you have your contacts and here 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.410
 a little bit further down there is an option that 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.420
 is going to tell you import contacts like 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.240
 you here to import contacts 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.430
 you are going to choose the file that is 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.510
 I already downloaded from icloud 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.209
 file looks for the file that 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.250
 what's it called we're going to look here sports 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.620
 icloud and karts 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.620
 open and I give him care 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.370
 but the process 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.510
 It's the load and 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.730
 Y 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.730
 perfect there they all passed 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.030
 and one of the things we're going to do 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.210
 Now, after all this happened, I'm going to 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:22.260
 go here where it says 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:25.110
 merckx woman duplicate 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.269
 this is very important to unite all 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.269
 the contacts I will give you merge 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.670
 and ready already attached to the contacts he 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.710
 understood that they were doubles this later 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.020
 you can check it one by one and now 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.030
 you are going to go to your android phone and 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.950
 with your jaime account to this same one that 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.470
 you have here synchronized puts it in 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.150
 your phone and automatically and to all 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:56.440
 your contacts will go directly to 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.080
 your android smartphone now what happens 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.000
 if you really want to keep 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.030
 synchronized your icloud with your phone 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.800
 well with your new android there 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.970
 an application called card de 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:13.239
 old guest and what this does is 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.840
 that automatically allows each time 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.549
 you update a web contact in 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.690
 icloud also updates it in your 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.600
 phone so he keeps it 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.130
 constantly working and synchronized 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.480
 good what you base this application 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.700
 let's say that is the option that you 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.370
 wants is very important that where it says 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.060
 server names you have to put there 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.070
 in that http address 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.139
 I will give you the address exactly 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.120
 at this time 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.599
 good this the address that you have 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.930
 to use where it says http contact 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:47.120
 s 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.690
 colon or colon six light 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:54.229
 contact point icloud.com server name 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.479
 to put that https contacts point to 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.340
 cloud and yours in that and me to the same 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.580
 icloud and his step give him next thing 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.560
 synchronize and it will automatically do 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.520
 the process that's basically what 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.320
 you have to do to maintain 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.940
 synchronized your contacts thank you for 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.360
