 because I'm going to make a 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.020
 tummy tuck the reasons that I'm 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:16.529
 here is because I'm chubby I feel 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.490
 Chubby and I want to see myself better I invite you 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.490
 to follow my change 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.420
 I would love it then we made a lipo 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.700
 tummy tuck which is nothing but 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.810
 a surgery in which a challenge is made 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:36.590
 of the skeletal fat skeleton of the 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:40.460
 person with cutting off excess skin 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.440
 that he has making a new navel and 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.900
 doing the repair of the musculature 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.210
 abdominal of the major recti 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.270
 abdomen of the patient not so that this 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.580
 here I can push the intestinal package 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.739
 you can push it back on 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.300
 diaphragm raise the ceiling raise bone 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.540
 completely position the posture of the 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.840
 person and stays with with some pounds 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.010
 less 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.470
 the evolution of the patient is good 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.479
 there are approximately 45 days left with 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.940
 trains that are to evacuate the liquid 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.470
 what remnant is left after the 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.770
 surgery those of mild are removed at 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.630
 fifth day and then the patient makes a 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.300
 normal life with the girdle we do not have to 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.130
 get points or anything from those things 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.130
 because the points fall on their own 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.610
 He tells me why I do not finish this 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.340
 little fat that has next to the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.570
 bust and it's because we've done a great 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.780
 Track back destruction 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.970
 part of the hips the abdomen the 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.409
 flanks we have done a tummy tuck 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.060
 they take out a lot of skin and 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.460
 fat and obviously you lose a lot 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.549
 blood 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.140
 you can not take more than 6 liters to 7 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.600
 liters of fat in a person because 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.570
 drags a lot of blood and the patient in 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.920
 instead of recovering quietly in a 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.750
 day at the clinic, it will happen to 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.000
 intensive care and that there is not 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.400
 the objective we seek in this surgery 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.959
 but that everyone goes well I'm 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.180
 here we can do it in a second 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.069
 time or the same with the diet that is going 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.850
 to give so she will lower it and there will be no 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.850
 no problem 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.849
 throughout the surgical procedure of 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.340
 plastic security is essential 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.720
 do the others in lymphatics which 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.870
 they are accompanied by appliances 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.360
 cosmetic and it is recommended 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.260
 be from the fifth day to avoid 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.299
 that inflammation and edema increase 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.549
 exaggeratedly the patient then go away 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:52.049
 evacuating body fluids 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.049
