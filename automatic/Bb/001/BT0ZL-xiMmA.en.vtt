Hello and welcome to Archana's Rasoi.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.440
Today I'm going to show you how to make Chikoo Barfi.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:17.920
When ever we go to the market we always find black current barfi, mango barfi and various other Barfi's

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.560
But I tried this Barfi at home, because we never buy chikoo barfi.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.020
For that Stay tuned to Archana's Rasoi.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.480
Lets see the ingredients needed for chikoo barfi.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.180
4-5 chikoo pulp, we've pealed the skin and grated it.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.520
150 grams Dried whole milk ( Khoya ), 3 tablespoon desiccated coconut, 1/2 cup sugar and some chopped cashews.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.260
Lets start making.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.820
First we'll mix Chikoo and sugar.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.460
Add 1/2 cup sugar to the pan, 4-5 chikoo pulp

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.580
We are not using water here, because the chikoo already contains water in it.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.440
So the Barfi should not become very thin in consistency.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.160
Mix the sugar and chikoo nicely.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.300
Cook on a low flame.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.600
Keep the temperature on 100

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.420
Because if you cook it on high flame your chikoo will get burnt and will lose its flavor.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.880
We're not adding any essence in it. We're adding natural flavors in it.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.980
Gauri Ganpati is coming soon and that's the reason I'm showing you all the sweet recipes

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:46.300
and we always have a question what new to make? and the sweets that we get from market are very expensive

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.300
So you make it at home and our recipe gets ready quickly.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.580
After the chikoo and sugar gets mix, add dried whole milk to it.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.580
Desiccated Coconut

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.180
Mix them well, keep mixing it till its ready

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.500
Do not preserve it for 2-3 days, finish it as soon as possible

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.040
If you want to shape it, you can do so.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.220
After it is nicely mixed increase the temperature

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.800
Increase it to 600

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.760
Desiccated coconut acts as a binding agent

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.320
You can make Strawberry, Mango Barfi similarly

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.580
Keep stirring it.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.780
The water released from the chikoo and the sugar that we've added will create a syrup.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.440
You've can make pieces of the sweet only after 2-3 minutes, If you try to cut it immediately it will get spoiled.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.760
Lets switch off the gas.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.520
Take it out in a plate.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.280
You can also use aluminium tray or the normal steel plate.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.500
Lets arrange it nicely in a dish.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.920
The Barfi should be 1/2 - 1 cm thick

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.280
Top it with cashews

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.500
Pat it slightly after adding the cashews, so that it sticks to the barfi.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.780
And after 15 - 20 minutes you can cut it.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.540
Our Chikoo Barfi is ready.
