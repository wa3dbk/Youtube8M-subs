00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
worth all these waypoints are and you're

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:26.069 
worth all these waypoints are and you're
not<00:01:25.030> really<00:01:25.180> paying<00:01:25.420> attention<00:01:25.570> because<00:01:26.020> you

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
not really paying attention because you

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:27.450 
not really paying attention because you
kind<00:01:26.259> of<00:01:26.289> got<00:01:26.409> it<00:01:26.500> zoomed<00:01:26.740> in<00:01:26.920> every<00:01:27.189> time<00:01:27.340> you

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
kind of got it zoomed in every time you

catch<00:01:27.610> one<00:01:27.789> or<00:01:27.909> get<00:01:28.000> a<00:01:28.060> bite<00:01:28.270> you're<00:01:28.450> just

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
catch one or get a bite you're just

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.600 
catch one or get a bite you're just
hitting<00:01:28.750> a<00:01:28.840> waypoint<00:01:28.960> you<00:01:29.799> know<00:01:29.920> get<00:01:30.430> another

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
hitting a waypoint you know get another

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.100 
hitting a waypoint you know get another
one<00:01:30.700> you're<00:01:30.850> hitting<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.090> waypoint<00:01:31.210> what

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
one you're hitting a waypoint what

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.340 
one you're hitting a waypoint what
happens<00:01:32.530> is<00:01:32.710> when<00:01:32.920> you<00:01:33.009> zoom<00:01:33.250> that<00:01:33.460> thing<00:01:33.729> out

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
happens is when you zoom that thing out

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.679 
happens is when you zoom that thing out
there's<00:01:35.520> inevitably<00:01:36.520> every<00:01:37.210> time<00:01:37.450> whether

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
there's inevitably every time whether

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.480 
there's inevitably every time whether
it's<00:01:37.899> on<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.049> Potomac<00:01:38.469> River<00:01:38.619> or<00:01:38.979> Champlain

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
it's on the Potomac River or Champlain

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.120 
it's on the Potomac River or Champlain
or<00:01:39.729> Lake<00:01:39.850> Okeechobee<00:01:40.469> you'll<00:01:41.469> see<00:01:41.740> clusters

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
or Lake Okeechobee you'll see clusters

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.800 
or Lake Okeechobee you'll see clusters
of<00:01:42.549> waypoints<00:01:43.270> and<00:01:44.460> what<00:01:45.460> you<00:01:45.609> can<00:01:45.759> do<00:01:45.939> is<00:01:46.240> but

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
of waypoints and what you can do is but

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.749 
of waypoints and what you can do is but
then<00:01:46.990> you<00:01:47.200> found<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.829> two<00:01:47.979> or<00:01:48.130> three<00:01:48.310> places

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
then you found the two or three places

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.399 
then you found the two or three places
in<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.000> grass<00:01:49.179> bed<00:01:49.479> where<00:01:49.750> all<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:49.990> fish<00:01:50.170> are

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
in the grass bed where all the fish are

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.560 
in the grass bed where all the fish are
so<00:01:51.100> you've<00:01:51.250> eliminated<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.969> unproductive

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
so you've eliminated the unproductive

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.950 
so you've eliminated the unproductive
areas<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:54.060> you're<00:01:55.060> you're<00:01:55.420> on<00:01:55.600> the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
areas and you're you're on the

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.539 
areas and you're you're on the
productive<00:01:56.409> areas<00:01:56.710> so<00:01:56.829> what<00:01:56.979> I'll<00:01:57.100> typically

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
productive areas so what I'll typically

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.660 
productive areas so what I'll typically
do<00:01:57.820> is<00:01:58.090> I'll<00:01:58.869> leave<00:01:59.140> like<00:01:59.350> one<00:01:59.409> way<00:02:00.159> point<00:02:00.460> in

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
do is I'll leave like one way point in

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.039 
do is I'll leave like one way point in
the<00:02:00.789> center<00:02:01.030> of<00:02:01.149> that<00:02:01.270> cluster<00:02:01.630> of<00:02:01.810> waypoints

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
the center of that cluster of waypoints

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.620 
the center of that cluster of waypoints
and<00:02:02.520> then<00:02:03.520> erase<00:02:03.789> all<00:02:03.999> those<00:02:04.119> other<00:02:04.299> ones<00:02:04.420> Sun

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
and then erase all those other ones Sun

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.969 
and then erase all those other ones Sun
will<00:02:04.749> have<00:02:04.780> all<00:02:05.020> that<00:02:05.140> clutter<00:02:05.380> on<00:02:05.499> my<00:02:05.679> screen

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
will have all that clutter on my screen

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.880 
will have all that clutter on my screen
and<00:02:06.549> then<00:02:06.820> I<00:02:06.909> just<00:02:07.119> have<00:02:07.270> this<00:02:07.420> this<00:02:07.840> big<00:02:08.140> bay

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
and then I just have this this big bay

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.550 
and then I just have this this big bay
and<00:02:09.280> I<00:02:10.000> got<00:02:10.210> three<00:02:10.479> waypoints<00:02:11.020> I<00:02:11.140> know<00:02:11.230> when<00:02:11.530> I

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
and I got three waypoints I know when I

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.740 
and I got three waypoints I know when I
go<00:02:11.770> in<00:02:11.950> there<00:02:12.159> go<00:02:13.150> right<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.450> one<00:02:13.569> of<00:02:13.629> those

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
go in there go right to one of those

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.449 
go in there go right to one of those
waypoints<00:02:14.349> and<00:02:14.349> just<00:02:14.680> fish<00:02:14.860> little<00:02:15.129> circles

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
waypoints and just fish little circles

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.580 
waypoints and just fish little circles
around<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:15.879> and<00:02:16.060> don't<00:02:16.750> mess<00:02:16.959> around<00:02:17.140> with<00:02:17.440> any

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
around it and don't mess around with any

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.940 
around it and don't mess around with any
of<00:02:17.709> the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
of the

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.280 
of the
just<00:02:18.550> when<00:02:19.209> I<00:02:19.239> feel<00:02:19.510> like<00:02:19.629> I've<00:02:19.840> covered<00:02:20.050> that

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
just when I feel like I've covered that

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.100 
just when I feel like I've covered that
area<00:02:20.590> pretty<00:02:20.770> good<00:02:21.540> kick<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.660> on<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.810> trolling

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
area pretty good kick it on the trolling

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.690 
area pretty good kick it on the trolling
motor<00:02:23.140> or<00:02:23.500> get<00:02:23.709> on<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.890> big<00:02:24.040> motor<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.550> run

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
motor or get on the big motor and run

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.610 
motor or get on the big motor and run
over<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.120> other<00:02:25.239> way<00:02:25.450> point<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:25.989> fish

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
over to the other way point and fish

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.470 
over to the other way point and fish
around<00:02:26.769> there<00:02:27.160> because<00:02:27.670> like<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.090> said<00:02:28.150> once

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
around there because like I said once

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.839 
around there because like I said once
again<00:02:28.780> when<00:02:28.959> you<00:02:29.110> zoomed<00:02:29.410> out<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.610> saw

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
again when you zoomed out and you saw

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.759 
again when you zoomed out and you saw
every<00:02:31.209> bite<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:31.480> had<00:02:31.870> on<00:02:32.200> your<00:02:32.290> screen<00:02:32.739> or

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
every bite you had on your screen or

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.030 
every bite you had on your screen or
every<00:02:33.190> fish<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.580> you<00:02:33.670> caught<00:02:35.040> always

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
every fish that you caught always

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.440 
every fish that you caught always
there's<00:02:36.310> those<00:02:36.459> little<00:02:36.700> clusters<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.269> that's

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
there's those little clusters and that's

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.930 
there's those little clusters and that's
just<00:02:37.720> that<00:02:38.500> narrows<00:02:38.800> it<00:02:38.950> down<00:02:39.130> it<00:02:39.459> takes<00:02:39.670> it

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
just that narrows it down it takes it

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.540 
just that narrows it down it takes it
takes<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.840> know<00:02:40.870> maybe<00:02:41.590> not<00:02:41.800> one<00:02:42.069> whole<00:02:42.280> day

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
takes you know maybe not one whole day

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.930 
takes you know maybe not one whole day
to<00:02:43.030> do<00:02:43.209> to<00:02:43.599> do<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.810> bay<00:02:44.489> but<00:02:45.489> you<00:02:45.670> know<00:02:45.760> might<00:02:45.910> be

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
to do to do a bay but you know might be

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.880 
to do to do a bay but you know might be
able<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.209> do<00:02:46.299> it<00:02:46.330> in<00:02:46.420> half<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.810> day<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.319> even<00:02:47.739> if

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
able to do it in half a day and even if

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.770 
able to do it in half a day and even if
even<00:02:48.099> if<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.519> do<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:48.819> very<00:02:48.940> quickly<00:02:49.180> just<00:02:49.629> do

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
even if you do it very quickly just do

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.690 
even if you do it very quickly just do
like<00:02:49.930> maybe<00:02:50.170> two<00:02:50.470> swipes<00:02:50.739> across<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.370> this<00:02:51.519> way

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
like maybe two swipes across it this way

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.309 
like maybe two swipes across it this way
and<00:02:51.880> two<00:02:52.000> swipes<00:02:52.209> across<00:02:52.569> the<00:02:52.720> bay<00:02:52.870> this<00:02:53.080> way

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
and two swipes across the bay this way

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.920 
and two swipes across the bay this way
but<00:02:54.099> still<00:02:54.370> you'll<00:02:54.610> get<00:02:54.880> those<00:02:55.090> those<00:02:55.630> little

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
but still you'll get those those little

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.390 
but still you'll get those those little
clusters<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:57.730> will<00:02:58.150> make<00:02:58.989> you<00:02:59.200> so<00:02:59.920> much<00:03:00.130> better

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
clusters it will make you so much better

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.100 
clusters it will make you so much better
so<00:03:00.790> much<00:03:00.819> more<00:03:01.180> efficient<00:03:01.599> and<00:03:01.660> catch<00:03:01.840> so<00:03:02.049> many

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
so much more efficient and catch so many

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.680 
so much more efficient and catch so many
more<00:03:02.349> bass<00:03:02.560> just<00:03:03.459> by<00:03:03.579> doing<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.390> there's

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
more bass just by doing that and there's

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.979 
more bass just by doing that and there's
big<00:03:05.310> expanse<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.489> grass<00:03:06.760> beds<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.360> of<00:03:07.780> course

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
big expanse of grass beds and of course

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:08.819 
big expanse of grass beds and of course
you're<00:03:08.170> going<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.349> have<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.500> take<00:03:08.650> into

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
you're going to have to take into

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.640 
you're going to have to take into
consideration<00:03:09.670> as<00:03:09.880> you're<00:03:10.510> doing<00:03:10.660> that<00:03:10.870> what

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
consideration as you're doing that what

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.110 
consideration as you're doing that what
we<00:03:11.739> talked<00:03:11.950> about<00:03:12.040> earlier<00:03:12.220> is<00:03:12.849> you<00:03:13.060> know

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
we talked about earlier is you know

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.550 
we talked about earlier is you know
where<00:03:13.299> you<00:03:13.450> think<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.750> fish<00:03:13.900> should<00:03:14.140> be<00:03:14.290> so<00:03:14.500> if

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
where you think the fish should be so if

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.839 
where you think the fish should be so if
you<00:03:14.680> get<00:03:14.829> into<00:03:14.980> an<00:03:15.160> area<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:15.519> you<00:03:15.579> think<00:03:15.760> the
