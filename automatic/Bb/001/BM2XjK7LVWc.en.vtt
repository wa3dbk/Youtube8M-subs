my my front foot as I do this let's see
we're<00:02:05.820> going<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.060> get<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.210> slow-mo<00:02:06.780> angle<00:02:07.409> in

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
we're going to get a slow-mo angle in

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.820 
we're going to get a slow-mo angle in
here<00:02:07.799> somewhere<00:02:08.210> I'm<00:02:09.210> going<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.539> pop<00:02:09.930> my<00:02:10.440> front

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
here somewhere I'm going to pop my front

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.040 
here somewhere I'm going to pop my front
foot<00:02:10.920> up<00:02:11.190> really<00:02:11.820> just<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.330> real<00:02:12.660> quick

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
foot up really just like a real quick

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.110 
foot up really just like a real quick
snap<00:02:13.500> right<00:02:13.920> here<00:02:14.190> so

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
snap right here so

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.479 
snap right here so
snap<00:02:15.420> right<00:02:15.840> there<00:02:15.900> did<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.769> see<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.159> and

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
snap right there did you see that and

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.449 
snap right there did you see that and
that<00:02:18.060> point<00:02:18.780> right<00:02:19.290> there<00:02:19.319> is<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.099> exact

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
that point right there is the exact

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.880 
that point right there is the exact
point<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:21.030> makes<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.540> skateboard<00:02:22.470> actually

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
point that makes the skateboard actually

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.610 
point that makes the skateboard actually
do<00:02:23.129> its<00:02:23.400> spin<00:02:23.909> so<00:02:24.810> that's<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.170> thing<00:02:25.349> you<00:02:25.440> need

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
do its spin so that's the thing you need

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.869 
do its spin so that's the thing you need
to<00:02:25.709> work<00:02:25.920> on<00:02:26.099> just<00:02:26.430> practice<00:02:26.849> practice

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
to work on just practice practice

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.080 
to work on just practice practice
practice<00:02:27.330> practice<00:02:27.780> practice<00:02:28.200> practice

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
practice practice practice practice

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.399 
practice practice practice practice
definitely<00:02:30.090> makes<00:02:30.330> perfect<00:02:30.780> on<00:02:30.900> these<00:02:31.080> things

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
definitely makes perfect on these things

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.069 
definitely makes perfect on these things
cool<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:32.519> again<00:02:32.819> this<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.510> going<00:02:33.659> to<00:02:33.720> be<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.870> much

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
cool so again this is going to be a much

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.300 
cool so again this is going to be a much
better<00:02:34.349> view<00:02:34.879> watch<00:02:35.879> that<00:02:36.120> front<00:02:36.360> foot<00:02:36.799> as<00:02:37.799> I'm

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
better view watch that front foot as I'm

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.039 
better view watch that front foot as I'm
coming<00:02:38.549> up<00:02:38.790> i'll<00:02:38.970> drag<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.420> toe<00:02:39.659> up<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:39.959> then

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
coming up i'll drag that toe up and then

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.330 
coming up i'll drag that toe up and then
right<00:02:40.319> here<00:02:41.450> snap<00:02:42.450> pop<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.470> ankle<00:02:43.890> up<00:02:44.069> into

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
right here snap pop the ankle up into

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.850 
right here snap pop the ankle up into
the<00:02:44.459> air<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.940> it's<00:02:45.239> that<00:02:45.480> motion<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.349> popping

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
the air and it's that motion of popping

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.729 
the air and it's that motion of popping
my<00:02:46.980> ankle<00:02:47.459> like<00:02:48.090> popping<00:02:48.569> my<00:02:48.599> toe<00:02:48.750> up<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:49.620> the

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
my ankle like popping my toe up in the

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.890 
my ankle like popping my toe up in the
air<00:02:49.890> i<00:02:49.920> guess<00:02:50.160> i<00:02:50.280> should<00:02:50.519> say<00:02:50.819> by<00:02:51.090> moving<00:02:51.780> my

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
air i guess i should say by moving my

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.050 
air i guess i should say by moving my
ankle<00:02:52.349> up<00:02:52.440> really<00:02:52.799> fast<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.519> that's<00:02:53.760> what

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
ankle up really fast and that's what

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.759 
ankle up really fast and that's what
causes<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.569> board<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.989> actually<00:02:55.349> do<00:02:55.590> that

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
causes the board to actually do that

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.160 
causes the board to actually do that
spin<00:02:56.340> now<00:02:57.120> when<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.329> get<00:02:57.450> really<00:02:57.660> good<00:02:57.780> at<00:02:57.989> it

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
spin now when you get really good at it

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.130 
spin now when you get really good at it
it<00:02:58.530> will<00:02:58.769> just<00:02:58.879> flip<00:02:59.879> the<00:03:00.060> board<00:03:00.299> which<00:03:00.900> will

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
it will just flip the board which will

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.740 
it will just flip the board which will
then<00:03:01.319> suck<00:03:01.769> right<00:03:02.250> up<00:03:02.459> into<00:03:02.670> your<00:03:02.849> back<00:03:03.299> foot

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
then suck right up into your back foot

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.539 
then suck right up into your back foot
and<00:03:03.989> you'll<00:03:04.109> just<00:03:04.140> have<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.709> down<00:03:04.920> perfectly

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
and you'll just have it down perfectly

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.569 
and you'll just have it down perfectly
so<00:03:06.269> i<00:03:06.629> would<00:03:06.900> suggest<00:03:07.099> practicing<00:03:08.099> stepping

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
so i would suggest practicing stepping

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.780 
so i would suggest practicing stepping
