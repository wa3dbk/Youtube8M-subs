00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
this video let's get started so the best

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.560 
this video let's get started so the best
place<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.680> start<00:00:23.100> with<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.550> groove<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.150> to

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
place to start with that groove is to

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.230 
place to start with that groove is to
look<00:00:24.720> at<00:00:24.900> playing<00:00:25.170> our<00:00:25.500> accents<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.400> 16th

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
look at playing our accents on 16th

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.740 
look at playing our accents on 16th
notes<00:00:27.570> as<00:00:27.920> every<00:00:28.920> 3rd<00:00:29.189> 16th<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.390> here's<00:00:30.599> an

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
notes as every 3rd 16th so here's an

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.959 
notes as every 3rd 16th so here's an
exercise<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.529> build<00:00:31.710> up<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.700> start

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
exercise to build up to that you start

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.819 
exercise to build up to that you start
off<00:00:33.059> by<00:00:33.300> tapping<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.780> tempo<00:00:34.230> with<00:00:34.469> one<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.739> your

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
off by tapping a tempo with one of your

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.990 
off by tapping a tempo with one of your
feet<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:36.320> then<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.440> start<00:00:37.770> adding<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.280> just

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
feet and then you start adding in just

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.229 
feet and then you start adding in just
straight<00:00:39.660> sixteenth<00:00:40.170> notes<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:41.090> then<00:00:42.090> we'll

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
straight sixteenth notes and then we'll

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:58.090 
straight sixteenth notes and then we'll
start<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.660> build<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.989> up<00:00:43.140> into<00:00:43.379> those<00:00:43.739> accents

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.310 

let's<00:00:59.100> try<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.640> little<00:00:59.670> bit<00:01:00.000> slower<00:01:00.420> one

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
let's try that a little bit slower one

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:24.440 
let's try that a little bit slower one
two<00:01:02.359> three<00:01:03.359> four<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:23.220> next<00:01:23.520> step<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:24.060> be<00:01:24.119> to

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
two three four the next step can be to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.710 
two three four the next step can be to
push<00:01:24.630> those<00:01:24.900> accents<00:01:25.530> down<00:01:26.250> onto<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> base<00:01:26.970> so

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
push those accents down onto the base so

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.660 
push those accents down onto the base so
that<00:01:27.869> way<00:01:27.990> we're<00:01:28.229> go<00:01:28.829> down<00:01:28.979> every<00:01:29.220> third

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
that way we're go down every third

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.300 
that way we're go down every third
stroke<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> base<00:01:30.810> as<00:01:31.140> accents<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
stroke is on the base as accents and the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.679 
stroke is on the base as accents and the
rest<00:01:32.490> are<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:32.729> up<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.060> top<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.450> snare

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
rest are just up the top on the snare

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:48.190 
rest are just up the top on the snare
I'll<00:01:34.380> show<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.619> how<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.770> sounds<00:01:35.369> 1<00:01:35.759> 2<00:01:36.479> 3<00:01:36.920> 4

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.690 

so<00:01:49.200> make<00:01:49.380> sure<00:01:49.410> that<00:01:49.620> you're<00:01:49.860> tapping<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.670> of

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
so make sure that you're tapping one of

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.820 
so make sure that you're tapping one of
your<00:01:50.910> feet<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.570> keep<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.080> every<00:01:52.470> quarter

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
your feet to keep that every quarter

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.640 
your feet to keep that every quarter
note<00:01:53.010> tempo<00:01:53.520> going<00:01:53.760> there<00:01:54.120> because<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.320> next

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
note tempo going there because the next

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.160 
note tempo going there because the next
step<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:56.190> to<00:01:56.430> bring<00:01:56.580> in<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.970> snare<00:01:57.330> drum<00:01:57.360> accent

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
step is to bring in a snare drum accent

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.740 
step is to bring in a snare drum accent
on<00:01:58.380> beats<00:01:59.160> two<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.490> four<00:01:59.730> so<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.390> starts<00:02:00.690> to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
on beats two and four so it starts to

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:45.140 
on beats two and four so it starts to
become<00:02:00.900> a<00:02:01.080> groove<00:02:01.440> one<00:02:02.130> two<00:02:02.850> three<00:02:03.630> four<00:02:44.150> since

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
become a groove one two three four since

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.300 
become a groove one two three four since
you're<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.360> exercise<00:02:45.900> accents<00:02:46.800> have<00:02:46.890> been<00:02:47.100> on

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
you're the exercise accents have been on

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.820 
you're the exercise accents have been on
the<00:02:48.060> every<00:02:48.450> third<00:02:48.720> sixteenth<00:02:49.320> note<00:02:49.590> and

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
the every third sixteenth note and

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.040 
the every third sixteenth note and
that's<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.519> polyrhythmic<00:02:51.060> filled<00:02:51.570> so<00:02:51.930> we

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
that's that polyrhythmic filled so we

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.900 
that's that polyrhythmic filled so we
move<00:02:52.260> those<00:02:52.530> accents<00:02:53.010> down<00:02:53.370> onto<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.700> base

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
move those accents down onto the base

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.720 
move those accents down onto the base
and<00:02:54.150> then<00:02:54.600> add<00:02:54.840> in<00:02:55.110> our<00:02:55.200> snare<00:02:55.590> on<00:02:55.800> 2<00:02:55.950> &amp;<00:02:56.220> 4<00:02:56.430> and

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
and then add in our snare on 2 &amp; 4 and

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.120 
and then add in our snare on 2 &amp; 4 and
we<00:02:57.090> have<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.269> groove<00:02:57.570> so<00:02:58.500> if<00:02:58.620> you've<00:02:58.769> got<00:02:58.980> all

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
we have a groove so if you've got all

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.800 
we have a groove so if you've got all
that<00:02:59.280> together<00:02:59.489> here's<00:03:00.120> something<00:03:00.510> else<00:03:00.630> you

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
that together here's something else you

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.840 
that together here's something else you
can<00:03:01.049> try<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.340> probably<00:03:02.640> my<00:03:02.820> favorite

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
can try this is probably my favorite

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.720 
can try this is probably my favorite
