hi<00:00:10.530> this<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.830> Gary<00:00:11.190> boss<00:00:11.429> here<00:00:11.790> with<00:00:12.120> audio

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
hi this is Gary boss here with audio

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.509 
hi this is Gary boss here with audio
technica<00:00:12.540> talking<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.469> pro<00:00:13.650> audio<00:00:13.830> LAN<00:00:14.219> about

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
technica talking to pro audio LAN about

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.730 
technica talking to pro audio LAN about
some<00:00:14.759> microphone<00:00:15.299> information<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.289> right

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
some microphone information and right

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.779 
some microphone information and right
now<00:00:16.920> we're<00:00:17.070> gonna<00:00:17.190> talk<00:00:17.310> about<00:00:17.369> polar

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
now we're gonna talk about polar

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.689 
now we're gonna talk about polar
patterns<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.510> really<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.560> polar<00:00:19.920> pattern<00:00:20.400> at

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
patterns and really a polar pattern at

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.840 
patterns and really a polar pattern at
it's<00:00:21.000> very<00:00:21.090> core<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:22.140> how<00:00:22.500> well<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.130> microphone

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
it's very core is how well a microphone

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.179 
it's very core is how well a microphone
will<00:00:24.480> pick<00:00:24.510> up<00:00:24.840> sound<00:00:25.109> coming<00:00:25.830> at<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.070> from

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
will pick up sound coming at it from

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.830 
will pick up sound coming at it from
different<00:00:26.250> directions<00:00:27.029> from<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.420> front<00:00:27.750> from

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
different directions from the front from

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.480 
different directions from the front from
the<00:00:28.080> side<00:00:28.320> from<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.710> back<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.130> remember<00:00:29.400> this

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
the side from the back and remember this

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.209 
the side from the back and remember this
is<00:00:29.779> 360<00:00:30.779> degrees<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.260> where<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:31.890> not<00:00:32.009> just

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
is 360 degrees so where it's not just

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.860 
is 360 degrees so where it's not just
the<00:00:32.309> front<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> back<00:00:32.969> it's<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.390> top<00:00:33.630> and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
the front in the back it's the top and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.540 
the front in the back it's the top and
the<00:00:33.960> bottom<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.469> just<00:00:34.739> everything<00:00:35.280> and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
the bottom and just everything and

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.500 
the bottom and just everything and
whatever<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.270> is

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
whatever it is

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.020 
whatever it is
so<00:00:36.809> essentially<00:00:37.590> microphones<00:00:38.250> come<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.790> two

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
so essentially microphones come in two

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.209 
so essentially microphones come in two
basic<00:00:39.450> polar<00:00:40.079> pattern<00:00:40.530> flavors<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.190> have

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
basic polar pattern flavors we have

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.970 
basic polar pattern flavors we have
omnidirectional<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.770> unidirectional<00:00:43.770> so

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
omnidirectional and unidirectional so

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.250 
omnidirectional and unidirectional so
all<00:00:44.550> patterns<00:00:44.879> can<00:00:45.239> pretty<00:00:45.420> much<00:00:45.539> be<00:00:45.870> grouped

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
all patterns can pretty much be grouped

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.450 
all patterns can pretty much be grouped
into<00:00:46.469> those<00:00:46.770> omnidirectional<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:49.129> as<00:00:50.129> it

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
into those omnidirectional is as it

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.090 
into those omnidirectional is as it
sounds<00:00:51.059> omni<00:00:51.539> meaning<00:00:51.930> all<00:00:52.170> around<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.010> that's

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
sounds omni meaning all around so that's

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.310 
sounds omni meaning all around so that's
a<00:00:53.280> microphone<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:54.059> will<00:00:54.180> respond<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.899> sound

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
a microphone that will respond to sound

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.099 
a microphone that will respond to sound
equally<00:00:56.010> all<00:00:56.730> around<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.360> microphone<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.989> in

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
equally all around the microphone so in

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.139 
equally all around the microphone so in
front<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> side<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> top<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
front and the side and the top and the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.349 
front and the side and the top and the
bottom<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.800> was<00:01:01.949> an<00:01:02.070> omnidirectional

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
bottom so if this was an omnidirectional

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.460 
bottom so if this was an omnidirectional
microphone<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.570> could<00:01:03.750> rotate<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.409> this

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
microphone I could rotate it like this

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.710 
microphone I could rotate it like this
and<00:01:05.040> rotate<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.549> like<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:06.000> as<00:01:06.240> long<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.570> that

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
and rotate it like this as long as that

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.570 
and rotate it like this as long as that
was<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.140> still<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.950> center<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.460> my

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
was in this still the center and my

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.950 
was in this still the center and my
voice<00:01:08.790> would<00:01:09.060> not<00:01:09.240> change<00:01:09.510> that's<00:01:09.840> an

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
voice would not change that's an

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.679 
voice would not change that's an
omnidirectional<00:01:10.380> microphone<00:01:11.689> typical

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
omnidirectional microphone typical

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.670 
omnidirectional microphone typical
applications<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:13.439> omnidirectional

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
applications for omnidirectional

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.469 
applications for omnidirectional
microphones<00:01:14.430> are<00:01:14.520> going<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.760> like<00:01:14.880> room

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
microphones are going to be like room

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.700 
microphones are going to be like room
microphones<00:01:15.780> maybe<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.380> want<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.560> pick<00:01:16.650> up

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
microphones maybe you want to pick up

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.350 
microphones maybe you want to pick up
the<00:01:16.830> ambience<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.640> room<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.030> get<00:01:18.119> all<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
the ambience of the room and get all the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.840 
the ambience of the room and get all the
reflections<00:01:19.110> there's<00:01:19.650> some<00:01:19.890> popular<00:01:20.280> stereo

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
reflections there's some popular stereo

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.880 
reflections there's some popular stereo
recording<00:01:21.479> techniques<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.140> use<00:01:22.320> Omni

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
recording techniques that use Omni

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.859 
recording techniques that use Omni
microphones<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.729> then<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.119> lot<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.570> times

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
microphones and then in a lot of times

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.929 
microphones and then in a lot of times
in<00:01:25.020> video<00:01:25.380> applications<00:01:26.130> you'll<00:01:26.340> use<00:01:26.549> omni's

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
in video applications you'll use omni's

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.149 
in video applications you'll use omni's
as<00:01:27.119> lavalier<00:01:27.750> microphones<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.590> whatnot

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
as lavalier microphones and whatnot

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.010 
as lavalier microphones and whatnot
how<00:01:29.490> many<00:01:29.700> microphones<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.329> like<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> lavalier

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
how many microphones in like a lavalier

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.469 
how many microphones in like a lavalier
situation<00:01:31.650> typically<00:01:32.040> we'll<00:01:32.460> pick<00:01:33.210> up<00:01:33.329> less

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
situation typically we'll pick up less

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.270 
situation typically we'll pick up less
wind<00:01:33.810> noise<00:01:34.079> they're<00:01:34.500> less<00:01:34.680> susceptible<00:01:35.220> to

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
wind noise they're less susceptible to

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.210 
wind noise they're less susceptible to
clothing<00:01:35.729> noise<00:01:36.090> things<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.750> nature<00:01:37.220> so

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
clothing noise things of that nature so

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.380 
clothing noise things of that nature so
that's<00:01:38.310> an<00:01:38.490> omnidirectional<00:01:38.820> then

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
that's an omnidirectional then

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.359 
that's an omnidirectional then
unidirectional<00:01:40.290> well<00:01:40.439> unidirectional<00:01:41.189> kind

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
unidirectional well unidirectional kind

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.310 
unidirectional well unidirectional kind
of<00:01:41.460> has<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> bunch<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.060> stuff<00:01:42.180> under<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.990> so

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
of has a bunch of stuff under it so

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.899 
of has a bunch of stuff under it so
unidirectional<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.220> means<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.579> picks<00:01:44.790> up

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
unidirectional just means it picks up

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.609 
unidirectional just means it picks up
from<00:01:45.149> one<00:01:45.420> direction<00:01:45.600> better<00:01:46.229> than<00:01:46.470> other

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
from one direction better than other

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.490 
from one direction better than other
directions<00:01:47.030> period<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.840> when<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.229> get<00:01:49.350> into

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
directions period so when we get into

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.440 
directions period so when we get into
unidirectional<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.460> most<00:01:50.670> popular<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.299> going

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
unidirectional the most popular is going

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.999 
unidirectional the most popular is going
to<00:01:51.509> be<00:01:51.659> cardioid<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.500> that's<00:01:52.619> what<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
to be cardioid and that's what the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.370 
to be cardioid and that's what the
typical<00:01:53.420> vocal<00:01:54.420> microphones<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.049> see<00:01:55.200> like

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
typical vocal microphones you see like

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.319 
typical vocal microphones you see like
here<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.219> lot<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.430> times<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.030> will<00:01:57.180> be

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
here and a lot of times that will be

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.899 
here and a lot of times that will be
described<00:01:57.810> as<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.560> little<00:01:58.829> guy<00:01:58.979> which<00:01:59.670> looks

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
described as that little guy which looks

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.999 
described as that little guy which looks
like<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> little<00:02:00.420> heart<00:02:00.840> some<00:02:01.590> people<00:02:01.829> call<00:02:01.979> it

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
like a little heart some people call it

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.219 
like a little heart some people call it
a<00:02:02.159> butt<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:02.939> we<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.570> refer<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.930> as<00:02:04.079> an

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
a butt but we like to refer to it as an

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.889 
a butt but we like to refer to it as an
upside-down<00:02:04.619> heart<00:02:05.100> cardio<00:02:06.060> coming<00:02:06.630> from<00:02:06.780> the

upside-down heart cardio coming from the
heart<00:02:07.140> heart<00:02:07.530> shaped<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.129> all<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:09.030> means<00:02:09.300> is

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
heart heart shaped and all that means is

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.920 
heart heart shaped and all that means is
on<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:10.110> microphone<00:02:10.590> as<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> cardioid

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
on this microphone as a cardioid

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.760 
on this microphone as a cardioid
directly<00:02:12.930> in<00:02:13.020> front<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.349> it

directly in front of it

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.380 
directly in front of it
this<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:13.980> what<00:02:14.100> we<00:02:14.190> call<00:02:14.340> on<00:02:14.580> axis<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.270> the

it's<00:02:23.580> gonna<00:02:23.700> attenuate<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.630> by<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.140> time<00:02:25.440> I

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
it's gonna attenuate and by the time I

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.430 
it's gonna attenuate and by the time I
get<00:02:25.620> all<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.010> way<00:02:26.040> back<00:02:26.370> right<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:27.630> 180

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
degrees off-axis is that's worth what

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.290

another popular polar pattern for live

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.470 
another popular polar pattern for live
sound<00:02:57.810> is<00:02:58.050> what<00:02:58.200> they<00:02:58.320> call<00:02:58.560> hyper-cardioid

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
sound is what they call hyper-cardioid

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.810 
sound is what they call hyper-cardioid
now<00:03:00.480> hyper-cardioid<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:01.800> gonna<00:03:02.280> have<00:03:02.550> a

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
now hyper-cardioid is gonna have a

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.990 
now hyper-cardioid is gonna have a
smaller<00:03:03.540> acceptance<00:03:04.290> angle<00:03:04.500> okay<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:05.730> we<00:03:05.850> can

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
smaller acceptance angle okay so we can

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.980 
smaller acceptance angle okay so we can
squish<00:03:06.450> this<00:03:06.750> here<00:03:07.260> but<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.070> physics<00:03:08.550> of<00:03:08.730> it

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
squish this here but the physics of it

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.940 
squish this here but the physics of it
mean<00:03:09.990> that<00:03:10.230> there's<00:03:10.380> going<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.560> be<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.710> little

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
mean that there's going to be a little

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.560 
mean that there's going to be a little
lobe<00:03:11.310> it's<00:03:11.550> gonna<00:03:11.700> pick<00:03:11.910> up<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.120> little<00:03:12.300> bit

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
lobe it's gonna pick up a little bit

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.630 
lobe it's gonna pick up a little bit
from<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.930> back<00:03:13.110> of<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.440> microphone<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:14.100> the

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
from the back of the microphone and the

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.220 
from the back of the microphone and the
null<00:03:14.970> point<00:03:15.270> is<00:03:15.510> gonna<00:03:15.720> be<00:03:15.900> at<00:03:15.990> about<00:03:16.200> a

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
null point is gonna be at about a

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.400 
null point is gonna be at about a
hundred<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.710> ten<00:03:17.010> degrees<00:03:17.190> okay<00:03:17.940> so<00:03:18.690> we<00:03:19.290> have

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
hundred and ten degrees okay so we have

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.500 
hundred and ten degrees okay so we have
a<00:03:19.440> hyper-cardioid<00:03:19.920> mic<00:03:20.430> we<00:03:20.850> go<00:03:21.030> into<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.270> club

we plug it in the sound guy puts his

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.300 
we plug it in the sound guy puts his
monitors<00:03:23.490> right<00:03:23.700> behind<00:03:23.970> us<00:03:24.209> bad<00:03:24.990> idea<00:03:25.530> we

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
monitors right behind us bad idea we

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.980 
monitors right behind us bad idea we
need<00:03:26.520> to<00:03:26.670> know<00:03:26.880> what<00:03:27.120> kind<00:03:27.300> of<00:03:27.360> microphone<00:03:27.660> we

need to know what kind of microphone we
have<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:28.770> we<00:03:28.890> can<00:03:28.920> put<00:03:29.190> our<00:03:29.310> microphones<00:03:29.760> 110

degrees<00:03:35.160> so<00:03:35.700> we<00:03:35.790> should<00:03:35.940> shoot<00:03:36.150> them<00:03:36.270> about

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
degrees so we should shoot them about

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.300 
degrees so we should shoot them about
right<00:03:36.720> there<00:03:36.990> and<00:03:37.230> that's<00:03:37.680> going<00:03:37.800> to<00:03:37.860> put<00:03:38.130> the

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
right there and that's going to put the

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.160 
right there and that's going to put the
monitor<00:03:38.850> right<00:03:38.880> in<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.420> null<00:03:39.660> point<00:03:39.930> of<00:03:40.050> this

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
monitor right in the null point of this

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.230 
monitor right in the null point of this
microphone<00:03:40.530> so<00:03:41.070> there's<00:03:41.610> two<00:03:41.880> unidirectional

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
microphone so there's two unidirectional

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.260 
microphone so there's two unidirectional
options<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.380> got<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.560> cardioid<00:03:44.090> you<00:03:45.090> got<00:03:45.240> a

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
options you got a cardioid you got a

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.320 
options you got a cardioid you got a
hyper-cardioid<00:03:45.900> well<00:03:46.860> sometimes<00:03:47.850> maybe<00:03:48.209> you

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
hyper-cardioid well sometimes maybe you

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330 
hyper-cardioid well sometimes maybe you
want<00:03:48.540> more<00:03:49.170> pattern<00:03:49.740> but<00:03:49.890> you<00:03:49.920> still<00:03:50.220> need

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
want more pattern but you still need

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.280 
want more pattern but you still need
rejection<00:03:50.880> maybe<00:03:51.090> for<00:03:51.360> a<00:03:51.390> choir<00:03:51.660> whatnot<00:03:52.110> and

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
rejection maybe for a choir whatnot and

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.350 
rejection maybe for a choir whatnot and
there's<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.500> pattern<00:03:52.890> called<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.340> sub<00:03:53.700> cardioid

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
there's a pattern called a sub cardioid

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.930 
there's a pattern called a sub cardioid
and<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:55.230> actually<00:03:55.560> has<00:03:55.740> a<00:03:55.770> wider<00:03:56.280> pickup

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
and that actually has a wider pickup

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.560 
and that actually has a wider pickup
pattern<00:03:57.120> in<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.600> front<00:03:57.959> okay<00:03:59.300> what<00:04:00.300> are<00:04:00.420> some

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
pattern in the front okay what are some

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.670 
pattern in the front okay what are some
other<00:04:00.750> ones<00:04:00.900> maybe<00:04:01.110> you<00:04:01.290> want<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.560> do<00:04:01.650> a

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
other ones maybe you want to do a

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.770 
other ones maybe you want to do a
bi-directional<00:04:02.240> microphone<00:04:03.240> now<00:04:03.420> this<00:04:03.600> is

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
bi-directional microphone now this is

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.600 
bi-directional microphone now this is
kind<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:04.020> a<00:04:04.140> unique<00:04:04.500> one<00:04:04.740> and<00:04:04.770> a<00:04:04.950> lot<00:04:05.070> of<00:04:05.100> ribbon

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
kind of a unique one and a lot of ribbon

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.480 
kind of a unique one and a lot of ribbon
microphones<00:04:06.120> are<00:04:06.300> bi-directional

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
microphones are bi-directional

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.770 
microphones are bi-directional
bi-directional<00:04:08.490> microphone<00:04:08.940> in<00:04:09.209> its<00:04:09.360> essence

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
bi-directional microphone in its essence

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.530 
bi-directional microphone in its essence
essentially<00:04:10.350> we'll<00:04:10.620> pick<00:04:10.800> up<00:04:10.890> from<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.220> front

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
essentially we'll pick up from the front

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.810 
essentially we'll pick up from the front
it<00:04:12.540> will<00:04:12.690> pick<00:04:12.900> up<00:04:13.050> from<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.350> back<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:14.010> then

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
it will pick up from the back and then

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.870 
it will pick up from the back and then
right<00:04:15.300> at<00:04:15.540> 90<00:04:16.049> degrees<00:04:16.380> all<00:04:17.340> around<00:04:17.730> this

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
right at 90 degrees all around this

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.409 
right at 90 degrees all around this
microphone<00:04:18.299> is<00:04:18.480> where<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.840> null<00:04:19.169> point<00:04:19.590> is

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
microphone is where the null point is

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.480 
microphone is where the null point is
that's<00:04:21.419> kind<00:04:21.720> of<00:04:21.750> a<00:04:21.870> unique<00:04:22.049> pattern<00:04:22.590> some

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
that's kind of a unique pattern some

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.920 
that's kind of a unique pattern some
good<00:04:23.669> applications<00:04:23.820> for<00:04:24.419> that<00:04:24.540> a<00:04:24.570> lot<00:04:24.840> of

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
good applications for that a lot of

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.659 
good applications for that a lot of
times<00:04:25.140> people<00:04:25.560> will<00:04:25.620> use<00:04:25.680> crossed<00:04:26.220> figure

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
times people will use crossed figure

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.600 
times people will use crossed figure
eights<00:04:26.880> first

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
eights first

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.700 
eights first
applications<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:29.289> MS<00:04:30.719> recording<00:04:31.719> stereo

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
applications the MS recording stereo

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.129 
applications the MS recording stereo
recording<00:04:33.129> technique<00:04:33.490> uses<00:04:34.139> bi-directional

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
recording technique uses bi-directional

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.749 
recording technique uses bi-directional
microphone<00:04:35.620> so<00:04:36.099> there's<00:04:36.219> a<00:04:36.280> lot<00:04:36.400> of<00:04:36.430> different

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
microphone so there's a lot of different

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.459 
microphone so there's a lot of different
uses<00:04:36.969> for<00:04:37.330> these<00:04:37.419> patterns<00:04:37.960> but<00:04:38.139> really

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:38.469 
uses for these patterns but really

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:40.469 
uses for these patterns but really
knowing<00:04:38.830> about<00:04:39.099> the<00:04:39.370> pattern<00:04:39.789> and<00:04:40.000> how<00:04:40.270> they

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
act and where they sound the best will

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.249 
act and where they sound the best will
really<00:04:43.509> help<00:04:43.629> you<00:04:43.780> out<00:04:43.870> of<00:04:43.990> a<00:04:44.050> lot<00:04:44.229> of

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
really help you out of a lot of

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:45.749 
really help you out of a lot of
situations<00:04:44.889> and<00:04:45.009> we're<00:04:45.099> gonna<00:04:45.189> fly<00:04:45.490> in<00:04:45.669> a

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
situations and we're gonna fly in a

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.279 
situations and we're gonna fly in a
little<00:04:45.969> image<00:04:46.300> it'll<00:04:46.750> give<00:04:46.960> you<00:04:47.050> what<00:04:47.199> the

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
little image it'll give you what the

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:49.110 
little image it'll give you what the
acceptance<00:04:47.770> angles<00:04:48.219> are<00:04:48.400> on<00:04:48.550> all<00:04:48.819> those

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
acceptance angles are on all those

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.740 
acceptance angles are on all those
patterns<00:04:49.509> hey<00:04:50.289> thanks<00:04:50.590> for<00:04:50.620> watching
