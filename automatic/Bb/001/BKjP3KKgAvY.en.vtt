now<00:00:05.970> this<00:00:06.270> test<00:00:06.510> I'm<00:00:06.720> going<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:06.960> put<00:00:07.109> in<00:00:07.580> one

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
now this test I'm going to put in one

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.720 
now this test I'm going to put in one
tablespoon<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:10.520> distilled<00:00:11.520> water<00:00:13.730> running

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
tablespoon of distilled water running

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.560 
tablespoon of distilled water running
excuse<00:00:15.029> me<00:00:15.209> and<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:16.350> vinegar<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:18.119> mostly

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
excuse me and of vinegar in this mostly

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.190 
excuse me and of vinegar in this mostly
just<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.930> water<00:00:23.360> and<00:00:24.360> I<00:00:24.510> want<00:00:24.690> to<00:00:24.750> see<00:00:24.900> what<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
just of water and I want to see what the

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:34.290 
just of water and I want to see what the
result<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.710> all<00:00:26.370> does<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.820> act

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.130 

and

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.960 

I'm<00:00:39.739> seeing<00:00:40.040> a<00:00:40.100> little<00:00:40.190> bit<00:00:40.340> of<00:00:40.520> like<00:00:40.730> try<00:00:40.910> to

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
I'm seeing a little bit of like try to

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:54.370 
I'm seeing a little bit of like try to
merge<00:00:41.270> more<00:00:41.739> electrolysis<00:00:42.739> than<00:00:43.100> there<00:00:43.280> was

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.950 

mmm<00:00:58.430> so<00:00:59.430> vinegar<00:00:59.970> and<00:01:00.060> distilled<00:01:00.390> water<00:01:00.510> does

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
mmm so vinegar and distilled water does

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.800 
mmm so vinegar and distilled water does
cause<00:01:01.350> electrolysis<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.400> increase<00:01:02.790> but<00:01:03.090> not<00:01:03.150> a

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
cause electrolysis to increase but not a

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.660 
cause electrolysis to increase but not a
lot<00:01:04.610> not<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:06.380> not<00:01:07.380> at<00:01:07.590> two<00:01:07.740> tablespoons<00:01:08.370> per

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
lot not one not at two tablespoons per

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.780 
lot not one not at two tablespoons per
gallon<00:01:09.890> now<00:01:10.890> I'm<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.160> try<00:01:11.310> adding<00:01:11.610> one

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
gallon now I'm going to try adding one

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.870 
gallon now I'm going to try adding one
more<00:01:11.970> tablespoon<00:01:12.300> of<00:01:12.690> vinegar<00:01:13.400> and<00:01:14.400> see<00:01:14.730> what

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
more tablespoon of vinegar and see what

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.530 
more tablespoon of vinegar and see what
the<00:01:14.970> reaction<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:16.140> will<00:01:16.320> make<00:01:16.500> four

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
the reaction is this will make four

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
the reaction is this will make four
tablespoons<00:01:18.540> per<00:01:18.840> gallon

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.340 

yes<00:01:35.560> needs<00:01:36.159> to<00:01:36.280> be<00:01:36.369> mixed<00:01:36.549> a<00:01:36.729> little<00:01:37.170> now<00:01:38.170> let's

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
yes needs to be mixed a little now let's

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:50.510 
yes needs to be mixed a little now let's
see<00:01:38.470> what<00:01:38.590> we<00:01:38.680> get

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.580 

I'm<00:01:51.149> seeing<00:01:51.539> increased<00:01:52.079> electrolysis<00:01:52.679> but

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
I'm seeing increased electrolysis but

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.310 
I'm seeing increased electrolysis but
not<00:01:55.590> what<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.770> would<00:01:55.890> call<00:01:56.250> useful<00:01:56.820> production

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.060 

now<00:02:01.320> I'm<00:02:01.380> going<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.619> add<00:02:01.710> another<00:02:01.829> tablespoon

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
now I'm going to add another tablespoon

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.130 
now I'm going to add another tablespoon
this<00:02:02.789> will<00:02:02.939> increase<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:05.569> amount<00:02:06.569> of<00:02:06.990> vinegar

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
this will increase the amount of vinegar

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.009 
this will increase the amount of vinegar
in<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> water<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:08.250> six<00:02:09.209> tablespoons<00:02:09.599> per

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
in the water to six tablespoons per

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:33.520 
in the water to six tablespoons per
gallon

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.000 

and<00:02:34.190> I'm<00:02:34.400> seeing<00:02:34.730> still<00:02:35.150> more<00:02:36.010> electrolysis

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
and I'm seeing still more electrolysis

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.310 
and I'm seeing still more electrolysis
occurring<00:02:37.610> but<00:02:38.000> it's<00:02:38.420> still<00:02:38.630> very<00:02:38.690> low

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
occurring but it's still very low

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.520 
occurring but it's still very low
production<00:02:40.390> now<00:02:41.390> I'm<00:02:41.480> going<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.690> increase<00:02:42.260> the

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
production now I'm going to increase the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.910 
production now I'm going to increase the
dosage<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.540> 8<00:02:44.540> tablespoons<00:02:45.260> per<00:02:45.470> gallon<00:02:45.530> and

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
dosage to 8 tablespoons per gallon and

00:02:45.920 --> 00:03:09.460 
dosage to 8 tablespoons per gallon and
see<00:02:46.700> what<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:46.970> does

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.250 

again<00:03:10.220> I'm<00:03:10.370> seeing<00:03:10.640> increased<00:03:11.150> electrolysis

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:23.729 

but<00:03:15.260> I'm<00:03:15.380> not<00:03:15.560> seeing<00:03:16.210> useful<00:03:17.210> production

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.030 

at<00:03:24.280> this<00:03:24.430> point<00:03:24.640> I've<00:03:24.819> added<00:03:25.030> I<00:03:25.239> think<00:03:25.480> about<00:03:25.719> a

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
at this point I've added I think about a

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.000 
at this point I've added I think about a
quarter<00:03:27.040> of<00:03:27.069> a<00:03:27.280> cup

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.890 

it<00:03:33.580> doesn't<00:03:33.909> appear<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.239> be<00:03:34.360> a<00:03:34.390> useful<00:03:34.810> amount

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
it doesn't appear to be a useful amount

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.330 
it doesn't appear to be a useful amount
of<00:03:35.140> production<00:03:35.530> at<00:03:35.650> this<00:03:35.799> rate<00:03:36.010> eight

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
of production at this rate eight

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.559 
of production at this rate eight
tablespoons<00:03:37.060> per<00:03:37.329> gallon<00:03:38.849> I'll<00:03:39.849> try<00:03:40.120> one<00:03:40.390> more

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
tablespoons per gallon I'll try one more

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.270 
tablespoons per gallon I'll try one more
see<00:03:41.110> how<00:03:41.230> that<00:03:41.379> works<00:03:42.480> there's<00:03:43.480> one<00:03:43.689> more

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
see how that works there's one more

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:53.940 
see how that works there's one more
tablespoon<00:03:50.970> this<00:03:51.970> makes<00:03:52.239> ten<00:03:52.959> tablespoons<00:03:53.620> of

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
tablespoon this makes ten tablespoons of

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:12.610 
tablespoon this makes ten tablespoons of
vinegar<00:03:54.819> in<00:03:55.299> distilled<00:03:55.840> water<00:03:55.870> for<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.590> gallon

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.610 

and<00:04:13.280> as<00:04:13.580> you<00:04:13.730> can<00:04:13.849> see<00:04:14.060> it<00:04:14.209> is<00:04:14.390> making<00:04:14.840> some<00:04:15.110> but

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
and as you can see it is making some but

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:22.659 
and as you can see it is making some but
not<00:04:15.650> enough<00:04:15.950> to<00:04:16.370> be<00:04:16.489> considered<00:04:16.760> productive

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.689 

my<00:04:23.300> conclusion<00:04:23.539> is<00:04:24.050> in<00:04:24.770> order<00:04:25.039> for<00:04:25.219> vinegar<00:04:25.580> to

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
my conclusion is in order for vinegar to

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.110 
my conclusion is in order for vinegar to
be<00:04:25.849> useful<00:04:26.349> it<00:04:27.349> would<00:04:27.680> take<00:04:27.889> a<00:04:28.189> pretty<00:04:28.939> high

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
be useful it would take a pretty high

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:37.029 
be useful it would take a pretty high
concentration<00:04:35.199> now<00:04:36.199> granted<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:36.710> vinegar

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
concentration now granted the vinegar

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:42.129 
concentration now granted the vinegar
you<00:04:37.069> buy<00:04:37.340> is<00:04:37.400> 5%<00:04:39.550> but<00:04:40.550> as<00:04:40.759> you<00:04:41.509> can<00:04:41.629> see<00:04:41.810> it's

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
you buy is 5% but as you can see it's

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.379 
you buy is 5% but as you can see it's
going<00:04:43.009> to<00:04:43.159> take<00:04:43.310> a<00:04:43.340> significant<00:04:43.969> amount<00:04:44.030> in

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
going to take a significant amount in

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:54.559 
going to take a significant amount in
order<00:04:44.539> to<00:04:44.810> get<00:04:45.560> useful<00:04:45.770> production
