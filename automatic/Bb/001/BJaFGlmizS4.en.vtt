00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.430
 mine 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.860
 Hi guys, how are you? This week's a video. 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.820
 special valentine's day 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.040
 She arrives on Valentine's Day, I go. 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.060
 to teach you that I did two 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:03.040
 gifts 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:05.590
 fire was my god, it's very hot and 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.710
 truth mexico just an inspiration you 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.200
 You can do it any way you want. 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.990
 I had this idea I researched 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.060
 internet and I did the way I liked it 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.680
 You can change the colors you can make. 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.780
 I really want you to leave. 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.030
 Here they come to me if you 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.610
 are enjoying the videos if you have 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.619
 new ideas want me to do some 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.880
 different thing can leave here that I 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.149
 I do 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.850
 and if you have not already written on my channel 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.680
 they often imply 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.010
 I liked to help spread my video. 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.229
 It is and that week is over 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:49.470
 special Valentine's Day video with 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:52.390
 two more tips and a kiss, bye 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.880
 cushion we will need a cloth 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.930
 for the cover of 50 centimeters wide 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.320
 1 flap to make the heart a mold 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.930
 and the cushion filler is 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.360
 I picked up the fabric and 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.720
 half forming two parts of more or 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.989
 least 50 by 50 centimeters come in 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.030
 inside out and stitched the edges of the 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.120
 sides with hot glue 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.090
 a tip is to go on to lay eggs 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.260
 so it does not dry before you paste 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.260
 a tissue in the other 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:57.489
 after cutting I cut the edges that 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:00.010
 have left so I formed a bag that I 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:09.450
 I'll turn inside out and be well finished. 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:13.120
 where I put it I got the stuffing 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.019
 middle of the last side of the cushion and 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.019
 excess tissue 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.549
 arrives 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.040
 I left the cover aside so we could do the 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:40.530
 detail I picked up a retail 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:43.049
 I drew the heart mold with the 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.980
 hot glue even I stuck the heart in 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.980
 center of the pad 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:14.100
 I refilled the filling 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.560
 But now to close musty I doubled the 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.510
 two tips for finishing and 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.269
 I glued it with hot glue 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.850
 I did it slowly, little by little. 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.070
 to get easier 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.200
 in the end the finish stays very 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.500
 similar to seam finish in 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.500
 machine 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:49.790
 to make the mobile we will need a 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:52.940
 Piece of Styrofoam Patchwork of Two Fabrics 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.910
 meters of satin ribbon and photos 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.820
 I drew four styrofoam 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.340
 measuring 10 by 10 centimeters 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.180
 cut using a heated knife in the 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.280
 fire 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.340
 I took the white patch of polka dots 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.850
 black and wallet and three of the four 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.400
 pieces of Styrofoam to wrap I used the 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.330
 cloth glue but white glue too 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.330
 it works 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:43.420
 if you still have some 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:45.850
 left over from fabric is just cut with retail 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:49.800
 black white polka dots on cape 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.800
 piece of Styrofoam that was missing 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:14.830
 after all dry colleagues three photos 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.800
 which I cut in size 9 by nine 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:21.280
 centimeters in the 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:24.880
 white cloth with red cloth 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:28.560
 draw a heart and stick it 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.560
 unable to black part 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.870
 after he was ready to put 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.440
 piece in satin life and made a detail 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.440
 at the bottom end 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:51.840
 with the rest of satin ribbon 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:55.640
 I made a bow and glued it to the top and 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.640
 that's how our moby was ready 

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:30.139
 ae 

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.410
 ae
