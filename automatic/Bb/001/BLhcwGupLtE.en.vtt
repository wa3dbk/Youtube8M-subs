this<00:04:48.479> case<00:04:48.780> with<00:04:49.740> different<00:04:50.340> canopies<00:04:51.330> and

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
this case with different canopies and

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.480 
this case with different canopies and
then<00:04:53.039> a<00:04:53.479> basic<00:04:54.479> summary<00:04:54.690> as<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.349> what<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:56.190> user

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
then a basic summary as to what the user

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.779 
then a basic summary as to what the user
might<00:04:56.970> do<00:04:57.270> so<00:04:57.960> first<00:04:58.560> photograph<00:04:59.160> taken<00:04:59.520> in

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
might do so first photograph taken in

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.290 
might do so first photograph taken in
February<00:05:00.300> with<00:05:01.139> the<00:05:01.259> ga<00:05:01.590> I<00:05:01.650> only<00:05:02.159> of<00:05:02.520> point<00:05:02.789> 35

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
February with the ga I only of point 35

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.029 
February with the ga I only of point 35
that<00:05:03.599> this<00:05:03.750> canopy<00:05:04.080> is<00:05:04.259> below<00:05:04.500> up<00:05:04.650> to<00:05:04.800> them<00:05:04.949> and

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
that this canopy is below up to them and

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.010 
that this canopy is below up to them and
nitrogen<00:05:05.970> should<00:05:06.240> be<00:05:06.330> applied<00:05:06.569> early<00:05:06.900> to

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
nitrogen should be applied early to

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.920 
nitrogen should be applied early to
boost<00:05:07.289> canopy<00:05:07.740> growth<00:05:07.979> no<00:05:08.610> fungicide<00:05:09.210> with

boost canopy growth no fungicide with

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.689 
boost canopy growth no fungicide with
growth<00:05:10.199> regulatory<00:05:10.979> activity<00:05:11.400> should<00:05:11.460> be

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
growth regulatory activity should be

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.830 
growth regulatory activity should be
applied<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:13.650> second<00:05:14.039> one<00:05:14.159> in<00:05:14.310> February

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
applied the second one in February

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.469 
applied the second one in February
slightly<00:05:15.840> different<00:05:16.430> situation<00:05:17.430> with<00:05:18.120> us<00:05:18.240> but

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
slightly different situation with us but

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.140 
slightly different situation with us but
a<00:05:18.509> higher<00:05:18.780> GA<00:05:19.560> I<00:05:19.650> it's<00:05:20.340> greater<00:05:20.789> than<00:05:20.940> the

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
a higher GA I it's greater than the

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.790 
a higher GA I it's greater than the
optimal<00:05:21.509> size<00:05:21.630> and<00:05:21.870> generally<00:05:22.409> will<00:05:22.560> give<00:05:22.680> an

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
optimal size and generally will give an

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.460 
optimal size and generally will give an
economic<00:05:23.220> response<00:05:23.639> to<00:05:24.300> a<00:05:24.539> growth<00:05:24.840> regulatory

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
economic response to a growth regulatory

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.040 
economic response to a growth regulatory
fungicide<00:05:26.009> and<00:05:26.819> the<00:05:26.940> third<00:05:27.150> one<00:05:27.419> with<00:05:27.720> an<00:05:27.810> even

fungicide and the third one with an even

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.589 
fungicide and the third one with an even
higher<00:05:28.229> GA<00:05:29.159> I<00:05:29.250> so<00:05:29.819> three<00:05:30.300> photographs

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
higher GA I so three photographs

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:32.839 
higher GA I so three photographs
throughout<00:05:31.409> februari<00:05:31.860> which<00:05:32.370> can<00:05:32.580> give<00:05:32.729> the

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
for April May again three representative

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.580 
for April May again three representative
crops<00:05:50.310> and<00:05:50.610> you<00:05:51.300> can<00:05:51.419> notice<00:05:51.630> that<00:05:51.960> navigation

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
crops and you can notice that navigation

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.100 
crops and you can notice that navigation
is<00:05:52.830> quite<00:05:53.190> simple<00:05:53.580> as<00:05:53.789> per<00:05:54.060> all<00:05:54.449> iPhone

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
is quite simple as per all iPhone

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.370 
is quite simple as per all iPhone
