00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
made a decision but here's the point if

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.040 
made a decision but here's the point if
kids<00:06:24.169> are<00:06:24.320> that<00:06:24.560> obese<00:06:25.010> is<00:06:25.310> that<00:06:26.150> is<00:06:26.300> it<00:06:26.479> a<00:06:26.600> form

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
kids are that obese is that is it a form

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.350 
kids are that obese is that is it a form
up<00:06:27.320> I<00:06:27.710> think<00:06:28.010> these<00:06:28.160> parents<00:06:28.669> are<00:06:28.729> negligent

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
up I think these parents are negligent

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.790 
up I think these parents are negligent
in<00:06:29.540> their<00:06:29.810> duty<00:06:30.169> but<00:06:30.290> I<00:06:30.380> don't<00:06:30.560> think<00:06:30.650> the

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
in their duty but I don't think the

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.870 
in their duty but I don't think the
government<00:06:30.949> should<00:06:31.190> get<00:06:31.400> what's<00:06:31.669> called

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
government should get what's called

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.120 
government should get what's called
freedom<00:06:32.300> mm-hmm<00:06:33.020> and<00:06:33.169> our<00:06:33.380> friend<00:06:33.650> Mark<00:06:33.830> Levin

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
freedom mm-hmm and our friend Mark Levin

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.360 
freedom mm-hmm and our friend Mark Levin
would<00:06:34.490> say<00:06:34.760> that<00:06:35.389> this<00:06:35.540> fact<00:06:36.020> may<00:06:36.199> he<00:06:36.440> he<00:06:37.190> would

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
would say that this fact may he he would

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.010 
would say that this fact may he he would
say<00:06:37.580> this<00:06:37.850> is<00:06:37.910> an<00:06:38.180> obsession<00:06:38.570> with<00:06:38.780> the

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
say this is an obsession with the

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.900 
say this is an obsession with the
supremacy<00:06:39.590> of<00:06:39.620> the<00:06:39.740> state<00:06:39.860> well<00:06:40.340> said<00:06:40.610> yeah

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910 
supremacy of the state well said yeah

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.670 
supremacy of the state well said yeah
but<00:06:41.060> the<00:06:41.120> problem<00:06:41.330> is<00:06:41.630> that<00:06:41.660> if<00:06:42.050> you<00:06:42.470> want<00:06:42.620> to

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680
