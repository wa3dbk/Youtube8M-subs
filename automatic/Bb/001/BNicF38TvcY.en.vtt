ways the speed seems up
I<00:01:44.750> think<00:01:45.750> our<00:01:45.960> use<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.620> real-life<00:01:46.920> locations

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
I think our use of real-life locations

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.160 
I think our use of real-life locations
is<00:01:47.880> going<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.210> appeal<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.570> hardcore<00:01:48.810> skate

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
is going to appeal to the hardcore skate

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.310 
is going to appeal to the hardcore skate
film<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.490> creative<00:01:51.150> Park<00:01:51.600> mode<00:01:51.870> I<00:01:52.140> think

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
film but the creative Park mode I think

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.140 
film but the creative Park mode I think
that<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.979> once<00:01:53.190> you<00:01:53.400> bring<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.760> video<00:01:53.970> game

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
that is once you bring the video game

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.660 
that is once you bring the video game
community<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:55.260> very<00:01:55.530> big<00:01:55.800> way<00:01:55.950> we're<00:01:56.520> always

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
community in a very big way we're always

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.520 
community in a very big way we're always
trying<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.210> create<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.660> sandbox<00:01:58.080> field<00:01:58.350> of

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
trying to create that sandbox field of

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.260 
trying to create that sandbox field of
I'm<00:01:58.860> creating<00:01:59.400> a<00:01:59.430> playground<00:01:59.820> for<00:01:59.880> people<00:02:00.180> to

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
I'm creating a playground for people to

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.600 
I'm creating a playground for people to
play<00:02:00.390> levels<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:01.830> so<00:02:02.010> much<00:02:02.160> fun<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.460> do<00:02:02.580> a

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
play levels and it's so much fun to do a

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.310 
play levels and it's so much fun to do a
designer<00:02:02.970> like<00:02:03.210> let's<00:02:03.509> give<00:02:03.690> that<00:02:03.840> experience

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
designer like let's give that experience

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.290 
designer like let's give that experience
to<00:02:04.440> the<00:02:04.500> players<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.520> course<00:02:05.700> creator<00:02:06.060> is

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
to the players so the course creator is

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.630 
to the players so the course creator is
something<00:02:06.690> that<00:02:07.080> you<00:02:07.470> know<00:02:07.590> allows<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.100> fan<00:02:08.459> to

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
something that you know allows a fan to

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.360 
something that you know allows a fan to
go<00:02:08.789> into<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> template<00:02:10.200> based<00:02:10.380> on<00:02:10.649> other<00:02:10.920> levels

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370
