00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
this railing as closer to the wall

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.120 
this railing as closer to the wall
that's<00:00:25.380> where<00:00:25.560> we<00:00:25.650> were<00:00:25.740> gonna<00:00:25.830> do<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:26.070> the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
that's where we were gonna do in the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.890 
that's where we were gonna do in the
glitch<00:00:26.310> at<00:00:26.550> once<00:00:27.119> you're<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.359> there<00:00:27.750> you're

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
glitch at once you're on there you're

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.300 
glitch at once you're on there you're
gonna<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.230> go<00:00:28.320> ahead<00:00:28.560> look<00:00:28.769> forward<00:00:29.160> and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
gonna have to go ahead look forward and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
gonna have to go ahead look forward and
look<00:00:29.429> kind<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.670> up<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.939> little<00:00:30.119> bit<00:00:30.240> you're

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
look kind of up a little bit you're

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.279 
look kind of up a little bit you're
going<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.510> see<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.630> there's<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> little

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
going to see that there's like a little

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.620 
going to see that there's like a little
gray<00:00:31.590> type<00:00:31.859> Wallisch<00:00:32.369> thing<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:33.480> don't<00:00:33.540> have

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
gray type Wallisch thing you don't have

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.180 
gray type Wallisch thing you don't have
to<00:00:33.750> do<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.899> double<00:00:34.079> jump<00:00:34.260> straight<00:00:34.770> into<00:00:35.010> that

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
to do a double jump straight into that

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.040 
to do a double jump straight into that
and<00:00:35.370> then<00:00:35.550> boost<00:00:35.850> backwards<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.780> then<00:00:36.840> do<00:00:37.020> a

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and then boost backwards and then do a

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.290 
and then boost backwards and then do a
double<00:00:37.500> jump<00:00:37.530> again<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.399> then<00:00:39.120> you're<00:00:39.210> going

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
double jump again and then you're going

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.389 
double jump again and then you're going
to<00:00:39.360> get<00:00:39.480> up<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:39.690> top<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.110> building

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
to get up on top of the building

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.590 
to get up on top of the building
unfortunately<00:00:41.399> as<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.760> see<00:00:41.969> i<00:00:42.000> got<00:00:42.270> stuck

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
unfortunately as you can see i got stuck

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.180 
unfortunately as you can see i got stuck
right<00:00:42.840> here<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.440> something<00:00:43.920> that

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
right here and this is something that

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.279 
right here and this is something that
might<00:00:44.399> commonly<00:00:44.789> happen<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
might commonly happen to you this is the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.540 
might commonly happen to you this is the
only<00:00:46.410> way<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.829> can<00:00:46.860> actually<00:00:47.070> mess<00:00:47.399> up

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
only way that you can actually mess up

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.520 
only way that you can actually mess up
the<00:00:47.700> glitch<00:00:47.879> if<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.690> don't<00:00:48.870> do<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.230> double

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
the glitch if you don't do that double

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.920 
the glitch if you don't do that double
jump<00:00:49.770> quick<00:00:50.010> enough<00:00:50.250> you'll<00:00:50.879> get<00:00:51.030> stuck<00:00:51.390> but

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
jump quick enough you'll get stuck but

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.270 
jump quick enough you'll get stuck but
as<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.199> can<00:00:52.260> see<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.530> did<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.800> again<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.070> did

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
as you can see I just did it again I did

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.130 
as you can see I just did it again I did
a<00:00:53.309> double<00:00:53.399> jump<00:00:53.760> into<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.270> thing<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.539> then

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
a double jump into the thing and then

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.020 
a double jump into the thing and then
boosted<00:00:55.829> backwards<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.550> then<00:00:56.610> did<00:00:56.760> another

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
boosted backwards and then did another

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.229 
boosted backwards and then did another
double<00:00:57.360> jump<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.840> then<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.949> landed<00:00:59.699> up<00:00:59.820> here<00:01:00.090> on

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
double jump and then I landed up here on

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.880 
double jump and then I landed up here on
top<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.690> building<00:01:00.960> now<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.590> know<00:01:01.649> it

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
top of this building now I know it

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.410 
top of this building now I know it
sounds<00:01:02.010> really<00:01:02.340> really<00:01:02.579> complicated<00:01:03.210> when<00:01:03.390> I

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
sounds really really complicated when I

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.270 
sounds really really complicated when I
say<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.780> like<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:03.930> but<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.949> have<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.159> really

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
say it like that but you have to really

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.469 
say it like that but you have to really
go<00:01:05.460> try<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.700> out<00:01:05.880> for<00:01:05.939> yourself<00:01:06.119> because

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
go try this out for yourself because

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.940 
go try this out for yourself because
it's<00:01:06.689> pretty<00:01:06.960> easy<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.409> do<00:01:07.500> other<00:01:07.710> than<00:01:07.890> a

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
it's pretty easy to do other than a

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.620 
it's pretty easy to do other than a
couple<00:01:08.280> times<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.760> might<00:01:08.909> get<00:01:09.090> stuck<00:01:09.299> in

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
couple times that you might get stuck in

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.359 
couple times that you might get stuck in
that<00:01:09.960> lower<00:01:10.170> part<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.619> only<00:01:10.770> really<00:01:11.100> kind<00:01:11.310> of

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
that lower part I only really kind of

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.620 
that lower part I only really kind of
got<00:01:11.520> stuck<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.060> first<00:01:12.270> couple<00:01:12.510> times

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
got stuck in that the first couple times

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.960 
got stuck in that the first couple times
I<00:01:12.840> tried<00:01:13.080> doing<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:14.280> then<00:01:14.430> once<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.760> kind

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
I tried doing it but then once you kind

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.190 
I tried doing it but then once you kind
