bazooka<00:00:31.800> twos<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.369> clearly<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:34.050> huge

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
bazooka twos and clearly this is a huge

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.850 
bazooka twos and clearly this is a huge

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860

kinda<00:00:38.160> Gundam<00:00:38.489> now<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.149> weight<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
kinda Gundam now the weight on the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.930 
kinda Gundam now the weight on the
backpack<00:00:39.890> didn't<00:00:40.890> have<00:00:41.100> as<00:00:41.280> much<00:00:41.460> effect<00:00:41.760> on

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
backpack didn't have as much effect on

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.270 
backpack didn't have as much effect on
this<00:00:42.120> as<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.690> o<00:00:42.719> riser<00:00:43.230> does<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> double-o

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
this as the o riser does on the double-o

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.209 
this as the o riser does on the double-o
Gundam<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.820> think<00:00:45.360> mostly<00:00:45.660> just<00:00:45.899> because<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
Gundam I think mostly just because the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.279 
Gundam I think mostly just because the
hollow<00:00:47.460> parts<00:00:48.059> but<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> weight<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.899> seems<00:00:49.110> a

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
hollow parts but the weight just seems a

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.410 
hollow parts but the weight just seems a
little<00:00:49.440> better<00:00:50.010> distributed<00:00:50.670> maybe<00:00:51.030> because

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
little better distributed maybe because

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.840 
little better distributed maybe because
of<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.600> large<00:00:51.840> size<00:00:52.140> legs<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.430> there<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.699> is

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
of the large size legs so there it is

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.630 
of the large size legs so there it is
with<00:00:54.239> six<00:00:54.570> angry<00:00:55.230> weapons<00:00:55.620> all<00:00:56.070> pointed<00:00:56.520> out

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
with six angry weapons all pointed out

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.430 
with six angry weapons all pointed out
you<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.449> start<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.780> see<00:00:57.930> some<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> weight

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
you can start to see some of the weight

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.590 
you can start to see some of the weight
issues<00:00:58.859> because<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.399> ankles<00:00:59.760> don't<00:00:59.969> bend<00:01:00.300> so

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
issues because the ankles don't bend so

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.619 
issues because the ankles don't bend so
much<00:01:01.430> when<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> legs<00:01:02.760> do<00:01:02.969> spread<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.449> don't

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
much when the legs do spread you don't

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.710 
much when the legs do spread you don't
get<00:01:03.809> as<00:01:03.960> bow<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.439> much<00:01:04.650> balance<00:01:05.040> as<00:01:05.220> you'd<00:01:05.400> like

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
get as bow as much balance as you'd like

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.810 
get as bow as much balance as you'd like
with<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.960> bazooka<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.500> each<00:01:07.770> hand<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.430> servi

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
with one bazooka in each hand the servi

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.789 
with one bazooka in each hand the servi
has<00:01:08.970> been<00:01:09.119> okay<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.479> far<00:01:09.930> for<00:01:10.200> keeping<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
has been okay so far for keeping the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.859 
has been okay so far for keeping the
weapons<00:01:11.130> up<00:01:11.280> but<00:01:11.880> what<00:01:12.030> about<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.659> double

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
weapons up but what about the double

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.740 
weapons up but what about the double
bazooka<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.330> let's<00:01:15.330> put<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:18.570> can

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
bazooka so let's put that in and you can

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.109 
bazooka so let's put that in and you can
see<00:01:18.960> for<00:01:19.140> yourself<00:01:19.549> I'm<00:01:20.549> going<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.820> hold<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.090> to

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
see for yourself I'm going to hold on to

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.499 
see for yourself I'm going to hold on to
the<00:01:21.270> legs<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:22.549> note<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.119> weight<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the legs and note the weight of the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.330 
the legs and note the weight of the
double<00:01:24.780> bazooka<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.350> too<00:01:25.590> much<00:01:25.799> for<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> arms

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
double bazooka is too much for the arms

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.179 
double bazooka is too much for the arms
to<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.610> fully<00:01:26.880> extended<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.680> going<00:01:28.979> to

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
to be fully extended so it is going to

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.030 
to be fully extended so it is going to
fall<00:01:29.400> down<00:01:29.430> if<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.390> twist<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.869> arm<00:01:31.079> yeah<00:01:31.770> it's

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
fall down if you twist the arm yeah it's

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.770 
fall down if you twist the arm yeah it's
naturally<00:01:32.520> going<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.729> fall<00:01:32.970> down<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.630> those

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
naturally going to fall down so those

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.149 
naturally going to fall down so those
cool<00:01:33.990> poses<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.619> see<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> box

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
cool poses that you see on the box

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.890 
cool poses that you see on the box
you're<00:01:35.759> not<00:01:36.000> going<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.240> be<00:01:36.329> able<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:36.750> that

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
you're not going to be able to do that

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.350 
you're not going to be able to do that
without<00:01:37.259> maybe<00:01:37.680> some<00:01:37.979> glue<00:01:38.220> or<00:01:38.610> some<00:01:39.030> sticky

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
without maybe some glue or some sticky

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.289 
without maybe some glue or some sticky
tack<00:01:40.159> so<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.310> arm<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.610> weapon<00:01:41.909> were<00:01:42.030> straight

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
tack so the arm and weapon were straight

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.210 
tack so the arm and weapon were straight
just<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.630> moment<00:01:42.930> ago<00:01:43.170> but<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.799> see<00:01:44.009> that

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
just a moment ago but you can see that

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.539 
just a moment ago but you can see that
the<00:01:44.310> gravity<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.880> already<00:01:45.270> pulling<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.750> down

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
the gravity is already pulling it down

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.760 
the gravity is already pulling it down
now<00:01:47.549> one<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.000> big<00:01:48.180> complaints<00:01:48.720> before<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
now one of the big complaints before the

now one of the big complaints before the
sura<00:01:50.040> v<00:01:50.280> came<00:01:50.520> out<00:01:50.759> was<00:01:51.659> these<00:01:52.020> holes<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.799> are

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
holes don't bother me as much as I

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.320 
holes don't bother me as much as I
thought<00:02:07.770> they<00:02:07.979> would<00:02:08.009> now<00:02:08.759> it's<00:02:08.940> able<00:02:09.090> to

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
thought they would now it's able to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.920 
thought they would now it's able to
support<00:02:09.720> one<00:02:10.310> bazooka

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
support one bazooka

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.259 
support one bazooka
at<00:02:12.049> a<00:02:12.110> full<00:02:12.379> 90-degree<00:02:12.920> angle<00:02:13.220> no<00:02:13.310> problem<00:02:13.640> but

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
at a full 90-degree angle no problem but

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.030 
at a full 90-degree angle no problem but
I<00:02:14.299> didn't<00:02:14.720> think<00:02:14.810> I'd<00:02:14.989> use<00:02:15.170> this<00:02:15.349> twin<00:02:15.650> Buster

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
I didn't think I'd use this twin Buster

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.039 
I didn't think I'd use this twin Buster
approach<00:02:16.340> as<00:02:16.700> much<00:02:17.120> but<00:02:17.420> because<00:02:17.540> it's<00:02:17.870> more

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
approach as much but because it's more

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.309 
approach as much but because it's more
solid<00:02:18.519> it<00:02:19.519> works<00:02:19.730> pretty<00:02:19.939> well<00:02:20.090> now<00:02:20.930> getting

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
solid it works pretty well now getting

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.190 
solid it works pretty well now getting
the<00:02:21.500> twin<00:02:21.769> Buster<00:02:22.280> cannon<00:02:22.670> in<00:02:22.790> place<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.750> not

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
the twin Buster cannon in place is not

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.009 
the twin Buster cannon in place is not
that<00:02:24.739> bad<00:02:25.069> actually<00:02:25.879> because<00:02:26.510> there's<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.780> peg

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
that bad actually because there's a peg

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.569 
that bad actually because there's a peg
on<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.200> back<00:02:27.470> of<00:02:27.650> this<00:02:27.739> weapon<00:02:27.980> here<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.430> just

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
on the back of this weapon here you just

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:29.979 
on the back of this weapon here you just
pull<00:02:28.819> it<00:02:28.849> out<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.090> plug<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.659> into<00:02:29.780> the

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
pull it out and plug it into the

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.780 
pull it out and plug it into the
Seraphim<00:02:30.439> and<00:02:30.620> then<00:02:31.310> it's<00:02:31.459> a<00:02:31.549> matter<00:02:31.579> of

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
Seraphim and then it's a matter of

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.550 
Seraphim and then it's a matter of
getting<00:02:31.939> the<00:02:32.090> arm<00:02:32.390> in<00:02:32.569> the<00:02:32.659> right<00:02:32.840> place<00:02:33.170> to

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
getting the arm in the right place to

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.710 
getting the arm in the right place to
pull<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.799> weapons<00:02:34.129> so<00:02:34.939> if<00:02:35.269> you<00:02:35.359> want<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.599> have

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
pull the weapons so if you want to have

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.300 
pull the weapons so if you want to have
him<00:02:35.870> shooting<00:02:36.230> forward<00:02:38.890> there's<00:02:39.890> no<00:02:40.099> big

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
him shooting forward there's no big

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.390 
him shooting forward there's no big
problems<00:02:40.730> with<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:42.099> when<00:02:43.099> you're<00:02:43.189> putting

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
problems with that when you're putting

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.849 
problems with that when you're putting
the<00:02:43.579> hands<00:02:44.120> on<00:02:44.329> the<00:02:44.389> lower<00:02:44.810> weapons<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.620> on

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
the hands on the lower weapons and on

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.410 
the hands on the lower weapons and on
the<00:02:45.980> top<00:02:46.159> you'll<00:02:46.400> notice<00:02:46.670> that<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.940> backs<00:02:47.180> are

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
the top you'll notice that the backs are

one<00:03:32.959> thing<00:03:33.169> I<00:03:33.290> have<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.500> complain<00:03:33.919> about<00:03:33.980> is<00:03:34.340> as

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
one thing I have to complain about is as

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.430 
one thing I have to complain about is as
I've<00:03:35.180> been<00:03:35.359> doing<00:03:35.629> different<00:03:35.930> poses<00:03:36.260> with

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
I've been doing different poses with

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.129 
I've been doing different poses with
this<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:37.220> legs<00:03:37.489> are<00:03:37.730> continuously<00:03:38.480> splitting

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
this the legs are continuously splitting

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.319 
this the legs are continuously splitting
and<00:03:39.290> spreading<00:03:39.620> apart<00:03:39.949> and<00:03:40.190> because<00:03:41.180> the

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
and spreading apart and because the

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:42.939 
and spreading apart and because the
ankles<00:03:41.659> don't<00:03:41.840> have<00:03:41.989> enough<00:03:42.290> mobility<00:03:42.829> they

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:42.949 
ankles don't have enough mobility they

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.129 
ankles don't have enough mobility they
can't<00:03:43.190> really<00:03:43.370> stay<00:03:43.729> flat<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:44.959> that's

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
can't really stay flat so that's

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.149 
can't really stay flat so that's
something<00:03:45.349> that<00:03:45.470> you<00:03:45.590> have<00:03:45.769> to<00:03:45.859> be<00:03:45.949> pretty

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
something that you have to be pretty

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.589 
something that you have to be pretty
careful<00:03:46.370> of<00:03:46.699> whenever<00:03:46.879> you're<00:03:47.150> trying<00:03:47.329> to

careful of whenever you're trying to

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.899 
careful of whenever you're trying to
pull<00:03:47.900> off<00:03:47.930> a<00:03:48.079> pose<00:03:48.349> with<00:03:48.560> this<00:03:48.799> to<00:03:49.609> put<00:03:49.790> the

servi in to face burst mode basically

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.399 
servi in to face burst mode basically
you<00:03:53.060> just<00:03:53.090> spread<00:03:53.629> the<00:03:53.780> antennas<00:03:54.260> out<00:03:54.379> a

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
you just spread the antennas out a

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.129 
you just spread the antennas out a
little<00:03:54.620> bit<00:03:54.829> and<00:03:55.329> pull<00:03:56.329> those<00:03:56.510> down<00:03:56.540> and<00:03:56.959> out

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
little bit and pull those down and out

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:01.539 
little bit and pull those down and out
and<00:03:57.379> pull<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.400> face<00:03:58.639> down<00:03:59.299> so<00:04:00.250> people<00:04:01.250> asked

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
and pull the face down so people asked

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.699 
and pull the face down so people asked
about<00:04:01.609> the<00:04:01.909> lighting<00:04:02.359> inside<00:04:02.569> yes<00:04:03.260> you<00:04:03.500> can

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
about the lighting inside yes you can

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.589 
about the lighting inside yes you can
put<00:04:03.949> a<00:04:03.979> light<00:04:04.250> in<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.519> back<00:04:04.549> of<00:04:04.819> the<00:04:04.909> CeraVe<00:04:05.419> or

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
put a light in the back of the CeraVe or

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.869 
put a light in the back of the CeraVe or
the<00:04:06.109> Seraph<00:04:06.440> I'm<00:04:06.560> sorry<00:04:06.799> and<00:04:07.040> because<00:04:07.639> it<00:04:07.760> has

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
the Seraph I'm sorry and because it has

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.360 
the Seraph I'm sorry and because it has
clear<00:04:08.120> parts<00:04:08.419> for<00:04:08.569> the<00:04:08.659> eyes<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:09.319> these<00:04:09.979> parts

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
clear parts for the eyes and these parts

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.619 
clear parts for the eyes and these parts
are<00:04:10.459> covered<00:04:10.609> up<00:04:10.819> with<00:04:11.000> seals<00:04:11.269> but<00:04:11.449> they're

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
are covered up with seals but they're

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.509 
are covered up with seals but they're
clear<00:04:11.840> parts<00:04:12.139> they're<00:04:12.349> the<00:04:12.769> light<00:04:13.040> would

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
clear parts they're the light would

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.509 
clear parts they're the light would
shine<00:04:13.549> through<00:04:14.829> now<00:04:15.829> I<00:04:15.859> think<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.220> head<00:04:16.340> looks

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
shine through now I think the head looks

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.979 
shine through now I think the head looks
pretty<00:04:16.729> cool<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.150> I<00:04:17.209> remember<00:04:17.599> when<00:04:17.720> I<00:04:17.750> first

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
pretty cool and I remember when I first

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.870 
pretty cool and I remember when I first
saw<00:04:18.260> it<00:04:18.289> at<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.560> start<00:04:18.739> of<00:04:18.889> season<00:04:18.949> 2<00:04:19.489> that<00:04:19.849> I

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
saw it at the start of season 2 that I

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.519 
saw it at the start of season 2 that I
wondered<00:04:20.450> if<00:04:20.570> these<00:04:20.750> were<00:04:20.989> going<00:04:21.169> to<00:04:21.260> be<00:04:21.409> the

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:21.529 
wondered if these were going to be the

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.120 
wondered if these were going to be the
first<00:04:21.680> Gundams<00:04:22.130> to<00:04:22.250> combine<00:04:22.669> transformers

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
first Gundams to combine transformers

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.420 
first Gundams to combine transformers
stater<00:04:24.340> style<00:04:24.700> but<00:04:25.450> thankfully<00:04:26.320> for<00:04:26.680> fans<00:04:27.220> of

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
stater style but thankfully for fans of

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.240 
stater style but thankfully for fans of
Gundam<00:04:27.790> they<00:04:28.300> resisted<00:04:29.050> that<00:04:29.080> urge<00:04:29.380> but<00:04:30.100> it's

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
Gundam they resisted that urge but it's

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.860 
Gundam they resisted that urge but it's
still<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.430> pretty<00:04:30.640> cool<00:04:30.880> effect<00:04:31.000> on<00:04:31.360> the<00:04:31.450> back

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
still a pretty cool effect on the back

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.810 
still a pretty cool effect on the back
I<00:04:31.900> think<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.770> seraphim<00:04:33.220> looks<00:04:33.400> pretty<00:04:33.640> cool

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
I think the seraphim looks pretty cool

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.970 
I think the seraphim looks pretty cool
just<00:04:34.240> arm<00:04:34.570> blasters<00:04:35.080> and<00:04:35.380> of<00:04:35.500> course<00:04:35.740> as

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
just arm blasters and of course as

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.910 
just arm blasters and of course as
you've<00:04:36.220> seen<00:04:36.550> with<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.210> CeraVe<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:38.380> hand<00:04:38.710> has

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
you've seen with the CeraVe the hand has

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.870 
you've seen with the CeraVe the hand has
no<00:04:39.130> problem<00:04:39.460> at<00:04:39.520> all

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
no problem at all

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.260 
no problem at all
holding<00:04:40.660> up<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:41.320> beam<00:04:41.530> sabers<00:04:42.040> but<00:04:42.880> let's<00:04:43.090> see

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
holding up the beam sabers but let's see

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.570 
holding up the beam sabers but let's see
if<00:04:43.300> it<00:04:43.450> can<00:04:43.600> hold<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:43.840> bazookas<00:04:44.370> let's<00:04:45.370> try<00:04:45.550> a

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
if it can hold the bazookas let's try a

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.490 
if it can hold the bazookas let's try a
live<00:04:45.820> shot<00:04:46.120> here<00:04:46.390> with<00:04:46.540> the<00:04:46.660> arm<00:04:46.840> up<00:04:47.080> 90

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
live shot here with the arm up 90

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.980 
live shot here with the arm up 90
degrees<00:04:47.800> and<00:04:48.130> I<00:04:49.030> will<00:04:49.240> hold<00:04:49.420> on<00:04:49.570> to<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:49.780> legs

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
degrees and I will hold on to the legs

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.800 
degrees and I will hold on to the legs
and<00:04:50.290> put<00:04:50.830> in<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:51.420> bazooka<00:04:52.420> and<00:04:54.300> you<00:04:55.300> can<00:04:55.510> see

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
and put in the bazooka and you can see

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.160 
and put in the bazooka and you can see
that<00:04:56.080> it<00:04:56.410> is<00:04:56.620> falling<00:04:57.340> down<00:04:57.790> so<00:04:58.630> that's<00:04:58.810> one

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
that it is falling down so that's one

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.690 
that it is falling down so that's one
bazooka<00:04:59.770> so<00:04:59.980> if<00:05:00.100> you<00:05:00.220> did<00:05:00.370> put<00:05:00.490> it<00:05:00.610> together

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
bazooka so if you did put it together

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.330 
bazooka so if you did put it together
into<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.300> twin<00:05:01.540> bazooka<00:05:01.990> there<00:05:02.830> would<00:05:03.010> be<00:05:03.040> no

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
into the twin bazooka there would be no

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.370 
into the twin bazooka there would be no
chance<00:05:03.640> that<00:05:03.790> it<00:05:04.000> would<00:05:04.120> be<00:05:04.240> able<00:05:04.510> to<00:05:04.840> hold<00:05:05.140> it

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
chance that it would be able to hold it

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.860 
chance that it would be able to hold it
up<00:05:05.500> for<00:05:05.530> a<00:05:05.830> prolonged<00:05:06.040> period<00:05:06.280> of<00:05:06.670> time<00:05:06.970> but

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
up for a prolonged period of time but

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:15.180 
up for a prolonged period of time but
let's<00:05:08.080> take<00:05:08.290> a<00:05:08.320> look<00:05:13.440> okay<00:05:14.440> so<00:05:14.980> you're<00:05:15.100> not

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
let's take a look okay so you're not

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.710 
let's take a look okay so you're not
even<00:05:15.400> going<00:05:15.520> to<00:05:15.580> get<00:05:15.700> any<00:05:15.910> time<00:05:16.210> delay<00:05:16.510> with

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
even going to get any time delay with

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.660 
even going to get any time delay with
that<00:05:16.900> one<00:05:17.110> collapsing<00:05:17.650> so<00:05:18.220> the<00:05:18.310> poses<00:05:18.640> that

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
that one collapsing so the poses that

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.430 
that one collapsing so the poses that
you<00:05:18.820> see<00:05:19.060> on<00:05:19.150> the<00:05:19.240> back<00:05:19.420> of<00:05:19.690> the<00:05:19.810> box<00:05:20.020> it's<00:05:20.290> not

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
you see on the back of the box it's not

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.020 
you see on the back of the box it's not
that<00:05:20.590> they're<00:05:20.740> misleading<00:05:21.250> but<00:05:21.670> it's<00:05:21.850> just

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
that they're misleading but it's just

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.480 
that they're misleading but it's just

one-hundredth<00:05:35.860> action<00:05:36.310> basis<00:05:36.760> they<00:05:37.150> come<00:05:37.360> in

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
one-hundredth action basis they come in

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.450 
one-hundredth action basis they come in
a<00:05:37.510> bunch<00:05:37.660> of<00:05:37.750> colors<00:05:37.810> you<00:05:38.740> can<00:05:38.950> launch<00:05:39.190> them

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
a bunch of colors you can launch them

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.880 
a bunch of colors you can launch them
both<00:05:39.670> midair<00:05:40.150> at<00:05:40.360> the<00:05:40.690> same<00:05:40.900> time<00:05:41.170> for<00:05:41.560> me<00:05:41.680> this

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
both midair at the same time for me this

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.620 
both midair at the same time for me this
is<00:05:42.040> where<00:05:42.190> it<00:05:42.280> starts<00:05:42.550> to<00:05:42.610> become<00:05:42.790> all<00:05:43.180> worth

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
is where it starts to become all worth

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.660 
is where it starts to become all worth
it<00:05:43.840> because<00:05:44.080> when<00:05:44.350> you<00:05:44.440> have<00:05:44.560> the<00:05:44.770> to<00:05:45.040> action

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
it because when you have the to action

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.180 
it because when you have the to action
basis<00:05:46.090> you<00:05:47.050> can<00:05:47.470> pull<00:05:47.680> off<00:05:47.800> a<00:05:47.830> pretty

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
basis you can pull off a pretty

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.620 
basis you can pull off a pretty
cool-looking<00:05:48.460> pose<00:05:48.940> where<00:05:49.270> it<00:05:49.360> looks<00:05:49.540> like

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
cool-looking pose where it looks like

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.110 
cool-looking pose where it looks like
the<00:05:49.840> seraphim<00:05:50.350> is<00:05:50.530> peeling<00:05:51.370> off<00:05:51.670> the<00:05:51.730> back<00:05:52.090> of

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
the seraphim is peeling off the back of

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.020 
the seraphim is peeling off the back of
the<00:05:52.360> CeraVe<00:05:52.780> and<00:05:53.020> ready<00:05:53.470> to<00:05:53.590> go<00:05:53.830> attack<00:05:54.160> now

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
the CeraVe and ready to go attack now

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
the CeraVe and ready to go attack now
you're<00:05:55.150> going<00:05:55.270> to<00:05:55.360> have<00:05:55.450> trouble<00:05:55.600> putting<00:05:55.930> the

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
you're going to have trouble putting the

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.750 
you're going to have trouble putting the
bazookas<00:05:56.470> together<00:05:56.740> because<00:05:57.130> of<00:05:57.280> the<00:05:57.430> weight

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
bazookas together because of the weight

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.870 
bazookas together because of the weight
issue<00:05:58.690> that<00:05:58.990> I<00:05:59.020> mentioned<00:05:59.470> before<00:05:59.730> but<00:06:00.730> still

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
issue that I mentioned before but still

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.820 
issue that I mentioned before but still
with<00:06:01.150> only<00:06:01.180> two<00:06:01.480> beam<00:06:01.720> sabers<00:06:02.140> I<00:06:02.290> think<00:06:02.680> this

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
with only two beam sabers I think this

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.730 
with only two beam sabers I think this
combination<00:06:03.430> looks<00:06:03.730> pretty<00:06:04.690> cool<00:06:04.960> and<00:06:05.290> I

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
combination looks pretty cool and I

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.620 
combination looks pretty cool and I
think<00:06:05.980> if<00:06:06.070> you<00:06:06.160> put<00:06:06.190> all<00:06:06.460> five<00:06:06.730> Gundams<00:06:07.240> up<00:06:07.420> on

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
think if you put all five Gundams up on

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.780 
think if you put all five Gundams up on
clear<00:06:08.050> action<00:06:08.410> bases<00:06:08.770> together<00:06:08.890> that's<00:06:09.640> a

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
clear action bases together that's a

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.300 
clear action bases together that's a
very<00:06:10.000> nice-looking<00:06:10.270> team<00:06:10.810> shot<00:06:11.110> so<00:06:11.830> now<00:06:11.950> some

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
very nice-looking team shot so now some

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.000 
very nice-looking team shot so now some
final<00:06:12.460> thoughts<00:06:12.850> on<00:06:13.000> the<00:06:13.060> syrupy<00:06:13.510> Gundam

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
final thoughts on the syrupy Gundam

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.470 
final thoughts on the syrupy Gundam
first<00:06:15.010> of<00:06:15.190> all<00:06:15.280> you're<00:06:15.460> getting<00:06:15.580> two<00:06:15.940> guns<00:06:16.270> for

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:16.480 
first of all you're getting two guns for

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.630 
first of all you're getting two guns for
the<00:06:16.540> price<00:06:16.720> of<00:06:16.750> one<00:06:17.080> for<00:06:17.350> 3600<00:06:18.100> yen<00:06:18.250> so<00:06:18.460> that's

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
the price of one for 3600 yen so that's

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.910 
the price of one for 3600 yen so that's
not<00:06:18.790> a<00:06:18.820> bad<00:06:19.030> price<00:06:19.270> and<00:06:19.780> it<00:06:20.170> is<00:06:20.200> very<00:06:20.560> hollow

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
not a bad price and it is very hollow

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.070 
not a bad price and it is very hollow
and<00:06:21.310> down<00:06:22.000> here<00:06:22.300> you<00:06:22.450> can<00:06:22.600> see<00:06:22.630> that<00:06:22.870> there<00:06:23.020> are

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
and down here you can see that there are

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.330 
and down here you can see that there are
a<00:06:23.140> couple<00:06:23.290> parts<00:06:23.650> that<00:06:23.830> this<00:06:23.980> should<00:06:24.190> be

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
a couple parts that this should be

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.730 
a couple parts that this should be
painted<00:06:24.730> gray<00:06:25.000> etc<00:06:25.570> now<00:06:26.080> that<00:06:26.320> doesn't<00:06:26.620> come

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
painted gray etc now that doesn't come

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.950 
painted gray etc now that doesn't come
across<00:06:26.860> when<00:06:27.250> you<00:06:27.280> buy<00:06:27.490> a<00:06:27.520> 1/100<00:06:28.330> non<00:06:28.570> grade<00:06:28.840> of

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
across when you buy a 1/100 non grade of

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.230 
across when you buy a 1/100 non grade of
course<00:06:29.140> but<00:06:30.070> overall<00:06:30.370> the<00:06:30.550> playability<00:06:31.000> of

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
course but overall the playability of

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.820 
course but overall the playability of
this<00:06:31.420> model<00:06:31.750> is<00:06:31.870> great<00:06:32.169> there's<00:06:32.440> a<00:06:32.500> lot<00:06:32.710> of

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
this model is great there's a lot of

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.560 
this model is great there's a lot of
weapon<00:06:33.160> variations<00:06:33.760> because<00:06:34.150> of<00:06:34.270> the<00:06:34.360> twin

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570 
weapon variations because of the twin

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.760 
weapon variations because of the twin
bazookas

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
bazookas

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.740 
bazookas
and<00:06:35.889> the<00:06:36.220> hands<00:06:36.759> and<00:06:36.970> the<00:06:37.120> blasters<00:06:37.539> on<00:06:37.660> the

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
and the hands and the blasters on the

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.659 
and the hands and the blasters on the
legs<00:06:37.930> for<00:06:38.530> me<00:06:38.650> this<00:06:38.830> is<00:06:39.009> a<00:06:39.039> real<00:06:39.280> selling<00:06:39.639> point

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:39.669 
legs for me this is a real selling point

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:41.640 
legs for me this is a real selling point
because<00:06:40.150> they<00:06:40.270> have<00:06:40.389> a<00:06:40.419> lot<00:06:40.660> of<00:06:40.840> mobility<00:06:41.259> and

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
because they have a lot of mobility and

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.379 
because they have a lot of mobility and
you<00:06:41.800> can<00:06:41.949> move<00:06:42.099> them<00:06:42.280> around<00:06:42.340> and<00:06:42.669> pull<00:06:43.240> of

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389 
you can move them around and pull of

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:46.290 
you can move them around and pull of
some<00:06:43.569> pretty<00:06:43.780> cool-looking<00:06:44.080> effects<00:06:45.300> when

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
some pretty cool-looking effects when

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.749 
some pretty cool-looking effects when
you<00:06:46.419> put<00:06:46.629> in<00:06:46.750> six<00:06:47.080> beam<00:06:47.319> sabers<00:06:47.830> I<00:06:48.069> think<00:06:48.520> it<00:06:48.639> is

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:48.759 
you put in six beam sabers I think it is

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:50.399 
you put in six beam sabers I think it is
one<00:06:48.940> of<00:06:48.970> the<00:06:49.120> coolest<00:06:49.449> looking<00:06:49.539> Gundams<00:06:50.110> I

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:50.409 
one of the coolest looking Gundams I

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:53.159 
one of the coolest looking Gundams I
have<00:06:50.919> ever<00:06:51.099> seen<00:06:51.490> but<00:06:52.270> now<00:06:52.509> for<00:06:52.750> the<00:06:52.810> negative

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:53.169 
have ever seen but now for the negative

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:56.879 
have ever seen but now for the negative
points<00:06:53.500> the<00:06:54.069> legs<00:06:54.460> are<00:06:54.879> very<00:06:55.599> easy<00:06:56.530> to<00:06:56.710> split

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:56.889 
points the legs are very easy to split

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:58.379 
points the legs are very easy to split
apart<00:06:57.159> and<00:06:57.370> fall<00:06:57.490> apart<00:06:57.729> so<00:06:57.940> you<00:06:58.000> have<00:06:58.150> to<00:06:58.300> be

00:06:58.379 --> 00:06:58.389 
apart and fall apart so you have to be

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:00.990 
apart and fall apart so you have to be
careful<00:06:58.750> with<00:06:58.840> your<00:06:59.050> balancing<00:06:59.560> and<00:06:59.710> like<00:07:00.699> any

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
careful with your balancing and like any

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.890 
careful with your balancing and like any
cool<00:07:01.389> looking<00:07:01.750> weapon<00:07:02.080> that's<00:07:02.319> huge

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
cool looking weapon that's huge

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.689 
cool looking weapon that's huge
basically<00:07:04.900> the<00:07:05.139> arms<00:07:05.470> can't<00:07:06.129> support<00:07:06.520> the

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:06.699 
basically the arms can't support the

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:08.490 
basically the arms can't support the
weight<00:07:06.849> so<00:07:07.419> if<00:07:07.780> you<00:07:07.930> put<00:07:08.080> in<00:07:08.169> the<00:07:08.259> double

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.500 
weight so if you put in the double

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.559 
weight so if you put in the double
bazooka<00:07:08.919> here<00:07:09.190> and<00:07:09.310> attach<00:07:09.520> it<00:07:09.699> together<00:07:09.819> then

00:07:10.559 --> 00:07:10.569 
bazooka here and attach it together then

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:11.969 
bazooka here and attach it together then
it's<00:07:10.930> just<00:07:11.110> going<00:07:11.259> to<00:07:11.319> be<00:07:11.440> a<00:07:11.470> matter<00:07:11.650> of<00:07:11.740> time

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:11.979 
it's just going to be a matter of time
