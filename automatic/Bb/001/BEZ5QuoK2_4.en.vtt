00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.909
 I'm going to put this bowl here 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:01.950
 we can be all boiling water in the 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.900
 bowl or in a bucket as you would two 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.170
 spoons of salt 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.030

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.960
 the basin 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.060
 now the second part of the mixture is 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.200

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:55.549
 reuse of the basin and now we 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.269
 will take that instinct that had 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:03.319
 shown to you from the beginning and 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:05.750
 pour into the pink mixture 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:10.340
 red blue goes slowly 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:13.340

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.970
