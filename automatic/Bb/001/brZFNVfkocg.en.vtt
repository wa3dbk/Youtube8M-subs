00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
transit in the die rise map there were

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.509 
transit in the die rise map there were
radio<00:00:21.689> signals<00:00:22.350> with<00:00:23.100> somebody

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
radio signals with somebody

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.189 
radio signals with somebody
communicating<00:00:24.359> over<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.810> radio<00:00:25.199> tower

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
communicating over this radio tower

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.359 
communicating over this radio tower
communicating<00:00:28.199> somewhat<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.949> kind<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.189> seems

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
like they're communicating with the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.840 
like they're communicating with the
other<00:00:30.750> maps<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.529> are<00:00:31.590> on<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.219> zombies<00:00:32.640> world

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
map and there's like a blue pulsating

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.840 
map and there's like a blue pulsating
signal<00:00:37.050> coming<00:00:37.290> from<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:38.010> maps<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.670> I'll

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
signal coming from the maps and I'll

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.610 
signal coming from the maps and I'll
also<00:00:39.059> leave<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.629> picture<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.110> what<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.469> looks

also leave a picture of what it looks
like<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.920> screen<00:00:41.250> now<00:00:41.370> for<00:00:41.640> both<00:00:41.820> transit<00:00:42.450> and

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
like on screen now for both transit and

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.799 
like on screen now for both transit and
die<00:00:42.899> rise<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.860> um<00:00:44.480> today<00:00:45.480> I'm<00:00:45.539> going<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.690> be

talking<00:00:45.899> about<00:00:46.110> pretty<00:00:46.379> much<00:00:46.469> what<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.829> believe

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
talking about pretty much what I believe

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.340

they<00:00:47.399> will<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.059> how<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.510> nav<00:00:48.750> cards<00:00:49.140> come

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
they will do and how the nav cards come

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.439 
they will do and how the nav cards come
into<00:00:49.559> play<00:00:49.739> with<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.399> how<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.820> easter

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
into play with this and how the easter

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.310 
into play with this and how the easter
eggs<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:52.260> have<00:00:53.250> been<00:00:53.719> starting<00:00:54.719> starting

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
eggs have have been starting starting

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.069 
eggs have have been starting starting
this<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.850> i<00:00:56.879> believe<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.270> happening<00:00:57.570> is

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
this so what i believe is happening is

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.500 
this so what i believe is happening is
that<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.129> showing<00:00:59.489> your<00:00:59.670> indication<00:01:00.149> of

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
that it is showing your indication of

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.750 
that it is showing your indication of
them<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.620> easter<00:01:01.949> egg<00:01:02.039> being<00:01:02.280> completed

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
them of the easter egg being completed

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.710 
them of the easter egg being completed
and<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:05.280> i<00:01:05.460> believe<00:01:05.729> what<00:01:05.939> they<00:01:06.060> will<00:01:06.240> do<00:01:06.450> is

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
and and i believe what they will do is

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.170 
and and i believe what they will do is
as<00:01:07.500> soon<00:01:07.560> as<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.159> finish<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> easter<00:01:08.970> egg

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
as soon as you we finish the easter egg

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.740 
as soon as you we finish the easter egg
on<00:01:09.650> buried<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.950> either<00:01:11.189> Dr<00:01:11.790> Maxis<00:01:11.939> or<00:01:12.420> rat

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
on buried for either Dr Maxis or rat

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.670 
on buried for either Dr Maxis or rat
Oakland<00:01:13.140> there<00:01:13.830> will<00:01:14.100> be<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:15.750> oranges<00:01:16.380> for

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
Oakland there will be a the oranges for

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.820 
Oakland there will be a the oranges for
or<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> orange<00:01:17.340> /<00:01:17.580> red<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.119> for<00:01:18.150> Max's<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
or the orange / red is for Max's and the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.190 
or the orange / red is for Max's and the
Blue<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.040> for<00:01:20.220> Richtofen<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.509> believe<00:01:21.960> that

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
Blue is for Richtofen so I believe that

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.929 
Blue is for Richtofen so I believe that
once<00:01:22.409> you've<00:01:22.560> completed<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.369> Easter<00:01:23.670> Egg<00:01:23.790> for

once you've completed the Easter Egg for

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.910 
once you've completed the Easter Egg for
either<00:01:24.450> Richtofen<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.470> then<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.680> will<00:01:25.830> get

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
either Richtofen and then you will get

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.649 
either Richtofen and then you will get
the<00:01:26.070> blue<00:01:26.280> pulsating<00:01:26.970> signal<00:01:27.360> coming<00:01:27.540> from

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the blue pulsating signal coming from

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.289 
the blue pulsating signal coming from
buried<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.770> do<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.280> mac<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:30.000> easter

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
buried and if you do the mac the easter

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.990 
buried and if you do the mac the easter
egg<00:01:30.420> for<00:01:30.689> Maxis<00:01:31.590> there<00:01:32.189> will<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.670> orange

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
egg for Maxis there will be the orange

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.160 
egg for Maxis there will be the orange
pulsating<00:01:33.630> radio<00:01:34.500> signal<00:01:34.979> coming<00:01:35.220> from

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
pulsating radio signal coming from

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.380 
pulsating radio signal coming from
buried<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.829> believe<00:01:38.280> what<00:01:38.640> we<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.270> do

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
buried so I believe what we have to do

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.020 
buried so I believe what we have to do
is<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.840> course<00:01:40.049> um<00:01:40.490> complete<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.579> Easter<00:01:41.909> Egg

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
is of course um complete the Easter Egg

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.910 
is of course um complete the Easter Egg
for<00:01:42.060> every<00:01:42.479> single<00:01:42.659> map<00:01:42.960> obviously<00:01:43.619> mod<00:01:43.799> with

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
for every single map obviously mod with

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.249 
for every single map obviously mod with
the<00:01:44.009> dead<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.340> nuketown<00:01:44.520> zombies<00:01:44.869> do<00:01:45.869> not<00:01:46.020> come

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the dead in nuketown zombies do not come

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.929 
the dead in nuketown zombies do not come
into<00:01:46.409> play<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> Easter<00:01:47.159> egg<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.490> do<00:01:47.670> not

into play of the Easter egg so do not
worry<00:01:48.180> about<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.590> believe<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.700> just

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
worry about that I believe this is just
