00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.470
 seen around a school a couple of 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.400
 Sometimes he thought of adding t but that 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.060
 race of problems or help help 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.400
 failed mission withdraws city ​​is seen in 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.880
 I too could meet you 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.610
 really disturbing everything 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.670
 stalker has come to chance and guess a 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.380
 we talked for hours when we were 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.050
 come to the end of the conversation le 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.160
 I said you should sign my yearbook 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.280
 even if we just met 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.940
 sure you go to the field tomorrow you there 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.739
 see there the field is this event 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.780
 funfair style organized at school 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.180
 every year we meet molin and finally 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.229
 we introduced ourselves in person was the dream 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.420
 of every stalker joke anyway 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.060
 erin was shorter than me 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.500
 froyo but only because he had scoliosis e 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.870
 he told me that if it wasn't for 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.570
 that would have been higher o 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.070
 mixed feelings about it 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.720
 anyway I got his number and from 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.540
 that moment we talked all day 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.920
 everyday 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.210
 we had a very strong bond I have 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.510
 amazed at how fast we are 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.340
 united 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.010
 we shared many interests there 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.650
 liked being together I had a crush 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.790
 and before he put it I knew that too 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.980
 she took it 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.240
 but sometimes meet the right person 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.180
 at the wrong time 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.630
 I told her I was leaving Canada 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.100
 seriously yes before I lived there and I did 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.600
 request to enter the school of 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.930
 toronto architecture 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.540
 they took me I'm really happy for 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.790
 you but it is very far away imagine it 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.890
 will go soon already i'm sorry we were n't 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.929
 still together when I told him about it 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.630
 we talked while I was going to 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.070
 I was going there for another month there 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.780
 we are seen the next day 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.030
 I know it was a stupid thing to do 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.250
 but I still asked her to be the 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.370
 my girlfriend though I thought 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.850
 seriously we would have broken 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.640
 at the end of the month the distance is 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.600
 quite preponderant and I would do it a 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.030
 found only once a year but I did it 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.610
 and he said yes 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.260
 about bad timing later 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.330
 I left in early July 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.860
 I would be back in Virginia a month later 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.540
 in August because bad timing erin 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.940
 went to volunteer in africa e 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.690
 it would come back exactly after mine 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.160
 starting point for an idea in canada but 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.840
 however let's try to be together the 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.650
 as possible before the day of 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.549
 judgment but the last day was 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.549
 obviously the hardest 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.340
 we should see each other like via webcam I don't 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.440
 I have a web camera I will buy when I have to 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.900
 still pack up and give it to me 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.040
 rai if you have to leave early tomorrow 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.400
 I'll leave it in the mailbox 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.400
 when I come in August it's fine 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:32.069
 my father wants me at home I think I have to 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:38.709
 to go 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:43.540
 okay i don't want to say goodbye to you 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.530
 so I tell you see you come to me a 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.830
 to find 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.830
 ok 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.690
 I knew I didn't have to look back 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.989
 but I did it and it was very painful me 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.989
 I'm told not to come back from her will get worse 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.790
 things are turned and continues to 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.530
 to walk 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.250
 5 years have passed and I haven't seen it since 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:13.150
 then in person at the very least 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.590
 she's just crying so they're back 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.120
 in canada and we tried to keep 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.489
 the contacts 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.040
 we talked almost every day and used the 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:25.360
 webcam as much as possible the school start 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.900
 and I was alone in a high environment I tell you 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.210
 one thing 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.460
 architecture is really difficult not 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.980
 I've never spent so many sleepless nights 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.780
 in my life I was stressed and 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.780
 bad mood and that's where they started 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.310
 change things between me and erin we have 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.050
 started talking less because of 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.580
 my thick agenda the quarrels 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.110
 were becoming more frequent e 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.520
 the impact with the school did not help 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.130
 in the way he handled the 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.860
 conversations and on the other hand she is not 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.080
 was very sympathetic towards 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.260
 adding all these factors was clear 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.500
 that it was time to close the matter 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.419
 it hurt maybe too bad because not 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.050
 we talked for a while and a few weeks 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.460
 after a friend of ours looked for me, I haring 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.940
 lost it 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.880
 what has lost your beautiful memory 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.310
 remember barely but what the fuck that is 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:19.000
 success 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.969
 erin had an accident had fallen from 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.610
 stairs 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:25.429
 and even if she wasn't seriously injured 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.679
 you suffer from some amnesia only part 

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:29.839
 of his memories were canceled 

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:32.719
 and I happened to be in those memories 

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:34.669
 no one likes to be forgotten 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:36.229
 if you have seen enough TV series 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.409
 you will think that I have not done anything that I have 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:41.869
 said he is so much better looking 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:44.119
 introspectively the moonlight 

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:45.319
 no I did the egoist is called one 

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:48.169
 crap type 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:51.679
 this is not a tv series ie you think of 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:53.689
 to be able to forget me but has therefore the 

00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:55.849
 I wrote you were not completely 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:57.679
 he forgot about me he knew about mine 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:00.289
 existence but many of our past 

00:05:57.679 --> 00:06:02.539
 they were blurred in his memory 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:04.909
 but as soon as we resumed hearing his 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.739
 memory began to return and with that 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:09.439
 also the hostility and the tension that 

00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:11.209
 he tried for me we resumed fighting but 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:14.269
 in a more passive aggressive style 

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:18.249
 conversations were unstable and 

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:18.249
 slowly we stopped talking to each other 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:23.099
 but despite all that it is not that 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.639
 I can say you were a bitch of 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:29.039
 fuck why years after the decided of 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.839
 sign up again we were more 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:33.110
 mature and managed to get over the old ones 

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:33.110
 wounds 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.409
 you know when it happens to you 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.150
 something and think 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:41.069
 I bet when we rethink everything 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:44.520
 this in five years we will laugh at 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:50.479
 how stupid we were well that's what it is 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.479
 success between me and erin already
