P we've got a house here that's got a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.770 
P we've got a house here that's got a
whole<00:00:12.809> bunch<00:00:13.019> top<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:14.009> bottom<00:00:14.599> we're<00:00:15.599> going<00:00:15.719> to

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
whole bunch top to bottom we're going to

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.359 
whole bunch top to bottom we're going to
practice<00:00:16.020> doing<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.650> two<00:00:16.830> ways

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
practice doing it two ways

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.519 
practice doing it two ways
there<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.449> straight<00:00:18.720> pulls<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.260> then

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
there is the straight pulls and then

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.980 
there is the straight pulls and then
there<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.920> basically<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.820> Z<00:00:21.240> technique<00:00:21.689> just

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
there is basically the Z technique just

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.960 
there is basically the Z technique just
like<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.260> do<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.380> big<00:00:22.619> windows<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.609> we'll<00:00:23.850> show

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
like you do on big windows so we'll show

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.650 
like you do on big windows so we'll show
you<00:00:24.029> both<00:00:24.240> here<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.720> we'll<00:00:24.900> go<00:00:24.960> from<00:00:25.080> there

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
first you got to have some bits open

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:29.330 
first you got to have some bits open
your<00:00:28.859> water

to<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.260> I've<00:00:34.980> done<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.489> here<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.239> wand

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
to it I've done that here on this wand

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.090 
to it I've done that here on this wand
cover<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.079> like<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.350> use<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.649> because<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.980> get

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
cover I like to use this because it get

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.740 
cover I like to use this because it get
some<00:00:38.219> really<00:00:38.489> sudsy<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.090> lathery<00:00:39.510> which

some really sudsy and lathery which

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.979 
some really sudsy and lathery which
makes<00:00:40.290> for<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.559> good<00:00:40.710> shiny<00:00:40.950> window<00:00:41.840> like<00:00:42.840> to

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
makes for a good shiny window like to

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.810 
makes for a good shiny window like to
spread<00:00:43.200> some<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.530> water<00:00:43.829> out<00:00:43.980> first<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.520> it's

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
spread some this water out first so it's

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.569 
spread some this water out first so it's
not<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:45.149> dripping<00:00:45.360> out<00:00:46.039> and<00:00:47.039> go<00:00:47.190> from<00:00:47.370> there

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
not just dripping out and go from there

00:00:47.579 --> 00:01:10.210 
not just dripping out and go from there
first<00:00:48.090> we'll<00:00:48.300> do<00:00:48.480> straight<00:00:48.960> folds

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.640 

each<00:01:11.090> time<00:01:11.360> swipe<00:01:11.690> your<00:01:11.870> blade<00:01:12.080> off<00:01:12.260> that<00:01:12.530> way

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
each time swipe your blade off that way

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:39.740 
each time swipe your blade off that way
you<00:01:12.710> don't<00:01:12.860> have<00:01:12.980> sides<00:01:13.370> all<00:01:13.580> over<00:01:13.820> everything

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:02:25.089

Tincknell<00:02:25.790> camel

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.360 

each<00:02:38.989> time<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.410> adjust<00:02:39.770> this<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:40.040> little<00:02:40.160> bit

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.400 
through doing the swirl and our Zima
that<00:02:57.680> I<00:02:57.739> call<00:02:57.920> it<00:02:59.019> couple<00:03:00.019> different<00:03:00.260> ways<00:03:00.349> you

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
that I call it couple different ways you

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.880 
that I call it couple different ways you
can<00:03:00.590> do<00:03:00.739> it

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
can do it

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.000 
can do it
but<00:03:01.040> here's<00:03:01.220> lovin<00:03:02.319> all<00:03:03.319> soaked<00:03:03.590> up<00:03:03.769> again

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
but here's lovin all soaked up again

00:03:04.010 --> 00:04:20.710 
but here's lovin all soaked up again
here

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.470 

okay<00:04:21.260> there<00:04:21.560> we<00:04:21.620> go<00:04:21.650> folks<00:04:22.280> there's<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.180> Z

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
okay there we go folks there's the Z

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.730 
okay there we go folks there's the Z
method<00:04:23.810> and<00:04:23.990> straight<00:04:24.380> poles

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
method and straight poles

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.990 
method and straight poles
so<00:04:25.040> hopefully<00:04:25.220> you<00:04:25.430> learn<00:04:25.550> something<00:04:25.820> by<00:04:25.940> the

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
so hopefully you learn something by the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.780 
so hopefully you learn something by the
video<00:04:26.150> also<00:04:26.990> I<00:04:27.530> wanted<00:04:27.950> to<00:04:28.130> show<00:04:28.340> you<00:04:28.370> I<00:04:28.550> mean

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
video also I wanted to show you I mean

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.130 
video also I wanted to show you I mean
normally<00:04:29.210> I<00:04:29.270> don't<00:04:29.330> go<00:04:29.510> quite<00:04:29.750> this<00:04:29.930> fast

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
normally I don't go quite this fast

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.170 
normally I don't go quite this fast
because<00:04:31.070> when<00:04:31.280> you<00:04:31.340> first<00:04:31.520> get<00:04:31.670> to<00:04:31.790> a<00:04:31.820> job<00:04:32.030> you

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
because when you first get to a job you

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.420 
because when you first get to a job you
have<00:04:32.360> to<00:04:32.450> address<00:04:32.720> stuff<00:04:33.350> like<00:04:33.560> bird<00:04:33.860> poop<00:04:34.130> and

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
have to address stuff like bird poop and

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.460 
have to address stuff like bird poop and
spiders<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:35.180> on<00:04:35.750> this<00:04:35.870> one<00:04:36.050> you<00:04:36.170> have<00:04:36.260> a<00:04:36.290> lot

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
spiders and on this one you have a lot

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.020 
spiders and on this one you have a lot
of<00:04:36.500> ivy<00:04:36.860> growing<00:04:37.040> around<00:04:37.340> so<00:04:37.610> sometimes<00:04:37.910> I

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
of ivy growing around so sometimes I

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.910 
of ivy growing around so sometimes I
have<00:04:38.060> ivy<00:04:38.420> growing<00:04:38.600> up<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.930> window<00:04:39.200> and<00:04:39.860> of

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
have ivy growing up the window and of

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.380 
have ivy growing up the window and of
course<00:04:40.160> you<00:04:40.250> can't<00:04:40.490> just<00:04:40.700> blast<00:04:41.060> through<00:04:41.240> it

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
course you can't just blast through it

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.890 
course you can't just blast through it
but<00:04:41.780> in<00:04:42.500> this<00:04:42.650> case<00:04:42.710> we<00:04:43.130> could<00:04:43.310> today<00:04:43.820> they<00:04:44.780> had

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
but in this case we could today they had

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.540 
but in this case we could today they had
a<00:04:44.930> couple<00:04:45.170> little<00:04:45.350> bird<00:04:45.590> spots<00:04:45.980> and<00:04:46.340> these

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
a couple little bird spots and these
