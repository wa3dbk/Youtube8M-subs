a<00:01:33.479> little<00:01:33.570> bit<00:01:33.780> about<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.200> processing<00:01:34.799> power

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
a little bit about the processing power

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.999 
a little bit about the processing power
of<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.369> tablet<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.420> processor<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.500> a

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
of this tablet the processor is a

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.190 
of this tablet the processor is a

2 to 5 Q CPU and the fact that this is a
quad-core<00:01:47.820> CPU<00:01:48.329> was<00:01:48.540> something<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:48.930> was

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
quad-core CPU was something that was

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.160 
quad-core CPU was something that was
used<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.770> propel<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.850> sales<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.630> tablet

so<00:01:52.710> let's<00:01:53.100> look<00:01:53.310> at<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.759> more<00:01:53.909> detail<00:01:54.270> so

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
so let's look at it in more detail so

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.870 
so let's look at it in more detail so
let's<00:01:55.590> start<00:01:55.860> off<00:01:55.979> with<00:01:56.189> some<00:01:56.430> benchmark

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
let's start off with some benchmark

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.410 
let's start off with some benchmark

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
just take some good shots if we work at

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.970 
just take some good shots if we work at
it<00:04:22.730> now<00:04:23.540> let's<00:04:23.720> talk<00:04:23.870> about<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.170> display<00:04:24.500> the

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
it now let's talk about the display the

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.780 
it now let's talk about the display the
resolution<00:04:25.580> is<00:04:25.790> 12<00:04:26.300> 32<00:04:26.570> x<00:04:27.140> 800<00:04:28.040> it<00:04:28.610> is

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
resolution is 12 32 x 800 it is

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.120 
resolution is 12 32 x 800 it is
reasonably<00:04:29.270> bright<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:29.930> colourful<00:04:30.590> though

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
reasonably bright and colourful though

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.670 
reasonably bright and colourful though
not<00:04:31.850> comparable<00:04:32.330> to<00:04:32.450> an<00:04:32.630> IPS<00:04:33.050> or<00:04:33.290> anything

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
not comparable to an IPS or anything

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.110 
not comparable to an IPS or anything
like<00:04:33.920> that<00:04:33.980> the<00:04:34.940> tablet<00:04:35.510> has<00:04:35.750> Adreno<00:04:36.590> 2:03<00:04:37.460> GPU

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
like that the tablet has Adreno 2:03 GPU

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.510 
like that the tablet has Adreno 2:03 GPU
which<00:04:38.810> processes<00:04:39.320> up<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:40.720> 854<00:04:41.720> x<00:04:41.960> 480<00:04:42.830> pixels

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
which processes up to 854 x 480 pixels

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.350 
which processes up to 854 x 480 pixels
otherwise<00:04:44.510> known<00:04:44.750> as<00:04:44.780> fw<00:04:45.650> VGA<00:04:46.070> the<00:04:46.970> problem

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
otherwise known as fw VGA the problem

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.450 
otherwise known as fw VGA the problem
with<00:04:47.450> that<00:04:47.570> is<00:04:47.750> that<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:48.230> GPU<00:04:48.590> is<00:04:48.740> calculating

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
with that is that the GPU is calculating

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.190 
with that is that the GPU is calculating
less<00:04:49.670> amount<00:04:49.940> of<00:04:50.060> pixels<00:04:50.240> than<00:04:50.780> what<00:04:51.080> the

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
less amount of pixels than what the

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.330 
less amount of pixels than what the
display<00:04:51.590> needs

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
display needs

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.120 
display needs
hence<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:53.360> excess<00:04:53.690> calculations<00:04:54.650> are<00:04:54.890> being

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
hence the excess calculations are being

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.600 
hence the excess calculations are being
driven<00:04:55.610> towards<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.180> CPU<00:04:56.870> as<00:04:57.170> a<00:04:57.440> result<00:04:57.920> HD

their<00:05:12.590> tablet<00:05:13.040> will<00:05:13.190> have<00:05:13.340> to<00:05:13.460> find<00:05:13.610> a

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
their tablet will have to find a

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.850 
their tablet will have to find a
workaround<00:05:14.060> to<00:05:14.470> compensate<00:05:15.470> for<00:05:15.680> this

workaround to compensate for this
shortcoming<00:05:16.340> so<00:05:17.300> here's<00:05:17.480> my<00:05:17.660> opinion<00:05:18.050> of<00:05:18.200> D

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
shortcoming so here's my opinion of D

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.650 
shortcoming so here's my opinion of D
tablet<00:05:18.830> it<00:05:19.490> is<00:05:19.669> not<00:05:19.880> bad<00:05:20.090> it's<00:05:20.270> very<00:05:20.450> well

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
tablet it is not bad it's very well

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.700 
tablet it is not bad it's very well
built<00:05:20.840> no<00:05:21.110> doubt<00:05:21.260> about<00:05:21.380> that

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
built no doubt about that

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.850 
built no doubt about that
and<00:05:21.919> the<00:05:22.510> $250<00:05:23.510> price<00:05:23.750> tag<00:05:24.020> is<00:05:24.230> quite

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
and the $250 price tag is quite

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.400 
and the $250 price tag is quite
reasonable<00:05:25.150> and<00:05:26.150> as<00:05:26.300> far<00:05:26.450> as<00:05:26.510> usage<00:05:26.930> goes<00:05:27.110> I

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
reasonable and as far as usage goes I

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.680 
reasonable and as far as usage goes I
use<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:27.860> tablet<00:05:28.190> almost<00:05:28.370> every<00:05:28.790> day<00:05:28.940> only

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
use the tablet almost every day only

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.420 
use the tablet almost every day only
thing<00:05:29.990> is<00:05:30.140> that<00:05:30.320> when<00:05:30.500> it<00:05:30.620> starts<00:05:30.950> to<00:05:31.010> struggle

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
thing is that when it starts to struggle

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.100 
thing is that when it starts to struggle
when<00:05:31.520> I'm<00:05:31.669> browsing<00:05:31.880> the<00:05:32.150> web<00:05:32.330> it<00:05:32.690> makes<00:05:32.960> me

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
when I'm browsing the web it makes me

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.659 
when I'm browsing the web it makes me
wish<00:05:33.260> that<00:05:33.470> I<00:05:33.500> used<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:33.980> 60<00:05:34.280> day<00:05:34.400> satisfaction

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
keep in mind that this tablet showed us

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.040 
keep in mind that this tablet showed us
that<00:05:44.540> quad-core<00:05:45.229> now<00:05:45.500> is<00:05:45.770> a<00:05:45.830> marketing<00:05:46.520> ploy
