that<00:01:44.480> Oscar<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:44.840> season<00:01:45.080> I<00:01:45.140> don't<00:01:45.290> think<00:01:45.440> he

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
that Oscar the season I don't think he

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.950 
that Oscar the season I don't think he
will<00:01:45.740> play<00:01:45.950> you<00:01:46.280> know<00:01:46.659> every<00:01:47.659> game<00:01:47.810> i<00:01:47.930> think

think Andre sure double play a lot of
games<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.600> and<00:01:53.690> he'll<00:01:53.870> be<00:01:53.960> a<00:01:53.990> bit<00:01:54.170> of<00:01:54.200> a<00:01:54.260> battle

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409

obviously they played a Branislav

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.479 
obviously they played a Branislav

Ivanovic there they've now got a spill
equator<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.939> think<00:02:44.209> will<00:02:44.510> be<00:02:44.629> chastised<00:02:44.989> first

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
equator I think will be chastised first

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.589 
equator I think will be chastised first
team<00:02:45.470> right<00:02:45.680> back<00:02:45.859> but<00:02:46.159> I<00:02:46.519> don't<00:02:47.180> really

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
team right back but I don't really

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.220 
team right back but I don't really
expect<00:02:48.319> to<00:02:48.650> see<00:02:48.950> Wallace<00:02:49.430> or<00:02:49.790> maybe<00:02:50.120> you<00:02:51.109> know

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230

pushing a spill equator season a lesson

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.610 
pushing a spill equator season a lesson
I<00:02:53.359> think<00:02:53.599> no<00:02:53.690> way<00:02:53.840> you'd<00:02:53.989> actually<00:02:54.109> get<00:02:54.440> into

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
I think no way you'd actually get into

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.530 
I think no way you'd actually get into
the<00:02:54.769> team<00:02:54.950> is<00:02:55.190> if<00:02:55.700> something<00:02:56.120> was<00:02:56.329> to<00:02:56.359> happen

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
the team is if something was to happen

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.390 
the team is if something was to happen
with<00:02:56.870> us<00:02:56.900> as<00:02:57.349> panic<00:02:57.709> which<00:02:57.859> I<00:02:58.040> think<00:02:58.190> he<00:02:58.280> may

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
with us as panic which I think he may

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.099 
with us as panic which I think he may
play<00:02:58.579> league<00:02:58.849> cup<00:02:59.180> games<00:02:59.420> maybe<00:02:59.659> a<00:02:59.750> bit<00:02:59.870> of<00:02:59.900> FA

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
play league cup games maybe a bit of FA

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.229 
play league cup games maybe a bit of FA
cup<00:03:00.319> and<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.859> also<00:03:01.040> does<00:03:01.370> depend<00:03:01.639> if<00:03:01.939> chat<00:03:02.120> is

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
cup and it also does depend if chat is

Denver<00:04:45.470> bar<00:04:45.770> I<00:04:46.460> think<00:04:47.030> he<00:04:47.120> needs<00:04:47.150> a<00:04:47.389> good

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
Denver bar I think he needs a good

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.060 
Denver bar I think he needs a good
pre-season<00:04:47.810> to<00:04:48.290> be<00:04:48.410> honest<00:04:48.650> I<00:04:48.800> think<00:04:48.980> he<00:04:49.040> needs

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
pre-season to be honest I think he needs

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.740 
pre-season to be honest I think he needs
to<00:04:49.250> score<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.550> lot<00:04:49.669> of<00:04:49.700> goals<00:04:49.910> not<00:04:50.330> a<00:04:50.389> logger<00:04:50.600> if

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
to score a lot of goals not a logger if

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.210 
to score a lot of goals not a logger if
he<00:04:50.810> needs<00:04:50.960> to<00:04:51.020> show<00:04:51.350> you<00:04:51.860> know<00:04:51.980> that<00:04:52.130> he's

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
he needs to show you know that he's

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.760 
he needs to show you know that he's
ticking<00:04:52.550> over<00:04:52.669> and<00:04:53.090> you<00:04:53.840> know<00:04:53.960> maybe<00:04:54.139> just

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
ticking over and you know maybe just

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.950 
ticking over and you know maybe just
that<00:04:54.980> you<00:04:55.760> know<00:04:55.850> he<00:04:56.000> wasn't<00:04:56.180> playing<00:04:56.450> you<00:04:56.780> know

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
that you know he wasn't playing you know

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.120 
that you know he wasn't playing you know
it<00:04:57.020> was<00:04:57.110> all<00:04:57.169> between<00:04:57.380> hearing<00:04:57.620> and<00:04:57.710> Torres

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
it was all between hearing and Torres

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.560 
it was all between hearing and Torres
and<00:04:58.370> Torres<00:04:58.760> of<00:04:58.880> plane<00:04:59.000> and<00:04:59.150> certain<00:04:59.389> games

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
and Torres of plane and certain games

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.390 
and Torres of plane and certain games
and<00:04:59.720> both<00:04:59.810> play<00:04:59.990> another<00:05:00.200> game<00:05:00.320> since<00:05:00.680> I<00:05:01.010> think

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
and both play another game since I think

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.550 
and both play another game since I think
that<00:05:01.520> was<00:05:01.639> just<00:05:01.820> like<00:05:02.000> Denver<00:05:02.660> bar<00:05:02.840> wasn't<00:05:03.139> you

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
that was just like Denver bar wasn't you

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.379 
that was just like Denver bar wasn't you
might<00:05:03.770> have<00:05:03.919> been<00:05:04.070> struggling<00:05:04.580> to<00:05:04.729> adapt<00:05:05.120> so<00:05:05.330> I

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
might have been struggling to adapt so I

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:06.790 
might have been struggling to adapt so I
think<00:05:05.450> that<00:05:05.660> he<00:05:05.960> is<00:05:06.050> a<00:05:06.080> lot<00:05:06.320> better<00:05:06.470> than<00:05:06.710> you

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
think that he is a lot better than you

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.110 
think that he is a lot better than you
show<00:05:07.010> towards<00:05:07.280> in<00:05:07.430> glasses<00:05:07.850> and<00:05:07.970> any

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
show towards in glasses and any

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.850

shoulding<00:05:08.570> glimpses<00:05:09.080> you<00:05:09.200> know<00:05:09.290> against<00:05:09.560> city

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
shoulding glimpses you know against city

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.360 
shoulding glimpses you know against city
against<00:05:10.729> United<00:05:11.540> so<00:05:12.470> for<00:05:12.710> me<00:05:12.830> I<00:05:12.860> think<00:05:13.070> Denver

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
against United so for me I think Denver

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.950 
against United so for me I think Denver
bar<00:05:13.610> will<00:05:13.790> stay<00:05:14.060> i<00:05:14.090> also<00:05:14.419> think<00:05:14.570> Fernando

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
bar will stay i also think Fernando

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.770 
bar will stay i also think Fernando
Torres<00:05:15.229> well<00:05:15.470> as<00:05:15.590> well<00:05:15.770> I<00:05:16.010> think<00:05:16.850> dan<00:05:17.240> ba<00:05:17.389> ba<00:05:17.540> is

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
Torres well as well I think dan ba ba is

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.300 
Torres well as well I think dan ba ba is
dead<00:05:18.110> certain<00:05:18.470> to<00:05:18.560> be<00:05:18.650> the<00:05:18.770> third<00:05:18.950> choice

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
dead certain to be the third choice

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.070 
dead certain to be the third choice
striker<00:05:19.639> in<00:05:20.000> my<00:05:20.120> opinion<00:05:20.389> i<00:05:20.600> think<00:05:20.630> that<00:05:20.930> jose

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
striker in my opinion i think that jose

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.290 
striker in my opinion i think that jose
mourinho<00:05:21.500> will<00:05:22.160> probably<00:05:22.729> start<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.120> season

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
mourinho will probably start the season

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.990 
mourinho will probably start the season
with<00:05:23.540> Lukaku<00:05:24.100> and<00:05:25.100> then<00:05:25.250> Fernando<00:05:25.729> Torres

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
with Lukaku and then Fernando Torres

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.879 
with Lukaku and then Fernando Torres
will<00:05:26.150> get<00:05:26.360> bits<00:05:26.660> and<00:05:26.870> bobs<00:05:27.080> I<00:05:27.260> think<00:05:27.500> I<00:05:27.620> think

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
will get bits and bobs I think I think

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.400 
will get bits and bobs I think I think
that<00:05:28.010> it's<00:05:28.970> all<00:05:29.090> going<00:05:29.300> to<00:05:29.330> be<00:05:29.390> Torres<00:05:30.080> as<00:05:30.260> the

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
that it's all going to be Torres as the

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.800 
that it's all going to be Torres as the
star<00:05:30.650> and<00:05:30.800> striker<00:05:31.039> Romelu<00:05:31.669> Lukaku<00:05:31.789> I<00:05:32.330> think

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
star and striker Romelu Lukaku I think

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.240 
star and striker Romelu Lukaku I think
the<00:05:32.870> first<00:05:33.020> game<00:05:33.260> in<00:05:33.380> a<00:05:33.410> season<00:05:33.680> will<00:05:33.830> show<00:05:34.100> us

the first game in a season will show us
that<00:05:34.600> I<00:05:35.600> think<00:05:36.080> like<00:05:36.320> I<00:05:36.440> said<00:05:36.650> that<00:05:36.740> nothing
