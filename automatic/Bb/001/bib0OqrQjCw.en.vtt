well hello and welcome to the guide of

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.650 
well hello and welcome to the guide of
how<00:00:03.689> you<00:00:03.750> get<00:00:04.410> rid<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:05.160> origin<00:00:05.670> bug<00:00:05.850> where

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
how you get rid of the origin bug where

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.799 
how you get rid of the origin bug where
you<00:00:06.810> cannot<00:00:07.290> start<00:00:07.649> but<00:00:07.859> 3<00:00:08.069> 3<00:00:08.340> because<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.300> it

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
you cannot start but 3 3 because of it

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.140 
you cannot start but 3 3 because of it
says<00:00:10.160> something<00:00:11.160> like<00:00:11.639> this<00:00:13.639> this<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.849> the

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
says something like this this is the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.930 
says something like this this is the
German<00:00:15.630> version<00:00:15.780> but<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.260> think<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:17.039> English

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
German version but I think the English

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.269 
German version but I think the English
or<00:00:18.300> American<00:00:18.600> or<00:00:19.199> British<00:00:19.350> or<00:00:19.650> whatever<00:00:19.949> word

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
or American or British or whatever word

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.640 
or American or British or whatever word
version<00:00:20.570> will<00:00:21.570> quite<00:00:22.080> look<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.410> same<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:23.519> you

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
version will quite look the same so you

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.650 
version will quite look the same so you
get<00:00:25.650> rid<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.039> problem<00:00:26.430> due<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.849> go<00:00:27.599> to

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
get rid of the problem due to go to

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.349 
get rid of the problem due to go to
their<00:00:28.019> computer<00:00:28.429> go<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.699> file<00:00:29.939> where<00:00:30.240> you

it<00:00:57.660> works<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.980> right<00:00:59.280> click<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.090> I

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
it works is just right click on it and I

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.520 
it works is just right click on it and I
don't<00:01:02.520> really<00:01:02.850> know<00:01:03.059> what<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.539> called<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.140> on

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
can start a bit a few three like you can

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.569 
can start a bit a few three like you can
start<00:04:02.160> it<00:04:02.310> every<00:04:02.790> time<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:03.540> want<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:04.190> so<00:04:05.190> it's
