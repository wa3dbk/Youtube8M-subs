00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
confused I guess or maybe I just didn't

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
it's a little tight on my arms but it's

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.350 
it's a little tight on my arms but it's
mostly<00:05:32.430> because<00:05:32.699> all<00:05:32.880> of<00:05:32.970> these<00:05:33.120> are<00:05:33.240> made

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
mostly because all of these are made

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.930 
mostly because all of these are made
really<00:05:33.720> really<00:05:33.930> small<00:05:34.229> so<00:05:34.860> when<00:05:35.340> buying<00:05:35.520> stuff

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
really really small so when buying stuff

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.969 
really really small so when buying stuff
again<00:05:36.360> just<00:05:36.690> buy<00:05:36.840> a<00:05:36.870> size<00:05:37.169> on<00:05:37.380> these<00:05:37.620> shoes

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.830 
again just buy a size on these shoes
which<00:05:38.280> looked<00:05:38.520> a<00:05:38.669> lot<00:05:38.940> cuter<00:05:39.389> on<00:05:39.690> their

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
which looked a lot cuter on their

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.010 
which looked a lot cuter on their
website<00:05:40.370> I<00:05:41.370> really<00:05:42.060> actually<00:05:42.240> disappointed

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
website I really actually disappointed

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.870 
website I really actually disappointed
with<00:05:43.199> their<00:05:43.380> shoe<00:05:43.620> quality<00:05:44.160> I<00:05:44.340> think<00:05:44.550> if<00:05:44.789> you

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
with their shoe quality I think if you

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.460 
with their shoe quality I think if you
look<00:05:45.090> here<00:05:45.510> there's<00:05:45.870> like<00:05:45.990> this<00:05:46.139> thing

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
look here there's like this thing

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.770 
look here there's like this thing
sticking<00:05:46.919> out<00:05:47.190> of<00:05:47.310> the

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
sticking out of the

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.959 
sticking out of the
it<00:05:48.780> wasn't<00:05:49.110> so<00:05:49.349> properly<00:05:49.949> closed<00:05:50.249> on<00:05:50.669> the<00:05:50.789> end

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:50.969 
it wasn't so properly closed on the end

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:55.369 
it wasn't so properly closed on the end
and<00:05:51.300> then<00:05:51.870> like<00:05:52.340> in<00:05:53.340> the<00:05:53.550> box<00:05:53.999> was<00:05:54.569> absolutely

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:55.379 
and then like in the box was absolutely

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:57.920 
and then like in the box was absolutely
crushed<00:05:55.860> when<00:05:56.219> I<00:05:56.279> shipped<00:05:56.669> it<00:05:56.849> so<00:05:57.599> like<00:05:57.779> the

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
crushed when I shipped it so like the

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.739 
crushed when I shipped it so like the
shoes<00:05:58.349> were<00:05:59.099> like<00:05:59.249> absolutely<00:05:59.749> demolished

00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:00.749 
shoes were like absolutely demolished

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:02.929 
shoes were like absolutely demolished
like<00:06:01.050> they're<00:06:01.199> like<00:06:01.349> squished<00:06:01.710> in<00:06:02.039> I<00:06:02.310> don't

know I don't know I like the way they
shipped<00:06:04.499> these<00:06:04.620> I<00:06:04.830> feel<00:06:04.979> like<00:06:05.099> if<00:06:05.189> they<00:06:05.310> were

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
shipped these I feel like if they were

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.129 
shipped these I feel like if they were
shipped<00:06:05.669> properly<00:06:06.120> it<00:06:06.629> would<00:06:06.719> look<00:06:06.870> a<00:06:06.930> lot

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
shipped properly it would look a lot

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.580 
shipped properly it would look a lot
better<00:06:07.259> now<00:06:07.710> but<00:06:08.460> I<00:06:08.969> guess<00:06:09.840> I<00:06:09.870> pay<00:06:10.229> seven

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590

better now but I guess I pay seven
dollars<00:06:10.919> and<00:06:11.249> then<00:06:11.340> you<00:06:11.400> don't<00:06:11.580> want<00:06:11.729> to<00:06:11.789> spend

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:11.939 
dollars and then you don't want to spend

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:13.550 
dollars and then you don't want to spend
extra<00:06:12.090> money<00:06:12.300> on<00:06:12.539> shipping<00:06:12.779> that's<00:06:13.259> what<00:06:13.439> you
