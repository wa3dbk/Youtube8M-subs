tennis and I have been been working on

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.390 
tennis and I have been been working on
we<00:00:18.150> wanted<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.420> do<00:00:18.539> something<00:00:18.900> together<00:00:19.400> you

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
we wanted to do something together you

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.480 
we wanted to do something together you
promised<00:00:20.910> her<00:00:21.119> maybe<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.109> challenge<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:23.250> make<00:00:23.460> a

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
promised her maybe a challenge to make a

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.630 
promised her maybe a challenge to make a
machine<00:00:23.850> if<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:25.050> put<00:00:25.320> wood<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.369> makes

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
machine if you put wood and it makes

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.220 
machine if you put wood and it makes
them<00:00:26.970> into<00:00:27.650> charcoal<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.609> then<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.630> items

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
them into charcoal and then the items

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.979 
them into charcoal and then the items
are<00:00:31.439> put<00:00:31.679> back<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.460> chest<00:00:32.790> yeah<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:33.899> an

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
are put back in the chest yeah I have an

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.380 
are put back in the chest yeah I have an
idea<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.649> then<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:34.950> both<00:00:35.160> went<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.760> built<00:00:36.090> our

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
idea and then we both went and built our

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.229 
idea and then we both went and built our
own<00:00:36.480> designs<00:00:37.520> because<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.730> did<00:00:38.910> about<00:00:39.180> six

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
own designs because we did about six

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.100 
own designs because we did about six
versions<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.800> them<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.940> then<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.690> put<00:00:42.960> it

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
versions of them and then we put it

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.590 
versions of them and then we put it
together<00:00:43.410> yeah<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.489> like<00:00:44.730> yours<00:00:45.300> was<00:00:45.450> already

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
together yeah and like yours was already

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.830 
together yeah and like yours was already
really<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.320> know<00:00:46.440> compact<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:48.420> mine<00:00:48.660> was

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
really you know compact and mine was

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.840 
really you know compact and mine was
sort<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.200> ridiculously<00:00:49.860> overcomplicated

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
sort of ridiculously overcomplicated

00:00:50.850 --> 00:01:00.260 
sort of ridiculously overcomplicated
yeah<00:00:57.050> Joe<00:00:58.050> enormous<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:59.039> then<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.730> snapshot

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
yeah Joe enormous and then the snapshot

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.910 
yeah Joe enormous and then the snapshot
the<00:01:00.390> new<00:01:00.510> snapshot<00:01:00.840> came<00:01:01.230> out<00:01:01.379> because<00:01:01.620> that's

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the new snapshot came out because that's

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.439 
the new snapshot came out because that's
also<00:01:02.309> what<00:01:02.430> made<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.760> possible

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
also what made this possible

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.649 
also what made this possible
yeah<00:01:03.989> because<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.830> big<00:01:05.189> droppers<00:01:05.760> because<00:01:06.540> of

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
yeah because of big droppers because of

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.480 
yeah because of big droppers because of
the<00:01:06.750> droppers<00:01:07.110> facing<00:01:07.500> up<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.770> down<00:01:08.010> maybe

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the droppers facing up and down maybe

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.310 
the droppers facing up and down maybe
you<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.790> tell<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.939> bit<00:01:09.119> more<00:01:09.330> about<00:01:09.630> how<00:01:10.290> it

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
you can tell a bit more about how it

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.149 
you can tell a bit more about how it
works<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:13.110> let's<00:01:13.619> get<00:01:13.860> started<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.780> a

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
works so let's get started this is a

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.520 
works so let's get started this is a
machine<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.220> converts<00:01:17.670> wood<00:01:18.360> into<00:01:18.840> charcoal

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
machine that converts wood into charcoal

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.260 
machine that converts wood into charcoal
it<00:01:20.369> can<00:01:21.090> use<00:01:21.330> two<00:01:21.720> types<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.320> wood<00:01:22.729> this<00:01:23.729> chest

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
it can use two types of wood this chest

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.050 
it can use two types of wood this chest
is<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> normal<00:01:25.140> chest<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.920> as<00:01:26.340> soon<00:01:26.640> as<00:01:26.700> you

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
is a normal chest so as soon as you

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.270 
is a normal chest so as soon as you
notice<00:01:27.509> there's<00:01:28.080> actually<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.770> lot<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.950> other

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
notice there's actually a lot of other

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.819 
notice there's actually a lot of other
stuff<00:01:30.290> inside<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.530> chest<00:01:31.799> as<00:01:32.009> well<00:01:33.170> if<00:01:34.170> you

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
stuff inside the chest as well if you

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.230 
stuff inside the chest as well if you
put<00:01:35.070> like<00:01:35.390> diamonds<00:01:36.390> won't<00:01:37.170> not<00:01:37.860> use<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.850> but

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
put like diamonds won't not use it but

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.039 
put like diamonds won't not use it but
if<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:40.170> put<00:01:40.200> wood<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.670> will<00:01:42.049> disappear

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
if you put wood it will disappear

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.440 
if you put wood it will disappear
magically<00:01:45.110> how<00:01:46.110> does<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.560> work<00:01:47.180> under<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
magically how does it work under the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.499 
magically how does it work under the
chest<00:01:48.750> there's<00:01:49.320> two<00:01:49.680> colors<00:01:50.159> with<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.820> quilters

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
chest there's two colors with a quilters

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.749 
chest there's two colors with a quilters
who<00:01:52.259> are<00:01:52.320> bringing<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.490> wood<00:01:53.700> down<00:01:54.200> after<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
who are bringing the wood down after the

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.030 
who are bringing the wood down after the
hopper<00:01:56.990> transports<00:01:57.990> them<00:01:58.259> into<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.799> furnace

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
hopper transports them into the furnace

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.469 
hopper transports them into the furnace
and<00:01:59.840> then<00:02:00.840> they<00:02:01.469> cook<00:02:01.799> what's<00:02:02.729> interesting<00:02:03.090> is

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
and then they cook what's interesting is

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.270 
and then they cook what's interesting is
that<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:04.219> furnace<00:02:05.540> is<00:02:06.540> actually<00:02:07.049> gonna<00:02:07.280> reuse

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
that the furnace is actually gonna reuse

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.380 
that the furnace is actually gonna reuse
the<00:02:08.610> charcoal<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.390> makes<00:02:10.220> so<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:11.730> you

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
the charcoal that it makes so if if you

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.920 
the charcoal that it makes so if if you
if<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.590> put<00:02:14.770> in<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.950> wooden<00:02:15.220> block<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:16.300> fire

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
if you put in a wooden block the fire

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.540 
if you put in a wooden block the fire
will<00:02:17.170> turn<00:02:17.380> it<00:02:17.500> into<00:02:17.620> charcoal<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.430> will

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
will turn it into charcoal and it will

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.270 
will turn it into charcoal and it will
basically<00:02:19.410> filter<00:02:20.410> out<00:02:20.560> there's<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.040> hopper

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
basically filter out there's a hopper

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.510 
basically filter out there's a hopper
underneath<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:23.140> will<00:02:23.290> filter<00:02:23.530> out<00:02:23.650> charcoal

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
underneath it will filter out charcoal

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.270 
underneath it will filter out charcoal
to<00:02:25.150> go<00:02:25.300> into<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.840> side<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.410> furnace<00:02:26.680> which

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
to go into the side of the furnace which

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.630 
to go into the side of the furnace which
will<00:02:27.520> you<00:02:28.030> know<00:02:28.120> add<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.930> fuel<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.470> if<00:02:30.460> you

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
will you know add to the fuel and if you

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.120 
will you know add to the fuel and if you
right-click<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.660> furnace<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.740> you<00:02:32.830> will<00:02:32.950> see

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
right-click the furnace and you will see

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.120 
right-click the furnace and you will see
that<00:02:33.280> it's<00:02:33.520> actually<00:02:33.750> 64th<00:02:35.040> charcoal<00:02:36.040> in

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
that it's actually 64th charcoal in
