little bit unique because you can
there's<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.550> lot<00:00:35.579> more<00:00:35.730> customization<00:00:36.630> there

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
there's a lot more customization there

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
so you can set things and have different

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.360 
so you can set things and have different
moves<00:00:40.050> be<00:00:40.290> put<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.620> there<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.100> switch

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
and mix-and-match and loop shit but

mainly are the supers that I just think
that's<00:01:16.470> gonna<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> most<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.850> most<00:01:17.880> fun

4<00:01:20.310> goku<00:01:21.090> what<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.810> think<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> move<00:01:22.560> set<00:01:22.770> will<00:01:22.920> be

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
4 goku what I think the move set will be

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.920 
4 goku what I think the move set will be
is<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:23.939> something<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.479> wild

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
is going to be something like a wild

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.380 
is going to be something like a wild
sense<00:01:25.140> kind<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.470> thing<00:01:25.650> where<00:01:26.180> these<00:01:27.180> are

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
sense kind of thing where these are

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.609 
sense kind of thing where these are
things<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.780> think<00:01:27.990> will<00:01:28.049> be<00:01:28.170> available

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
things that I think will be available

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.890 
things that I think will be available
right<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.189> like<00:01:29.880> each<00:01:30.150> character<00:01:30.600> won't<00:01:30.689> have

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
right so like each character won't have

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.690 
right so like each character won't have
a<00:01:30.960> set<00:01:31.350> move<00:01:31.560> set<00:01:31.799> because<00:01:32.009> you'll<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.400> able<00:01:32.490> to

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
a set move set because you'll be able to

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.640 
a set move set because you'll be able to
customize<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.540> obviously<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.350> what<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.560> think

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
customize it obviously so what I think

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.840 
customize it obviously so what I think
will<00:01:34.860> be<00:01:34.950> available<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.490> something<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:35.759> a

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
will be available is something like a

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.660 
will be available is something like a
wild<00:01:36.299> sense<00:01:36.570> baby<00:01:36.900> like<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.380> little<00:01:38.009> buff<00:01:38.400> where

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
wild sense baby like a little buff where

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.700 
wild sense baby like a little buff where
your<00:01:39.180> melee<00:01:39.869> attacks<00:01:40.200> will<00:01:40.380> little<00:01:40.530> bit<00:01:40.619> more

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
your melee attacks will little bit more

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.990 
your melee attacks will little bit more
damage<00:01:41.009> maybe<00:01:41.159> you're<00:01:41.340> super<00:01:41.610> attached<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.970> a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
damage maybe you're super attached to a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.069 
damage maybe you're super attached to a
little<00:01:42.150> bit<00:01:42.240> more<00:01:42.329> damage<00:01:42.630> maybe<00:01:42.810> something

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
little bit more damage maybe something

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.480 
little bit more damage maybe something
called<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.320> same<00:01:43.619> spirit<00:01:44.159> or<00:01:44.340> something

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
called like same spirit or something

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.270 
called like same spirit or something
like<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.759> or<00:01:45.180> or<00:01:45.479> rage<00:01:46.320> or<00:01:46.710> something<00:01:47.100> I

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
like that or or rage or something I

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.889 
like that or or rage or something I
don't<00:01:47.340> know<00:01:47.460> where<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:48.329> get<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.540> little<00:01:48.810> bit

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
don't know where you get a little bit

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.700 
don't know where you get a little bit
more<00:01:48.990> powerful<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.909> I<00:01:50.909> think<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.409> ways<00:01:52.560> of

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
more powerful and I think in the ways of

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.870 
more powerful and I think in the ways of
that<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.040> also<00:01:53.070> get<00:01:53.369> something<00:01:53.640> maybe<00:01:53.790> like

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
that you also get something maybe like

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.460 
that you also get something maybe like
an<00:01:54.060> explosive<00:01:54.570> waving<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.960> know<00:01:55.079> stuff<00:01:55.380> like

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
an explosive waving you know stuff like

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.230 
an explosive waving you know stuff like
that<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:55.920> be<00:01:56.040> interchangeable<00:01:56.670> between<00:01:56.880> each

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
that can be interchangeable between each

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.580 
that can be interchangeable between each
and<00:01:57.390> every<00:01:57.509> character<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:58.320> might<00:01:58.469> get

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
and every character you might get

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.959 
and every character you might get
something<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.950> something<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.430> an<00:01:59.640> instant

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
something like something like an instant

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.580 
something like something like an instant
transmission<00:02:00.360> was<00:02:00.750> super<00:02:00.960> saiyan<00:02:01.170> 4<00:02:01.350> goku

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
transmission was super saiyan 4 goku

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.560 
transmission was super saiyan 4 goku
because<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.310> goku<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.880> instant

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
because it is goku and instant

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.510 
because it is goku and instant
transmission<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.229> exclusive<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.920> goku<00:02:05.369> so

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
transmission is exclusive to goku so

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.999 
transmission is exclusive to goku so
maybe<00:02:05.810> you<00:02:06.810> use<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.320> ability<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.890> get

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
maybe you use that ability and you get

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.710 
maybe you use that ability and you get
to<00:02:08.099> teleport<00:02:08.489> directly<00:02:08.879> behind<00:02:09.030> your<00:02:09.390> enemy

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
to teleport directly behind your enemy

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.089 
to teleport directly behind your enemy
and<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.110> know<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.289> can<00:02:10.379> follow<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.950> up<00:02:11.009> with

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
and you know you can follow that up with

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.309 
and you know you can follow that up with
a<00:02:11.250> combo<00:02:11.580> if<00:02:11.670> you'd<00:02:11.819> like<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.420> go<00:02:12.989> all

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
a combo if you'd like to and go all

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.150 
a combo if you'd like to and go all
crazy

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
crazy

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.460 
crazy
and<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.610> stuff<00:02:15.000> on<00:02:15.330> but<00:02:15.810> let's<00:02:15.930> get<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.260> fun

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
and a stuff on but let's get to the fun

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.240 
and a stuff on but let's get to the fun
part<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.070> supers<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:18.570> I<00:02:18.600> think<00:02:18.780> what<00:02:19.410> Super

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
part the supers so I think what Super

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.710 
part the supers so I think what Super
Saiyan<00:02:20.460> 4<00:02:20.490> goku's<00:02:20.940> main<00:02:21.210> stuff<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.540> going<00:02:21.690> to

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
Saiyan 4 goku's main stuff is going to

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.510 
Saiyan 4 goku's main stuff is going to
be<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:21.870> think<00:02:21.990> each<00:02:22.290> character<00:02:22.710> should<00:02:23.280> be<00:02:23.430> able

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
be I think each character should be able

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.590 
be I think each character should be able
to<00:02:23.880> hear<00:02:24.360> about<00:02:24.780> or<00:02:25.560> should<00:02:25.950> be<00:02:26.070> able<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.600> use

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
to hear about or should be able to use

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.900 
to hear about or should be able to use
very<00:02:28.470> generic<00:02:29.070> abilities<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.640> maybe<00:02:29.820> a

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
very generic abilities that maybe a

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.030 
very generic abilities that maybe a
volley<00:02:30.270> or<00:02:30.450> or<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.170> know<00:02:31.680> just<00:02:31.770> like<00:02:32.010> a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
volley or or you know just like a

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.260 
volley or or you know just like a
regular<00:02:32.250> energy<00:02:32.670> wave<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:32.970> stuff<00:02:33.120> like<00:02:33.210> that

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
regular energy wave and stuff like that

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.150 
regular energy wave and stuff like that
but<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:34.170> think<00:02:34.470> with<00:02:34.620> super<00:02:34.800> saiyan<00:02:34.950> for<00:02:35.130> a

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
but I think with super saiyan for a

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.990 
but I think with super saiyan for a
group<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.430> should<00:02:35.490> get<00:02:35.700> something<00:02:35.850> like

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
group you should get something like

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.320 
group you should get something like
meteor<00:02:36.420> smash<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:37.320> is<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.590> melee<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.760> burst

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
meteor smash that is a melee a burst

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.750 
meteor smash that is a melee a burst
attack<00:02:39.660> from<00:02:39.900> some<00:02:40.350> older<00:02:40.620> games<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:41.130> Goku

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
attack from some older games that Goku

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.000 
attack from some older games that Goku
has<00:02:41.790> had<00:02:42.000> before<00:02:42.420> something<00:02:43.170> like<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.410> where

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
has had before something like that where

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.960 
has had before something like that where
you<00:02:44.700> sort<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.270> dash<00:02:45.510> in<00:02:45.780> or<00:02:46.020> maybe<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.560> have<00:02:46.590> to

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
you sort of dash in or maybe you have to

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.000 
you sort of dash in or maybe you have to
combo<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.150> in<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:48.540> maybe<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.990> start<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.560> combo

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
combo it in so maybe you start a combo

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.260 
combo it in so maybe you start a combo
you<00:02:50.070> know<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.280> hit<00:02:50.460> them<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.670> few<00:02:50.850> times<00:02:50.880> and

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
you know you hit them a few times and

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.490 
you know you hit them a few times and
then<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.480> stagger<00:02:51.780> them<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.050> little<00:02:52.260> bit<00:02:52.440> and

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
then you stagger them a little bit and

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.990 
then you stagger them a little bit and
then<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.680> go<00:02:52.890> in<00:02:53.070> with<00:02:53.250> like<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.400> meteor<00:02:53.670> smash

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
then you go in with like a meteor smash

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.330 
then you go in with like a meteor smash
type<00:02:54.270> move<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.990> finish<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.410> off<00:02:55.560> or<00:02:55.800> maybe<00:02:56.010> to

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
type move to finish it off or maybe to

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.040 
type move to finish it off or maybe to
use<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.060> middle<00:02:57.330> of<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.510> combo<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:57.900> that

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
use it in the middle of a combo so that

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.300 
use it in the middle of a combo so that
way<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.200> can<00:02:58.380> go<00:02:58.530> ahead<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.740> extend<00:02:59.100> with

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
way you can go ahead and extend with

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.280 
way you can go ahead and extend with
more<00:02:59.580> melee<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.210> if<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.570> still<00:03:00.750> got<00:03:00.870> some<00:03:01.080> key

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
more melee and if you still got some key

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.780 
more melee and if you still got some key
left<00:03:01.500> over<00:03:01.830> then<00:03:02.100> you<00:03:02.190> can<00:03:02.340> go<00:03:02.490> in<00:03:02.640> with

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
left over then you can go in with

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.370 
left over then you can go in with
another<00:03:03.090> meteor<00:03:03.570> smash<00:03:03.810> i'm<00:03:04.020> calling<00:03:04.170> it

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
me to smash because i believe that is

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.640 
me to smash because i believe that is
for<00:03:07.530> super<00:03:07.950> saiyan<00:03:08.160> regular<00:03:08.550> goku<00:03:09.230> but<00:03:10.230> so

for super saiyan regular goku but so

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.950 
for super saiyan regular goku but so
something<00:03:11.130> like<00:03:11.160> that<00:03:11.700> where<00:03:12.330> it<00:03:12.600> just<00:03:12.750> looks

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
something like that where it just looks

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.450 
something like that where it just looks
really<00:03:13.110> cool<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.710> know<00:03:13.830> you<00:03:14.190> get<00:03:14.340> the

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
really cool and you know you get the

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.950 
really cool and you know you get the
string<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.790> combos<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.150> it's<00:03:15.360> used<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.840> either

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
string of combos and it's used to either

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.530 
string of combos and it's used to either
extend<00:03:16.440> or<00:03:16.680> end<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.340> combo<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.270> think<00:03:18.450> that'd

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
extend or end a combo and I think that'd

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.140 
extend or end a combo and I think that'd
be<00:03:18.660> really<00:03:18.840> cool<00:03:18.959> for<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:20.310> regular<00:03:20.730> super<00:03:21.000> move

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
you you did and I think that should be a

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.390 
you you did and I think that should be a
regular<00:03:44.100> move<00:03:44.720> now<00:03:45.720> what<00:03:46.080> about<00:03:46.110> is<00:03:46.590> super<00:03:47.220> or

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
ultimate i should say this can range

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.150 
ultimate i should say this can range
between<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:50.130> think<00:03:50.870> 33<00:03:51.870> abilities<00:03:52.350> here<00:03:52.650> one

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
between I think 33 abilities here one

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.440 
between I think 33 abilities here one
there<00:03:53.190> should<00:03:53.459> be<00:03:53.580> like<00:03:53.700> a<00:03:53.760> super<00:03:54.090> attend
