he'll<00:00:00.480> announce<00:00:00.780> invaders

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:06.160 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.230 

its<00:00:06.549> built-in<00:00:06.819> it's<00:00:07.450> got<00:00:07.479> a<00:00:07.600> built-in<00:00:07.870> charger

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
its built-in it's got a built-in charger

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.000 
its built-in it's got a built-in charger
it<00:00:09.510> works<00:00:09.809> like<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.019> trickle<00:00:10.320> charger<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.769> plug

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
it works like a trickle charger you plug

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.130 
it works like a trickle charger you plug
it<00:00:11.130> in

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:15.140 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:23.210 

keep<00:00:15.290> it<00:00:15.410> constantly<00:00:16.090> asking

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.010 

if<00:00:23.429> you're<00:00:24.000> welding

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
if you're welding

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.020 
if you're welding
give<00:00:27.020> four<00:00:27.260> minutes<00:00:27.699> well<00:00:28.699> time<00:00:29.090> or

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.030 
give four minutes well time or

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.020 
give four minutes well time or
so<00:00:30.870> you<00:00:31.010> run<00:00:32.010> a<00:00:32.040> single<00:00:32.310> charger<00:00:32.760> a<00:00:32.790> full

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
so you run a single charger a full

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.430 
so you run a single charger a full
charge<00:00:33.300> you'll<00:00:33.570> get<00:00:33.720> a<00:00:33.750> hundred<00:00:33.990> inch<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
charge you'll get a hundred inch of the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.250 
charge you'll get a hundred inch of the
mobile

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
mobile

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.060 
mobile
the<00:00:35.710> works<00:00:35.890> great<00:00:36.070> for<00:00:36.190> filled<00:00:36.760> up<00:00:36.969> asian<00:00:37.449> were

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
the works great for filled up asian were

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.940 
the works great for filled up asian were
I<00:00:38.130> mean<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.550> was<00:00:38.610> made<00:00:38.880> for<00:00:39.090> work<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.530> it's

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
I mean it was made for work and is it's

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.560 
I mean it was made for work and is it's
not

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.420 

wires<00:00:45.570> knock

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.510 

so<00:00:49.730> it's<00:00:49.880> good

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
so it's good

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.600 
so it's good
always<00:00:52.090> live

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
always live

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.200 
always live
voltage<00:00:54.210> regulation<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:54.990> can<00:00:55.260> always<00:00:55.530> get

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
voltage regulation so you can always get

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.440 
voltage regulation so you can always get
and<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> other<00:00:58.140> ones<00:00:58.640> they<00:00:59.640> are<00:00:59.910> either

so<00:01:32.740> it<00:01:32.860> gives<00:01:32.979> you<00:01:33.159> a<00:01:33.220> little<00:01:33.369> bit<00:01:33.549> more<00:01:33.670> time

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.810 

well<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.550> timeout<00:01:38.440> if<00:01:39.440> you<00:01:39.590> will<00:01:40.190> shut<00:01:40.580> you<00:01:40.700> down

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
well a timeout if you will shut you down

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.469 
well a timeout if you will shut you down
you're<00:01:41.090> using<00:01:41.270> it

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
you're using it

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.430 
you're using it
duty<00:01:43.479> cycle<00:01:44.100> office<00:01:45.100> what'll<00:01:45.850> happen<00:01:46.000> is<00:01:46.440> it's

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
duty cycle office what'll happen is it's

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.110 
duty cycle office what'll happen is it's
just<00:01:47.650> going<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.890> go<00:01:48.070> it's<00:01:48.670> going<00:01:48.820> to<00:01:48.880> go<00:01:48.970> until

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
just going to go it's going to go until

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.600 
just going to go it's going to go until
in<00:01:49.479> hand<00:01:49.750> yeah<00:01:50.320> so<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:50.830> voltage<00:01:50.950> gets<00:01:51.340> to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
in hand yeah so the voltage gets to

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.170 
in hand yeah so the voltage gets to
where

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
where

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.390
