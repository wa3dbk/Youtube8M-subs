00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.170
 me 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.160
 Ha 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.910
 me 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.910
 me 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.510
 Hey 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:22.360
 Yes psyched everyone 5 tea this time to introduce this time in I want to Cairo introduction 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:27.490
 Circuit is an anti-human trap 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.320
 I think that I want to introduce the Wow convex last time I introduce's circuit 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.700
 I trap my great man 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.690
 Well, there was an attempt to avoid the meeting, so Ehara 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:41.390
 completely 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.379
 There was a possibility that it did not get caught in the flower, so it was completely caught on the banner this time 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.440
 Oh dear 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:50.390
 I made a belly to have you come to an end 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:55.680
 So I would like to introduce you to today a little 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.450
 It may be an act like that the tone of the microphone is parched and the voice is stagnant 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.790
 But please understand 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:05.600
 No, if there are immediately entered I want to Well ordinary house here 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.240
 Well there is a guy there is a diamond but not large invisible 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.790
 so 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.050
 Well I will meet you if you try to come in so usually with the mother of Ho 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:18.150
 1 square 2 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:20.670
 a Well I know protection but sometimes I like this circuit 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.880
 There are people who just know 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.420
 Isn't it a thread that stops in front of you? 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.960
 But this circuit is possible 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:36.990
 If this is suspicious 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:39.180
 And I teamed up in I passed even try to return to go Yaba in the Movie of the return from the above I made after all 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.750
 Also fell 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.960
 Entered was 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:50.409
 Well is this that came port If you say, Well, I'm a truly now devil wind 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:55.210
 I hope to introduce you how to make it quickly 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:58.580
 a An Xie change the color of the block to be easy to understand 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:02.000
 It is conflict until it is finished well 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:07.610
 Yes you 've come back for the circuit 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.509
 I think that I want to explain because there are various reasons 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.340
 First of all 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:16.910
 signal 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:20.230
 I made a red blog a place to receive input output, so on this block of red block 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:26.500
 There is a Khan version on this 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.489
 Here is the location of the signal that you receive, so here is the signal from here and here 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.760
 Go down 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:38.440
 If you have become a hassle sound Well I'd have this kind of model E'now this this 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.250
 It is a description of the piston this this pig is a child 's red stone 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.150
 Adjacent to the side 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.430
 Because 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:52.860
 Because it is next to Poppy Red Stone, it is a mechanism that goes up when it becomes a picture book 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:55.350
 Well, if you say this forward , that car's dungee will be black at the back and it's a stopper 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:00.060
 Role is a boom 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:06.460
 The theme here is the circuit on this light blue 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:11.290
 This yellow is connected with the highway where the eighth hangs from above 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:16.090
 Threatened Ana large that the pitfalls in under the door 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.750
 Describe What effect of the above is changing hear Yama's I would like to head explained 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.799
 I will 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.370
 The theme Eastern Europe circuit will be connected and will rise 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:26.000
 Here, first at you 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:31.860
 Marot Fid used last time anything 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.150
 First This was If you have happened to a lot of not circuit does not receive the book Shopper 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.150
 Guest output 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:46.270
 a I will enter the room and become more 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:47.319
 Moving to convey crack propagated to the above example Emaa it Ja' Once does not rose Ha on this Nde 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.750
 Tell by 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.750
 So it will be off 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.060
 2 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.280
 Tan had left behind a repeater 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:04.319
 Oh well 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:11.150
 Narimashitara input is often not circuit to because it is such as 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:11.150
 It is a child who eats up or eats lava because it moves in the reverse opposite direction 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:33.670
 Reverse would Satie is this that was Yari different elaborate Nante said Boo Boo 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:39.409
 Lapis was originally turned off 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:45.680
 It's in a squeezed state, so it's closed and you feel the entrance is pulled. 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:50.660
 I think I want to go once in to say the bus Do not you Yeah Do and that the 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:54.110
 As I heard in the morning, you can encounter while thinking about what I said earlier 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:58.130
 Potency at the yellow I have come here Akoitsu 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.569
 The light blue part opens on this 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.180
 I want to see a hand 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:05.960
 Yes this is how it works 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.960
 In Pop I 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:16.120
 But if it comes out this time, it might have been a little confusing explanation like Genjin and such a thick niece 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:21.940
 I want to end the introduction with this 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:29.370
 If you find it difficult to hear the voice with Pug Mike again 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:38.310
 I'm sorry still also when there is a point, such as do not know is difficult to take key voice 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:39.240
 I will reciprocate to the side, so please comment by all means more than this time I will increase 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:45.050
 I want to end 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.050
 Thank you for watching until the end Let's still be the next episode
