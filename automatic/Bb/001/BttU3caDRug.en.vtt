00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 It was until the appearance of the sims 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.990
 and helped life 2 the best-selling pc 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.389
 game of all times in south korea is the

 multiplayer mode as folk sports there 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.170
 There are whole TV channels that nothing 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.120
 other than profi matches 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.949
 Transfer and good players can there 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.900
 to cure and millions of dollars 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.730
 But you would know how to earn a lot of money 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.560
 that milestone almost never that 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.570
 light of the world had seen light becomes 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.189
 then have fun with our giga trivial 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.189
 to starcraft 1 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.290
 Did you know that the first version of 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.150
 starcraft ii graphics engine from warcraft 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.410
 1 used blizzard rejected the 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.690
 development of this version, however 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.450
 fast again than the starcraft in the year 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.650
 1996 the world public on the e3 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.180
 wanted to introduce 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.739
 they actually had good ones 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.270
 But the game is counting 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.460
 was ridiculed and mocked 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.559
 numerous fans are cursing as 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.940
 purple warcraft this is by the way 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.879
 screenshots from the very first 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.680
 alphaversion until today then hard on 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.030
 a new version of the graphically and 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.100
 more chic was still on the 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.140
 isometric perspective waived 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.909
 however , the possibilities were the 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.530
 engine so limited that many 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.570
 today known features easy 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.159
 impossible were the burying of the hydra 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.440
 List for example was with the old one 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.870
 engine a thing of impossibility so 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.120
 locked up lead programmer bobic six 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.430
 months in a dark room and baited 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.470
 a completely new engine finally 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.490
 starcraft then glowed in the us 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.490
 not known today 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.400
 though warcraft is one and two huge ones 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.540
 successes were wanted blizzard afterwards 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.340
 something with science fiction elements 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.690
 However, you wanted to create on the 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.190
 not dearly loved tradition 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.960
 renounce why you considered the 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.280
 orcs and people from warcraft easy 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.380
 to transplant into space 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.090
 in early version of starcraft were 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.190
 the orks even as a playable breed 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.070
 implemented and then removed 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.750
 shortly thereafter, they agreed on a team 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.930
 the people as a fraction and one 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.150
 more check out the space vampires 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.710
 yeah right blizzard wanted everyone 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.930
 serious a vampire aces into the game 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.930
 build the organized into several 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.280
 clans were the universe sounds today 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.140
 stupid thought well, too 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.500
 blizzard and agreed on the 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.420
 protoss and the pulled the pulled exactly the 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.520
 Zerg are probably the most popular today 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.050
 race in the starcraft universe in one 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.420
 first version was called the slimy one 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.890
 Space Monster, however, still 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.440
 nightmarish invaders what blizzard 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.940
 later in train also changed this name 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.920
 was dropped there disney 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.780
 at the same time toy story 2 in the cinema 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.180
 brought and there dismissed the villain 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.920
 imperator pulled Disney threatened with one 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.160
 Rechtsstreit blizzard invaded and 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.870
 trade this for an e 1 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.520
 and so legends are written there 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.080
 they were so incredibly elaborate 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.120
 the work began at that time 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.070
 state-of-the-art cinemagic movies still 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.480
 before the actual game or one 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.340
 act existed 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.380
 This explains why many of them 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.120
 short scenes completely out of context 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.650
 torn at that time 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.870
 By the way, it was planned that the terrans 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.700
 in the game, the resources of asteroids 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.170
 can dismantle the finished game where 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.060
 new feature discarded though 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.660
 but in the intro sequence, the scene is 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.660
 to see 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.420
 did you know that dachshund for the 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.190
 invention of the popular internet fraport 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.360
 responsible is one of the map 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.740
 designer has become during the 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.390
 development seemingly prescribed 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.640
 Unfortunately , the error looks undetected 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.500
 and the game was released or 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.750
 defeated a player multiplayer mode 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.080
 the message player will appear 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.130
 xsb pont later blizzard the embarrassing 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.720
 mistakes from the game 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.459
 but the internet already had one 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.470
 Eat each other cool phrase 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.360
 in the credits at the end of starcraft 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.970
 thanks blizzard among others at 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.320
 hayao miyazaki though not at all 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.630
 was involved in the game 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.550
 because the protoss unit reader or im 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.100
 German the robber but an immense one 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.350
 similarity to the caterpillars from me says 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.000
 ihs masterpieces from the valley of the winds 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.640
 it probably is that 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.080
 blizzard extensively tell me availed 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.360
 until she actually liked that here 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.280
 mobile motta and its spiritual 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.050
 successor league of legends actually 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.730
 due to starcraft are blank 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.130
 of the powerful map editor 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.810
 resourceful players the modifications of 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.310
 drive in the two teams with the 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.239
 units of their choice against each other 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.550
 could compete 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.100
 as warcraft 3 appeared places of mod 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.560
 bastler oil the map and named it 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.660
 the fans on the agence you knew that 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.040
 starcraft in korea so strong with the pop 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.500
 culture scene is connected that the 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.630
 most famous djs of the country remixes and 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.430
 rap versions of well known pieces of the 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.800
 made starcraft soundtracks 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.840
 if you hanni family then land with it 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.229
 even in the charts and sound that does 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.229
 whole 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.319
 Yes 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.789
 vat 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:46.339
 By the way, zagreb was not exclusive to the 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.899
 pc reserved in the year 2000 let one of 

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:50.209
 the game to an external developer 

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:52.939
 the 64 Portieren the with the fans however 

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:54.799
 The control was not very well received 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:56.479
 awkward the graphics resolution was 

00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:58.399
 worse than on the pc the 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.559
 The cinematics was missing 

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:01.069
 were shortened and there were online games 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:03.019
 not at all 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:04.699
 did you know that ingenious addons 

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:06.409
 Starcraft Brood Castle is not the first one 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.969
 Expansion to the main game was like 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:09.799
 tried at that time more common 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:11.329
 desperate contractors become one piece 

00:05:09.799 --> 00:05:12.979
 to cut off the cake and 

00:05:11.329 --> 00:05:15.019
 developed on the basis of the main game 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.089
 your own addons with some luck 

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:18.829
 Blizzard then gave an authorization 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:20.419
 but blizzard refused 

00:05:18.829 --> 00:05:20.959
 always marketing and 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.299
 press relations 

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:25.459
 probably for this reason knows no pig 

00:05:23.299 --> 00:05:28.159
 today the extra packs island action 

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:30.919
 and retribution of nine companies like 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:33.259
 aztec new media both addons led 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.309
 a handful of new mission 1 units 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:36.469
 but there were none 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:38.749
 and there is another addon 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:40.819
 Forces called this and appeared only weeks 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:42.259
 after the main game blitzer prohibited 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.209
 here, however, the use of the license 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.309
 which is why the game was later renamed 

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:47.689
 and miserably went down that starcraft in 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:49.249
 a time was developed in the 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:51.589
 love for the game was even more important than 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:53.389
 Billions included it like 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:55.279
 many games of that time one 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.319
 almost wasteful wealth 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:59.059

 warcraft about special codes you can 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.589
 For example, there sound 1 as

 as a stop before he leaves necessarily 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.509
 go to the side because there we have
