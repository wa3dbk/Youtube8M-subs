easily wanted we had a pretty good stage
at<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.300> point<00:00:27.539> where<00:00:27.660> we<00:00:27.750> could<00:00:27.900> have<00:00:27.990> just

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
at the point where we could have just

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.589 
at the point where we could have just
gone<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.439> 5<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.980> pushed<00:00:29.670> up<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.849> hill<00:00:30.090> if<00:00:30.269> am

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
didn't come oh we're going to a bad

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.260 
didn't come oh we're going to a bad
situation<00:00:34.340> in<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.460> sense<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.790> aim<00:00:36.059> was

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
situation in the sense that aim was

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.790 
situation in the sense that aim was
split<00:00:36.480> pushing<00:00:36.690> all<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:36.960> time<00:00:37.200> you're

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
split pushing all the time you're

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.959 
split pushing all the time you're
strumming<00:00:37.980> our<00:00:38.190> base<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:38.579> we<00:00:38.670> could<00:00:38.820> easily

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
strumming our base but we could easily

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.450 
strumming our base but we could easily
take<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.450> 55<00:00:39.960> but<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.829> never<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.190> into

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
take the 55 but we can never get into

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.340 
take the 55 but we can never get into
that<00:00:41.610> into<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.090> kind<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.329> situation<00:00:42.570> for

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
that into that kind of situation for

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.260 
that into that kind of situation for
smack<00:00:43.710> what<00:00:44.610> was<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> rationale<00:00:45.210> behind

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
smack what was the rationale behind

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.350 
smack what was the rationale behind
using<00:00:45.809> going<00:00:46.379> on<00:00:46.500> Mills<00:00:46.800> from<00:00:46.920> first<00:00:47.250> oh<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
using going on Mills from first oh the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.479 
using going on Mills from first oh the
idea<00:00:48.600> behind<00:00:48.719> maelstrom<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:49.620> cheap<00:00:50.340> and

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
idea behind maelstrom is it's cheap and

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.549 
idea behind maelstrom is it's cheap and
cost<00:00:50.730> efficient<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:52.050> go<00:00:52.170> with<00:00:52.320> spider

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
cost efficient so you can go with spider

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.619 
cost efficient so you can go with spider
lee<00:00:52.920> if<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.610> pipe<00:00:53.850> up<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.180> can<00:00:54.329> enter

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
lee if you have pipe up you can enter

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.000 
lee if you have pipe up you can enter
base<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.800> bear

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
base and you can just have this bear

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.189 
base and you can just have this bear
sees<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> tower<00:00:56.670> over<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.149> over<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.570> it's

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
sees the tower over and over and it's

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.049 
sees the tower over and over and it's
safer<00:00:58.620> instead<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.949> having<00:00:59.129> bear<00:00:59.370> save<00:00:59.640> 300

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
safer instead of having bear save 300

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.209 
safer instead of having bear save 300
for<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.480> relic<00:01:00.780> where<00:01:01.379> until<00:01:01.710> he<00:01:01.859> gets<00:01:02.039> that

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
for a relic where until he gets that

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.939 
for a relic where until he gets that
he's<00:01:02.430> useless<00:01:02.640> if<00:01:02.969> he<00:01:03.090> dies<00:01:03.329> then<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.949> set

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
he's useless if he dies then it's set

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.969 
he's useless if he dies then it's set
back<00:01:04.979> real<00:01:05.339> far<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.850> oh<00:01:06.680> it's<00:01:07.680> more<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.920> an

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
back real far and oh it's more of an

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.620
