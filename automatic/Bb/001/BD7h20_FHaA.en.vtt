00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hi, I'm Jorge de Ferro, and I'm in 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.270
 a video response because I have 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.790
 asked a question how do you 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.889
 change the spare burner wick 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.570
 petro lamps more this video 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.700
 Tutorial is worth so much for models 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.220
 petro plus hd 1 as for the model 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.830
 full full hander 276 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.480
 let's see or I'll explain how 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.039
 change the spare burner and wick and 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.140
 how can we change the wick and also 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.300
 to the crystal is very simple we take the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.609
 hook we throw up we hold 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.000
 with your hand and then this will go towards 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.140
 back down and we will be confused 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.390
 the back 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.360
 here we have access to the one who is what 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.620
 we would change and come on let's ask 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.989
 what did you do to me the report burned two 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.380
 meters as you can see we would throw 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.230
 here 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.300
 and it would come out what is all the spare that 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.680
 we sell the complete spare both of the 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.720
 burner like the wick or you can 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.480
 change the wick you always have to have 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.230
 Beware that here is a board 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.230
 we would put it back here 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.120
 can appreciate 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.430
 we will look towards asia now it would be towards 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.500
 clockwise to loosen it 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.210
 counterclockwise takes here some 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.400
 tabs so the camera approaches and what 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.670
 you can see here and the tab here would be 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.890
 to close it takes 23 of these to kansas 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.740
 offer we will go down so turn and 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.890
 masters clockwise to tighten and 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.450
 to loosen sense before being worth 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.030
 OK 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.469
 and the glass for nothing we take open 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.490
 backwards 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.429
 we take a little open here and 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.470
 we take out the glass, it's worth for that, 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.360
 same 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.070
 if it helps another person look a lot 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.140
 better because while we throw 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.450
 carefully here because this has 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.920
 position here lower the camera so that 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.430
 see here has a position when we go to 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.470
 let this rest time the sides 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.700
 so that it stays totally closed not 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.230
 I will not put a code comes removes 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.200
 so that you see the petro more opposite 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.500
 and so it goes and here we wanted the wick 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.039
 and it 's worth 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.060
 notice that the wick has stayed here 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.060
 it has been a little low 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.400
 Y 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.010
 we lost 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.600
 and here we will have access to the mix well 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.600
 correct 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.170
 the wick we climb 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.400
 and we go down 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.400
 they do not throw me up 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:42.400
 perfect for 276 models 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.750
 we also upload this model 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.510
 as it is a bit bigger for me it is 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.980
 more comfortable worth we would pull back 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.599
 It's worth it, it has nothing of the other world 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.920
 and would catch'd get well again 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.920
 wick we would catch 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.790
 we would look at this model as it is painted 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.989
 Well, it's like that painted model 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.670
 we will have to do a little more strength 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.439
 because a whole piece has been painted 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.439
 I should have picked another model that 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:09.090
 it's more than saying that it's much more comfortable 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.680
 ok and we have the mix we will put 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.920
 here again 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.430
 This model to be painted costs a 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.430
 a little more 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.940
 the same position that we would see the wick 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.409
 up and this one I hope this 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.680
 information or help has been served to a 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.680
 greeting
