00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
there's no team mode from what I can

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.580 
there's no team mode from what I can
tell<00:04:35.699> I<00:04:35.909> don't<00:04:36.090> play<00:04:36.569> this<00:04:36.719> remote<00:04:37.020> very<00:04:37.289> often

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
tell I don't play this remote very often

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.950 
tell I don't play this remote very often
and<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:38.669> single<00:04:38.999> player<00:04:39.210> instant<00:04:39.629> action

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
and the single player instant action

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.989 
and the single player instant action
mode<00:04:40.139> has<00:04:40.439> a<00:04:40.770> few<00:04:41.039> amounts<00:04:41.400> to<00:04:41.490> play<00:04:41.669> on<00:04:41.789> but

00:04:41.989 --> 00:04:41.999 
mode has a few amounts to play on but

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:44.209 
mode has a few amounts to play on but
then<00:04:42.449> again<00:04:42.629> we<00:04:43.110> do<00:04:43.229> have<00:04:43.259> the<00:04:43.590> main<00:04:43.770> campaign

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:44.219 
then again we do have the main campaign

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:47.119 
then again we do have the main campaign
to<00:04:44.400> play<00:04:44.580> so<00:04:45.240> like<00:04:46.139> I<00:04:46.289> said<00:04:46.469> I<00:04:46.529> don't<00:04:46.889> really

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:47.129 
to play so like I said I don't really

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:48.739 
to play so like I said I don't really
play<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.520> multiplayer<00:04:47.939> mode<00:04:48.180> all<00:04:48.300> that<00:04:48.509> much

00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:48.749 
play the multiplayer mode all that much

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:50.600 
play the multiplayer mode all that much
but<00:04:49.020> I<00:04:49.199> suppose<00:04:49.680> if<00:04:49.830> you<00:04:49.919> could<00:04:50.129> find<00:04:50.400> someone

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
but I suppose if you could find someone

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.600 
but I suppose if you could find someone
who<00:04:51.110> enjoys<00:04:52.110> this<00:04:52.319> game<00:04:52.560> as<00:04:52.770> much<00:04:52.800> as<00:04:52.979> you<00:04:53.279> do

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
who enjoys this game as much as you do

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.399 
who enjoys this game as much as you do
okay<00:04:54.120> I<00:04:54.270> suppose<00:04:54.419> it<00:04:54.689> could<00:04:54.810> be<00:04:54.960> a<00:04:54.990> bit<00:04:55.289> of<00:04:55.319> fun

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409 
okay I suppose it could be a bit of fun

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.040 
okay I suppose it could be a bit of fun
to<00:04:56.249> have<00:04:56.430> if<00:04:56.699> you've<00:04:57.210> finished<00:04:57.599> the<00:04:57.870> main

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
to have if you've finished the main

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.290 
to have if you've finished the main
campaign<00:04:58.500> that<00:04:59.279> all<00:04:59.460> said<00:04:59.759> this<00:04:59.969> is<00:05:00.180> an

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
campaign that all said this is an

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.959 
campaign that all said this is an
excellent<00:05:00.509> game<00:05:00.810> is<00:05:01.080> in<00:05:01.830> my<00:05:02.039> opinion<00:05:02.250> a<00:05:02.490> truly

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:02.969 
excellent game is in my opinion a truly

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:06.589 
excellent game is in my opinion a truly
ageless<00:05:03.180> game<00:05:03.889> while<00:05:04.889> I<00:05:05.430> have<00:05:06.240> had<00:05:06.449> trouble

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
ageless game while I have had trouble

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:08.959 
ageless game while I have had trouble
getting<00:05:07.259> it<00:05:07.469> to<00:05:07.560> work<00:05:07.680> on<00:05:07.889> various<00:05:08.279> sort<00:05:08.879> of

there's<00:06:14.099> a<00:06:14.129> few<00:06:14.580> games<00:06:14.819> where<00:06:15.089> like<00:06:15.330> if<00:06:15.569> you

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:15.689 
there's a few games where like if you

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:16.850 
there's a few games where like if you
keep<00:06:15.870> on<00:06:16.020> repeating<00:06:16.259> something<00:06:16.680> it<00:06:16.740> gets

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
keep on repeating something it gets

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.740 
keep on repeating something it gets
frustrating<00:06:17.460> usually<00:06:18.210> in<00:06:18.330> this<00:06:18.449> game<00:06:18.629> you

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
frustrating usually in this game you

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.969 
frustrating usually in this game you
don't<00:06:18.779> have<00:06:19.020> to<00:06:19.110> repeat<00:06:19.379> things<00:06:19.560> too<00:06:19.889> many

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
don't have to repeat things too many

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.999 
don't have to repeat things too many
times<00:06:20.399> and<00:06:20.610> it's<00:06:21.599> far<00:06:22.110> more<00:06:22.139> satisfying<00:06:22.710> when

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009 
times and it's far more satisfying when

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:25.629 
times and it's far more satisfying when
you<00:06:23.339> get<00:06:23.580> it<00:06:23.729> right<00:06:23.969> when<00:06:24.240> you<00:06:24.360> realize<00:06:24.750> that

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 
you get it right when you realize that

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:29.179 
you get it right when you realize that
every<00:06:26.639> move<00:06:26.849> kind<00:06:27.539> of<00:06:27.629> counts<00:06:28.110> so<00:06:28.289> this<00:06:28.770> this

00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:29.189 
every move kind of counts so this this

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:31.939 
every move kind of counts so this this
game<00:06:29.490> is<00:06:29.699> is<00:06:29.969> it<00:06:30.330> manages<00:06:30.779> to<00:06:30.960> say<00:06:31.139> fun<00:06:31.500> while
