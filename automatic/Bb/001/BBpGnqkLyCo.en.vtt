egg<00:00:04.160> some<00:00:05.160> people<00:00:05.490> do<00:00:05.850> that<00:00:05.970> in<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.150> port<00:00:06.390> of

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
egg some people do that in a port of

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.440 
egg some people do that in a port of
deep<00:00:06.720> water<00:00:07.130> some<00:00:08.130> people<00:00:08.429> like<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.940> do<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.269> an

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
deep water some people like to do it an

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.930 
deep water some people like to do it an
upon<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.750> shallow<00:00:10.110> water<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:11.370> way<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:11.519> like<00:00:11.790> to

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
upon a shallow water the way I like to

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.280 
upon a shallow water the way I like to
do<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.240> as<00:00:12.360> in<00:00:12.509> deeper<00:00:12.870> water

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
do it as in deeper water

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.650 
do it as in deeper water
so<00:00:13.710> that's<00:00:13.920> port<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.370> god<00:00:14.670> 3<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.299> she's<00:00:15.540> in

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
so that's port is a god 3 and she's in

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.750 
so that's port is a god 3 and she's in
water<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.260> along<00:00:17.100> with<00:00:17.340> some<00:00:17.369> white<00:00:17.730> wine

water and it along with some white wine

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.480 
water and it along with some white wine
vinegar<00:00:18.380> so<00:00:19.380> what<00:00:19.560> I'm<00:00:19.650> gonna<00:00:19.770> do<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.340> bring

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
vinegar so what I'm gonna do is bring

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.599 
vinegar so what I'm gonna do is bring
the<00:00:20.730> port<00:00:20.939> almost<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> simmer<00:00:22.529> but<00:00:23.340> not

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
the port almost to a simmer but not

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.080 
the port almost to a simmer but not
quite<00:00:23.910> then<00:00:24.720> I'm<00:00:25.050> gonna<00:00:25.260> stir<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.830> slowly<00:00:26.760> at

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
quite then I'm gonna stir it slowly at

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.290 
quite then I'm gonna stir it slowly at
first<00:00:27.119> then<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:28.560> little<00:00:28.920> bit<00:00:29.220> more<00:00:29.279> rapidly<00:00:29.939> so

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
first then a little bit more rapidly so

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.420 
first then a little bit more rapidly so
as<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.410> actually<00:00:31.800> get<00:00:32.009> off<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.279> will

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
as that can actually get off that will

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.540 
as that can actually get off that will
peel<00:00:32.640> effect<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.750> poor<00:00:34.250> once<00:00:35.250> I've<00:00:35.399> got

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
peel effect and the poor once I've got

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.790 
peel effect and the poor once I've got
that<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.760> I've<00:00:36.540> got<00:00:36.600> my<00:00:36.930> eggs<00:00:37.140> ready<00:00:37.350> here

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
that going I've got my eggs ready here

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.080 
that going I've got my eggs ready here
and<00:00:38.300> I'm<00:00:39.300> going<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.660> gently<00:00:40.550> pull<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.760> right

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
and I'm going to gently pull it right

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.389 
and I'm going to gently pull it right
down<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.570> center<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.649> petal<00:00:43.800> pill<00:00:44.190> in

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
down to the center of the petal pill in

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.920 
down to the center of the petal pill in
the<00:00:45.120> pot<00:00:45.950> now<00:00:46.950> what<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.280> pill<00:00:47.760> does<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.570> serves

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
the pot now what the pill does it serves

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.799 
the pot now what the pill does it serves
to<00:00:49.110> draw<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.379> albumin<00:00:49.980> around<00:00:50.280> New<00:00:50.460> York<00:00:50.809> and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
to draw the albumin around New York and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.420 
to draw the albumin around New York and
it<00:00:52.020> gives<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> much<00:00:52.530> better<00:00:52.710> effect<00:00:53.010> and

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
it gives you a much better effect and

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.970 
it gives you a much better effect and
the<00:00:53.489> final<00:00:53.850> poached<00:00:54.090> egg<00:00:54.649> what<00:00:55.649> you'll<00:00:55.770> notice

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the final poached egg what you'll notice

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.040 
the final poached egg what you'll notice
is<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.399> doesn't<00:00:57.000> break<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.420> egg<00:00:57.570> straight

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
is that doesn't break the egg straight

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.330 
is that doesn't break the egg straight
into<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> port<00:00:59.149> doing<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.390> can<00:01:00.840> not<00:01:01.079> also

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
into the port doing that can not also

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.160 
into the port doing that can not also
lead<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.370> breaking<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.090> yolk<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.870> can

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
lead to breaking the yolk it can

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.140 
lead to breaking the yolk it can
actually<00:01:04.769> tell<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.040> she'll<00:01:05.489> or<00:01:05.760> something

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
actually tell that she'll or something

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.450 
actually tell that she'll or something
in<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.600> port<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:07.860> much<00:01:08.040> better<00:01:08.220> to

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
in on the port so it's much better to

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.670 
in on the port so it's much better to
break<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.060> into<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> small<00:01:09.479> bowl<00:01:09.869> or<00:01:10.200> even<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
break it and into a small bowl or even a

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.630 
break it and into a small bowl or even a
cup<00:01:10.920> before<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.369> do<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:13.040> when<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.130> poaching

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
cup before you do so when you poaching

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.249 
cup before you do so when you poaching
the<00:01:14.760> egg<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.659> leave<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.990> alone

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the egg like this just leave it alone

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.710 
the egg like this just leave it alone
don't<00:01:16.799> move<00:01:17.100> about<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.790> port<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.540> what

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
don't move about in the port but what

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.679 
don't move about in the port but what
you<00:01:18.840> need<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.229> do<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.680> control<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.189> summer<00:01:21.090> you

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
need to bring it down so is that the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.960 
need to bring it down so is that the
water<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.790> barely<00:01:24.390> simmering<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:25.530> at<00:01:25.740> all<00:01:25.970> if

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
water is barely simmering if at all if

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.270 
water is barely simmering if at all if
