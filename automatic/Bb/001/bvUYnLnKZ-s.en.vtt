00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.539 
and today I'm gonna be talking to you
guys<00:00:03.480> about<00:00:03.780> holographic<00:00:04.529> television<00:00:05.069> now

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
guys about holographic television now

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.309 
guys about holographic television now
you<00:00:05.609> may<00:00:05.850> say<00:00:06.150> holographic<00:00:06.870> television<00:00:07.230> it

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
you may say holographic television it

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.720 
you may say holographic television it
doesn't<00:00:07.529> even<00:00:07.620> exist<00:00:07.710> yet<00:00:08.010> but<00:00:08.460> it<00:00:08.550> kind<00:00:08.700> of

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
doesn't even exist yet but it kind of

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.220 
doesn't even exist yet but it kind of
does<00:00:08.940> it's<00:00:09.360> actually<00:00:09.450> in<00:00:09.719> development<00:00:10.139> right

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
does it's actually in development right

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.990 
does it's actually in development right
now<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:11.010> actually<00:00:11.099> watch<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.550> video<00:00:11.790> one

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
now and I actually watch the video one

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.910 
now and I actually watch the video one
of<00:00:12.059> my<00:00:12.120> video<00:00:12.360> classes<00:00:12.630> here<00:00:13.080> at<00:00:13.110> school<00:00:13.469> that

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
of my video classes here at school that

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.680 
of my video classes here at school that
explains<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.700> I'm<00:00:14.910> words<00:00:15.360> out<00:00:15.540> its

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
explains it I'm words out its

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.910 
explains it I'm words out its
development<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.320> what<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.500> actually<00:00:16.619> means

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
development and what it actually means

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.590 
development and what it actually means
for<00:00:17.220> 3d<00:00:17.820> televisions<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.390> are<00:00:18.510> out<00:00:18.570> right

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
for 3d televisions that are out right

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.230 
for 3d televisions that are out right
now<00:00:19.250> I'm<00:00:20.250> going<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.520> suggest<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.880> guys<00:00:21.000> watch

now I'm going to suggest you guys watch

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.390 
now I'm going to suggest you guys watch
that<00:00:21.449> video<00:00:21.600> I'll<00:00:21.990> put<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> link<00:00:22.740> somewhere<00:00:23.100> in

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
that video I'll put a link somewhere in

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.620 
that video I'll put a link somewhere in
the<00:00:23.460> description<00:00:23.910> or<00:00:23.970> maybe<00:00:24.119> an<00:00:24.269> annotation

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
the description or maybe an annotation

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.300 
the description or maybe an annotation
it's<00:00:24.869> actually<00:00:25.170> on<00:00:25.230> YouTube<00:00:25.590> where<00:00:26.130> they<00:00:26.250> talk

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
it's actually on YouTube where they talk

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.550 
it's actually on YouTube where they talk
about<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.789> holographic<00:00:27.449> television<00:00:28.019> how<00:00:28.410> it

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
about this holographic television how it

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.589 
about this holographic television how it
works<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.070> basically<00:00:29.699> what<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.029> means<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.269> 3d

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
works and basically what it means for 3d

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.840 
works and basically what it means for 3d
television<00:00:31.109> um<00:00:31.230> but<00:00:32.189> if<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.610> don't<00:00:32.730> wanna

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
television um but if you don't wanna

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.830 
television um but if you don't wanna
watch<00:00:33.000> out<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.239> going<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.420> sum<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.570> up<00:00:33.690> really

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
watch out it's going to sum it up really

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.500 
watch out it's going to sum it up really
quick<00:00:33.980> basically<00:00:34.980> they<00:00:35.130> say<00:00:35.370> 3d<00:00:36.059> television

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
quick basically they say 3d television

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.330 
quick basically they say 3d television
right<00:00:36.719> now<00:00:36.750> with<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.800> without<00:00:37.950> glasses

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
right now with and without glasses

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.700 
right now with and without glasses
causes<00:00:39.030> too<00:00:39.210> much<00:00:39.360> eye<00:00:39.570> strain<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.590> lead

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
causes too much eye strain and can lead

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.900 
causes too much eye strain and can lead
to<00:00:40.770> headaches<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.489> can't<00:00:41.760> really

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
to headaches and that you can't really

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.240 
to headaches and that you can't really
watch<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.270> lot<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.570> at<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.690> time<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.649> that's<00:00:43.829> 3d

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
watch a lot of it at a time so that's 3d

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.130 
watch a lot of it at a time so that's 3d
technology<00:00:44.700> from<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.879> 3ds<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.660> 3d<00:00:45.930> cell

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
technology from the 3ds to 3d cell

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.840 
technology from the 3ds to 3d cell
phones<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.649> 3d<00:00:47.010> televisions<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:47.640> and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
phones to 3d televisions with and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.549 
phones to 3d televisions with and
without<00:00:47.940> glasses<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.719> they<00:00:49.230> say<00:00:49.410> they're

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
without glasses and they say they're

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.529 
without glasses and they say they're
really<00:00:49.739> early<00:00:50.129> cure<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.360> really

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
really early cure to that and the really

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.299 
really early cure to that and the really
only<00:00:51.690> option<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.140> go<00:00:52.289> towards<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.800> holographic

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
only option to go towards is holographic

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.760 
only option to go towards is holographic
television<00:00:54.149> where<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.960> actually<00:00:55.170> take<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
television where you actually take the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.560 
television where you actually take the
image<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.760> put<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.180> front<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
image and you put it in front of the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.060 
image and you put it in front of the
television<00:00:57.780> people<00:00:58.350> are<00:00:58.500> no<00:00:58.620> longer<00:00:58.800> fit

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
television people are no longer fit

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.099 
television people are no longer fit
focusing<00:00:59.699> on<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.879> screen<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.420> having<00:01:00.989> eye

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
focusing on the screen and having eye

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.750 
focusing on the screen and having eye
strain<00:01:01.379> there<00:01:01.559> now<00:01:01.920> focusing<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.520> an<00:01:02.609> object

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
strain there now focusing on an object

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.070 
strain there now focusing on an object
that<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.120> actually<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.510> front<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> screen

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
that is actually in front of the screen

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.620 
that is actually in front of the screen
and<00:01:04.350> right<00:01:05.129> now<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.670> technology<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.479> in

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
and right now this technology is in

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.000 
and right now this technology is in
development<00:01:06.780> still<00:01:07.290> as<00:01:07.470> far<00:01:07.650> as<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:07.830> know

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
development still as far as we know

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.219 
development still as far as we know
video<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.700> actually<00:01:08.909> around<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.570> year<00:01:09.750> old<00:01:09.960> look

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
video is actually around a year old look

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.140 
video is actually around a year old look
if<00:01:10.350> not<00:01:10.560> more<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.040> basically<00:01:11.729> they<00:01:11.939> say

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
if not more and basically they say

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.609 
if not more and basically they say
holographic<00:01:12.720> TVs<00:01:12.990> would<00:01:13.170> go<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.380> see<00:01:13.530> out

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
holographic TVs would go and see out

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.710 
holographic TVs would go and see out
with<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.830> 2012<00:01:14.549> well<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.180> don't<00:01:15.420> agree<00:01:15.659> with

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
with in 2012 well I don't agree with

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.850 
with in 2012 well I don't agree with
that<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.930> think<00:01:16.049> they<00:01:16.259> have<00:01:16.380> maybe<00:01:16.590> at<00:01:16.770> least

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that I think they have maybe at least

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.620 
that I think they have maybe at least
another<00:01:17.130> year<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.790> go<00:01:17.970> until<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.299> even<00:01:18.450> hear

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
another year to go until we even hear

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.179 
another year to go until we even hear
from<00:01:18.659> them<00:01:18.930> they<00:01:19.439> might<00:01:19.560> surprise<00:01:19.799> us<00:01:20.040> they

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
from them they might surprise us they

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.280 
from them they might surprise us they
might<00:01:20.340> release<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.850> have<00:01:21.030> no<00:01:21.150> idea<00:01:21.270> but<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.080> just

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
might release I have no idea but I just

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
might release I have no idea but I just
think<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:22.830> interesting<00:01:22.920> because

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
think it's really interesting because

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.679 
think it's really interesting because
right<00:01:24.000> now<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.210> see<00:01:24.479> all<00:01:24.630> these

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
right now we see all these

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.450 
right now we see all these
advertisements<00:01:25.110> for<00:01:25.409> 3d<00:01:25.770> televisions<00:01:26.340> you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
advertisements for 3d televisions you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.859 
advertisements for 3d televisions you
should<00:01:26.610> go<00:01:26.670> buy<00:01:26.850> or<00:01:27.000> 3d<00:01:27.240> TV<00:01:27.540> because<00:01:27.720> they're

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
should go buy or 3d TV because they're

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.630 
should go buy or 3d TV because they're
always<00:01:27.960> getting<00:01:28.200> new<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.590> better<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:29.340> really

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
always getting new and better but really

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.670 
always getting new and better but really
this<00:01:30.000> holographic<00:01:30.420> technology<00:01:30.689> makes<00:01:31.500> it

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
this holographic technology makes it

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.950 
this holographic technology makes it
obsolete<00:01:32.340> soon<00:01:32.909> enough<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.299> another<00:01:33.540> year<00:01:33.750> so

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
obsolete soon enough and another year so

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.270 
obsolete soon enough and another year so
we're<00:01:34.049> gonna<00:01:34.140> holla<00:01:34.500> graphic<00:01:34.829> televisions

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
we're gonna holla graphic televisions

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.980 
we're gonna holla graphic televisions
and<00:01:35.369> surrender<00:01:35.820> our<00:01:35.939> 3d<00:01:36.270> televisions<00:01:36.720> we<00:01:36.840> have

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
and surrender our 3d televisions we have

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.319 
and surrender our 3d televisions we have
right<00:01:37.170> now<00:01:37.320> basically<00:01:38.040> useless<00:01:38.430> there<00:01:39.180> are<00:01:39.299> a

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
right now basically useless there are a

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.120 
right now basically useless there are a
couple<00:01:39.450> folks<00:01:39.780> right<00:01:40.020> now<00:01:40.049> they<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.799> mean

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
couple folks right now they have I mean

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.800 
couple folks right now they have I mean
there's<00:01:41.460> kind<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.939> limited<00:01:42.270> viewing<00:01:42.450> angle

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
there's kind of a limited viewing angle

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.030 
there's kind of a limited viewing angle
you<00:01:42.869> have<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.049> be<00:01:43.170> right<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.500> front<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.860> to

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
you have to be right in front of it to

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.830 
you have to be right in front of it to
be<00:01:44.159> able<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.369> see<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> picture<00:01:44.909> clearly<00:01:45.210> see

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
be able to see the picture clearly see

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.840 
be able to see the picture clearly see
the<00:01:45.869> hologram<00:01:46.350> clearly<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.430> they<00:01:47.640> do<00:01:47.700> have

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
the hologram clearly but they do have

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.219 
the hologram clearly but they do have
cameras<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.390> television<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.869> can<00:01:48.990> track

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
cameras in the television that can track

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.219 
cameras in the television that can track
your<00:01:49.380> eyes<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.939> put<00:01:50.939> project<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.689> hologram<00:01:51.720> to

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
your eyes and put project a hologram to

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.149 
your eyes and put project a hologram to
wherever<00:01:52.409> you're<00:01:52.590> sitting<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:52.979> they<00:01:53.040> can

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
wherever you're sitting and they can

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.920 
wherever you're sitting and they can
track<00:01:53.490> up<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.759> four<00:01:53.970> pairs<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.299> eyes<00:01:54.420> right

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
track up the four pairs of eyes right

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.780 
track up the four pairs of eyes right
now<00:01:55.079> they<00:01:55.259> have<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> improve<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.890> basically

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
now they have to improve that basically

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.580 
now they have to improve that basically
the<00:01:57.060> machines<00:01:57.600> may<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.960> bunch<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.200> medical

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
the machines may have a bunch of medical

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.700 
the machines may have a bunch of medical
supplies<00:01:59.250> right<00:01:59.460> now<00:01:59.640> medical<00:02:00.200> equipment<00:02:01.200> and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
supplies right now medical equipment and

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.289 
supplies right now medical equipment and
so<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.890> hook<00:02:02.009> filet<00:02:02.189> de<00:02:02.399> have<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.969> shrink<00:02:03.119> it

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
so the hook filet de have to shrink it

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.399 
so the hook filet de have to shrink it
down<00:02:03.329> because<00:02:03.659> if<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.869> watch<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.110> video<00:02:04.290> it's

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
down because if you watch the video it's

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.080 
down because if you watch the video it's
actually<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.680> box<00:02:04.950> or<00:02:05.159> big<00:02:05.430> box<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.880> only

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
actually a box or big box and only

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.089 
actually a box or big box and only
projects<00:02:06.659> in<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.840> green<00:02:07.079> maybe<00:02:07.469> some<00:02:07.829> other

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
projects in a green maybe some other

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.830 
projects in a green maybe some other
limited<00:02:08.459> colors<00:02:08.729> right<00:02:08.879> now<00:02:09.060> they<00:02:09.629> have<00:02:09.750> to

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
limited colors right now they have to

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.220 
limited colors right now they have to
get<00:02:09.929> full<00:02:10.140> color<00:02:10.410> I'm<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:11.069> smaller<00:02:11.400> device<00:02:11.580> and

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
get full color I'm a smaller device and

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.059 
get full color I'm a smaller device and
broadcast<00:02:13.230> up<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.530> more<00:02:13.680> people<00:02:13.920> who<00:02:13.950> are

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
broadcast up the more people who are

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.119 
broadcast up the more people who are
watching<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.550> same<00:02:14.760> picture<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.450> hologram

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
watching the same picture and hologram

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.050 
watching the same picture and hologram
but<00:02:17.129> basically<00:02:17.430> back<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.790> what<00:02:17.879> I<00:02:17.910> was<00:02:17.940> saying

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
but basically back to what I was saying

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.660 
but basically back to what I was saying
with<00:02:18.270> 3d<00:02:18.569> televisions<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.260> basically<00:02:20.099> renders

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
with 3d televisions it basically renders

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.790 
with 3d televisions it basically renders
them<00:02:20.790> obsolete<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.599> a<00:02:21.810> couple<00:02:22.080> years<00:02:22.110> your<00:02:22.500> 3d

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
them obsolete in a couple years your 3d

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.900 
them obsolete in a couple years your 3d
television<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.220> just<00:02:23.400> bought<00:02:23.580> for<00:02:23.879> a

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
television you just bought for a

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.550 
television you just bought for a
boatload<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.540> cash<00:02:24.780> isn't<00:02:25.140> going<00:02:25.379> to<00:02:25.440> really

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
boatload of cash isn't going to really

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.600 
boatload of cash isn't going to really
mean<00:02:25.739> anything<00:02:25.950> because<00:02:26.160> gonna<00:02:26.459> have

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
mean anything because gonna have

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.270 
mean anything because gonna have
holographic<00:02:27.540> televisions<00:02:28.020> out<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.349> always

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
holographic televisions out I always

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.920 
holographic televisions out I always
kind<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.550> predicted<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.150> 3d<00:02:30.420> televisions

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
kind of predicted that 3d televisions

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.059 
kind of predicted that 3d televisions
were<00:02:31.050> more<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.349> a<00:02:31.410> gimmick<00:02:31.739> than<00:02:31.860> really

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
were more of a gimmick than really

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.520 
were more of a gimmick than really
something<00:02:32.400> actually<00:02:32.580> worth<00:02:33.120> buying<00:02:33.450> am<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.260> not

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
something actually worth buying am I not

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.350 
something actually worth buying am I not
even<00:02:35.069> consider<00:02:35.370> buying<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.670> 3d<00:02:35.910> television<00:02:36.060> i

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
even consider buying a 3d television i

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.670 
even consider buying a 3d television i
know<00:02:36.420> i<00:02:36.510> bought<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.780> 3ds<00:02:37.080> but<00:02:37.349> that<00:02:37.470> was<00:02:37.560> like

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
know i bought the 3ds but that was like

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.320 
know i bought the 3ds but that was like
a<00:02:37.739> gaming<00:02:38.190> platform<00:02:38.819> it's<00:02:38.970> completely

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
a gaming platform it's completely

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.699 
a gaming platform it's completely
different<00:02:39.420> than<00:02:39.629> watching<00:02:40.050> our<00:02:40.379> daily

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
different than watching our daily

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.339 
different than watching our daily
television<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.640> movies<00:02:41.910> in<00:02:42.060> 3d<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.660> think<00:02:43.110> 3d

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
television and movies in 3d I think 3d

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.660 
television and movies in 3d I think 3d
television<00:02:43.800> is<00:02:43.890> cool<00:02:44.129> but<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.370> don't<00:02:44.400> think

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
television is cool but I don't think

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.729 
television is cool but I don't think
it's<00:02:44.849> applicable<00:02:45.450> as<00:02:45.569> of<00:02:45.690> now<00:02:45.900> it's<00:02:46.440> just<00:02:46.560> not

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
it's applicable as of now it's just not

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.940 
it's applicable as of now it's just not
really<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.720> widely<00:02:48.720> accepted<00:02:49.379> it's<00:02:49.739> a<00:02:49.830> lot

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
really that widely accepted it's a lot

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.759 
really that widely accepted it's a lot
of<00:02:49.980> different<00:02:50.209> companies<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.239> whatnot<00:02:51.720> so<00:02:52.650> if

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
of different companies and whatnot so if

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.140 
of different companies and whatnot so if
you're<00:02:52.860> in<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:52.980> 3d<00:02:53.250> television<00:02:53.400> right<00:02:53.790> now<00:02:53.819> what

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
you're in a 3d television right now what

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.080 
you're in a 3d television right now what
does<00:02:54.269> that<00:02:54.360> mean<00:02:54.599> for<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.930> um<00:02:55.760> nothing<00:02:56.760> else

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
does that mean for you um nothing else

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.059 
does that mean for you um nothing else
of<00:02:57.209> now<00:02:57.330> because<00:02:57.659> the<00:02:58.050> holographic<00:02:58.440> TVs<00:02:58.890> are

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
of now because the holographic TVs are

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.559 
of now because the holographic TVs are
not<00:02:59.250> yet<00:02:59.430> we<00:02:59.550> don't<00:02:59.730> have<00:02:59.819> much<00:02:59.970> news<00:03:00.269> on<00:03:00.450> them

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
not yet we don't have much news on them

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.180 
not yet we don't have much news on them
we<00:03:00.659> just<00:03:00.840> know<00:03:00.930> their<00:03:01.080> development<00:03:01.650> but<00:03:02.069> it

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
we just know their development but it

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.790 
we just know their development but it
may<00:03:02.459> render<00:03:02.670> your<00:03:02.970> 3d<00:03:03.720> television<00:03:04.200> obsolete

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
may render your 3d television obsolete

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.290 
may render your 3d television obsolete
you<00:03:05.220> may<00:03:05.370> be<00:03:05.430> saying<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.849> wish<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.060> didn't<00:03:06.209> buy

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
you may be saying I wish you didn't buy

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.850 
you may be saying I wish you didn't buy
that<00:03:06.330> but<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:07.110> might<00:03:07.260> have<00:03:07.409> another<00:03:07.560> year<00:03:07.830> or

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
that but you might have another year or

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.259 
that but you might have another year or
two<00:03:07.920> before<00:03:08.069> these<00:03:08.340> holographic<00:03:08.700> televisions

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
two before these holographic televisions

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.240 
two before these holographic televisions
actually<00:03:09.569> get<00:03:09.690> out<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.709> spacek<00:03:11.040> alee<00:03:11.129> want

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
actually get out so I spacek alee want

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.140 
actually get out so I spacek alee want
to<00:03:11.310> make<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:11.489> video<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:11.819> can<00:03:11.909> share<00:03:12.120> with

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
to make this video you can share with

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.330 
to make this video you can share with
you<00:03:12.330> guys<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.510> ideas<00:03:13.379> and<00:03:13.409> the<00:03:13.680> technology<00:03:14.040> is

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
you guys the ideas and the technology is

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.220 
you guys the ideas and the technology is
being<00:03:14.519> developed<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:15.360> I<00:03:15.870> just<00:03:16.019> think<00:03:16.140> it's

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
being developed and I just think it's

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.690 
being developed and I just think it's
really<00:03:16.379> interesting<00:03:16.470> how<00:03:16.920> we've<00:03:17.220> taken<00:03:17.550> it

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
really interesting how we've taken it

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.630 
really interesting how we've taken it
step<00:03:17.970> from<00:03:18.300> black<00:03:19.050> and<00:03:19.080> white<00:03:19.349> to<00:03:19.470> color<00:03:19.769> to

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
step from black and white to color to

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.130 
step from black and white to color to
the<00:03:21.030> bigger<00:03:21.239> screens<00:03:21.659> with<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.930> box

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
the bigger screens with the box

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.259 
the bigger screens with the box
television<00:03:22.650> sets<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:23.069> flat<00:03:23.340> screens<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.909> HD

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
television sets the flat screens the HD

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.470 
television sets the flat screens the HD
LCD<00:03:25.230> all<00:03:25.890> that<00:03:26.250> cool<00:03:26.430> stuff<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:27.150> 3d

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
LCD all that cool stuff the 3d

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.110 
LCD all that cool stuff the 3d
television<00:03:28.049> to<00:03:28.500> actually<00:03:29.220> now<00:03:29.340> holographic

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
television to actually now holographic

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.699 
television to actually now holographic
television<00:03:30.720> which<00:03:30.959> is<00:03:31.140> coming<00:03:31.409> in<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.530> future

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
television which is coming in the future

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.740 
television which is coming in the future

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
toward holographic television I'll let

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.680 
toward holographic television I'll let
me<00:03:38.340> know<00:03:38.400> if<00:03:38.489> you<00:03:38.549> think<00:03:38.580> about<00:03:38.700> 3d<00:03:39.090> TVs<00:03:39.420> if<00:03:39.599> you

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
me know if you think about 3d TVs if you

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.360 
me know if you think about 3d TVs if you
have<00:03:39.870> one<00:03:40.110> if<00:03:40.319> you<00:03:40.500> were<00:03:40.709> going<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.010> buy<00:03:41.129> one<00:03:41.159> if

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
have one if you were going to buy one if

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.770 
have one if you were going to buy one if
you<00:03:41.549> think<00:03:41.819> they're<00:03:41.940> dumb<00:03:42.150> do<00:03:42.690> you<00:03:42.720> think

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
you think they're dumb do you think

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.789 
you think they're dumb do you think
they're<00:03:43.019> waste<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.319> money<00:03:43.379> if<00:03:43.500> you<00:03:43.680> actually

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
they're waste of money if you actually

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:44.690 
they're waste of money if you actually
think<00:03:44.040> there's<00:03:44.220> something<00:03:44.400> you're<00:03:44.580> willing

said<00:03:49.920> check<00:03:50.069> out<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.370> other<00:03:50.400> video<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:51.000> I

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
said check out that other video that I

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.280 
said check out that other video that I
mentioned<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.780> talks<00:03:52.019> about<00:03:52.230> the

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
mentioned the talks about the

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.570 
mentioned the talks about the
holographic<00:03:52.620> televisions<00:03:53.189> I<00:03:53.280> think<00:03:53.459> it's

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
holographic televisions I think it's

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.940 
holographic televisions I think it's
very<00:03:53.939> informational<00:03:54.599> it's<00:03:55.049> really<00:03:55.379> useful<00:03:55.769> to

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
very informational it's really useful to

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.199 
very informational it's really useful to
