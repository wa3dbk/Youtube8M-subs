00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
 i 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.240
 hello and tubers or daughter of cher cam 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:16.379
 we are here in a new video the dragon 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.660
 ball firefighting 1.5 part 2 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.150
 the second video that I make of dragon ball 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.580
 first fighting is one of the most videos 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.660
 seen and I give the public what 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.760
 wants 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.869
 this was with my good friend the great level 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.869
 what if 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.150
 is not very participatory good as 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.310
 can see now there are more selection of 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.170
 characters he is going to be goku and his time being 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.150
 Krillin will not be like in the previous game 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.400
 that the characters were confused 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:49.250
 now it's going to be easier to recognize them 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:54.080
 and there's more in this game there are more levels 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.540
 we're still going to play them all or so 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:01.899
 minus one part out there we divide it not 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:05.089
 I know we'll see good let's start your letters 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.450
 remember, we started here and we had 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.340
 to fight against the disgusting fates 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.539
 I do not remember what the controls were like 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.539
 good run 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.579
 with two one jumps with one does not stick and with 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.579
 three charges 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.549
 the music takes eternal 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.549
 but down 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.420

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.159

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.159

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.180
