00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580
 Hello old and did you come to another video of me and continue me 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.520
 introduce you to an app for around 59 from the Mac App Store 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.930
 can easily zoom in and out 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.270
 the whole thing is called still images and the first movie watch first 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.180
 clearly arranged the interface 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.390
 I have taken a picture on my desk for the feast and how to 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.690
 here the information sees is this picture 800 times 600 pixels so we have 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.949
 now left-handed wide and six airbags in height 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.470
 this is quite easy to drag-and-drop into the app rows everything 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.529
 is displayed again normally and we can now have a club thats permanent 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.879
 Picture we can do that easily with a friendship 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.050
 and takes over three hours to go in or give off ideas 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.610
 below it a certain number of pixels 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.570
 to which the image should be reduced in height or in width 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.879
 should be increased 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.960
 It's expensive, but it should not be a problem, it's the same 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.829
 a few words and I treasures and, for example, at the freestyle 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.909
 fourth highest one well he also knows that the proportions retain both 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.539
 so be the width with her so synonymous reduced so that the 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.870
 wide field is still easy after he still put the quality on 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:05.729
 where to leave the best quite high and from the Cologne between 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.560
 different file formats Wenders I take PNG now and maybe was 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.840
 It's easy to take pictures of tests 2 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.980
 and ever make the picture smaller and saved on my desk 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.900
 "We see it so it's exactly these masses that have indicated when we did 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.090
 There are a lot of pictures that we would scale to a certain size 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.140
 Of course, it would be tedious to enter the values ​​in each picture 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.010
 you can create such presets just click this 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.150
 Plus down here and this will give us a few options now 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.530
 We can display a nice picture on a set course 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.770
 is trained a certain percentage of the previous a Skroder 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.570
 quite simply as studies have shown that the chalk or height 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.220
 I want now that the picture is half as big as before gold 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.910
 So I give a club that the picture should be 50% big 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.000
 who has such a name as half size 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.120
 and then save the Barten and ready so the app works 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.640
 really great she does exactly what she should and that really is 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.249
 fast 

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:06.939
 For example, if it has a web page, all the balls are the same size 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.200
 should have because she becomes a verbohrter of it 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.760
 This app is very good custom BoD because they give a way over 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.819
 or saving Photoshop and scale the weather is equivalent to indemnify and 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.120
 So if you need something like this very often you can save one 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.430
 Save a lot of time and who just wants to use it occasionally 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.010
 think it over again because they are 91 and maybe too much 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.969
 and what's more of him, I think I see something
