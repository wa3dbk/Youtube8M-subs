them<00:01:56.180> they<00:01:56.390> look<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.750> same<00:01:56.780> it<00:01:57.530> just<00:01:57.740> looks

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
them they look the same it just looks

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.200 
them they look the same it just looks
like<00:01:58.009> it's<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:58.340> green<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:58.820> there's<00:01:58.940> fire

like it's a green and there's fire

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.210 
like it's a green and there's fire
everywhere<00:01:59.240> so<00:02:00.110> this<00:02:00.229> onslaught<00:02:00.680> fire<00:02:00.979> king

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
everywhere so this onslaught fire king

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.770 
everywhere so this onslaught fire king
so<00:02:01.460> he's<00:02:02.030> gonna<00:02:02.210> do<00:02:02.360> special<00:02:02.780> summon<00:02:02.990> again<00:02:03.610> d

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
so he's gonna do special summon again d

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.050 
so he's gonna do special summon again d
2700<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:06.710> then<00:02:06.890> we<00:02:07.100> have<00:02:07.130> bottomless<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:07.729> don't

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
2700 and then we have bottomless I don't

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.609 
2700 and then we have bottomless I don't
feel<00:02:08.240> like<00:02:08.360> Wallace<00:02:08.540> was<00:02:08.869> necessary<00:02:09.320> at<00:02:09.440> this

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
feel like Wallace was necessary at this

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.770 
feel like Wallace was necessary at this
point<00:02:09.890> because<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:11.150> already<00:02:11.330> have<00:02:11.450> skill

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780
