and the star wheel is forward Cassatt
star<00:03:54.060> wheel<00:03:54.330> was<00:03:54.600> forward<00:03:57.680> at<00:03:58.680> lower<00:04:00.110> lower

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
star wheel was forward at lower lower

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:25.250 
star wheel was forward at lower lower
spring<00:04:01.970> like<00:04:02.970> so<00:04:20.959> I<00:04:23.300> got<00:04:24.300> new<00:04:24.510> spring<00:04:24.870> so<00:04:25.169> it

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
spring like so I got new spring so it

00:04:25.260 --> 00:05:17.360 
spring like so I got new spring so it
doesn't<00:04:25.590> matter<00:04:25.770> if<00:04:25.919> these<00:04:26.210> brake

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.010

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
there's our lever and there you can see

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.980 
there's our lever and there you can see
all<00:05:38.260> the<00:05:38.380> rest<00:05:38.680> on<00:05:38.979> those<00:05:39.510> thread<00:05:40.510> so<00:05:40.810> what<00:05:40.930> I
