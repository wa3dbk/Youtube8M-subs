00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:08.530
 in the winter the holidays the joys of the 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.900
 Christmas glide 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.210
 the end of the year is really one of my 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.639
 favorite times and I hope you 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.470
 you also have fun personally 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.300
 like every year I surf with 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.179
 my little brother enjoying the air 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.819
 pure and landscape there is no need to say in my 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:26.199
 friend is beautiful and it's so cool 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:28.529
 to hit the slopes with people 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.529
 we like 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:36.890
 [Music] 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.989
 after a good day 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.400
 it will soon be time to celebrate 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.380
 last hours of the year 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.020
 it's up to us to make this evening 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:50.870
 magical as possible but natural 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:53.030
 well follow that's back to the warm and 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.080
 dry and just time to prepare 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:04.360
 for the big night 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:07.220
 [Music] 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.290
 that you are there him not the cold 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.450
 aggravates the skin so do not hesitate 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.920
 especially not to moisturize a nutty of 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.380
 fresh cream will do a lot of good 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.119
 to the skin and penetrates fast enough and so 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.940
 she really suffered you can 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.530
 add a small drop of aloe vera 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.770
 insisted of course the sensitive areas and 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.650
 take the opportunity to heal your hands 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.000
 [Music] 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.980
 and if you have not thought about giving 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.810
 before a good layer of lip balm 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.550
 house by and parejo letters and the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:42.540
 to shine as if you were wearing 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:44.190
 gloss well while waiting all did 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.520
 to be born I will enjoy it for myself 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.030
 switch 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.220
 and here is my little dress super 12 based 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.210
 of linen and cotton wool that says 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.240
 natural 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.100
 [Music] 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.810
 ok now less good is more dense 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.690
 at all then it's time to unify 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.040
 a little skin and prevent dark circles 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.630
 some small skin risation of tea 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.840
 green is the best medicine that I 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.450
 know vaporize mass and let 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.130
 to dry and that's all it is 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.209
 effective than the dark circles and that does not 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.040
 will not move hair now to 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.080
 because of the humidity it does not shine 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.970
 so always just dropped a little 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.650
 vinegar and water and brushed your 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.080
 hair to tighten the scales and 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.940
 make them shine of course the smell 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.090
 disappears when your hair is dry 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:37.280
 [Music] 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.989

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.989
 little brush stroke some elastic 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.970
 pins, of course, do not forget 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.300
 especially not lacquer for the future any 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.229

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.640

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:48.690
