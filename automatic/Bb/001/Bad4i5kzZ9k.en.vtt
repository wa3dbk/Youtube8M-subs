00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
ice punch that he can I guess since he

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.990

to<00:01:02.460> take<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:02.969> then<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.149> guess<00:01:03.300> he<00:01:03.420> didn't

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
to take it and then I guess he didn't
