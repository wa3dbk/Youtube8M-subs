underwhelming<00:05:11.540> that<00:05:11.870> is<00:05:12.020> it's<00:05:12.440> crap<00:05:13.990> it<00:05:14.990> could

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
underwhelming that is it's crap it could

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.790 
underwhelming that is it's crap it could
have<00:05:15.260> been<00:05:15.320> done<00:05:15.530> better<00:05:15.910> but<00:05:16.910> no<00:05:17.680> that'd<00:05:18.680> be<00:05:18.770> a

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
have been done better but no that'd be a

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:26.260 
have been done better but no that'd be a
good<00:05:18.919> idea<00:05:19.450> um<00:05:22.030> but<00:05:23.030> yeah<00:05:23.830> that's<00:05:24.830> about<00:05:25.040> it<00:05:25.270> so

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
good idea um but yeah that's about it so

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.970 
good idea um but yeah that's about it so
these<00:05:26.570> final<00:05:26.900> parts<00:05:26.960> are<00:05:27.260> very<00:05:27.440> underwhelming

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
these final parts are very underwhelming

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.440 
these final parts are very underwhelming
and<00:05:28.160> it<00:05:28.310> sucks<00:05:29.500> now<00:05:30.500> like<00:05:30.890> I<00:05:30.980> said<00:05:31.010> before<00:05:31.450> yet

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
and it sucks now like I said before yet

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.120 
and it sucks now like I said before yet
again<00:05:32.690> this<00:05:32.840> is<00:05:32.990> the<00:05:33.020> proof<00:05:33.560> positive<00:05:33.800> the

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
again this is the proof positive the

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.070 
again this is the proof positive the
people<00:05:34.400> don't<00:05:34.580> listen<00:05:34.730> if<00:05:35.240> you've<00:05:35.510> asked<00:05:36.020> me
