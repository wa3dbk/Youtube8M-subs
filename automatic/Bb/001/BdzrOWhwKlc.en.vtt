00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
carry up into the focus mint he's going

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.470 
carry up into the focus mint he's going
to<00:00:36.600> slightly<00:00:37.110> pivot<00:00:37.649> his<00:00:37.860> front<00:00:38.280> leg<00:00:38.730> forward

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
to slightly pivot his front leg forward

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.580 
to slightly pivot his front leg forward
and<00:00:40.489> as<00:00:41.489> he<00:00:41.850> does<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.090> he<00:00:42.540> drops<00:00:43.200> his<00:00:43.379> base<00:00:43.559> a

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
and as he does that he drops his base a

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.260 
and as he does that he drops his base a
little<00:00:43.980> bit<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.340> don't<00:00:44.460> necessarily<00:00:45.120> have<00:00:45.239> to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
little bit you don't necessarily have to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.389 
little bit you don't necessarily have to
drop<00:00:45.570> your<00:00:45.750> base<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.620> will<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.950> will<00:00:47.160> give

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
drop your base but it will it will give

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.610 
drop your base but it will it will give
you<00:00:47.550> more<00:00:47.730> power<00:00:47.789> if<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.870> put<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> little<00:00:49.440> bit

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
you more power if you put a little bit

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.459 
you more power if you put a little bit
more<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.890> your<00:00:50.010> core<00:00:50.309> into<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> strike<00:00:51.469> and

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
more of your core into the strike and

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.040 
more of your core into the strike and
because<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.640> path<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.390> uppercut<00:00:54.870> is

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
because the the path of the uppercut is

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.170 
because the the path of the uppercut is
straight<00:00:55.680> up<00:00:55.710> that's<00:00:56.370> another<00:00:56.730> reason<00:00:56.969> why

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
straight up that's another reason why

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.540 
straight up that's another reason why
dropping<00:00:57.629> your<00:00:57.719> base<00:00:58.010> will<00:00:59.010> allow<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.340> to

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
dropping your base will allow you to

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.630 
dropping your base will allow you to
transfer<00:01:00.270> some<00:01:00.510> more<00:01:00.690> power<00:01:00.960> into<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:02.010> strike

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
transfer some more power into the strike

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.700 
transfer some more power into the strike
so<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> couple<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.780> strikes<00:01:04.110> with<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.439> front

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
so a couple of strikes with the front

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.750 
so a couple of strikes with the front
uppercuts<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.549> now<00:01:06.299> as<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:07.229> saw<00:01:07.760> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
uppercuts to it now as you saw the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.640 
uppercuts to it now as you saw the
strike<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.210> going<00:01:09.240> straight<00:01:09.900> up<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.439> not

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
strike is going straight up it's not

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.590 
strike is going straight up it's not
coming<00:01:11.040> at<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.189> at<00:01:11.369> any<00:01:11.610> angles<00:01:12.180> it's<00:01:12.360> you're
