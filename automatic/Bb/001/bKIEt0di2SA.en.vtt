it<00:01:47.440> happens<00:01:47.770> to<00:01:47.830> be<00:01:47.920> a<00:01:47.979> bad<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.450> paging<00:01:49.450> there<00:01:49.570> is

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
it happens to be a bad a paging there is

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.150 
it happens to be a bad a paging there is
yeah<00:01:49.930> then<00:01:50.680> it's<00:01:50.800> too<00:01:50.979> late

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
yeah then it's too late

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.740 
yeah then it's too late
so<00:01:51.340> cracks<00:01:51.580> into<00:01:51.759> a<00:01:51.850> bowl<00:01:52.030> first<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:52.600> hasn't

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
so cracks into a bowl first and hasn't

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.690

in one at a time I was taught that's how

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.260 
in one at a time I was taught that's how
I<00:01:54.729> was<00:01:54.880> trained

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
I was trained

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.020 
I was trained
I<00:01:55.390> forgot<00:01:55.750> it<00:01:55.899> I<00:01:56.020> was<00:01:56.140> being<00:01:56.350> lazy<00:01:56.440> oh<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:57.610> you
