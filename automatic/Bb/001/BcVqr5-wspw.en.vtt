to 120 really you can stay here to let
but<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.140> recommend<00:00:55.530> going<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.829> LHC<00:00:56.399> at<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:56.820> 117

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
but I recommend going to LHC at like 117

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.830 
but I recommend going to LHC at like 117
I'm<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.710> only<00:00:58.859> reason<00:00:59.160> i<00:00:59.250> say<00:00:59.460> 117<00:01:00.180> it's

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
I'm the only reason i say 117 it's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.000 
I'm the only reason i say 117 it's
because<00:01:01.199> you're<00:01:01.320> not<00:01:01.440> going<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.620> get<00:01:01.739> leech

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
