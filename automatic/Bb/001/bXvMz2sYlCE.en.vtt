00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
 all its legislation discussed in the subject of great interest to those who 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.200
 want to improve the quality of life and dollars more, which is a new way of 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.449
 technology based on the findings 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:12.789
 resentful 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:18.740
 of science was here through the reading and mapping of brain waves 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.419
 made it possible to know exactly what the wave frequency is 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.680
 responsible for reporting or reporting removal behavior 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.160
 for example when she was relaxed 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.070
 the following the mayor of pomegranate of italy 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.550
 when you are stressed holland seed by the netherlands then via 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.520
 of years use after big bid 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.610
 in tests 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.640
 a boat for the people they have managed to determine various patterns 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.490
 it's waves 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.490
 who are responsible for their emotions 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.010
 to go through this growth 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.000
 have created several pathologies that use music to make the brain snore 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 certain frequencies, that is, you listen to a song and cause a 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.980
 deep relaxation or you listen to a song that makes you euphoric 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.110
 then this technology can be used to generate any kind of 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.640
 emotion in the brain 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.950
 it's just day 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.980
 it is for discussing new technologies like in sintra teddy bear that is the hype of 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.800
 praise that are software that uses music to stimulate the brain of 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.420
 people 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.730
 then through country music 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.230
 It is easy to learn and humanize, remembering the 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.210
 have a weapon and quality of life based not on these discoveries 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.310
 impressive 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.560
 so to win the cup of more information 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.560
 is therefore our species 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.770
 ondina account showing technology brokers act with the full celebration 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.950
 and technology 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.420
 and with what this can be applied with what this will benefit from the 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.280
 military service 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.780
 all of you 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.119
 want to know more about this technology can be here so it is necessary 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.440
 that she knows exactly how it works with ov you'll be able to take 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.569
 benefit of the technologies of your life 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.500
 I thank you all and thank you very much.
