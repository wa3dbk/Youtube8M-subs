00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
kind of diving through movement that you

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.800 
kind of diving through movement that you
can<00:01:48.240> use<00:01:48.420> by<00:01:48.660> pressing<00:01:49.200> space<00:01:50.190> twice<00:01:50.810> but

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
can use by pressing space twice but

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.050 
can use by pressing space twice but
that's<00:01:52.290> not<00:01:52.470> enough<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:56.310> things<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.880> I

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
that's not enough the things that I

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.690

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
attack is surprisingly useful and that's

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:10.190 
attack is surprisingly useful and that's

overall this game is great fun and it's

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.250 
overall this game is great fun and it's
almost<00:02:29.280> impossible<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.390> play<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.900> same

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
almost impossible to play the same

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.340 
almost impossible to play the same
mission<00:02:31.680> exactly<00:02:32.280> like<00:02:32.430> they<00:02:32.610> did<00:02:32.880> before

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
mission exactly like they did before

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.759 
mission exactly like they did before
that's<00:02:34.350> why<00:02:34.560> I'm<00:02:34.830> giving<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.459> 8<00:02:35.880> out<00:02:36.299> of<00:02:36.390> 10<00:02:36.840> god

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
that's why I'm giving it 8 out of 10 god
