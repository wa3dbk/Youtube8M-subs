00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
the reason why and then I thought okay

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.410 
the reason why and then I thought okay
maybe<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:28.109> broke<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.680> computer<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.420> PSU

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
maybe I broke the computer the PSU

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.999 
maybe I broke the computer the PSU
doesn't<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:30.869> enough<00:00:31.140> wattage<00:00:31.380> like<00:00:31.830> if<00:00:31.949> you

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
doesn't have enough wattage like if you

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.470 
doesn't have enough wattage like if you
read<00:00:32.250> forums<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:33.440> found<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.590> problem<00:00:35.480> because
