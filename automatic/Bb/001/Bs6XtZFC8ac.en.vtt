soon my friend is actually on this train

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.950 
soon my friend is actually on this train
and<00:06:44.200> he<00:06:45.200> said<00:06:45.560> he<00:06:45.650> did<00:06:45.830> leave<00:06:46.040> whoa<00:06:46.280> boy<00:06:46.960> sorry

about<00:06:48.260> maybe<00:06:48.470> 15<00:06:48.920> or<00:06:49.280> 20<00:06:49.580> minutes<00:06:49.700> ago<00:06:49.970> so<00:06:50.270> and

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:50.600 
about maybe 15 or 20 minutes ago so and

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.240 
about maybe 15 or 20 minutes ago so and
I<00:06:51.410> checked<00:06:51.650> on<00:06:52.030> my<00:06:53.030> train<00:06:53.360> tracking<00:06:53.720> app<00:06:53.870> and

I checked on my train tracking app and

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.650 
I checked on my train tracking app and
surely<00:06:55.250> enough<00:06:55.460> that<00:06:55.670> says<00:06:56.000> it's<00:06:56.150> approaching

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
but I'm just hoping that there's not an

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.980 
but I'm just hoping that there's not an
error<00:06:58.730> with<00:06:58.940> that<00:06:58.970> I<00:06:59.120> don't<00:06:59.300> necessarily<00:06:59.390> want
