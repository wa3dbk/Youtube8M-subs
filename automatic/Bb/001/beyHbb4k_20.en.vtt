00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hi guys today new video on all 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.799
 the products I use for mine 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.900
 manicure and how to use and for 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.540
 keep my nails right 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.980
 however they grow faster because 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.410
 many asked me about mine 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.770
 facebook page and nothing I leave you the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.650
 video 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.800
 hello then first let's go to 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.380
 file the nails unfortunately the index mi 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.210
 breaks the long just yesterday precisely 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.980
 so face I do this treatment for 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.840
 strengthen her nails for a moment because 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.420
 I'm slaughtering and nothing before the soul 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.570
 in a delicate way without spoiling 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.579
 long and then we're going to apply all the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.000
 products and we will see in what sequence li 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.000
 I apply 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.230
 after filing, I'm going to apply 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.300
 This polish s this yellow 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.270
 more than smart, a gel to remove 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.059
 cuticles called fast food col 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:02.540
 remover and nothing this here practically 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.300
 it is applied on the cuticle lap is a yellow 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.759
 precisely that then comes a long time with care 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.950
 it absorbs and you have to wait fifteen 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.920
 seconds and then with a stick go 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.140
 cole we go to say to remove the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.700
 product that takes away even the 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.700
 cuticles cuticle away saying 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.810
 after that I go to apply this oil 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.380
 vitamin on the nails always on the lap 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.979
 cuticles and is a vitamin oil let's say 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.920
 oil in a nourishing oil that indeed 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:59.540
 strengthens nails and let's say it 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.340
 it helps them grow short after that 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.049
 after having extended the lever go to 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.000
 massage all the nail doing 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.000
 adhere this oil well 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.040
 then I go to apply this 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.980
 gel calcium 1 of the pg sage that we say is 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.010
 a calcium gel that really strengthens the 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.450
 nails like no one else can do 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.840
 enamel hardener because it is precisely the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.000
 base that must be applied before applying 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.459
 almost any hardening enamel 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.980
 because if the nails are very sensitive 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.350
 who are weak and sensitive go first 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.420
 applied this to reinforce them a little 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.420
 after applied the hardening enamel 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.370
 after which I apply this 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.260
 petit law that is this hardening cure 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.930
 for long I love that you already know 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.299
 in many because I always apply it 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.700
 I apply it in every tutorial so there is 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.849
 the strange because it is an in during that 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.699
 really does his duty we say i 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:41.359
 mine stretches out my nails for a long time 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:44.689
 an amazing way and it does them 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:47.239
 become strong enough indeed 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:49.909
 because no another hardening enamel 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.519
 he never did his duty as a matter of fact 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:56.620
 he does this and I apply this as a basis 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.620
 for each card that generally does 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:03.139
 then I apply these nylon fibers which is 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:04.009
 always a hardener but let's say 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.940
 another version 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:08.430
 and there is the 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:12.330
 let's say the first step that this glaze 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.740
 which we just say contains precisely the 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.530
 fibers in aion that create this 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.510
 protection on the nails and must be applied 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.600
 a thin layer over the entire nail and 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.070
 then let it dry 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.990
 after which the second is applied 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.100
 layer that is that other you will see 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.050
 then we say a top coat 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:35.840
 colored which helps maintenance 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.840
 let 's say of this base 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.580
 let's go to apply the second step 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.759
 let's go to the second step that already 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.740
 but this top coat rose that we say is 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.870
 a fixing enamel that covers the fibers 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.830
 nylon we applied 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.000
 previously with the fixing system 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.130
 then nothing from a long let's say one 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.410
 smooth and glossy and colored finish 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.090
 precisely because fast and then nothing 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.550
 manicure is over it must be done 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.490
 dry the product well 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.880
 product and then you will have a say 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.520
 manicure and more then 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.770
 you still have your nails treated 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.580
 decorated at the same time you have them 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.580
 precise 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.540
 so many girls from niles carrÃ¹ of infinity 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.790
 and I hope there may have been 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.919
 help because for those who do not know anyway 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.270
 which can be used on the nails 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.040
 fragile and sensitive 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.110
 nothing see you at their neighbor
