it comes with a LED light and this light
is<00:03:09.780> actually<00:03:09.930> pretty<00:03:10.380> bright<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.820> works

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
is actually pretty bright so it works

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.420 
is actually pretty bright so it works
and<00:03:12.780> this<00:03:13.170> light<00:03:13.380> sort<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.709> puts<00:03:13.890> on<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.220> back

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
though they don't die because it's

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.440 
though they don't die because it's
that's<00:03:39.780> what<00:03:39.930> he<00:03:40.050> did<00:03:40.200> also<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:41.310> have<00:03:41.580> the<00:03:42.060> the

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
that's what he did also I have the the

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.360 
that's what he did also I have the the
filters<00:03:42.870> filters<00:03:43.170> on<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.530> left<00:03:43.890> side<00:03:44.100> over

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
filters filters on the left side over

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.720 
filters filters on the left side over
there<00:03:44.610> you<00:03:44.790> can<00:03:44.940> see<00:03:45.320> so<00:03:46.320> pretty<00:03:47.310> much<00:03:47.459> the

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
there you can see so pretty much the

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.479 
there you can see so pretty much the
water<00:03:47.970> goes<00:03:48.930> in<00:03:49.260> from<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.860> bottom<00:03:50.280> of<00:03:50.400> the

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
water goes in from the bottom of the

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.449 
water goes in from the bottom of the
tank<00:03:50.670> all<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.420> way<00:03:51.570> on<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.810> bottom<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.459> it

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
tank all the way on the bottom and it

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.340 
tank all the way on the bottom and it
goes<00:03:53.730> through<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.000> filter<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:54.540> goes<00:03:55.080> this

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
goes through the filter and goes this

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.460 
goes through the filter and goes this
piping<00:03:55.739> goes<00:03:55.920> out<00:03:56.160> right<00:03:56.430> here<00:03:56.730> so<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:58.260> had

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
piping goes out right here so you had

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.740 
piping goes out right here so you had
kind<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.830> have<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.160> have<00:03:59.310> this<00:03:59.580> water<00:04:00.000> filled

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
kind of have to have this water filled

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.290 
kind of have to have this water filled
up<00:04:01.190> otherwise<00:04:02.190> you'll<00:04:02.489> have<00:04:02.550> this<00:04:02.790> dripping

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
up otherwise you'll have this dripping

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.690 
up otherwise you'll have this dripping
you<00:04:03.810> know<00:04:03.900> we're<00:04:04.530> shooting<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:04.980> waterfall<00:04:05.459> down

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
you know we're shooting a waterfall down

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.840 
you know we're shooting a waterfall down
so<00:04:06.380> that's<00:04:07.380> one<00:04:07.739> of<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:08.010> tanks<00:04:08.370> that<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.610> have

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
so that's one of the tanks that I have

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.409 
over here I have micro swords and these
guys<00:06:09.990> I<00:06:10.470> mean<00:06:10.800> I<00:06:11.280> haven't<00:06:11.729> seen<00:06:11.880> much<00:06:12.180> growth

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
guys I mean I haven't seen much growth

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.420 
guys I mean I haven't seen much growth
of<00:06:12.570> them<00:06:12.720> how<00:06:13.169> did<00:06:13.320> you<00:06:13.410> put<00:06:13.680> one<00:06:13.890> here<00:06:14.130> and<00:06:14.190> one

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
of them how did you put one here and one

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.930 
of them how did you put one here and one
there<00:06:14.460> so<00:06:14.940> I<00:06:15.180> think<00:06:15.510> it<00:06:15.660> really<00:06:15.690> changed<00:06:16.260> and<00:06:16.940> I

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
there so I think it really changed and I

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.730 
there so I think it really changed and I
guess<00:06:18.210> that's<00:06:18.450> pretty<00:06:18.780> much<00:06:18.960> it<00:06:19.169> also<00:06:19.560> have

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
guess that's pretty much it also have

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.469 
guess that's pretty much it also have
