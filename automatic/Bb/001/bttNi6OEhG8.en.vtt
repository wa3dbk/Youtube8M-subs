00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.770 
head this is what the new gasket looks
like<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.390> would<00:01:27.540> sit<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.900> there<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.340> this

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
like it would sit in there like this

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.600 
like it would sit in there like this
this<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.260> old<00:01:31.470> gasket<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.370> the<00:01:32.430> old

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
this is the old gasket and the old

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.740 
this is the old gasket and the old
gasket<00:01:32.820> wasn't<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.300> that<00:01:33.420> bad<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.630> shape

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
gasket wasn't in that bad of shape

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.380 
gasket wasn't in that bad of shape
except<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.800> it<00:01:34.890> was<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.310> there<00:01:35.580> all<00:01:35.820> sideways

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
except that it was in there all sideways

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.050 
except that it was in there all sideways
because<00:01:36.510> there's<00:01:36.780> no<00:01:36.900> lower<00:01:37.140> bolt<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.060> I

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
because there's no lower bolt and I

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.670 
because there's no lower bolt and I
actually<00:01:39.210> kind<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.630> tore<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.020> up<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.380> get<00:01:40.530> it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.240 
I'm thinking I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
notch<00:01:44.400> this<00:01:44.760> top<00:01:45.060> one<00:01:45.330> and<00:01:45.650> slide<00:01:46.650> it<00:01:46.890> up<00:01:47.040> in

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
notch this top one and slide it up in

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.330 
notch this top one and slide it up in
there<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.910> then<00:01:48.350> bolt<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.560> back<00:01:49.770> down<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.220> it

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.360 
there and then bolt that back down on it
and<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.690> man<00:01:51.930> kept<00:01:52.200> about<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.680> stuff<00:01:53.070> this

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
and so a man kept about that stuff this

gasket<00:02:02.730> maker<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.240> had<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> guy<00:02:04.170> tell<00:02:04.200> me<00:02:04.470> that<00:02:04.590> I

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
gasket maker I had a guy tell me that I

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.320 
gasket maker I had a guy tell me that I
could<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.130> basically<00:02:05.580> coat<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.060> whole

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330

thing<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.230> would<00:02:07.380> be<00:02:07.530> enough<00:02:07.800> to

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
thing in that and it would be enough to

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.960 
thing in that and it would be enough to
fix<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.670> had<00:02:09.149> enough<00:02:10.580> went<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.640> pick<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.880> up

this<00:03:01.740> might<00:03:01.920> be<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.100> fixed<00:03:02.490> that<00:03:03.450> would<00:03:03.600> be<00:03:03.690> good

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
this might be a fixed that would be good

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.560 
this might be a fixed that would be good
enough<00:03:03.960> in<00:03:04.500> order<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:05.100> get<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.370> by<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:05.910> we

okay<00:03:29.019> let's<00:03:29.590> take<00:03:29.709> a<00:03:29.739> look<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:34.349> wiped<00:03:35.349> off<00:03:35.560> the

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
okay let's take a look I wiped off the

okay let's take a look I wiped off the
excess<00:03:36.190> that<00:03:36.400> was<00:03:36.549> around<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.909> edge<00:03:37.290> about<00:03:38.290> as

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
excess that was around the edge about as

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.780 
excess that was around the edge about as
much<00:03:38.500> as<00:03:38.620> I<00:03:38.769> could<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:41.200> owed<00:03:42.159> it<00:03:42.190> both<00:03:42.519> sides

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
much as I could and I owed it both sides

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.550 
much as I could and I owed it both sides
of<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.030> gasket<00:03:43.540> I<00:03:43.629> slipped<00:03:43.959> it<00:03:44.079> up<00:03:44.200> in<00:03:44.379> there

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
of the gasket I slipped it up in there

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.759 
of the gasket I slipped it up in there
and<00:03:44.590> then<00:03:44.799> I<00:03:44.950> put<00:03:45.190> a<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.629> kind<00:03:46.629> of<00:03:46.750> another<00:03:47.409> layer

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
and then I put a a kind of another layer

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.440 
and then I put a a kind of another layer
all<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.099> way<00:03:48.220> around<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:48.700> outside<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.299> kind

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
all the way around the outside and kind

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.640 
all the way around the outside and kind
of<00:03:49.540> mashed<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:50.079> in<00:03:50.200> there<00:03:50.349> with<00:03:50.500> my<00:03:50.620> fingers

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
of mashed it in there with my fingers

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.190 
of mashed it in there with my fingers
and<00:03:51.159> then<00:03:51.400> I<00:03:51.459> tightened<00:03:51.940> it<00:03:51.970> up<00:03:52.090> enough<00:03:52.450> so

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
and then I tightened it up enough so

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.020 
and then I tightened it up enough so
that<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.409> can<00:03:53.560> see<00:03:53.769> it<00:03:53.890> squish<00:03:54.370> out<00:03:54.640> just<00:03:54.909> a

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
that I can see it squish out just a

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.490 
that I can see it squish out just a
little<00:03:55.299> of<00:03:55.510> this<00:03:55.930> stuff

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
little of this stuff

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.800 
little of this stuff
I<00:03:56.530> didn't<00:03:57.280> tighten<00:03:57.610> it<00:03:57.700> real<00:03:58.030> hard<00:03:58.390> because

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
I didn't tighten it real hard because

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.690 
I didn't tighten it real hard because
the<00:03:59.079> instructions<00:03:59.650> said<00:03:59.890> you<00:04:00.160> know<00:04:00.280> basically

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
don't tighten it so hard you squeeze all

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.069 
don't tighten it so hard you squeeze all
the<00:04:02.500> gasket<00:04:02.890> material<00:04:03.310> back<00:04:03.459> out<00:04:03.670> of<00:04:03.700> there

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
hard enough it was a little bit hard to

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.969 
hard enough it was a little bit hard to
get<00:04:26.979> to<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.520> head<00:04:28.080> because<00:04:29.080> there's<00:04:29.289> a<00:04:29.350> sheet

covers it and it's hard to get up in
there<00:04:33.729> but<00:04:33.760> I<00:04:33.910> took<00:04:34.660> a<00:04:34.720> screwdriver<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.440> kind

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
there but I took a screwdriver and kind

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.760 
of smeared that stuff up in there as
good<00:04:37.330> as<00:04:37.419> I<00:04:37.539> could<00:04:37.690> around<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.139> backside<00:04:38.320> and

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
good as I could around the backside and
