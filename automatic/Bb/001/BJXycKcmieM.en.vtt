up for that but if you already have all

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.159 
up for that but if you already have all
three<00:05:09.790> of<00:05:09.880> these<00:05:09.940> movies<00:05:10.210> on<00:05:10.330> blu-ray<00:05:10.360> this<00:05:10.990> is

video release plan and this was on the

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.000 
video release plan and this was on the

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
that sort of justifies me getting this

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.800 
that sort of justifies me getting this
set<00:05:36.400> but<00:05:36.880> if<00:05:37.000> I<00:05:37.120> had<00:05:37.270> all<00:05:37.419> three<00:05:37.570> of<00:05:37.720> these

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
set but if I had all three of these

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.659 
set but if I had all three of these
movies<00:05:38.169> I'd<00:05:38.410> be<00:05:38.620> really<00:05:38.860> let<00:05:39.160> down<00:05:39.340> by<00:05:39.490> this

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
movies I'd be really let down by this

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.150 
movies I'd be really let down by this
set<00:05:39.990> being<00:05:40.990> that<00:05:41.140> it's<00:05:41.260> called<00:05:41.470> the<00:05:41.680> ultimate

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
set being that it's called the ultimate

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.680 
set being that it's called the ultimate
collector's<00:05:42.520> edition<00:05:42.850> it<00:05:43.000> is<00:05:43.180> not<00:05:43.330> nearly<00:05:43.510> as

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
collector's edition it is not nearly as

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.290 
collector's edition it is not nearly as
ultimate<00:05:44.350> as<00:05:44.500> other<00:05:45.190> ultimate<00:05:45.820> titles<00:05:46.180> by

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
ultimate as other ultimate titles by

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.670 
ultimate as other ultimate titles by
Warner<00:05:46.539> Brothers<00:05:46.660> like<00:05:46.960> Harry<00:05:47.169> Potter<00:05:47.440> and

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
Warner Brothers like Harry Potter and

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.460 
Warner Brothers like Harry Potter and
the<00:05:47.770> Matrix<00:05:48.190> however<00:05:48.880> this<00:05:49.539> costs<00:05:49.990> a<00:05:50.140> lot<00:05:50.410> less

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
the Matrix however this costs a lot less

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.090 
the Matrix however this costs a lot less
than<00:05:50.979> the<00:05:51.400> Harry<00:05:51.580> Potter<00:05:51.820> set<00:05:52.180> so<00:05:52.600> I<00:05:52.900> think<00:05:53.890> my

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
than the Harry Potter set so I think my

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.560 
than the Harry Potter set so I think my
expectations<00:05:54.280> should<00:05:54.789> also<00:05:54.940> be<00:05:55.060> balanced<00:05:55.450> by

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
expectations should also be balanced by

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.350
