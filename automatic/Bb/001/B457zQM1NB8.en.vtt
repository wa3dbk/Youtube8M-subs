00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.679 
the name mayhem but when I think a total
mayhem<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.950> think<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.759> spinning<00:01:48.299> out<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.509> control

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
mayhem I think a spinning out of control

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.620 
mayhem I think a spinning out of control
which<00:01:49.470> fits<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.070> bill<00:01:50.280> for<00:01:50.670> an<00:01:50.759> S&amp;S<00:01:51.210> 4d

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
which fits the bill for an S&amp;S 4d

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.749 
which fits the bill for an S&amp;S 4d
coaster<00:01:52.110> Six<00:01:52.560> Flags<00:01:52.680> also<00:01:53.130> filed<00:01:53.430> for<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
coaster Six Flags also filed for the

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.959 
coaster Six Flags also filed for the
trademark<00:01:54.020> titan<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.200> gale<00:01:55.890> force<00:01:56.250> seven

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
trademark titan and gale force seven

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.730 
trademark titan and gale force seven
it's<00:01:57.360> possible<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.049> great<00:01:58.229> venture<00:01:58.439> could

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
it's possible the great venture could

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.950 
it's possible the great venture could
use<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.189> Titan<00:01:59.640> name<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.360> think<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.780> gale

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
use the Titan name but I think that gale

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.929 
use the Titan name but I think that gale
force<00:02:01.170> 7<00:02:01.590> will<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.310> another<00:02:02.640> park

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
force 7 will be going to another park

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.760 
force 7 will be going to another park

what<00:02:11.129> this<00:02:11.459> 4d<00:02:11.940> coaster<00:02:12.330> could<00:02:12.510> be<00:02:12.629> like<00:02:12.870> I

what this 4d coaster could be like I

what this 4d coaster could be like I
don't

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
don't

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.929 
don't
it'll<00:02:14.109> be<00:02:14.230> an<00:02:14.349> exact<00:02:14.739> clone<00:02:15.069> I<00:02:15.459> think<00:02:15.790> that

version<00:02:18.099> of<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:18.639> which<00:02:19.150> would<00:02:19.329> make<00:02:19.480> sense

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
version of this which would make sense

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.020 
version of this which would make sense
because<00:02:20.049> SNS<00:02:20.680> came<00:02:20.950> out<00:02:21.069> with<00:02:21.249> more<00:02:21.579> than<00:02:21.790> one

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
because SNS came out with more than one

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.050 
because SNS came out with more than one
model<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:23.019> other<00:02:23.200> model<00:02:23.650> was<00:02:24.099> a<00:02:24.129> lot<00:02:24.609> taller

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
than Batman the ride is because great

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.789 
than Batman the ride is because great
adventure<00:02:28.120> is<00:02:28.269> a<00:02:28.299> more<00:02:28.599> popular<00:02:28.840> Park<00:02:29.530> it

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
adventure is a more popular Park it

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.349 
adventure is a more popular Park it
makes<00:02:30.159> sense<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.489> they<00:02:30.730> get<00:02:30.909> a<00:02:30.939> bigger

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
makes sense that they get a bigger

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.140 
makes sense that they get a bigger

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
capacity so this isn't the most

would be a great fit it's something that

would be a great fit it's something that

fit for a great adventure they want a

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.289 
fit for a great adventure they want a
winged<00:02:53.500> coaster<00:02:53.739> instead<00:02:54.400> but<00:02:54.819> I'd<00:02:54.939> like<00:02:55.180> to
