00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.930 
properly and today truth I've already
made<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.860> measurements<00:02:35.340> but<00:02:35.400> I'm<00:02:35.520> gonna<00:02:35.670> redo

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
made the measurements but I'm gonna redo

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.600 
made the measurements but I'm gonna redo
the<00:02:35.970> measurements<00:02:36.450> again<00:02:36.660> here<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.709> I<00:02:38.280> was

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
the measurements again here and I was

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.170 
the measurements again here and I was
very<00:02:38.820> very<00:02:39.090> pleased<00:02:39.780> with<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.700> start<00:02:41.700> off<00:02:41.910> with

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
very very pleased with it start off with

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.410 
very very pleased with it start off with
the<00:02:42.300> thumb<00:02:42.510> pitches<00:02:42.900> we<00:02:43.050> were<00:02:43.140> doing<00:02:44.420> 5/16

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
the thumb pitches we were doing 5/16

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.010 
the thumb pitches we were doing 5/16
reverse<00:02:45.780> with<00:02:46.080> 1/8<00:02:46.320> side<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:48.209> we'll<00:02:48.810> just

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
reverse with 1/8 side so we'll just

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.690 
reverse with 1/8 side so we'll just
quickly<00:02:49.230> slap<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:49.860> in<00:02:50.070> here<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.430> check<00:02:50.580> the

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
quickly slap this in here and check the

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.080 
quickly slap this in here and check the
pitches<00:02:51.030> or<00:02:51.209> click<00:02:52.100> don't<00:02:53.100> left<00:02:53.310> my<00:02:53.520> gauge<00:02:53.760> I'm

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
pitches or click don't left my gauge I'm

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.300 
pitches or click don't left my gauge I'm
not<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.330> pro<00:02:54.840> shop<00:02:55.110> owner<00:02:55.380> so<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.739> can't<00:02:56.010> afford

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
not a pro shop owner so I can't afford

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.900 
not a pro shop owner so I can't afford
the<00:02:57.470> $200<00:02:58.470> for<00:02:58.709> those<00:02:58.860> gentle<00:02:59.250> gauges<00:02:59.730> so

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
the $200 for those gentle gauges so

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.280 
the $200 for those gentle gauges so
we'll<00:03:00.150> just<00:03:00.270> go<00:03:00.420> with<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.630> cheap<00:03:00.810> mastered

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
we'll just go with the cheap mastered

put that back in there properly and of

course comes out to exactly eight side

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.280 
course comes out to exactly eight side
don't<00:03:27.800> check<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.340> other<00:03:28.880> 100<00:03:29.720> girl<00:03:29.930> right

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
don't check the other 100 girl right

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:38.150 
don't check the other 100 girl right
here<00:03:31.240> once<00:03:32.240> again

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.630 

one<00:03:39.160> eight<00:03:39.310> side<00:03:39.780> actually<00:03:40.780> it's<00:03:40.930> about<00:03:41.050> a

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
one eight side actually it's about a

one eight side actually it's about a
30-second<00:03:42.640> shine<00:03:43.569> it<00:03:43.780> will<00:03:43.930> one<00:03:44.110> each<00:03:44.260> side<00:03:44.590> I

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
30-second shine it will one each side I

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.340 
30-second shine it will one each side I
mean<00:03:45.790> if<00:03:45.910> you<00:03:46.030> can<00:03:46.180> feel<00:03:46.330> 30<00:03:46.630> seconds<00:03:47.140> of<00:03:47.260> an

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
mean if you can feel 30 seconds of an

mean if you can feel 30 seconds of an
inch<00:03:47.640> more<00:03:48.640> power<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:49.180> you<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:53.400> that<00:03:54.400> one<00:03:54.700> is

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
inch more power to you and that one is

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.840 
inch more power to you and that one is
exactly<00:03:57.670> 5/16<00:03:58.540> reverse<00:03:59.250> so<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.370> thumb<00:04:00.580> checks

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
exactly 5/16 reverse so the thumb checks

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.710 
exactly 5/16 reverse so the thumb checks
out<00:04:01.060> identical<00:04:01.720> pictures<00:04:02.140> wise<00:04:03.450> let's<00:04:04.450> check

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
out identical pictures wise let's check

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.190 
out identical pictures wise let's check
out<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:05.020> fingers<00:04:06.150> as<00:04:07.150> I<00:04:07.360> said<00:04:07.600> on<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:07.840> fingers

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200

out the fingers as I said on the fingers
I<00:04:08.350> just<00:04:08.560> shot<00:04:08.739> did<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:09.310> straight<00:04:09.790> 3/8<00:04:10.180> side

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
I just shot did the straight 3/8 side

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.460 
I just shot did the straight 3/8 side
each<00:04:10.840> way<00:04:11.110> did<00:04:12.040> I<00:04:12.160> use<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.519> power<00:04:12.760> left

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
each way did I use the power left

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.110 
each way did I use the power left
inserts<00:04:14.470> so<00:04:15.400> I<00:04:15.430> do<00:04:15.550> not<00:04:15.850> need<00:04:16.090> any<00:04:16.269> other
