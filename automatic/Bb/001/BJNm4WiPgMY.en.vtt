walking across the yard to go to the big
compost<00:00:43.500> pile<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:43.980> just<00:00:44.250> use<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:45.110> for<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
compost pile so I just use this for the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.050 
compost pile so I just use this for the
wintertime<00:00:46.739> late<00:00:46.980> fall<00:00:47.219> or<00:00:47.250> early<00:00:47.430> spring<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
wintertime late fall or early spring and

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.830 
wintertime late fall or early spring and
by<00:00:49.430> planting<00:00:50.430> time<00:00:50.580> I<00:00:50.640> should<00:00:50.940> be<00:00:51.060> done<00:00:51.240> now

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
by planting time I should be done now

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.420 
by planting time I should be done now
surely<00:00:52.200> it's<00:00:52.320> not<00:00:52.380> big<00:00:52.650> enough<00:00:52.680> Arden<00:00:53.250> but

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
surely it's not big enough Arden but

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.900 
surely it's not big enough Arden but
definitely<00:00:53.970> for<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.240> few<00:00:54.420> beds<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:56.010> guess

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
definitely for a few beds and I guess

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.580 
definitely for a few beds and I guess
there's<00:00:57.120> rules<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.570> compost<00:00:58.079> now<00:00:58.260> really
