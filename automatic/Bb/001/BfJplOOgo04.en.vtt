 m 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.670
 lye d other 11 euros 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:24.269
 today this morning very early I want guide system 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.900
 who am I going 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.189
 now that you can see it's totally different 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.670
 everything has changed 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.490
 for 100 m 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.269
 you see 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.269
 the boat got me 3 new locations 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.710
 so we'll start from the beginning simply 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.810
 that's where it starts 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.440
 start again paris puf primordial the executive paramount if the courses 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.140
 convoy on the sides 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.370
 so the primordial keys usually if the executive who are going 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.370
 add the country holds or regular care 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.780
 for example 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.990
 the lack of respect rolled over a sometimes deadly product of 400 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.590
 more deadly strikes containing than malefactors 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.580
 after the short center 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.580
 we arrive on the major leagues then the four major 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.210
 lurking major crises the click that will redeem for 100 m 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.940
 dd 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.920
 if the money 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.250
 additional aid 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.420
 that is to say 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.420
 we will look for example shield of Aswan 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.960
 of shields 6 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.000
 increases your movement speed by 15% when the clip is effective 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.430
 that's great 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.580
 but I know it's new 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.000

 tso c winter the victim is finally a tissue tick 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.070
 not a little useful thing to add a useful click 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.470
 m 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.709
 for example 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.559
 resistant poignant 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:14.429
 as for death fish techniques that fail because insensitive sybille 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:17.069
 underload charge too strong 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.579
 a good thing 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.849
 quote liverpool must not last maybe cordelière to align find 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.169

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.039
 finally it's the whole system how does it work 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:34.039
 so now what's great is the big chessboard 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:37.459
 and when we use it on the consume 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.750
 she will appear directly portzamparc easy 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:46.139
