00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
through it you won't go down because you

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.540 
through it you won't go down because you
have<00:01:13.330> juggernaut<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:17.070> then<00:01:18.070> go<00:01:18.220> use<00:01:18.400> the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
have juggernaut and then go use the

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:25.710 
have juggernaut and then go use the
teleporter

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.550 

and<00:01:26.860> now<00:01:28.210> for<00:01:29.210> some<00:01:29.360> reason<00:01:29.750> it<00:01:30.140> won't<00:01:30.380> ever

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
and now for some reason it won't ever

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.310 
and now for some reason it won't ever
teleport<00:01:31.100> you<00:01:31.189> back<00:01:31.250> out<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:32.320> you're

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
teleport you back out and you're

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.930 
teleport you back out and you're
probably<00:01:33.470> wondering<00:01:34.220> what<00:01:34.490> happens<00:01:34.729> when<00:01:34.850> I

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
probably wondering what happens when I

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.700 
probably wondering what happens when I
run<00:01:34.970> out<00:01:35.119> of<00:01:35.270> ammo<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:35.900> that's<00:01:36.320> when<00:01:36.470> you<00:01:36.560> can

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
run out of ammo and that's when you can

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.930 
run out of ammo and that's when you can
just<00:01:36.799> go<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:37.310> buy<00:01:37.390> grenades<00:01:38.390> off<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.810> wall

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
just go and buy grenades off the wall

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.529 
just go and buy grenades off the wall
and<00:01:40.940> then<00:01:41.060> keep<00:01:41.240> throwing<00:01:41.509> them<00:01:41.690> down<00:01:41.720> there

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
and then keep throwing them down there

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.430 
and then keep throwing them down there
fortunately<00:01:44.539> right<00:01:44.690> now<00:01:44.840> I<00:01:44.869> have<00:01:45.110> a<00:01:45.140> shotgun

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
fortunately right now I have a shotgun

00:01:45.440 --> 00:02:08.710 
fortunately right now I have a shotgun
so<00:01:45.619> that<00:01:45.920> won't<00:01:46.100> really<00:01:46.220> do<00:01:46.460> anything

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.240 

but<00:02:09.720> if<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.899> just<00:02:10.080> watch<00:02:10.320> you'll<00:02:10.679> see<00:02:11.039> that

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
but if you just watch you'll see that

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.860 
but if you just watch you'll see that
it's<00:02:11.640> not<00:02:11.850> ever<00:02:12.030> going<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.240> teleport<00:02:12.630> me<00:02:12.780> out

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
it's not ever going to teleport me out

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.600 
it's not ever going to teleport me out
of<00:02:13.020> here<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.200> just<00:02:13.320> have<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.590> limited<00:02:14.040> time<00:02:14.070> up<00:02:14.490> in

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
of here I just have a limited time up in

00:02:14.610 --> 00:03:07.530 
of here I just have a limited time up in
here

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.809 

and<00:03:07.780> that's<00:03:08.379> how<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.590> get<00:03:08.769> unlimited<00:03:09.040> time<00:03:09.519> in

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
and that's how you get unlimited time in

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.920 
and that's how you get unlimited time in
the<00:03:10.030> teleporter<00:03:10.569> on<00:03:10.690> black<00:03:10.959> ops<00:03:11.140> nazi<00:03:11.560> zombies
