turning<00:00:59.699> slightly<00:01:00.089> translucent<00:01:01.609> now<00:01:02.609> we<00:01:02.999> can

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
turning slightly translucent now we can

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.690 
turning slightly translucent now we can
add<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.510> spices<00:01:03.809> at<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.260> stage<00:01:04.560> so<00:01:05.489> I'm

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
add the spices at this stage so I'm

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.420 
add the spices at this stage so I'm
going<00:01:05.730> to<00:01:05.940> do<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:09.590> so<00:01:10.590> all<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> spice<00:01:11.130> all<00:01:11.340> in

going to do that so all the spice all in

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.540 
going to do that so all the spice all in
one<00:01:11.550> go<00:01:15.200> it's<00:01:16.200> better<00:01:16.440> to<00:01:16.620> add<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> spices<00:01:17.220> at

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
one go it's better to add the spices at

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.300 
one go it's better to add the spices at
this<00:01:17.700> stage<00:01:18.030> while<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> onions<00:01:18.840> cooking<00:01:19.310> make

this stage while the onions cooking make

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.090 
this stage while the onions cooking make
sure<00:01:20.340> that's<00:01:20.760> studying<00:01:21.630> thoroughly<00:01:22.470> because

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
sure that's studying thoroughly because

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.250 
sure that's studying thoroughly because
it<00:01:23.640> gives<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.970> list<00:01:24.150> powdery<00:01:24.600> taste<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
it gives a list powdery taste to the

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.290 
it gives a list powdery taste to the
dish<00:01:25.470> whereas<00:01:26.280> if<00:01:26.370> you<00:01:26.520> added<00:01:26.760> it<00:01:26.850> after<00:01:27.180> us

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
dish whereas if you added it after us

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.810 
dish whereas if you added it after us
after<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.660> meats<00:01:27.840> been<00:01:27.990> added<00:01:28.350> then<00:01:29.130> would

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
after the meats been added then would

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.540 
after the meats been added then would
not<00:01:30.300> combine<00:01:30.690> well<00:01:30.900> with<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.320> source<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.370> all

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
not combine well with the source so all

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.860 
not combine well with the source so all
of<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:32.760> onion<00:01:32.940> is<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.210> be<00:01:33.270> coated<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:33.720> this

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
of the onion is to be coated with this

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.890 
of the onion is to be coated with this
spice<00:01:34.110> mixture

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.740 

okay<00:01:39.620> the<00:01:39.740> chunks<00:01:40.070> are<00:01:40.310> about<00:01:41.000> two<00:01:41.360> inches

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
okay the chunks are about two inches

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.830 
okay the chunks are about two inches
wide<00:01:42.050> and<00:01:42.470> long<00:01:43.210> do<00:01:44.210> I<00:01:44.240> wouldn't<00:01:44.510> go<00:01:44.600> bigger

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
wide and long do I wouldn't go bigger

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.750 
wide and long do I wouldn't go bigger
than<00:01:45.020> that<00:01:45.050> because<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:46.340> source<00:01:46.580> doesn't

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
than that because the source doesn't

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.160 
than that because the source doesn't
seem<00:01:46.970> to<00:01:47.090> absorb<00:01:47.420> into<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.750> meat<00:01:47.990> otherwise

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
seem to absorb into the meat otherwise

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.070 
seem to absorb into the meat otherwise
but<00:01:48.980> any<00:01:49.220> small<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.640> that's<00:01:49.760> fine<00:01:50.060> but<00:01:50.810> if

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
but any small and that's fine but if

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.960 
but any small and that's fine but if
it's<00:01:51.230> like<00:01:51.470> this<00:01:51.770> about<00:01:51.920> two<00:01:52.130> inches<00:01:52.370> wide<00:01:52.580> and

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
it's like this about two inches wide and

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.000 
it's like this about two inches wide and
it<00:01:53.120> tends<00:01:53.390> to<00:01:53.480> say<00:01:53.840> tender<00:01:54.470> if<00:01:54.590> it's<00:01:54.710> smaller

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
it tends to say tender if it's smaller

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.370 
it tends to say tender if it's smaller
than<00:01:55.130> that<00:01:55.400> test<00:01:55.880> hardened<00:01:56.330> slightly<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:57.290> you

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
than that test hardened slightly so you

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.740 
than that test hardened slightly so you
can<00:01:57.650> add<00:01:57.740> that<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:58.160> them<00:02:00.190> dash<00:02:04.540> well<00:02:05.540> I'm<00:02:05.660> going

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
can add that to them dash well I'm going

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.510 
can add that to them dash well I'm going
to<00:02:05.810> reduce<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.200> heat<00:02:06.350> slightly<00:02:10.360> it's<00:02:11.360> now<00:02:11.540> a

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
to reduce the heat slightly it's now a

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.120 
to reduce the heat slightly it's now a
medium<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.850> low<00:02:14.150> heat<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.720> you're<00:02:15.680> stealing

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
medium to low heat and you're stealing

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.830 
medium to low heat and you're stealing
the<00:02:16.250> meat<00:02:16.490> on<00:02:17.170> each<00:02:18.170> side<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:19.300> coating<00:02:20.300> spice

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
the meat on each side and coating spice

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.420 
the meat on each side and coating spice
mixture<00:02:22.030> okay<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.330> seals<00:02:23.690> on<00:02:23.840> all<00:02:24.020> sides

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.060 

so<00:02:28.430> these<00:02:28.550> have<00:02:28.700> been<00:02:28.900> parboiled<00:02:29.900> already<00:02:30.290> so

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
so these have been parboiled already so

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.550 
so these have been parboiled already so
give<00:02:31.490> that<00:02:31.520> a<00:02:31.640> stir<00:02:31.760> make<00:02:32.240> sure<00:02:32.450> all<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.870> spice

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
mixture coats each so two sections I'm

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.440 
mixture coats each so two sections I'm
going<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.740> raise<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:36.980> heat<00:02:37.130> slightly<00:02:40.450> the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
going to raise the heat slightly the

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.220 
going to raise the heat slightly the
water<00:02:41.660> tends<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:43.209> soften<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.300> meat<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:45.110> we

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
water tends to soften the meat so we

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.310 
water tends to soften the meat so we

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
reduce the liquid a bit more just to

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.610 
reduce the liquid a bit more just to
make<00:03:29.570> it<00:03:29.600> slightly<00:03:29.810> thick<00:03:30.110> as<00:03:30.230> you<00:03:30.350> can<00:03:30.470> see
