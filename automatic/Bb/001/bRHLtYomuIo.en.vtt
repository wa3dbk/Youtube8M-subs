than one of the 36 volt batteries on the
standard<00:04:09.160> cruiser<00:04:09.400> so<00:04:10.200> let's<00:04:11.200> let's<00:04:11.650> hop<00:04:11.799> on

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
standard cruiser so let's let's hop on

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.229 
standard cruiser so let's let's hop on
take<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.280> for<00:04:12.489> a<00:04:12.519> test<00:04:12.730> ride<00:04:12.849> I've<00:04:13.090> actually

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
take it for a test ride I've actually

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.370 
take it for a test ride I've actually
got<00:04:13.510> it<00:04:13.540> in<00:04:13.660> pedal<00:04:13.989> assist<00:04:14.200> mode<00:04:14.349> here<00:04:16.380> there

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
got it in pedal assist mode here there

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.640 
got it in pedal assist mode here there
we<00:04:17.500> go<00:04:17.530> I'm<00:04:18.430> going<00:04:18.459> to<00:04:18.639> go<00:04:18.729> to<00:04:18.789> three<00:04:19.530> I'm<00:04:20.530> gonna

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
we go I'm going to go to three I'm gonna

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.230 
we go I'm going to go to three I'm gonna
hold<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.190> camera<00:04:21.219> back<00:04:21.700> there<00:04:21.849> you<00:04:21.940> can<00:04:22.060> kind

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
hold the camera back there you can kind

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:31.790 
hold the camera back there you can kind
of<00:04:22.300> listen<00:04:22.570> for<00:04:22.690> them

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.860 

and<00:04:32.800> again<00:04:33.250> that's<00:04:33.430> because<00:04:33.580> of<00:04:33.910> that<00:04:34.060> giant

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
and again that's because of that giant

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.529 
and again that's because of that giant
500<00:04:35.800> watt<00:04:35.919> geared<00:04:36.220> hub<00:04:36.460> motor<00:04:36.699> combined<00:04:37.389> with

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
500 watt geared hub motor combined with

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.150 
500 watt geared hub motor combined with
a<00:04:37.570> 48<00:04:37.930> volt<00:04:38.050> pack<00:04:38.440> now<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:38.680> can<00:04:38.919> see<00:04:39.039> the

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
a 48 volt pack now you can see the

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.290 
a 48 volt pack now you can see the
display<00:04:39.490> a<00:04:39.520> little<00:04:39.699> bit<00:04:39.850> better<00:04:40.030> so<00:04:42.300> let's

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
display a little bit better so let's

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.340 
display a little bit better so let's
actually<00:04:43.770> take<00:04:44.770> it<00:04:44.949> to<00:04:45.090> five<00:04:47.880> move<00:04:48.880> I<00:04:49.300> just<00:04:49.930> get

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
actually take it to five move I just get

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.580 
actually take it to five move I just get
you<00:04:50.500> going<00:04:50.860> super<00:04:51.490> fast<00:04:52.440> there's<00:04:53.440> those
