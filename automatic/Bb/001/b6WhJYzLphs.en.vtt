00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.780
 Hi everyone, how are you? I'm going back, I'm going. 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.219
 show you how we're going 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.349
 do to test sensor 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.870
 parking is first let's go 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.840
 understand what the display here is 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.550
 we have that is the village side display 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.320
 the right side when the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.970
 obstacle on the left side of the sensor 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.599
 parking lights lit this 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.460
 side 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.710
 is now on the right side of the semifinals 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.750
 this side and between the two sides 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.090
 while also giving the distance 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.100
 that it 30 centimeters to two meters at 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.649
 age 10 centimeters 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.300
 I just want to show you how 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.129
 What are we going to do to test the sensor? 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.680
 sensor - side of those who was 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.750
 of car like first access to 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.390
 and b with a left side sensor 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.000
 then adviser identify the sensor 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.000
 right side right so let's go 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.219
 I'm seeing a ray sensor from 8 to 12 as 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.489
 want to be your predecessors here 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.960
 right then that's how I 'm going to test those 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.370
 access to the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.830
 parking and works with the 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.290
 principle of ultrasound ie the order 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.659
 emitted by the sensor so that under 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.090
 Back I know, I just interpret this. 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.590
 away as it is in a hurry and 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.630
 return to distance 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.369
 So I guess how I put my hand. 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.079
 on the parking sensor 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.210
 it stops working as you are 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.970
 seeing the hope side marking nothing 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.990
 If I'm the one I want, I want it. 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.570
 let the first sensor pocket 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.880
 so he was walking there in the sensor 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.909
 spray research that is working 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.270
 right behind is the second set I'm going alone 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.700
 Go there and back to the first second. 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.470
 working the same way I'll do with 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.470
 the 1 cm sensors 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.080
 here is to run with jumping 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.390
 solving is working there someone who 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.700
 Do you love or hate him or her? 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.009
 who operate such but there is a 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.930
 personal problem that the following sometimes 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.390
 You 're back and the car is still 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.550
 to have nothing but how I will discover 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.009
 which is essential to a problem 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.840
 time they put you on top of you 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.270
 to know if you have a 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.430
 problem will stop believing in risk 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.680
 This is it, so I put my hand on it. 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.920
 of the first census and did not stop 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.840
 I'll do the same test of the other or 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.060
 put his hand in front of him there without 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.030
 let no obstacle made and shows is 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.100
 until you go to the lady who gave 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.420
 your show to make noise because the 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.940
 people found it without a hitch 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.769
 Problems is well worth it 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.070
 I hope I can help you with this league. 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.239
 then anything is available and 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.730
 I'm enjoying coming to you, in 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.560
 portugal the channel register here in the 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.530
 hospital too 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.530
 igor also brings hits to Czech voucher
