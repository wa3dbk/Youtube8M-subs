hey guys how's it going this is helping
with<00:00:03.120> tech<00:00:03.330> here<00:00:03.570> in<00:00:03.689> today's<00:00:03.990> video<00:00:04.410> I'm

with tech here in today's video I'm

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.900 
with tech here in today's video I'm
going<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.650> be<00:00:04.710> talking<00:00:04.890> about<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.279> new<00:00:05.549> 3d

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
going to be talking about a new 3d

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.000 
going to be talking about a new 3d
camera<00:00:06.420> which<00:00:06.899> is<00:00:07.080> going<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.290> be<00:00:07.440> coming<00:00:07.890> out

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
camera which is going to be coming out

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.459 
camera which is going to be coming out
fairly<00:00:08.370> soon<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.750> thought<00:00:10.139> this<00:00:10.320> was

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
fairly soon and I thought this was

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.169 
fairly soon and I thought this was
really<00:00:10.530> cool<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.190> decided<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.700> want<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:11.969> make

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
really cool so I decided I want to make

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.360 
really cool so I decided I want to make
a<00:00:12.210> video<00:00:12.450> on<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.750> it's<00:00:13.620> called<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.889> roll<00:00:14.190> i

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
a video on it it's called the roll i

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.660 
a video on it it's called the roll i
powerflex<00:00:15.120> 3d<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:16.440> this<00:00:16.859> camera<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.430> going<00:00:17.580> to

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
powerflex 3d so this camera is going to

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.790 
powerflex 3d so this camera is going to
have<00:00:17.850> two<00:00:18.090> lenses<00:00:18.510> as<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.810> guys<00:00:18.990> can<00:00:19.380> tell<00:00:19.439> up

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
have two lenses as you guys can tell up

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.370 
have two lenses as you guys can tell up
there<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.270> the<00:00:21.270> reason<00:00:21.570> for<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.840> two<00:00:21.960> lenses

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
there and the reason for the two lenses

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.599 
there and the reason for the two lenses
is<00:00:22.500> that's<00:00:22.710> what's<00:00:22.949> going<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.160> give<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.490> a

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
is that's what's going to give it a

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.550 
is that's what's going to give it a
three-dimensional<00:00:24.060> look<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
three-dimensional look to it the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.339 
three-dimensional look to it the
three-dimensional<00:00:26.220> photography<00:00:27.349> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
three-dimensional photography the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.160 
three-dimensional photography the
pictures<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.369> take<00:00:29.400> both<00:00:29.880> 3d<00:00:30.689> pictures

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
pictures you can take both 3d pictures

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.229 
pictures you can take both 3d pictures
and<00:00:31.349> just<00:00:31.439> regular<00:00:31.859> pictures<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.940> camera

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
and just regular pictures and the camera

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.060 
and just regular pictures and the camera
is<00:00:33.300> actually<00:00:33.630> going<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:33.960> 5<00:00:34.230> megapixels

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
is actually going to be 5 megapixels

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.060 
is actually going to be 5 megapixels
which<00:00:35.280> isn't<00:00:35.880> great<00:00:36.270> but<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.050> not<00:00:37.230> bad<00:00:37.500> or<00:00:37.829> ed

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
which isn't great but it's not bad or ed

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.970 
which isn't great but it's not bad or ed
by<00:00:38.340> any<00:00:38.550> means<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.719> back<00:00:39.960> it's<00:00:40.410> got<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> cool

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
by any means on the back it's got a cool

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.160 
by any means on the back it's got a cool
little<00:00:41.100> screen<00:00:41.550> there<00:00:41.790> it's<00:00:41.940> 2.8<00:00:42.510> inches<00:00:42.930> and

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
little screen there it's 2.8 inches and

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.920 
little screen there it's 2.8 inches and
that's<00:00:44.129> using<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.640> new<00:00:44.850> technology<00:00:45.480> called

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
that's using this new technology called

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.069 
that's using this new technology called
parallax<00:00:46.680> barrier<00:00:47.100> display<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.899> what

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
parallax barrier display and so what

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.410 
parallax barrier display and so what
that<00:00:49.110> means<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.039> instead<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:51.210> wearing

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
that means is that instead of wearing

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.020 
that means is that instead of wearing
those<00:00:51.660> glasses<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.469> these<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:53.190> see<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.670> 3d

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
those glasses to these to see the 3d

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.639 
those glasses to these to see the 3d
effect<00:00:54.360> you're<00:00:54.750> not<00:00:54.989> going<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.230> need<00:00:55.350> anything

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
effect you're not going to need anything

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.740 
effect you're not going to need anything
it's<00:00:56.039> just<00:00:56.250> gonna<00:00:56.370> look<00:00:56.670> 3d<00:00:57.090> right<00:00:57.300> there<00:00:57.570> and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
it's just gonna look 3d right there and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.619 
it's just gonna look 3d right there and
I'm<00:00:58.410> interested<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.219> see<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.940> know<00:01:00.059> how<00:01:00.300> good

especially that ones with the new 3d TVs
you<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.330> also<00:01:09.479> hook<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.960> up<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.200> your<00:01:10.350> TV<00:01:10.470> if

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
you can also hook this up to your TV if

you would like if you have a 3d TV but

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.460 
you would like if you have a 3d TV but
in<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.729> case<00:01:14.970> since<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.720> doesn't<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.080> that

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
in this case since it doesn't have that

in this case since it doesn't have that
new<00:01:16.650> technology<00:01:17.400> for<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> parallax<00:01:18.420> barrier

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
new technology for the parallax barrier

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.120 
new technology for the parallax barrier
display<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.500> will<00:01:19.650> need<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.890> wear<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.520 
videos will be shot in 1280 by 720 and I
believe<00:01:52.320> it's<00:01:52.530> 30<00:01:52.950> frames<00:01:53.610> per<00:01:53.729> second<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.530> I

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
believe it's 30 frames per second and I

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.800 
believe it's 30 frames per second and I
think<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.579> will<00:01:56.759> be<00:01:56.790> another<00:01:57.210> really<00:01:57.570> cool

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
think that will be another really cool

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.109 
think that will be another really cool
feature<00:01:57.869> with<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.070> I'm<00:01:59.549> not<00:01:59.759> sure<00:02:00.000> if

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
feature with this and I'm not sure if

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.850 
feature with this and I'm not sure if
you're<00:02:00.270> gonna<00:02:00.360> be<00:02:00.570> able<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.869> take<00:02:01.049> 3d<00:02:01.469> videos

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
you're gonna be able to take 3d videos

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.499 
you're gonna be able to take 3d videos
but<00:02:02.130> if<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.310> could<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.549> think<00:02:02.850> that'd<00:02:03.149> be<00:02:03.180> even

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
but if you could I think that'd be even

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.440 
but if you could I think that'd be even
better<00:02:03.689> but<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.460> said<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.759> can<00:02:05.880> take<00:02:06.030> 2d

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
better but like I said you can take 2d

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.249 
better but like I said you can take 2d
pictures<00:02:06.990> or<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.890> 3d<00:02:08.280> pictures<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.259> that's
