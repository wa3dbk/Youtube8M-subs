with<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.490> unarmed<00:00:29.939> damage<00:00:30.419> scaling<00:00:30.900> script

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
with the unarmed damage scaling script

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.310 
with the unarmed damage scaling script
it<00:00:32.189> was<00:00:32.310> a<00:00:32.340> script<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.820> put<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.840> make<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
it was a script to put in to make the

unarmed<00:00:34.710> damage<00:00:35.720> scale<00:00:36.720> with<00:00:36.990> your<00:00:37.140> level<00:00:37.470> so

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:37.740 
unarmed damage scale with your level so

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.070 
unarmed damage scale with your level so
as<00:00:37.920> your<00:00:38.610> level<00:00:38.880> went<00:00:39.060> up<00:00:39.120> your<00:00:39.360> unarmed<00:00:39.630> level

as your level went up your unarmed level

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.970 
as your level went up your unarmed level
the<00:00:40.710> damage<00:00:41.040> would<00:00:41.160> get<00:00:41.400> higher<00:00:41.660> now

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
the damage would get higher now

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.900 
the damage would get higher now

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
fix that and they haven't worked there's

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.070

just<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:50.100> whole<00:00:51.030> bunch<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.300> issues<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.900> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
code and with different ways of getting

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.860 
code and with different ways of getting
it<00:00:56.130> to<00:00:56.220> run<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.610> everything<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.150> I<00:00:57.540> haven't

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
found a way to get it running properly

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.290 
found a way to get it running properly
so<00:01:01.020> I've<00:01:01.350> uploaded<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.190> version<00:01:02.580> to<00:01:02.820> both<00:01:02.970> steam

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
so I've uploaded a version to both steam

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.319

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:06.329 
and the Nexus without the unarmed

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:09.080 
and the Nexus without the unarmed
scaling<00:01:06.899> now<00:01:07.859> you<00:01:08.429> don't<00:01:08.579> have<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.880> unarmed

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
scaling now you don't have the unarmed

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.599 
scaling now you don't have the unarmed
scaling<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:10.079> since<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.590> wasn't<00:01:10.740> working<00:01:11.009> it's

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:11.609 
scaling but since it wasn't working it's

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:13.010 
scaling but since it wasn't working it's
not<00:01:11.850> much<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.179> loss<00:01:12.329> and<00:01:12.659> at<00:01:12.750> least<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
unarmed scaling bug is gone I'm going to

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.529 
unarmed scaling bug is gone I'm going to
try<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.770> get<00:01:17.189> an<00:01:17.369> arm<00:01:17.520> scaling<00:01:17.909> working<00:01:18.359> in

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.069 
try to get an arm scaling working in
future<00:01:19.439> versions<00:01:19.679> so<00:01:20.390> still<00:01:21.390> keep<00:01:21.810> your<00:01:21.929> hopes

bit on the focus system and previously I

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:06.099 
bit on the focus system and previously I
had<00:02:03.479> just<00:02:03.810> been<00:02:04.049> planning<00:02:04.859> on<00:02:04.979> making<00:02:05.189> any

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
had just been planning on making any

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.510 
had just been planning on making any
focus<00:02:07.109> powers<00:02:07.499> that<00:02:07.709> could<00:02:07.799> come<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.130> mind<00:02:08.369> but

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
focus powers that could come to mind but

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.370 
focus powers that could come to mind but
now<00:02:08.729> I'm<00:02:08.850> going<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.180> try<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.390> focus<00:02:09.690> mostly<00:02:10.260> on

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
now I'm going to try to focus mostly on

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.960 
now I'm going to try to focus mostly on
teleportation

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
teleportation

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.370 
teleportation
and<00:02:12.090> movement<00:02:12.600> powers<00:02:12.960> so<00:02:13.620> for<00:02:14.460> instance<00:02:14.520> a

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
and movement powers so for instance a

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.690 
and movement powers so for instance a
power<00:02:16.380> they'll<00:02:16.650> let<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:16.920> teleport<00:02:17.520> over

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
power they'll let you teleport over

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.670 
power they'll let you teleport over
there<00:02:18.030> or<00:02:19.370> teleport<00:02:20.370> behind<00:02:20.700> your<00:02:20.850> enemy<00:02:21.210> or

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
there or teleport behind your enemy or

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.780 
there or teleport behind your enemy or
increase<00:02:22.680> your<00:02:22.830> running<00:02:23.160> speed<00:02:23.340> really

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
increase your running speed really

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.610 
increase your running speed really
quickly<00:02:24.180> stuff<00:02:24.510> like<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.660> good<00:02:25.320> i<00:02:25.380> think

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
quickly stuff like that good i think

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.560 
quickly stuff like that good i think
that<00:02:25.740> fits<00:02:26.040> better<00:02:26.250> with<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.640> monk<00:02:26.880> thing<00:02:27.530> and

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
that fits better with the monk thing and

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.460 
that fits better with the monk thing and

working<00:03:14.760> on<00:03:14.850> part<00:03:15.090> two<00:03:15.300> but<00:03:15.900> i<00:03:15.930> don't<00:03:16.019> want<00:03:16.260> to

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
working on part two but i don't want to

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.410 
working on part two but i don't want to
just<00:03:16.500> put<00:03:16.890> everything<00:03:17.070> I<00:03:17.820> came<00:03:18.090> in<00:03:18.269> there

just put everything I came in there
because<00:03:18.570> then<00:03:18.750> it's<00:03:18.900> just<00:03:18.989> going<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.230> get<00:03:19.380> it

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500

because then it's just going to get it
be<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:19.980> really<00:03:20.220> huge<00:03:20.370> mod<00:03:21.080> with<00:03:22.080> more<00:03:22.920> bugs<00:03:23.280> that

be a really huge mod with more bugs that

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.780 
be a really huge mod with more bugs that
then<00:03:24.660> is<00:03:24.810> necessary<00:03:25.320> because<00:03:25.790> it's

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
then is necessary because it's

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.780 
then is necessary because it's
unavoidable<00:03:27.590> that<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.860> more<00:03:29.040> at<00:03:29.310> things<00:03:29.670> I

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
unavoidable that the more at things I

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.410 
unavoidable that the more at things I
add<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.209> more<00:03:30.390> chances<00:03:31.170> for<00:03:31.230> bugs<00:03:32.420> another

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
add the more chances for bugs another

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.660 
add the more chances for bugs another
thing<00:03:33.600> i'm<00:03:33.720> going<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.019> do<00:03:34.200> is<00:03:34.230> for<00:03:35.040> part<00:03:35.280> two<00:03:35.489> is
