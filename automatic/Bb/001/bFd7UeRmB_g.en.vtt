00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.640
 it's good actually it's complicated because 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:12.270
 that the rocket must be that of a 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:13.130
 complicated not mischief did not happen to 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.430

 photo ap when I'm not at my 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.210

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:25.800

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:00.800
