how everybody so what I'm gonna show you
today<00:00:04.560> is<00:00:05.629> installing<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:07.080> power<00:00:07.620> iso<00:00:08.280> file

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
today is installing a power iso file

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.379 
today is installing a power iso file
onto<00:00:09.300> your<00:00:09.870> system<00:00:10.370> so<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.910> means<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.240> doing

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
onto your system so the means of doing

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.020 
onto your system so the means of doing
this<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.590> install<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> little<00:00:14.460> program

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
this is to install a little program

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.040 
this is to install a little program
called<00:00:15.059> power<00:00:15.630> iso<00:00:16.550> power<00:00:17.550> iso<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> small

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
called power iso power iso is a small

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.880 
called power iso power iso is a small
program<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:20.189> avoids<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.029> whole<00:00:21.180> process<00:00:21.480> of

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
program the avoids the whole process of

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.550 
program the avoids the whole process of
having<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.310> burn<00:00:24.300> your<00:00:24.570> file<00:00:24.750> onto<00:00:25.109> disk<00:00:25.320> and

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
having to burn your file onto disk and

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.230 
having to burn your file onto disk and
then<00:00:25.650> put<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.920> disk<00:00:26.099> into<00:00:26.340> your<00:00:26.519> system<00:00:26.970> and

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
then put the disk into your system and

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.660 
then put the disk into your system and
then<00:00:27.720> install<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.199> through<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.769> way<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.279> cuts

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
then install it through that way it cuts

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.669 
then install it through that way it cuts
out<00:00:29.849> all<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.150> middleman<00:00:30.570> by<00:00:30.929> doing<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.349> and

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
out all the middleman by doing that and

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.860 
out all the middleman by doing that and
it<00:00:31.890> creates<00:00:32.279> its<00:00:32.550> own<00:00:32.669> CD<00:00:33.090> drive<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.780> you

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
it creates its own CD drive so that you

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.700 
it creates its own CD drive so that you
can<00:00:34.020> mount<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.559> file<00:00:35.149> onto<00:00:36.149> your<00:00:36.450> system<00:00:36.719> onto

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
can mount the file onto your system onto

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.350 
can mount the file onto your system onto
its<00:00:37.829> own<00:00:37.980> drive<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.610> then<00:00:38.760> install<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.210> that

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
its own drive and then install it that

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.750 
its own drive and then install it that
way<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.379> will<00:00:40.710> put<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.040> link<00:00:41.280> for

way so I will put the link for

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.330 
way so I will put the link for
installing<00:00:42.480> power<00:00:42.780> ISO<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.559> into<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340

one I really want to install and once

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.920 
one I really want to install and once
it's<00:01:23.430> done<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.939> should<00:01:24.360> when<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.810> click

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
on my computer there you go it's created

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.330 
on my computer there you go it's created
its<00:01:27.330> own<00:01:27.450> CD<00:01:28.080> drive<00:01:28.350> ready<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.040> things<00:01:29.220> to

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
its own CD drive ready for the things to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.340 
its own CD drive ready for the things to
be<00:01:29.490> mounted<00:01:29.850> onto<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.420> then<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.840> mount<00:01:31.049> that

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
be mounted onto and then to mount that

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.710 
be mounted onto and then to mount that
image<00:01:31.770> onto<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:33.030> right<00:01:33.240> click<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.570> it

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
image onto it you right click on it

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.760 
image onto it you right click on it
click<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.590> power<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.960> again<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.259> then<00:01:37.590> you

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
click on power I so again and then you

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.560 
click on power I so again and then you
can<00:01:37.799> click<00:01:38.189> mount<00:01:38.970> image<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.840> drive<00:01:40.140> I

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
can click mount image to drive I

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
can click mount image to drive I
hopefully<00:01:42.570> now<00:01:42.899> once<00:01:43.200> you've<00:01:43.320> done<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.470> you

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
hopefully now once you've done it you

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.310 
hopefully now once you've done it you
reopen<00:01:44.009> my<00:01:44.610> computer<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.329> they<00:01:45.600> go<00:01:45.810> trial<00:01:46.200> and

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
reopen my computer and they go trial and

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.289 
reopen my computer and they go trial and
